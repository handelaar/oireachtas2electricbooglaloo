      <P>I have notice from Senator Burke that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to provide extra funding and to change the rules governing the essential repairs grant.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 24, motion 15. I will also be asking the House to deal on its receipt from the Dáil with all Stages of the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1999, and a motion for the Bill's earlier signature by the President. On No. 1, Temporary Holding Fund for Superannuation Liabilities Bill, 1999, all Stages to be taken today. No. 2, motion for earlier signature will be taken without debate at the conclusion of item 1. On No. 3, Appropriation Bill, 1999 &ndash; all Stages to be taken today on the understanding that the motion which appears on the Order Paper as No. 10 will be taken early in the next session. I propose that contributions be confined to one speaker from each group as is the usual practice and that speakers' contributions should not exceed 30 minutes. No. 4, motion for earlier signature, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of No. 3. It is hoped to take the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1999, which is currently in the Dáil, and the earlier signature motion not earlier than 2 p.m. Item 24, motion 15, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and business to resume thereafter if not previously concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any difficulty with the items ordered for business which appear on the Order Paper. However, I strongly object to the manner in which the Fisheries (Amendment) <Col N="1246" /> Bill is expected to be taken in this House. This Bill could have been introduced to this and the other House in any of the past number of weeks. We now have a situation in which the Bill still has not been passed in the Dáil and we are being told that the Minister, with some degree of arrogance, wants all Stages of the Bill to be taken in this House today.</P>
      <P>There are nine Seanad Bills in the Dáil at present, two of which &ndash; the Radiological Protection Bill and the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill &ndash; are 1998 Bills. This House was informed that it was a matter of great urgency that we would pass these and other Bills. The Planning and Development Bill has not yet commenced its life in the Dáil, yet we had to reschedule our sittings for the convenience of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development got into a huff because we would not take all Stages of the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill on a particular day and he had to return to the House on another date.</P>
      <P>This House is being treated with contempt. The Dáil is not running its business properly and Government machinery is breaking down as far as dealing with legislation is concerned. We are being asked to rubber stamp this Bill today and I strongly object to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources expecting us to take all Stages of a Bill which has not yet been passed in the Dáil, sight unseen.</P>
      <P>I propose amendment No. 1 to the Order of Business:</P>
      <P>That the Seanad does not take all Stages of the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill today.</P>
      <P>On a cooler note, will the Leader confirm that the debate on the Appropriation Bill will continue in the new session?</P>
      <P>A great deal of publicity surrounds the publication of the report of the Committee of Public Accounts. Although we do not have any constitutional role in this regard, it would desirable to have a full debate on the report some time after Christmas. The report is a very historic document in regard to the history of the Houses of the Oireachtas and shows that work can be carried out in a very efficient manner. I suggest that the Committee on Procedures and Privileges might consider the possibility of the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts coming into the House to answer any questions arising from the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We too are opposed to the Order of Business as outlined by the Leader and I second Senator Manning's proposed amendment to the Order of Business. It is outrageous that we should be asked to take all Stages of a Bill which is still before the other House. We do not even know whether or not it will conclude in the other House. Now we are being asked to take it at some stage this afternoon. That is totally unacceptable. We at least have the other Bills here in front of us, and we have already put on record that we <Col N="1247" /> are not happy to take all Stages of any Bill, whether or not it is before us on the Order Paper. Certainly we are totally opposed to taking all Stages of a Bill that is not before us.</P>
      <P>To highlight what has been happening with legislation from this House going to the Dáil, yesterday, on the Criminal Justice (Safety of United Nations Workers) Bill, 1999, there was reference to a Bill which is before the Dáil, the Criminal Justice (United Nations Convention Against Torture) Bill, 1998, and the Minister was totally confused, referring to an Act when it is in fact a Bill which we see before us, a Bill of 1998 which has been languishing in the Dáil for over 12 months with no attempt to put it through. There is a logjam of legislation that has been passed by this House but has not been processed by the other House. It is unfair of the Leader of the House to expect us to take, sight unseen, legislation that is currently before the other House.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for an early debate on the report of the Committee of Public Accounts. It appears to be a seminal report in terms of how we conduct our business. It would be well worthwhile to put it on the Order Paper at an early stage next year.</P>
      <P>I ask for a debate on the public and private sectors which involve key areas of industry and operations relating to the well-being of the entire nation. I refer specifically to the fact that Ryanair has decided to suspend its operations at Knock Airport from 11 January next, although this year over 80,000 people were brought through. It is not good enough that something like that can happen at the drop of a hat, leaving a whole community in the west bereft of a tremendously successful service, on the basis of a £6 levy. If that is the case, let us find a way of solving it rather than having the whole service suspended.</P>
      <P>The second reason for a debate on this is the announcement by the Minister for Public Enterprise that she proposes to have Aer Lingus floated in the same way as Telecom Éireann. We need to discuss what will happen if the State is not in charge of essential services. We need to discuss the whole area of joint ventures rather than total sales. We have seen what can happen. Ryanair is picking and choosing the plum areas. It started off with Knock Airport as its flagship. Now it no longer wants that but is going for juicier routes. I believe that is what will happen if Aer Lingus is sold off.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader of the House ask the Minister responsible for transport about park and ride facilities for the people of this city? The people of south-west Dublin have no park and ride facilities for Christmas. There are two sites on the north side, one at the airport and one at Whitehall, and there is one on the south side at the Simmonscourt extension. It is a wonderful system. It costs £4 a day to leave one's car, and that includes the cost of travelling to and from the city centre by bus. However, the people I rep<Col N="1248" /> resent in south-west Dublin, which has the two roads with the greatest concentration of traffic, the Galway road and the Naas Road, have nothing. People in south Dublin have the benefit of the DART service as well. We want to know why we are not being catered for in Tallaght, Clondalkin and Lucan. I strenuously object to being excluded from what is supposed to be a proposal to keep the traffic moving. I hope the Leader of the House will take me very seriously in this matter. Why should we not have that facility?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to support public transport when one sees Iarnród Éireann going on strike, greatly inconveniencing the people of the west who will not be able to get to Dublin to do their shopping and preventing people travelling to the west. It is scandalous that people in Iarnród Éireann, formerly CIE, specialise in going on strike in the days leading up to Christmas, for their own selfish reasons. I appeal to the private bus companies to fill the vacuum. I appeal to the Garda Síochána and Dublin Corporation to be sympathetic to them when they come to this city, because they will be filling a vacuum that has been created by selfish Iarnród Éireann workers. I appeal to them to come back to work and not inconvenience the very people who put the bread and butter on their table and support them all year round.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I too wish to raise the matter of Ryanair's decision, although it is not on the Order of Business. However, on this, the second last day of this session, there is no other opportunity to raise the matter. This decision by Ryanair to pull out of the west is heartless, ruthless and totally unjustifiable. We saw a time when Ryanair had not the price of fuel to put into its aircraft when it was starting up at Knock Airport. Now it is abandoning the west. It would never have got off the ground &ndash; and I do not intend a pun &ndash; were it not for Knock Airport. It is a dastardly decision. We have seen the power of public opinion in the past few weeks and the changes that resulted. Public opinion should be mobilised now to reverse Ryanair's decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to continue on the same theme of transport, in relation to the flotation of Aer Lingus. It is not as big a venture as Eircom, in which almost all of us in the South invested, only to see the shares become almost valueless. It is essential that we should not go the same way in relation to Aer Lingus. Maybe I am being pessimistic, but there is no great sense of confidence among the general public in the flotation of any Irish asset.</P>
      <P>Coming from the west, I believe it is essential that we should not allow Knock Airport to be affected as badly as it is. I would welcome a debate on transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request for a debate on the air transportation service, particularly in light of Ryanair's proposed withdrawal from Knock Airport. In discussing the flotation of Aer Rianta or Aer Lingus, we should have a debate on what we regard nationally as essential air services and the underpinning of the future of regional airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At great frustration to myself yet again, let me ask the Leader of the House what the Government is going to do about our telecommunications infrastructure, since it is apparently refusing to do anything about the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill. Notwithstanding what the Leader of the House has said, this is a problem for the parts of the country about which we have been hearing. Telecommunications infrastructure in most of our underdeveloped areas is appalling, and this Bill was supposed to deal with it, but it is sitting on the Order Paper for reasons I do not understand.</P>
      <P>I would like to know why, in the case of Nos. 2 and 4, early signatures are necessary. As a matter of principle, I object to things going through here without an explanation. Can the Leader of the House tell me why we need an early signature, particularly to the Temporary Holding Fund for Superannuation Liabilities Bill which is meant to provide for pensions in about 25 years' time? The urgency of getting through and signed within the next three days something that will not come into force for 25 years escapes me.</P>
      <P>Let me raise an issue that has been raised here frequently. I refer to the budget speech in the Dáil and the fact that with great reluctance copies of the script were given to Members of this House. We were told this was for constitutional reasons, something I can understand, but it was given to every journalist in the Press Gallery and no constitutional exception was made in their case. If the media can be supplied with copies of the script in advance for their convenience, and I believe they should be, there is no constitutional reason Members of this House who are in attendance should not be treated in a similar manner. It is a gross offence to this House to raise constitutional issues while the script is handed out willy-nilly to members of the press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1250" /> I support the Members who raised the need for a debate on transport policy. I invite Members on the other side to consider what will happen if Aer Lingus is privatised. We see what Ryanair is doing in Knock. If Aer Lingus is privatised it will inevitably become a minor part of a major multinational. We will be far more peripheral in terms of the thinking of a major multinational than Knock Airport is in the thinking of Ryanair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and appreciate his guidance as I would not have known that.</P>
      <P>While I do not believe the House should get media coverage simply because of its existence, last Wednesday the Minister for Finance came to the House, his first appearance in the Houses of the Oireacthas following all the fuss of the previous week, and made a very spirited defence of the budget. It was a very lively debate which went substantially unreported because the timing was inconvenient or awkward, etc. I am at a loss to know why this was less important than Senator Norris's problems with legal costs which was raised yesterday morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we could have an emergency debate before the recess on the decision by the Irish Medicines Board to make some drugs, in particular St. John's wort, unavailable unless on prescription. The necessary licensing has not been processed and people who are in the habit of buying St. John's wort in food stores will no longer be able to buy it or get it on prescription. I hope the Leader will call on the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to give a commitment to put a moratorium on the decision for at least three months until the licensing issues are sorted out, if the decision to put it on prescription stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are having debates on high finance and high flying. Road conditions in frosty weather can be forecast well in advance and I ask the Leader to ask the Department of the Environment and Local Government to request local authorities to take the necessary steps to ensure sanding and gritting are carried out to avoid the many accidents which may occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Cox's call regarding the decision of the Irish Medicines Board. This may only be the start of decisions by it in this area and it would be very appropriate to have a debate on alternative medicine, although I know we had a debate previously on the matter. <Col N="1251" /> However, further explanation is necessary and we should not be pioneers in European terms in this area, as would seem to be the case. If we look at the control of products over the years we will remember what happened on previous occasions, such as with thalidomide, hepatitis C, etc., and the associated fall out from those decisions. While I have no reason to conflict in any way with the Medicines Board other than on this issue, public debate says this decision is not correct and that its ramifications should not be carried into other areas.</P>
      <P>I also support the call for a debate on the crisis in Knock Airport as a result of the decision by Ryanair to pull out. Horan International Airport serves the entire Connaught region and is part of the vital infrastructure. I am taken aback by the crocodile tears on the other side of the House as I remember that both Fine Gael and Labour in Government tried to block the development of the airport. If it had not been for Monsignor Horan and his good friends in Fianna Fáil at that time we would not have an airport in Knock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what has been said about the non-availability of the Budget Statement to Members of this House. Given that today is Wednesday, an anniversary so to speak of the budget, can the Leader say if we should expect a further instalment of the budget, or is the budget by instalment at an end? Will there be a further balancing measure announced as required or deemed necessary?</P>
      <P>What arrangements does the Leader intend making for a debate on the report of the Committee of Public Accounts which is expected today?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senators have said about the proposal of the Irish Medicines Board to regulate certain health products and alternative medicines. I am a supporter of alternative medicines and am strongly of the view that much of our population, particularly our young people, is being systematically poisoned by the over use of antibiotics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a personal view. I would like a debate on the matter and perhaps the deadline of 1 January could be deferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader make contact with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment about the relocation of Molnlycke to the Middle East? This is the only factory of significance in Dunmanway and the loss of jobs and the knock-on effect on the economy is a huge blow to the town. In broader terms I am concerned that a factory such as Molnlycke, which has given great employment and service to the town, should for economic reasons relocate in the Far East, in this case Taiwan. This seems to be a trend throughout <Col N="1252" /> the country. The closure of Molnlycke is a huge blow to the people and community of Dunmanway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I find Ryanair's decision to pull out of Knock Airport hard to understand because only months ago that company was lobbying politicians, particularly those in our part of the country, about the huge number of people it would bring in if it was allowed into Shannon Airport. It outlined the effect this would have on the entire south-eastern region, listing the number of tourists it would carry. In fact, it suggested the place would be overflowing with tourists. Now Ryanair is pulling out of Knock Airport.</P>

      <P>In response to Senators Manning and Costello, I would prefer if we did not have to rush through the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill. However, what happens in the Dáil is the concern of the Dáil and what happens in the Seanad is the business of the Seanad. I am proud to be here this morning on the 154th sitting day of this Seanad and to have presided over the busiest two years in the history of Seanad Éireann. We could not have imagined three or four years ago the amount of legislation we would initiate in this House. One third of all legislation has been initiated in the House and that is the way it will continue for the remainder of the Government's term in office. Any Senator who thinks he will have a cushy job for a day or a day and a half a week had better think again about his position. We must move two by-election writs and I would have no problem moving a third or a fourth if a Senator wishes <Col N="1253" /> to leave the House on the first day back in January.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Manning's suggestion that the Chairman of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, Deputy Brian Lenihan, should come into the House to discuss the report. We can process that through a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello, Caffrey, Chambers, Jackman, Finneran, Burke and Tom Hayes expressed their concerns about Knock Airport and the fact that Ryanair is contemplating not flying out of there from mid-January. If Mr. Barry Desmond had had his way, Knock Airport would not have been built. I remember Monsignor Horan did not get a letter for a couple of days so that work could be completed. The Mayo Member on the other side of the House should at least be honest.</P>

      <P>Senator Ridge's point is more suited to discussion on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan mentioned the motion for earlier signature. It is necessary to enable £3 billion to be paid into funds before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>I will pass on Senator Jackman's views on the flotation of Aer Lingus to the Minister. Senator Ryan mentioned the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, 1999. It will not be taken in this session, but I will see what I can do for the next session.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senators Coghlan and Ryan that the budget speech should be circulated to Senators on budget day. This matter will be on the agenda of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges until we get a satisfactory conclusion. All Members of the Oireachtas should be circulated with the budget speech before members of the press. I did everything I could to ensure that happened and I will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>I will pass on the views of Senators Cox, Finneran and O'Donovan to the Minister immediately after the Order of Business. I would like to have a debate but, unfortunately, tomorrow is the last sitting day. I will also pass on Senator Callanan's views to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I will pass on Senator O'Donovan's views about the closure of a factory in Dunmanway to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>As this is the last Order of Business of the year, the decade and the century, I, on behalf of all Members of the House, thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and the Leas-Chathaoirleach for your kindness and courtesy. I thank the leaders and the Whips of all parties, particularly Senator Tom Fitzgerald, for their hard work in the House. I also thank the Clerk, Ms Deirdre Lane, and Ms Jody Blake for their kindness and courtesy. I thank Mr. Jimmy Walsh who reports the proceedings in the House every day in <i>The Irish Times</i> and I thank RTÉ and Mr. George Devlin who presents &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable this year's Exchequer allocation of £3 billion for pre-funding of social welfare and public service pensions to be held in a temporary fund pending the enactment of sub<Col N="1257" /> stantive legislation next year providing for the establishment of pension funding arrangements on a permanent, ongoing basis. Over the past decade or so we have witnessed an extraordinary transformation in Ireland's economic and budgetary performance.</P>
      <P>The medium term outlook is also quite promising, with growth expected to average over 5 per cent in the next three years and the economy heading towards an historically low level of unemployment. On the basis that public finances will continue to be managed prudently and that our international competitiveness is maintained, we can expect to achieve significant budget surpluses over the next few years.</P>
      <P>The transformation in our economic position has been assisted in no small measure by favourable demographic conditions but this is set to change over the next half century with the gradual onset of an ageing population. In Ireland today, for every person over 65, there are five persons of working age. Current demographic projections show that by 2025 the ratio will have increased to 25 per cent, that is, one person aged 65 or over for every four persons of working age. However, more dramatic changes will occur over the following 25 years, so that by the middle of the next century the ratio will have risen to 50 per cent, that is, one person over 65 for every two persons of working age.</P>
      <P>This ageing process is occurring across Europe but in many European countries it is proceeding at a more advanced pace than in Ireland. In both Germany and Italy, for example, the comparable ratio will rise to roughly 30 per cent by 2010 and nearly 50 per cent by 2030. The average ratio for the European Union is forecast to rise to 40 per cent by 2030 and 50 per cent by mid-century. The fact that Ireland lags behind the EU in the ageing process is something we can turn to our advantage.</P>
      <P>The demographic changes that lie ahead will have major implications for the Exchequer cost of pension provision, that is, social welfare pensions and public service pensions. It will also significantly affect the cost of health care provision. While long-term projections are unavoidably tentative, an indication of the potential scale of the problem was presented in a report published in July this year by my Department &ndash; the report of the budget strategy for ageing group. The group estimated that on the basis of current pay-as-you-go policies, by 2025 the Exchequer cost of broadly maintaining the current level of pensions and health service provision will have risen by about 4.5 per cent of GNP or over £2.6 billion. By 2050, this cost will have risen by 7 per cent of GNP, that is, by over £4 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, long-term forecasts such as this can never be accurate. We simply cannot predict the economic, social and technological changes that will take place over the next half century. The projections to hand may prove too pessimistic or they may be too optimistic. However, to sit back and do nothing in the hope that it will be all right <Col N="1258" /> on the night is not consistent with prudent and responsible Government.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the decision taken by the Government, announced last July, to set aside 1 per cent of gross national product annually from the budgetary arithmetic towards the Exchequer costs of social welfare and public service pensions in the future. In addition, a major portion of the proceeds of the Telecom flotation is being allocated for this purpose. In all, the Government is setting aside £3 billion this year for pension funding. I will explain the make-up of this sum in a moment.</P>
    <P>In the year 2000, a further £1.15 billion which is due from the Telecom sale will also be allocated for pension funding, along with the 1 per cent of GNP allocation for that year, estimated at £635 million. Thus, by the end of next year, an estimated £4.8 billion will have been set aside for pension funding purposes, with further allocations to be provided in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>The Bill enables the payment of up to £4.3 billion into a temporary holding fund in 1999. This sum is made up as follows: 1 per cent of GNP in the current year, equal to £582 million on the basis of my Department's latest estimate of GNP; the flotation of Telecom Éireann raised £3.667 billion and the Government has decided to use £1.25 billion of this sum to pay off Exchequer liabilities to the pension funds of Eircom and An Post, reducing the proceeds of the sale to £2.417 billion; these Exchequer liabilities are in respect of service of staff of the companies in the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs. This sum, £2.417 billion, is being allocated to the temporary fund. When added to the £582 million referred to above, payments to the fund come to £2.999 billion. Interest realised on the sum of £2.999 billion in the current year comes to an estimated £16 million and this also is being allocated to the fund. Further accrued interest of £19 million will be credited to the fund in the new year. This brings the total to be paid to the fund this year to £3.015 billion.</P>
    <P>It may be noted that section 1(3) of the Bill will permit payments to the fund of up to £4.3 billion. The reason for the higher sum is that, at this stage of the year, the payment to the Eircom pension fund has not been finalised, while the payment to the An Post pension fund has only just issued from my Department. It is anticipated that the payment to the Eircom fund will be made shortly. The higher figure is there merely as a precaution. Should there be a hitch in finalising these transactions this year, the amounts in question could be paid into the temporary holding fund.</P>
    <P>Section 1(4) provides that moneys in the fund will be placed in deposit accounts or invested in other short-term financial products within or outside the State and that any income arising therefrom will be held or reinvested by the fund.</P>
    <P>Section 1(5) in an important provision which ensures that moneys may not be withdrawn from the fund without further legislaton expressly authorising this. It provides a guarantee that the <Col N="1259" /> £3 billion which is now being allocated to the temporary fund cannot be accessed by the Government without the House having an opportunity to debate both the funding policy which the Government has adopted and the arrangements that the Government proposes for implementing that policy.</P>
    <P>The accounting arrangements in relation to the fund are contained in sections 1(6), 1(7) and 1(8). Accounts will be prepared by the NTMA and audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the accounts as audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that control and management of the fund be delegated to the National Treasury Management Agency by Government order. The NTMA is a State agency possessing the systems and expertise to manage such a large sum of money and the Bill provides that the task of managing this money may be assigned to the agency. In its role as manager of the Exchequer account, the agency is currently managing the proceeds from the Telecom flotation and the 1 per cent of 1999 GNP allocation for pension funding. These moneys have been placed on short-term deposit by the NTMA with various financial institutions to mature at various dates in 1999 and 2000. These institutions conform with the counterparty risk criteria specified in guidelines issued to the agency and with the agency's own internal counterparty risk limits. Section 3 contains the short title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an interim measure and Senators will have the opportunity of fully debating the pension funding issue when I bring forward substantive legislation in the new year providing for the establishment and management of two separate funds, one for social welfare pensions and one for public service pensions. This legislaton, which is currently being prepared in my Department, will provide for annual Exchequer subscriptions to the funds and for subsequent drawdowns from the funds to meet Exchequer pension costs. It will also set out arrangements for the administrative control and management of the funds as well as a high-level investment mandate within which this is to be exercised. Accountability in relation to the operation and performance of the funds will also be a key provision. It is envisaged that the legislation will facilitate the transfer of moneys in the temporary holding fund to the permanent funds and provide for the winding up of the temporary fund.</P>
    <P>This legislation and the substantive legislation I intend to introduce in the new year will mark a new departure in the management of our public finances. With the budgetary surpluses now at our disposal we have a major opportunity to provide for the secure retirement of current and future generations. Let us not squander this opportunity.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Col N="1260" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the Seanad on this occasion, which is happier than the last occasion on which he visited the House.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for the setting up of a temporary fund into which this year's allocation for pre-funding social welfare and public service pensions will be deposited. At a later date next year, the House will be asked to enact legislation to provide for the establishment of pension funding arrangements on a permanent basis and at that time we will have an opportunity to discuss the different aspects of the management of this kind of pension fund.</P>
      <P>It makes good economic sense to plan for the future, especially in relation to pensions. As with the individual, the earlier the State begins to contribute to a pension fund the greater the benefit and the better the result will be. We are fortunate in Ireland in enjoying very favourable demographic conditions compared to our European partners. Some European countries, such as Germany and Italy, will have serious problems over the next 20 years servicing their pension needs. It will require up to 20 per cent of their GDP and that will be a serious problem.</P>
      <P>Ireland will not be faced with such a serious problem until the middle of the next century. In the meantime, we must provide for our ageing population. We need to provide not just pensions but also for the care of the elderly. I am a member of the Eastern Health Board and the board is conscious of the need to provide for the elderly. In the last five years it has provided 500 beds in purpose built nursing homes. Yesterday I attended the opening of a 50 bed unit in Ballymun. This work will, and must, continue because by 2010, 195,000 of the population in the Eastern Health Board region will be over 65 years of age. They will constitute a costly demand on the Exchequer. Providing pension funds for the elderly is one issue but providing services for them is also important. It will be one of the biggest financial drains on the State in coming years and I hope provision will be made for it.</P>
      <P>If we continue to operate on the pay as you earn basis, in 25 years the cost to the Exchequer of mounting pension funds and health services will be approximately 4.5 per cent of GNP or over £2.5 billion. It would not be prudent to continue funding pensions on that basis. It makes good economic sense at a time of budget surpluses to make provision for social welfare and public service pensions. It is envisaged that 1 per cent of GNP will be set aside in the fund each year. The Minister will also make a major contribution to the fund from the proceeds of the sale of Telecom Éireann. As future State assets are sold, and there was discussion on the Order of Business about the sale of Aer Lingus, will the Minister by sympathetic to making further similar contributions? It is important that the fund is built up over the next 15 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When will we start withdrawing from the fund? When will it have reached a deposit level which will allow us to start making withdrawals? Will <Col N="1261" /> there be two separate funds, one for social welfare payments and one for public service pensions? I am delighted with section 1(5) which provides that the money in the fund cannot be touched by a Government unless the Houses legislate for it. The Minister will be familiar with the old road fund in which money was deposited from road tax receipts for the upkeep of the roads. Of course, every Minister for Finance raided that fund&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;so we are providing that something similar cannot happen in this case.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to private pensions, although they are not relevant to the Bill. Many people contributed over the years to pension funds in the belief that they would get a pension of approximately £20,000 on their retirement. However, due to low interest rates, the most they will get is £12,000. That is causing severe problems. How can that be dealt with? I acknowledge the measure introduced in the budget under which the income tax allowance for people over 65 years of age was raised from £13,000 to £15,000. I hope the Minister will continue that process over forthcoming years. When the elderly get a return from their savings they should not have to pay tax on it.</P>
      <P>The measure before the House is prudent. I look forward to discussing in detail how this fund will be managed at a later date, when the permanent legislation is introduced.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance on his handling of the national finances since his appointment to office. He has presided over the most successful period in the history of the State with regard to its public finances. This Bill is another forward looking step in the innovative policy he has introduced into the Department.</P>
      <P>The greatest worry of a middle aged person or a person approaching retirement age is that there will be adequate provision for their twilight years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>They worry that they will have adequate finances to support them in their final years. The step being taken by the Minister is good housekeeping. It provides for the two areas of responsibility which the Government will have in the future, people who retire under the social welfare system and those who retire from the public service under the superannuation system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If measures are not implemented now, the burden on future Governments would be similar to that which was experienced by previous Governments in terms of servicing the interest on the <Col N="1262" /> national debt. Many commentators have pointed out that if we could have invested the money we were paying in interest on the national debt in infrastructure and job creation in the 1970s and 1980s, many positive things could have been done for our young workforce at that time. That was not to be, however. We were obliged to meet our international responsibilities and pay the interest on our debts.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, as a result of good housekeeping, those repayments are no longer a major impediment to this Government and will not be for future Governments. Similarly, unless we put in place the mechanism to operate a fund to provide for pensions, it would become a burden on the State in the future. I compliment the Minister and the Government on bringing this legislation forward.</P>
    <P>The Bill will ensure that a portion of the fund, which might not be capable of being dealt with fully in the primary legislation, can be put into a holding fund and will not be interfered with until the proper funds are in place as a consequence of legislation that will be introduced in the future. It is important that the legislation provides that interference with the fund cannot take place and money cannot be drawn down from the fund without the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This legislation is of vital importance in the provision of pensions for the elderly and the retired but I agree with Senator Doyle that the wider issue is not exclusively pensions. There are many other issues involved in providing for the elderly, such as health care and the provision of services. We could be a little more innovative in this area. I have taken a keen interest in what is happening in this regard in other countries. One thing we lack and which could be self-financing is private health insurance for people in retirement. It is not something we have promoted or facilitated and the health insurance bodies &ndash; our own VHI or the new one BUPA &ndash; have not considered it either. Other countries are providing care for the elderly in areas other than health care, such as retirement complexes and rest homes. Not all the elderly, and fewer in the future, will avail of or feel they need to avail of what we now see as a nursing home or a sheltered home under a health care system. In the future, as is happening in other developed countries of the western world, people will be retiring into supportive situations and to do that, they must have some type of back up, such as insurance or a financial provision made in earlier years. I call upon the people in the health care system to look to the growing market of people who in their forties, fifties or earlier can afford to make pension provisions and provisions for retirement, health or support care. The Minister for Finance could be supportive of that initiative by means of a tax break if those involved in the health care area make such proposals. It is an area that the existing health care system or or a new operator who <Col N="1263" /> wishes to come in by means of a pension fund, should consider. There is an opening there.</P>
    <P>It is predicted that in 25 years' time one in four people will be over the age of 65. This projection is based on current information and may not necessarily be the case in 2025. The whole area of employment and extra employment are factors that may change and, if so, that figure may not be as high. There is a major problem right across Europe. We will be in a better position than many European countries with regard to the ratio of people in the retirement category and those in the working category. If this economy continues its forward stride over the next ten years, we will hopefully not reach the one in four ratio because of the extra employment and more people in employment. The provision that is now made will be adequate and may even surpass the demand that will be placed upon the pension funds.</P>
    <P>There is a sizeable amount of money involved &ndash; it could be up to £4.3 billion this year. It may not reach that figure but there is a definite commitment of £3 billion. It is important that the sale of the family silver is reinvested in the future. It is important that the Minister does that and sets aside a percentage rather than a GNP figure. Both funds will be managed by the National Treasury Management Agency. This company has been the success story of recent years. I compliment the Minister on his decision to bring forward this legislation and on his forward thinking on both public and private sector pensions. In years to come people will look back and say, &ldquo;Wasn't he the man who planned for the future and made sure that the burden of pensions for our elderly was not ignored or put on the long finger?&rdquo; I commend the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. I do not intend to strike a discordant note. I have a couple of suggestions to make about where the Minister could use this money better.</P>
      <P>The previous speakers have described the Minister's approach to this Bill as prudent and good housekeeping. Far be it from me to disagree. We cannot fault the Minister on his logical approach to budgeting in terms of the overall annual Exchequer budgeting or how he intends to spend the money in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has presented us with a scenario based on demographics in relation to Ireland and the European Union and he has quoted the report of the budget strategy for each group. Those demographics seem to give an extraordinarily distanced approach in the sense that we are talking about the year 2000 and then jump to 2025 and on to 2050. They are light years ahead in terms of the performance of the Irish economy at present. Only in the period 2000-25 are we projected to lose a ratio of working population to ageing population of between one and five at present and one and four in 2025. That is a good ratio projection which does not under any circumstances suggest any threat to our ability to fund <Col N="1264" /> the pensions. If there is not a problem, why fix it?</P>
    <P>In Europe the situation is different. They are experiencing the problem the Minister envisages for us in a quarter of a century and a half century on. We are not comparing like with like. We have a buoyant economy and a young population. The main players in Europe do not have buoyant economies or youthful populations. We have not taken into consideration the need for a new, vibrant workforce which will surely come into this country. It is already happening. The numbers who are immigrating as distinct from emigrating have changed dramatically from 30,000 to 40,000 leaving in the 1980s to 30,000 coming back, with the existing 30,000 to 40,000 remaining. Our population will expand with these youthful people. Where are the projections? I do not believe there will be any change in our profile of youth to old age in ten, 15 or 25 years that will make a bit of difference to our figures or statistics and our financial requirements. Is the Minister not being too prudent in his approach? Do we need to take this measure and, if so, could we do it differently? Let me present a scenario to the Minister. What are the alternatives? Could the Minister use the money better? There is £4.3 billion available in windfall gains.</P>
    <P>Reducing the national debt, which currently stands in the region of £29 billion, is one alternative. If one substracts the figure of £4.3 billion one is left with a figure close to £25 billion. One per cent of GNP will account for £582 million of the figure of £3 billion while a sum of £1.25 billion is required to meet liabilities in An Post and Eircom. The interest rate payable is in the region of 8 per cent, well over double the rate payable on short-term investments about which the Minister has spoken. There would be, therefore, a considerable net saving to the Exchequer from which the national debt has to be paid and pension liabilities met. If the Minister were to do as I suggest, savings in the region of £350 million to £400 million would accrue this year. If this was added to the £582 million available by way of 1 per cent of GNP there would be in the region of £1 billion available which could be placed in the pensions fund immediately. This figure would continue to grow annually and it would have the added benefit of being painless. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, announced today that she intends to sell off Aer Lingus, the money from which could also be used to reduce the national debt, leading to lower interest repayments and increased provision for pension liabilities.</P>
    <P>This is one alternative which would make much more sense but it is not my preferred option. While it would be prudent and good housekeeping to do as the Minister suggests to take care of the elderly, we are not under any pressure to do so. This is a wealthy and prosperous country but our infrastructure ranks among the worst in the European Union. It is extremely bad. Let us look <Col N="1265" /> at the quality of the service provided by Iarnród Éireann, in which a strike has been called today. It takes over three hours to travel to Sligo by train at speeds of between 30 mph and 40 mph. This is outrageous and I must travel there tonight. The line is considered dangerous because of the condition and age of the sleepers. They are antiquated. Our bus services and roads are also inadequate. There is not a decent road between the two major cities on this island &ndash; Dublin and Belfast &ndash; or between any of the major urban centres. Neither do we have decent rail services. One would have been able to travel to Sligo much faster 100 years ago. What is going to be done about this? There are major areas&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and will endeavour to answer some of the questions raised. This <Col N="1266" /> is a temporary measure to place the moneys in a holding fund. There will be adequate opportunity to debate many of the issues raised when the substantive legislation is brought forward next year. The various policy options have yet to be determined. How the fund will be managed and the use to which the funds will be put will be addressed in the Bill proper.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle raised a number of specific issues, including future privatisations. The moneys placed in the holding fund now and early next year will eventually be transferred to the funds proper. This will be governed by the substantive legislation. While the Minister will be compelled to set aside 1 per cent of GNP each year, provision will also be made to allow him or her to add to this depending on financial circumstances. This may happen, for example, subsequent to privatisations.</P>
      <P>The moneys placed in the holding fund now and early next year may not be withdrawn other than for the purposes to be provided for in the substantive Bill. It is my intention to put as much distance as possible between the funds and the Minister for Finance. There is a balance to be struck. The Minister must be accountable to the taxpayer who has contributed the money through the Dáil and Seanad. I do not want him or her when under pressure from his or her colleagues to dip into the fund when stuck for a few quid at budget time. This is a complex matter which will be addressed in the substantive legislation.</P>
      <P>I note the desire of Senator Doyle that we should ensure future Governments cannot dip into these funds. That would be my desire also but one has to marry the complexity and balance between being responsible for the fund or taxpayers' money while at the same time have that arm's length area.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle asked whether there would be two funds. Yes, there will be the public service pension fund and the other pensions that will be paid out of a social welfare pensions area. It will be the intention, subject to allow the Bill be enacted, that the breakdown of the allocation would be of the order of two to one, two thirds for social welfare pensions and one third for public service. Even though &ndash; I pointed this out when I announced this last July &ndash; I am setting aside 1 per cent of GNP and I am giving it a big kick start with money from the Telecom Éireann flotation, we have estimated that that will go nowhere near meeting the demands on funds in the years to come. We calculate &ndash; even though checking and long-term estimations are somewhat difficult &ndash; that we would want to set aside 3.5 per cent of GNP each year to meet the proposed ageing and other health costs as years go on. Even though we are giving it a good start with the money from the flotation plus 1 per cent, it still will not meet what our estimated demands will be in the years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Doyle referred to private pensions. Members will be aware that I have made significant changes in my last Finance Bill in this area. <Col N="1267" /> As I said in my budget speech on 1 December, I am not finished with that area yet. I am willing to hear other contributions and iron out some anomalies. The Senator is quite correct that what has happened is that people could expect to save X pension based on annuity rates that, in the past, were related to higher interest rates. Lower interest rates have benefited everyone in the economy and allowed the economy to grow. I often wonder how Ireland survived when businesses and private individuals had to pay interest rates of up to 20 per cent when Germany had low interest rates. Yet we did survive. It is good for the economy that we are enjoying low interest rates. On the other hand, people who are in their retirement years, who are dependent on pensions which related to bond yields, have seen their income drop. Therefore, the expectations people would have had of their lump sums producing a pension on annuity basis of X amount cannot now be realised. That is part of the background of why I changed the arrangement last year to allow greater flexibility for the self-employed and proprietary directors. Although, as I have said previously, I had made up my mind that I was doing this in any event, long before annuity rates dropped to the level that they have in the past 18 months or so, it did give a further reason for doing so. I will address the matter again.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran made good points about the provision of health care. Members will notice in my speech and in earlier ones that I referred to the provision of health care in the future. Not alone will the ageing of the population affect pension provisions, it will affect health care provision as well. In my first budget and Finance Bill I introduced a special tax allowance that would allow people invest in the provision of nursing homes. This was one of my better ideas, totally dreamt up by myself. I gave a tax break which has been quite successful. Some of the financial institutions are now putting forward packages to allow people to invest in these opportunities. My provision has increased the number of nursing homes throughout the country. As the Senator correctly pointed out &ndash; and he has a lot of expertise in this area &ndash; this will be a problem in years to come. It is a problem now.</P>
    <P>An area which has grown enormously over the past 15 years in my constituency has been the provision of private health care in the form of nursing homes. There will be an increased need for these around the country and one of the reasons is that the traditional way we looked after our aged has changed with changing societal conditions. When I was growing up in Kildare one person in the family cared for the elderly. In 98 per cent of the cases it was a woman who never married. She stayed at home to look after her mother and her grandmother. Then someone looked after her and life went on like that. Society has changed. Whether it has changed for good or evil is a matter for another debate. That method no long applies and we cannot expect <Col N="1268" /> people to do that. Therefore, the demand for health care for the aged and provision for looking after the aged has increased. If there are any other effective tax breaks I am willing to consider them. The tax breaks I have given so far are quite useful. If there are other tweakings I could do that would assist, I will be glad to look at them.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran made the point that it was a far-reaching measure. I would like to think it is. It was not forced upon me. It was not in the programme for Government. It was not forced upon by the Department of Finance. It is something I thought should be done over a long period of years.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Costello's point, if we do not do it now when times are good we will never do it. There are 1,001 reasons Ministers for Finance should not do something like this. There are no votes in it for a start. If I thought of votes I would not be doing something like this. In the long term I am of the view that in 20 to 25 years time someone might stand up and say &ldquo;Who was the Minister for Finance who thought up this in the first place?&rdquo;  People will not even remember my name but they will say I must have had some vision for the future.   </P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to think that that might happen.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello referred to the demographic distance of looking into the future. In actuarial terms 20 to 25 years is a short period. I can say from previous experience as a professional accountant in a private capacity that in pension provisions one takes an even longer-term view than that. Twenty to 25 years is a short time in terms of pension provision. With regard to the self-employed and proprietary directors, most people in that area find that they are in their mid to late fifties, having worked hard all their lives, without having made any provision for their pensions because they have been actively trying to keep their shop, farm or small business going. Then these people find that they are left with too short a time period to invest enough money to provide for a pension. There will be thousands of cases like this. So 20 or 25 years at 50 years of age is a very short period in actuarial terms. As I pointed out, Ireland's demographic position is different from that of the European Union in general but we will reach that position in time to come. I take the view &ndash; as I think most people would &ndash; that it is prudent at this stage to set up the mechanisms to provide for the time when things are different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hard to know what the Labour Party believes about this because sometimes Labour Party people have said we should not pay off the national debt. Over the past year the Labour Party Leader, Deputy Quinn, has said it was a waste of time doing it, that I am hung up about paying off the national debt and that I should not do it at all. However, Senator Costello seems to <Col N="1269" /> suggest that it is a good idea to pay off the national debt. I agree with him. I have been able to provide money to pay off the national debt, provide money for pensions as well as funding the national development plan. Due to technical things we did last year with the portfolio, there will be a nominal increase in the total of the national debt but <i>de facto</i> it is coming down. There will be a budgetary surplus in 1999 just like I had last year and that automatically reduced the national debt. I project that we will have a budgetary surplus for the year 2000 and beyond while at the same providing funding for this area.</P>
    <P>Senators need not get too excited about this. One of the insults that has been thrown at me is that I am financially right wing.  </P>

      <P>On the national development plan, there are provisions for every single infrastructural area in the national development plan. Some people think that the provisions in the national development plan are too generous because one could spend all the money but one might not get any increase in volume. There is a balance to be struck. One could produce millions in the morning to do certain things but if there are reasons why the work cannot be done, all that will happen is that one will bid up the price. No extra work will be done. Some economists take the view that there is probably too great an amount of money going into the national development plan and all that will happen is that the prices but not the volume will increase. One has to strike a medium and most sensible people will take that view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to address the Seanad today on the 1999 Appropriation Bill. The purpose of the annual Appropriation Bill is to give statutory effect to the Departmental Estimates for the supply services, current and capital, including all Supplementary Esti<Col N="1271" /> mates which were approved by the Dáil since the last Appropriation Act. The 1999 Bill appropriates to the various services listed in the Schedule for the year ending on 31 December 1999 the net sum of £14,913.294 million. This total amount comprises the original net Estimates of £14,248.82 million, as approved by the Dáil last June, and net Supplementary Estimates totalling £664.474 million which have been approved by the Dáil in recent weeks. In line with the normal practice, the Bill also seeks approval for the use of Departmental receipts, amounting to £1,397.162 million as appropriations-in-aid of the services listed in the Schedule. As I have indicated, that the Estimates and Supplementary Estimates included in the Schedule to the Appropriation Bill have been approved by the Dáil. The Bill simply seeks to give formal legal effect to those Estimates and Supplementary Estimates.</P>
      <P>The Bill includes the same standard provisions as in previous years, apart from the provision in section 3 of the Bill dealing with the payment of the excise duty on tobacco to the Department of Health. This is a technical measure required in order to give the Revenue Commissioners the authority to pay the excise revenue directly to the Department of Health and Children rather than to the Exchequer as is normally the case.</P>
      <P>The Appropriation Bill provides an opportunity to review the budgetary and economic position. We are all aware of the exceptional performance of the Irish economy in recent years. We have managed to combine strong economic growth with price stability and large gains in employment. Ireland progressed from having one of the worst performing economies in Europe to having the best. This good performance was maintained this year. Yet again, economic growth is set to exceed expectations. GNP growth of 7.5 per cent is estimated for this year, compared with a forecast of 6 per cent at the start of the year. Employment growth continues to be strong. Employment is expected to increase by 74,000 this year. As a result, the fall in unemployment has continued. The unemployment rate currently stands at 5.1 per cent. This is just over half the rate of unemployment which existed when this Government entered office &ndash; quite a remarkable performance in two and a half years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, prices have remained under control. Inflation is expected to average 1.6 per cent this year &ndash; substantially less than the 2 per cent projected at the start of the year. The performance of the economy has transformed the public finances. We are now expecting a general Government surplus for the third year in a row. We are set to have a record surplus in 1999, equivalent to more than 3 per cent of GNP. As a result, the national debt has continued to fall rapidly. It is now projected to fall to 47 per cent of GDP. As recently as 1993, this figure was over 90 per cent of GDP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> The economic outlook for 2000 remains positive. On budget day, the Minister for Finance announced our latest set of projections &ndash; real growth in GNP of 6.25 per cent, strong employment growth with an increase of 54,000, unemployment to fall to below 5 per cent, and inflation to average 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>In preparing its budgetary policy, the Government is taking account of the longer-term challenges we face. Many European countries face a pensions time bomb in the near future, an issue which the Seanad has been discussing with the Minister for Finance. Demographic developments have left them with an ageing population, with many people reaching retirement in the near future. The cost of providing for increasing numbers of pensioners at a time when the working age population is falling will put a major strain on public finances. Ireland is fortunate in this regard. With the birth rate peaking around 1980 we will not face this problem for another 25 years. However, the Government has already begun to prepare to face this problem. The Government has decided to put aside a sum equivalent to 1 per cent of GNP annually to pre-fund both public service and social welfare pensions. In addition, the bulk of the net proceeds from the sale of Telecom Éireann will be added to this fund, a sum equivalent to almost £3 billion in 1999. This far-sighted measure will substantially reduce the burden on future generations.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance mentioned on budget day, rapid economic growth is creating a new set of problems. House prices have risen rapidly, congestion is increasing in our towns and cities and labour shortages are emerging in the economy. These pressures must be relieved if the economic performance of recent years is to be maintained.</P>
    <P>The increase in house prices, particularly in Dublin, has been the subject of much discussion recently. Prices have nearly doubled since 1996. This has made it very difficult for many people to afford accommodation. This must be a major cause for concern. However, the Government is taking action. Recommendations made in the Bacon report are being implemented. This is having a significant effect. Record numbers of new houses are expected to be built this year. As a result, the rate of increase in prices has slowed. This trend should continue as the supply of new houses begins to match demand.</P>
    <P>Over the last decade, Ireland has benefited from a series of social partnership agreements involving a consensus approach to economic management based on prudent fiscal policy, moderate pay increases and moderate inflation. The Partnership 2000 agreement was the fourth in a series of economic development strategies implemented since 1987. It involves an active collaboration between the Government, trade unions, employers' organisations and the community and voluntary sectors. Partnership 2000 has built on the successes of its predecessors in achieving continued economic growth and <Col N="1273" /> employment creation, together with moderation in pay developments in the economy.</P>
    <P>The stable framework provided by social partnership has proven very attractive to foreign investment which, together with an emerging indigenous sector, has driven forward growth, employment and real incomes. It has also enabled real and substantial progress to be made in tackling social exclusion.</P>
    <P>It is easy to forget how much we have achieved in such a relatively short time. By any objective standard, Ireland's performance in recent years has been impressive, indeed remarkable. Social partnership has contributed significantly to this success. There are advantages for us in using the social partnership process to underpin steady sustained growth in the future. At the same time, the long-term sustainability of social partnership depends on its ability to adjust to changing demands and needs at both national and enterprise levels.</P>
    <P>There are many serious challenges facing us both domestically and on foot of globalisation. In the new policy environment which membership of EMU brings, pay levels across the economy, in the public and private sectors, are even more crucial in determining competitiveness and employment. As a small, open economy which is vitally dependent on exports, any loss of competitiveness <i>vis à vis</i> our trading partners would be very serious for growth and jobs. Our recent economic progress has shown us that much can be achieved by all the social partners striving towards a common aim. There is an onus on all of us to meet these challenges in a constructive and innovative way.</P>
    <P>The NESC strategy report was prepared in response to a request from the Taoiseach for a strategy report in relation to a new national programme of social partnership. It provides a valuable background and framework for discussions on a new national partnership agreement. The Government remains committed to concluding a new agreement with the social partners. A new agreement is essential to ensure the maintenance and, where possible, the strengthening of the conditions necessary for continued economic and social development in the interests of all the members of society.</P>
    <P>We cannot take our current economic success for granted. We are faced with a number of key challenges to ensure that the progress we have achieved to date is sustained into the future. One of these challenges is to ensure that the significant improvement in the public finances which has been a major cornerstone of our success is not put at risk by excessive pay demands in the public sector.</P>
    <P>The public service pay and pensions bill has increased substantially in recent years. In the five year period 1995-2000, it will rise by almost 50 per cent. This is before allowing any provision for the costs of a new pay deal to succeed Partnership 2000. As the Minister for Finance said in the Budget Statement, the Government considers <Col N="1274" /> that it must overhaul the present system of pay determination in the public service. We need to move towards a system that more clearly links pay to performance and away from the fixed internal relativities and analogues that are a feature of the present system. Too often, we are paying for agreement to change, not for the outputs from the successful implementation of change. The current discussions on public service pay, in the context of the negotiation of a new national partnership agreement, must address this issue. We must also ensure that a new agreement addresses the issue of industrial peace, particularly in relation to essential services.</P>
    <P>I will outline briefly some of the detail of the Appropriation Bill before the House today. Section 1 gives statutory effect to the departmental Estimates for the supply services, non-capital and capital, including all Supplementary Estimates which were approved by the Dáil since the last Appropriation Act. On 30 June 1999, the Dáil approved the original 1999 net Estimates for departmental expenditure which totalled £14.249 billion. Since then, the Dáil has approved a number of Supplementary Estimates for various Departments which, in total, come to £664 million. This extra amount brings the total grant for supply services expenditure in 1999 to £14.913 billion. Section 1(1) appropriates this total amount of £14.913 billion to the various supply services or Departments as listed in the Schedule. In addition, Section 1(2) provides for the application of a total amount of £1.397 billion in departmental receipts as appropriations-in-aid of the grants for the supply services listed in the Schedule.</P>
    <P>I will outline briefly the main factors which have given rise to additional expenditure and the requirement for Supplementary Estimates this year. Six Departments and offices accounted for £634 million or 95 per cent of the total Supplementary Estimates of £664 million. The main factors which gave rise to the additional allocations in these areas are as follows. A net additional £179 million was granted to the Department of Health and Children Vote. Of this, £107 million was required to cover the cost of settlement of the dispute on nurses' pay and allowances. A further £90 million was needed to deal with under-provision over a number of years in the GMS payments board in respect of services to medical card holders and £21 million was required for additional costs arising on the demand-led drug schemes. These excesses were partially offset by buoyancy in the appropriations-in-aid of the Vote.</P>
    <P>An extra net allocation of £159 million was granted to the Department of Education and Science. A total of £47.5 million was provided for additional capital for schools and third level institutions, £44.5 million covered an expected shortfall in EU receipts, £21.5 million was for pay settlements, including arrears of pay in the universities and institutes of technology, and £20.25 million was allocated to cover the cost of a <Col N="1275" /> greater number of teacher retirements at primary and second level than originally anticipated.</P>
    <P>Net additional funds of £107 million have been approved for the Department of Public Enterprise. An additional £80 million was provided for CIE's rail safety programme and £40 million was required to cover extra costs associated with the Telecom Éireann public flotation.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Office of Public Works, the purchase of the Farmleigh Estate and Lansdowne House, in addition to a number of other properties held on long-term leases, required the provision of additional net funds of £103 million to the Office of Public Works Vote.</P>
    <P>Net additional funds of £52 million were provided to the Department of the Environment and Local Government to fund accelerated development of the national roads network. An extra net amount of £34 million was provided for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, most of which was required to meet additional animal health compensation and related costs and for higher headage payments.</P>
    <P>I now turn to section 2 of the Bill. Article 17.1.2º of the Constitution requires that the Financial Resolutions of each financial year must be enacted into law by the end of that financial year, that is, by 31 December 1999 in the case of the financial resolutions passed on budget night, 1 December. However, Article 17.1.2º also allows for the 31 December deadline to be deferred if an Act to that effect is passed before the end of 1999. This section makes provision for this deferment option to be invoked. The provision in this section of the Appropriation Bill will maintain the normal statutory deadlines for passing budget measures into law, that is, 84 days for the completion of the Second Stage and four months for enactment of the Finance Bill. Identical provisions were included in the 1998 and 1999 Appropriation Acts.</P>
    <P>Finally, I will deal with section 3 of the Bill. The Minister for Finance announced in the budget that the excise duty on cigarettes was being increased by 50p per packet of 20, with corresponding increases in other tobacco products, and that the resulting revenue increase of £132 million in a full year would be paid as an appropriation-in-aid to the Department of Health and Children. The increase in the rate of duty was provided for in the Financial Resolutions passed in the Dáil on budget day and section 3 of this Appropriation Bill now provides the statutory authority required to assign the proceeds to the Department of Health and Children Vote.</P>
    <P>These proceeds will, as indicated in the Bill, be paid by the Revenue Commissioners to the Minister for Health and Children, who will take them to account as an appropriations-in-aid of the Vote. The dedication of this substantial tax increase to support health spending will drive home to smokers the message that the habit is directly harmful to their health. Smoking is a major cause of lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, <Col N="1276" /> emphysema and heart disease and thus creates very significant costs for the health services. In accordance with the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle, smokers should make a particular contribution towards those costs.</P>
    <P>As we approach the end of this year and this millennium and look forward to the start of a new millennium, we can feel justifiably proud of the substantial economic and social progress that has been made, particularly over the last decade. This Government acknowledges the contribution which has been made at all levels of Irish society in helping to make this happen. Crucially, the fostering, through the social partnership model, of a consensus approach to dealing with economic and social issues, has played a hugely important role in bringing about our current favourable position.</P>
    <P>The successful conclusion of a new national agreement with the social partners, together with the implementation of the ambitious national development plan and a continuation of the prudent economic and budgetary policies which have underpinned progress to date, will help to ensure that our current economic success continues well into the next century.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I wish you, a Chathaoirligh, and all your colleagues a very happy Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not take 30 minutes because this matter will come before the House again in the new millennium under motion No. 10 on the Order Paper to which the Leader of the House referred.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his comprehensive speech on the state of the nation. The amount of money to which the Bill gives statutory effect, £14.913 billion, is frightening. I am delighted the Minister came here to make a statement because we do not usually have the opportunity in this House to discuss the Estimates which give effect to that Vote, and this gives us that opportunity.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Government on the excellent financial returns for the year. Over the past six years we have enjoyed extraordinary growth. We are the envy of every European nation because of our economic growth and falling unemployment. This morning, two measures, the measure which we debated earlier and the measure before the House now, overlapped in some way, and many of the issues which were discussed earlier were discussed again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one issue I want to take up, that is, the national debt which has been mentioned by the Minister. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, also made a statement on it before he left the House. The Government of 1982-87 had to face very difficult times. Very imprudent measures had been taken by the previous Admin<Col N="1277" /> istration of 1977-82 which trebled the national debt. There were very severe redundancies in many industries in this city at that time. The motor industry went to the wall because of EU regulations. However, there was one famous motor industry in the Taoiseach's constituency at that time, Talbot Motors. All the employees in Talbot Motors, rather than getting redundancy payments, were put on the payroll of this State for the remainder of their lives, and we must not forget that.</P>
    <P>The Government of 1982-87 was faced with difficult situations and had to borrow to meet the needs of citizens. What happened is extraordinary. In borrowing it provided housing, a telecommunications service, and, above all, education for our young citizens. That is bearing fruit now. That money was well invested and has shown a great return. I remember going to San José in 1985 with the present Taoiseach who was then Lord Mayor of Dublin to try to encourage American computer firms to come here. At that time some of our graduates from Trinity were finding employment in Silicon Valley, and we went over there. At that stage there were three American companies in Dublin dealing mostly in hardware. When President Clinton recently came to Ireland he noted that there were now 2,000 American computer industry firms based in Ireland and that, after America, we were the foremost country exporting software. We are now reaping the benefits of the education facilities this State provided for its citizens at that time. Therefore, we should not look at the 1982-87 Administration as a spendthrift Administration. It spent the money well. When it left office, the incoming Administration with the Tallaght Strategy followed the same prudent path and from then on there was support from all parties in relation to the finances of the State, and the State has grown to the prosperity we are now enjoying.</P>
    <P>In our prosperity, there are certain infrastructural defects which still have to be addressed. Even though we have economic growth far better than our European neighbours, we fall well behind in our infrastructural facilities. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has given me a commitment that major infrastructures for the city of Dublin will have his approval before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I worry about recent forecasts in relation to inflation. I see inflation beginning to rise again, and this concerns me. The Minister might comment on that. Inflation is now at 2 per cent and growing. As the economy grows and prospers, it would be terrible if inflation rose to a very high rate because that would destroy it.</P>
    <P>In times of economic prosperity there are social needs to attend to. The Minister referred to the serious housing problem in Dublin. I do not think much can be done in the short term, but I hope that in the long term we can plan so that young people can get affordable social housing for which there is a tremendous need. I hope that when the Planning and Development Bill is <Col N="1278" /> passed we will be able to provide for that great need.</P>
    <P>In the light of economic prosperity we must also look more kindly on refugees and asylum seekers coming here. We owe them that, given that we have, over many years, sent people abroad. We should now be more generous in our approach to people coming here.</P>
    <P>In regard to the homeless, it is sad, given the current economic growth compared to what we had in the 1980s, to see people sleeping rough on our streets. That did not happen in the 1980s when we had less economic growth. Why are people are sleeping rough on the streets every night? It worries me to see so many people doing this in our capital city and it is a growing problem. If we have prosperity, let us deal with that problem. I attended a housing initiative for the homeless last week with the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government at which a new home was launched. However, the Government needs to provide more funds in that area.</P>
    <P>I hope the prosperity we have enjoyed at the end of this century continues into the new millennium and that we will continue to prosper as a nation. All Governments have contributed to achieving this. I thank the Minister for coming to the House this morning to address us. I thank him for the very kind millennium presentation he made to each Member of the House. It is a very striking presentation, and we are very grateful. I join in wishing the Minister a very happy Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, to the House. This is appreciated by the Members of this House. While we do not have a direct input to the Estimates, we do have an opportunity under the Appropriation Bill to discuss financial matters. I too compliment the Minister on this very comprehensive document.</P>
      <P>The Appropriation Bill gives statutory effect to the moneys that have been provided under departmental Estimates and Supply Services for the current year. It is an extraordinary amount, just short of £15 billion in 1999. This country has come a long way in the past 20 years and more particularly in the past ten or 12 years. In the 1980s and early 1990s we could not have thought we would have an unemployment rate of just over 5 per cent. Some would say that given that percentage we do not have an unemployment problem. I know that is not true, but a rate of 5 per cent is a yardstick which is used internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate is 30 per cent or 40 per cent in some areas in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point that the percentage is higher in some areas and it is important that in the context of social justice we continue to identify those areas and ensure equality of opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1279" /> The focus is on social partnership, which is so responsible for our current situation. I am very pleased with the statements made by the Government, and in particular by the Minister for Finance, that the minimum wage will be implemented in the coming year and that those in society who feel they have not benefited as much as others from the Celtic tiger will be looked after and seen to be looked after in the new social partnership agreement.</P>
    <P>An additional 50,000 were employed during the year, with the prospect of an additional 74,000 being employed in the coming year. These are extraordinary figures and show a country on the march. We have moved to a situation where we are the envy not only of Europe but of the western world in general. I consider this in the context of three issues which will be very important over the next number of years. The first issue, which I spoke about earlier this morning, is the national debt which was a problem we thought we would never face down some years ago. This is no longer the position, with the national debt decreasing as a proportion of GDP from 90 per cent to 47 per cent, and continuing to decrease. This is quite extraordinary and I compliment those involved in achieving it.</P>
    <P>At a time when we have reduced the national debt so significantly we are investing in the pension funds for the future. In legislation this morning we decided to put 1 per cent of growth into pre-financing our funds out of which pensions will be paid in 25 or 50 years' time. Included in that fund is the money raised from the sale of certain assets which are being privatised. This is good housekeeping and the decision to provide such funding is very important. In addition we have brought forward a national development plan which will invest £40 billion over the next six years. It is an extraordinary situation when we take the reduction in the national debt, the funding of future pensions and the national development plan side by side.</P>
    <P>Compliments must be paid to the Minister for Finance and the Government on their innovative thinking in dealing with the public finances and making provision for the future. These three issues will impact greatly on the future. The national development plan is most welcome when taken in conjunction with the Objective One status for 13 counties, including my own. The west, north, Border areas and the midlands felt they had not received all the benefits which have been accruing in recent times. However, the decision to give Objective One status to these areas, thereby drawing down extra finance from Europe, was very important. Coupled with the national development plan it will bring prosperity to those regions which has not previously been seen.</P>
    <P>I disagree with those who say we are not investing in infrastructure. Major funding is being invested in road, rail and broad band services in the west, something which we welcome. This is <Col N="1280" /> not confined to communication as there is also funding being provided for the health services and many other areas. The Government is addressing the issues nationally, not sectionally. I believe the next six years will bring major prosperity and improvement to the livelihoods of those in the Objective One areas. In this context I think of national roads, including dual carriageways, and the gas grid which are so important to the future economic well-being of the country.</P>
    <P>I listen sometimes to the negative public comment on how the public finances are being handled, but we would be very foolish to think that as a country we could spend like drunken sailors as if there were no tomorrow. The Minister for Finance and the Government who would preside over such spending would be castigated and ridiculed in future years. The current Minister for Finance will be complimented on his legacy in handling the public finances, especially when the true benefits of the legislation on pension funds, which we passed this morning, and the national development plan are felt by the people.</P>
    <P>I know we will have a further opportunity to contribute when we discuss the Appropriation Bill early in the new year. For now I compliment the Minister of State on his comprehensive contribution this morning. He comes to the House on a very regular basis and obviously takes the business of the House seriously. He has always shown great respect and has been one of the finest contributors in the House. Today is no exception.</P>
    <P>I join my colleague, Senator Doyle, and the Minister of State in wishing everybody a happy Christmas and good luck and fortune in the new millennium.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish people a happy Christmas and the compliments of the season at the outset as it might sound a bit hypocritical at the end of my contribution.</P>
      <P>The Government ought to be embarrassed to bring this legislation before the House because of the shamefully low level of public expenditure. For example, the population of Northern Ireland is approximately one-third of this State, but the combined spending of the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive will be proportionally 50 per cent more than we will spend &ndash; it may be one-third more as it is difficult to compare the figures. However, it is undoubtedly true that the level of public expenditure in Northern Ireland is spectacularly higher than in this State, which is why the North has a better health service, schools which are better equipped and older people who are better off when they need institutional care. The one exception is the income of our elderly people and some of the allowances for fuel. Its public services are better than ours because it is prepared to spend money on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1281" /> It is time the Government stopped fighting the battles of the 1980s. We are not a country on the verge of financial crisis or without resources. There are so much resources available to the State the Government does not know what to do with them. We have the £4 billion fund, with which I do not disagree in principle, but the Government still does not know what it will do with it. It is being put into a temporary fund until it figures out what to do with it because ideological rigidity says that public expenditure is a bad thing.</P>
    <P>It is an unarguable fact that our railways are in a mess. They are under-funded, under-resourced, under-capitalised and dangerous. What will the Government do? The national plan states that it will buy 20 new carriages. The Government is resistant to public expenditure, about which it boasts. We are heading towards US levels of public expenditure which are completely out of line with the rest of civilised Europe.</P>
    <P>There are a number of small civilised countries in Europe, including the Netherlands, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Austria, each of which is prosperous in terms of private prosperity and the quality of its public services. One will not find homeless people sleeping in the doorways of the principal shopping street of Stockholm, for example.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>One will find them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps one homeless person. The Finnish Government decided some years ago to halve the numbers of homeless people living on its streets and it has done so. I read a letter recently from an Irish emigrant living in Finland who wanted to come home. Contrary to the Government's ideology, it was not the level of personal taxation which kept him in Finland but the appalling quality of services for his children, such as oversized classrooms, under-equipped and poorly maintained schools and a housing crisis which was foreseeable five, six or ten years ago. Once the Government decided in 1987 to stop building public housing and to force local authorities to sell off their land banks, the housing crisis was inevitable.</P>
      <P>We now have spectacular economic growth and a Government which is terrified of the prospect of using its resources. We need £500 million a year for a proper child care service for pre-school and school going children, like that in all the civilised countries of northern Europe. We need a proper programme of support for old people in their homes, not a Mickey Mouse home help service which pays £2.20 an hour. We need a proper service for handicapped people, but the Department of Finance announced this week we cannot afford it. This country is awash with money, yet it cannot afford to guarantee the minimum services needed for a dignified life for handicapped people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can afford it. It is only the ideology of the Department of Finance and the Government <Col N="1282" /> which says we cannot afford it. We can afford anything we have dreamed about. All that stands between us and a society of which we can all be proud is the ridiculous ideology of the Government which believes it is a good thing to have public expenditure trailing down towards 25 per cent of gross domestic product. That is wrong and obscene as it cements fundamental inequalities. The only way one can do it is by giving huge tax breaks to the already well off, such as me. My wife and I got a tax break from the Government which will enable us to pay for a continental holiday next year. I did not ask for it, I do not want it and I will not vote for the Government because of it. The alternative was either to run up an even more enormous surplus or to give money to those at the bottom of the heap who have been the victims of our society for so long. However, the Government has consistently decided not to do the latter.</P>
    <P>The fundamental reason the health service is in a mess is that we will not spend enough money on it. We have the lowest number of doctors per 1,000 of population in Europe. The reason our housing is in a mess is that we have the lowest number of houses per 1,000 of population in Europe. The reason our public transport system is in a mess is that we have the least subsidised public transport in western Europe, outside the almost equally primitive United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>We can choose to go one of two routes. The first is the American route, which deals with homelessness by turning the police on homeless people and hunting them off the streets. An attempt is made, as Mayor Giuliani has done, to take their children off them and to make it illegal for the providers of hostels to allow them to stay if they do not take a job. The second route is to recognise that people who are homeless are victims of an unfair and unequal society. One cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>Nobody has built a compassionate society on the levels of expenditure the Government is determined to pursue. This only canonises greed and rewards success, not effort, in our society. Some 200,000 people struggle to work for low wages and their efforts far exceed those of any Member of this House. They put up with the boredom and worthlessness of their job and the long hours for low wages. We have no interest in rewarding their efforts. It is an euphemism for saying we will reward those who are successful by reducing their taxes.</P>
    <P>This is a catalogue of missed opportunities. We should be witnessing a dramatic increase in the level of public expenditure in the State. My party believes the 4 per cent rule is gloriously out of date, utterly pointless and is doing an enormous amount of damage to social cohesion, to the possibility of partnership and to the lives of large numbers of people.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister of State to explain how the Department of Finance decided we could not afford to make legal obligatory provision for the handicapped in our society. How dare it say that. <Col N="1283" /> Did it ask the people if we could afford it? Did it come before the Houses of the Oireachtas and ask for their opinion on this matter? It did not. The Department of Finance, with the approval of the Minister, said we could not afford it because it does not believe in public expenditure. I heard an official of that Department say at a committee meeting that it is always good to reduce taxes.</P>
    <P>I saw in the budgetary provisions that the Department of Finance is back to its old trick of classifying education as social expenditure. Investment in education is productive investment, not social expenditure. The trouble is that if education is taken out, there would be a ridiculously low level of social expenditure. This country has benefited spectacularly from every penny we have spent on education. It is perhaps the most productive investment. It is a distortion of reality for the Department of Finance to continue to classify it as social expenditure.</P>
    <P>We have more money than we could have dreamed about. The Government can make <i>post facto</i> adjustments to the budget which are greater than what was usually the sum of the entire budgetary changes. When it has a problem, it can give £125 million here and £125 million there. It can in the process break the rule about the budget which has been sacrosanct in this State since its foundation &ndash; that budgetary announcements are made to the Oireachtas. This Government makes them to a meeting of the parliamentary party instead.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has more money than he could have dreamed of, money which could have guaranteed that not a single house in this State would be without running water or an indoor bathroom, that there would be no schools without such facilities. It could guarantee that the children of low to middle income families, who desperately want to go on to third level education, had proper grants. The Government refuses to make the money necessary for those guarantees available. I do not want to hear about increases of 5 per cent or 10 per cent. The truth is that no student from a poor background can live on the grant this State pays. We could pay them but we will not because we do not approve of supporting students. Civilised countries in the European Union and elsewhere believe in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the official figures, we have now approximately the same <i>per capita </i>GDP as Sweden and Finland. Even when the transfer of resources is removed, we are still at 90 <Col N="1284" /> per cent of their levels of<i> per capita</i> GDP. This is a rich country full of poor people, poor services and poor roads, which is ruled by a poor Government. It is so ideologically obsessed with reducing public expenditure and taxes for those who did not even ask to have their taxes reduced and with not giving money to the undeserving poor that we are left in a mess. We are in such a mess that considerable social strain is starting to appear. The number of people who are homeless has risen spectacularly. There are now three times as many homeless people than there were five years ago in this city. People are lying on hospital beds in casualty wards for a week at a time. We have the smallest number of doctors per thousand of population in all of civilised Europe. We boast about that in our programme for the European Union. We go to our betters in European Union and brag about the pain we are inflicting on our own people just to prove that we are financially correct.</P>
      <P>This issue must be dealt with in a realistic fashion, not by replying that Senator Ryan wants the Government to go on a spending spree. I do not want that. I know, however, what defines civilised society and this Government is determined that we will not become such a society. It is determined that we will be like the United States, riven by greed, inequality and hostility from one group to another. There is no country in the western world which has achieved social cohesion at the levels of public expenditure this Government is determined to maintain. The one figure quoted is Switzerland and that country has a wonderful solution &ndash; it deals with its problems with the number of migrants it allows to stay or forces to leave. Outside Switzerland no country in the civilised world has managed to look after its people at the levels of public expenditure this Government is determined to pursue.</P>
      <P>The perpetual incantation about public sector pay would be better served if there was an intelligent breakdown of the cost increases caused by larger numbers, incremental pay increases and by global pay increases. I am fascinated that every time my Dáil colleagues ask for that information, the Department of Finance says it is not possible to give that sort of breakdown. If a Government decides to increase the number of people working in the public sector, and it should, public sector pay bills will rise. This may have come as a surprise the Government, because it writes speeches about it as if it was, but when people are employed they have to be paid and, therefore, there is a bigger public sector pay bill.</P>
      <P>If there is a clear out of public sector workers, as there was in the late 1980s, those who stay on because they had not been the job long form a greater proportion of the work force and they will be on incremental salaries for a considerable number of years. The wages bill, therefore, increases as they move up the incremental scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be problems with some areas of the public sector. I was not enamoured of the gardaí refusing to operate a computer system which <Col N="1285" /> would make their jobs easier. The Minister and the Government should be careful, however, to avoid waving big sticks over issues about which they are singularly uninformed.</P>
    <P>The area of the public sector in which I work would not function if it had waited for Government leadership on the profound changes which have taken place. Every person in third level education taught himself or herself about information technology and drove the demand for access to that technology. The Internet evolved from the efforts of the public sector in the United States and then through the European Nuclear Research Centre in Switzerland. If there are groups in the public sector which resist modern technology, the Government should deal with those groups but it should lay off the vast majority of teachers who have grasped every opportunity and whose major frustration has been the refusal of Government to provide the funds and training to make the best possible use of IT.</P>
    <P>If the Minister was to read any teachers' journal he would see the problems they have getting access to a photocopier. The Government should cringe with embarrassment that every primary school in the State does not have photocopier and the budget to run it. It should think of the unthinkable &ndash; that every primary school in the State should have a scanner, which would cost £250, and a good colour printer for another £250.</P>
    <P>The Government should not come in here and say the problem is caused by inflexibility on the part of public sector employees. The problem is caused by the inflexible Department of Finance which refuses to spend the money to give people in the public sector the resources which will enable them to do the things they want. It is a classic tactic to pick a soft target, talk about it in general terms and not deal with the specifics.</P>
    <P>Where are the public servants who have refused to change? This House and every other Government is awash with modern technology. The third level education is as awash as it can be under State provision with similar technology and uses it constructively. It was way ahead of any Department in identifying areas of need. There are many skilled graduates in the State because the third level sector told the State it was necessary to train people, not because a wonderful, forward looking Government identified the problems. State agencies catch up after a few years on what is happening in education and then claim credit for it. Despite what is said about it, we have an excellent primary and secondary education system run by people who are among the best paid teachers in Europe. People who believe in the market economy, as the Government does with ideological zeal, wonder why if we have good teachers we have a good education system. We get good teachers because we pay them properly. It also means that teaching has a status in society that has been lost in other countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> Again in pursuit of its ideological zeal, the Government is determined to end that. It wants to introduce something called performance related pay. If it believes in this it could start in Leinster House. How will it pay the Members of the Oireachtas who all get the same salary whether they are here for one year or 40? The Government should start a debate on this issue with Members of this and the other House. People will answer back and the Government knows what they will say. In many cases it is impossible to quantify.</P>
    <P>I increasingly realise that the Government does not live in the real world but one at which it looks through ideological glasses. Everybody in the public service is on a form of performance related pay because they are not guaranteed their increments. People in the public sector have been refused an increment for under-performance.</P>
    <P>What does the Government want? For example, does it want to pay me for my work in the Cork Institute of Technology on the basis of the numbers who pass examinations? If I wanted to I could guarantee that everybody would pass and no external examiner or other body would be able to work out what I was doing. I could also fail half of the candidates. In many areas one is ultimately dependent on the professional integrity of people. If the Government tries to force them into an artificial concept of performance related pay it will mean that everybody will do what is needed to achieve the performance related targets because they will be devised by people who do not know what they are about.</P>
    <P>I have no problems in dealing with people in the public sector or elsewhere who do not do their job. That is not an issue and it never has been. Perhaps the procedures are long winded, but it must be repeated that the driving force for much of this nonsense is the Department of Finance, all of whose members have a security of employment which they apparently wish they could take from others.</P>
    <P>Let us deal with the issue. For example, if teachers or others are not performing let us address that problem. However, it must be asked what is meant by performance related pay and how is performance measured? How is it possible to measure the performance of a child care worker dealing with profoundly handicapped children? How is the performance of a teacher who chooses to work in a school where all the children come from appalling backgrounds to be compared with the performance of a teacher who chooses to work in a school where every child comes from very privileged backgrounds, as is the case with my children, and whose parents have the time, money and inclination to support their education? How is this measured in a sensible way which does not devalue the work of those who deal with the worst off? I have not heard about it.</P>
    <P>My so-called socialist comrades in Britain are engaged in the idiotic nonsense of measuring it by examination results. The achievement of a <Col N="1287" /> school is measured by what it does with the intake it gets, which means that to proceed on that basis the quality of the intake to a primary school must be measured. I would like to see the Department of Education and Science being given the funds to undertake a proper evaluation of the stage of development of every child in junior infants and then measure their progress through each year according to a proper scientific evaluation and not by the use of cheap tests. If we did that we might have the framework in which to talk about performance related pay.</P>
    <P>Does somebody who achieves a 5 per cent improvement in the performance of a child who is intellectually handicapped rate better than somebody who achieves a 15 per cent improvement in a child who is both mentally capable and also comes from the same kind of background as my children? It cannot be done and if it is attempted it will mean becoming involved in all kinds of odd nonsense &ndash; I use the phrase advisedly &ndash; the purpose of which is to force a break in some of the relativities, some of which are out of date.</P>
    <P>Somebody picked up the phrase &ldquo;performance related pay&rdquo;. I do not know if it was from the airwaves, the Internet or <i>The Sunday Telegraph.</i> It allegedly works in the private sector. Every blockie on every building site in the country gets approximately the same rate of pay because they look after each other. Similarly, every builder's labourer working on every unionised construction site gets the same pay. Virtually everybody working in the restaurants from here to Grafton Street and who has been working for the same period of time get the same pay.</P>
    <P>I have the good fortune to understand the private sector, unlike a considerable part of the Government which claims to believe in it. It is not the jungle some people refer to. It is often based on loyalty, personal relationships and trust, where people do not abuse each other, do not tell people they are doing 20 per cent better than the next and then ask them not to mention it. IBM attempted that and the organisation almost collapsed. It created a conspiratorial atmosphere where no two people in the organisation were allowed to tell each other how much they were paid.</P>
    <P>If the Government wants this state of affairs in the public sector, in areas of public provision such as hospitals and schools, so be it, but it will not succeed. Like most civilised countries we are fortunate to have a strong trade union movement. Furthermore, when the public sees what is to be recognised as performance, it will reject the concept because it knows that however we reform the public service and make it more efficient, we will not do it by creating conditions where people are forced to compete with each other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all who contributed to the debate and I will do my best to respond to the <Col N="1288" /> points raised, especially by Senator Ryan. Senator Joe Doyle expressed concern about inflation and his analysis of the issue is correct. It is an important factor within the economy and in terms of the Government's fiscal policy we are mindful to ensure that the levels of inflation, which have been low and below the European average, will be maintained in the years ahead because it is one of the pillars underpinning competitiveness in the economy.</P>
      <P>Nobody in the Seanad or the Dáil should seek to misrepresent or misunderstand why the economy is in its present position and why there has been such an enormous fall in unemployment and growth in employment. This has arisen because the competitiveness in the economy on an international basis has been central to growth. That growth and the contribution by the increased numbers at work is allowing us to do many of the things we could only dream of years ago.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan is a man of some intellect, yet his rhetoric is in a time warp. He seems to be locked in the 1970s and 1980s and appears to have lost the capacity to recognise the Ireland of today. I will address some of his points. Unfortunately he has left the House, which is disappointing.</P>
      <P>Senator Joe Doyle referred to the housing crisis which has been arrested. Over the past few years the growth in the cost of housing, especially in Dublin, has concerned all in the political domain and in the public and private sectors. The implementation of many of the Bacon report recommendations is taking effect. We always knew it would take two years for this to happen. The root of the problem was the relationship between supply and demand. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government intervened as best he could in the marketplace to make land available and this has had an enormous effect in different parts of the country. Land has been released and money has been provided to service it. Supply is now beginning to meet the demand and this is reflected in the slowing down of the increase in the cost of housing. This is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senator for his kind remarks about the desk and pocket diary produced by my Department. I hope Senators and Deputies will enjoy it as a special millennium piece. We have sold about 20,000 copies, which is extraordinary and I commend the officials in my Department who came up with this idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Finneran was correct when he spoke of employment black spots. We can talk about unemployment falling to 5.1 per cent but the figure is higher in some areas. In Dublin and in major centres such as Cork, Limerick, Galway and my own city of Waterford there are areas suffering from high levels of unemployment which need particular measures to address the problem. While we can see this problem in large urban areas, it would be a mistake to think that such circumstances do not exist in rural Ireland too. The Government's approach in addressing this problem in recent budgets is having its effect. I <Col N="1289" /> do not accept that only part of the population is benefitting from our economic success. There is real benefit right across the board and this is something we should be proud of.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan ignored the publication of the national development plan which is an unprecedented spending package for the next six or seven years and is in addition to normal Government spending. I reject what Senator Ryan says about social inclusion. The Government, as all recent Governments, has put social inclusion at the centre of Government policy. Each Department is required to be conscious, when formulating policies, of their effect on social inclusion or exclusion and to discriminate positively in favour of social inclusion. We do not wish to see society further divided as a result of the economic boom.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran was correct in identifying the fiscal prudence that has been exercised in recent years. How can anyone suggest that it was not fiscal prudence which allowed us to create an enterprising society? We are able to give people a role in society and pride in themselves by getting them back to work. What better way to solve most of society's social ills than by giving people the opportunity to earn an income and make independent decisions for themselves.</P>
    <P>Social partnership has been a crucial element in the development of the economy. We have had four very successful partnership agreements and the next is being negotiated. The conclusion of a successful agreement for the years ahead is vitally important for the well-being of all who live in this society. Over the coming weeks, the various elements of social partnership must find a solution that is fair and reflects across the spectrum the fruits of our economic growth, but in a way which protects that growth and ensures that it continues.</P>
    <P>I reject much that Senator Ryan has said. He spoke about Northern Ireland. This is a wonderful time for Northern Ireland but what would its people not give to have an economy such as we have today? To suggest that extra-high spending in Northern Ireland is more beneficial to the people there and that we are lagging behind is not true. Senator Ryan did not mention the high levels of unemployment, social deprivation and the legacy of 30 years of serious troubles. Government spending in Northern Ireland is higher in some areas for the obvious reasons on which Senator Ryan did not reflect. He suggested that public services in Northern Ireland are better than here. I completely reject that. We have one of the finest health services. We should remind ourselves that in 1994 the level of spending on health was £2,100 million, then a substantial sum of money. Today that spending is £4,200 million, a 100 per cent increase in five years. Has Senator Ryan been living in some other country for the past few years, failing to recognise what has been happening in Ireland?</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan says we do not know how to spend our extra money, although he made no ref<Col N="1290" /> erence to the visionary provision the Government has made for the funding of pensions in the future. The measure provides for the use of substantial moneys for public sector and social welfare pensions and ensures that we do not overburden future generations when the demography of the country changes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not mention where the money came from either, or how we got so rich.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true. How ironic that the two economies he selected for criticism, the US and Ireland, are probably the two most successful economies in the world today. They are both successful in driving down unemployment and raising employment. What better way for a society to involve everyone in the fruits of its success than by being able to offer productive work. Senaor Ryan's was an extraordinary dissertation.</P>
      <P>We have addressed child care and related issues in recent budgets. I accept that our changing economic circumstances have made this a central and important issue. The Minister for Finance introduced a magnificent and extraordinarily visionary budget some weeks ago. On the night of the Budget Statement I had the privilege of listening to the budget debate in the Seanad. Since I became a Member of the Oireachtas in the mid-1980s we have faced every year the problem of the anti-work ethos created by our taxation system. The pro-work quantum leap taken by the Minister for Finance in this year's budget could not have been dreamt possible, even three years ago.</P>
      <P>It is right to reflect on the fact that certain issues remain to be addressed but we have become impatient and it is time we regained some patience. One budget cannot be the answer to all our problems and the Minister for Finance did not suggest that it could. We cannot achieve all we want in one moment and we have not solved all our problems in one moment. It takes 100 years to grow a forest but it can be burnt down in one day. That applies to the Irish economy. As a society, therefore, we must be patient. We should remark and reflect on what has been achieved and protect that growth into the years ahead, not for ourselves but for future generations.</P>
      <P>Prudence in fiscal policy is an essential ingredient in that regard, coupled with the imaginative and far seeing policies introduced by the Minister in this budget. If there was doubt in the minds of the public, that has been addressed and more will be done over the next two budgets to be introduced by this Government. However, we must be patient about achieving everything overnight. That cannot be done but we must support something that is an imaginative and extraordinary reward to the enterprise that exists in the Irish economy. It will stand the test of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised to hear from Senator Ryan that the 4 per cent ceiling being maintained by the <Col N="1291" /> Government is now no longer Labour Party policy. The policy now appears to be spend, spend, spend and the old rhetoric of the 1970s and 1980s appears to be creeping back to the top of the agenda. I am not aware that the Leader of the Labour Party subscribes to the new policy espoused by Senator Ryan that we should abandon fiscal prudence and forget about jobs. He also appeared to suggest that the growth in job creation is unnecessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is nonsense. Growth in employment and in business is what the economy is about.</P>
      <P>Another extraordinary comment was his assertion, in the context of education, that education is only productive and has nothing to do with the social economy. That is one of the most extraordinarily nonsensical assertions I have heard in public life. It is so far from reality I must wonder where it originated, particularly given that the Senator is involved in the education system.</P>
      <P>The gift of education and the investment in education, which was maintained even in bad economic times, was the single greatest contribution to including people in society. The reason the Irish economy is so successful is that its young people have the highest level of education in the western world. The social benefit to the economy and to our society from the investment in education is so obvious and is so well recognised throughout the world that no further comment is required to knock the Senator's assertion on the head.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I got a little excited about the Senator's contribution but his remarks demanded a response. He also spoke about Scandinavia. I know a good deal about Scandinavia as I am married to a Dane and have been visiting the area for the last 20 years. Scandinavia is bursting at the seams as a result of their burdensome social economy. It is simply not working because they got the balance wrong and the Scandinavians will admit that. The Senator made no mention of the huge local government tax structure that exists there and in most of Europe to support these things. If we wish to go down that road, that choice is available. I am often amazed when I visit these countries with political colleagues to hear them marvel at the fantastic facilities at local level. There are extraordinarily high levels of local taxation in these countries. I am not saying there is anything wrong with that but if we wish to examine these issues, certain choices must be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to introduce this Bill and with the complimentary responses of various Senators. We are on the right track. We are mindful of the future, of the global economy in which we work, <Col N="1292" /> our involvement in the European Union and our involvement in the euro. We are intent on ensuring that should any shocks occur in the European or global economy we will have the capacity to absorb them as a result of the prudent fiscal policies that have been maintained by successive Governments. Those policies will be maintained by this Government and will lead to continued growth and a continued reduction in unemployment to unprecedented levels. Every household will be involved, something we never had before, in making a positive contribution to the continued growth of this economy.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill sets out to create a new framework for inland fisheries. Our inland fisheries resource is a precious national asset in its own right and in terms of the social and economic benefits it brings to local communities and to the country as a whole. The inclusive management, conservation and development of the resource to the highest standards is my overall policy objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a forward-looking agenda for change reflecting the interests and responsibilities of all concerned. It is a carefully balanced package designed to empower all concerned at local and regional level. It will deliver on the accepted need for new directions in the management, organisation and service delivery of the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards. The new framework for the boards and the co-operative societies, combined with the establishment of the National Salmon Management Commission, is the most significant initiative for the inland fisheries sector <Col N="1293" /> for 20 years. The reform of the structures reflects the process of change in the public service and local government. It also reflects the evolution in thinking in recent years about inland fisheries development and conservation, and recognises the importance of environment, regional development, tourism, heritage and biodiversity.</P>
    <P>The framework will devolve responsibility to local level through the regional fisheries boards, the co-operatives and clubs. It underpins the vital contribution of all local fisheries interests to the development of the resource. The philosophy underlying my approach, therefore, is firmly based on the principles of devolution, subsidiarity, partnership and quality service delivery.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline for the Seanad the substantive provisions of the Bill and the thinking which underlies my proposals for change. The Bill provides for clarified and enhanced functions for the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards. The need to re-define and clarify those roles has been obvious for many years. It is first and foremost in the interests of the boards, their committed staff, and all who have a stake in inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>The Central Fisheries Board will have a pivotal national role in policy advice, strategic planning and development and in providing specialist co-ordination and support services for the regional boards. It will have explicit responsibility for the co-ordination and delivery of multi-annual strategic plans, the overall supervision of EU and other funding schemes, and in co-operation with Bord Fáilte, the delivery of overseas marketing and promotion strategies for tourism angling. The central board will, therefore, deliver on the national policy dimension of inland fisheries. It will also ensure delivery of crosscutting services to ensure optimum resource deployment, accountability and corporate governance. The central and regional boards collectively employ over 400 people and are funded largely by the Exchequer and EU to the tune of over £16 million per annum.</P>
    <P>I have also secured in the national development plan £24 million for the development of inland fisheries for tourism and also for recreational purposes. This is a significant funding envelope for the period of the plan. The involvement of the regional boards, angling clubs and co-ops in the planning and expenditure of this funding will be critical to its success. The Bill provides for that. New standards of service delivery, reporting and accountability in line with modern public service norms are also provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The functions and roles of the regional fisheries boards are significantly enhanced in the Bill. The boards will have front-line responsibility for management, conservation, protection and development of inland fisheries and angling in their regions. They will have a new pivotal role in leading a voluntary process of inland fisheries catchment management with angling clubs and other interests. This reflects new thinking about the integrated nature of fisheries with the environment and local activity generally. I will expand <Col N="1294" /> further on this point later. The boards will also have explicit responsibilities for sustainable development, biodiversity and heritage, which again reflects the evolution of thinking at national and international level. The boards will work together in a new form of regional co-operation and shared responsibility. This reflects the essential shared nature of the resource.</P>
    <P>I am providing for a new role for the regional boards in the acquisition and management of State fisheries subject at all times to ministerial approval. Senators will recall that earlier this year I oversaw the transfer of the Moy fishery to the North-Western Regional Fisheries Board. This was the first practical step towards the new model of subsidiarity which will ensure management of our valuable State fisheries assets is undertaken by those best placed to manage and develop them. I include the long established network of salmon, trout and coarse angling clubs in that context.</P>
    <P>Overall my proposals deliver the correct balance between national and regional priorities. The Bill will empower the regional boards, their executives and local fisheries interests with exciting new remits which reflect the latest thinking on sustainability, responsive and answerable to local priorities and needs.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for revised composition of the regional boards to achieve a more appropriate balance of fisheries and other relevant interests. My proposals on membership were designed to underpin the new functions and reinforce the links with other local stakeholders. They are also designed to maintain the local democratic nature of the boards. My proposals therefore continue the system whereby local fisheries interests elect representatives to the boards in addition to appointment of agriculture, tourism, aquaculture and other relevant interests.</P>
    <P>Since I published the Bill on 5 November there has been a generally positive response to the strategic concept, including the clarified functions and roles of the regional boards. There is general agreement that the direction is broadly the right one. As public debate on the Bill developed it became clear that there were six key areas which gave rise to particular concerns &ndash; the levels of elected fisheries representation on the boards; the balance and mix of ministerial appointments to the boards; the place of angling organisations within the new framework; the future of the fisheries co-operative societies; the mechanisms for consultation on the introduction of salmon tagging and the concept of inland fisheries catchment management.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks I have met and received submissions from all the angling organisations, commercial fishing interests, central and regional boards and other interests. This consultative phase has been very productive. All the various interests clearly set out their views on changes which they wished to see. There has been close liaison with all the groups in working to reach <Col N="1295" /> agreement on a number of key improvements to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been amended in a number of respects. It now maintains existing levels of representation for salmon, trout and coarse anglers and life members of the Inland Fisheries Trust on the regional boards. It will also maintain the current level of representation for commercial salmon interests. This will ensure the necessary fisheries focus at regional board level.</P>
    <P>The chairpersons of the regional boards will continue to be elected by all board members. This in line with the clearly expressed preference of the majority of those concerned. The Bill now provides for the prescribing of organisations representing agriculture, aquaculture, the environment, regional tourism, the natural heritage and regional/local development. These organisations will nominate members for appointment.</P>
    <P>I have inserted a provision which uniquely recognises and copperfastens in statute the particular role and contribution of angling clubs and associations in inland fisheries development. The Bill also provides for an enhanced public consultative process on any scheme for salmon tagging which the National Salmon Management Commission might recommend.</P>
    <P>The existing arrangements for the fisheries co-operatives whereby trout and coarse angling share certificate holders elect five members to their committees are being retained. There will be one nominated regional board staff member and one ministerial nominee to the co-operative committees. Making share certificates compulsory will remain an option for co-operatives to decide on themselves.</P>
    <P>The provision in relation to catchment management has been amended to clarify comprehensively and ensure confidence in what is intended. The lead role of the regional boards in encouraging catchment management plans with local fisheries interests has been made explicit. The provision also spells out clearly that catchment management is a voluntary and incremental process which must take account of specific and unique factors or circumstances pertaining in each catchment area.</P>
    <P>Catchment management has stimulated a great deal of discussion and debate in the last two weeks. Much of the debate has been positive but concerns have been expressed by some angling groups. The Bill sets out to facilitate a catchment management process where and when it is agreed to be potentially beneficial. Catchment management is a simple practical concept. It brings together all the local stakeholders to work in partnership, overcome problems and improve the resource. Catchment management is still at an embryonic stage, although well developed abroad. I have made it clear that catchment management in the Irish context must take account of the highly complex factors which have traditionally characterised our inland fisheries ownership management and access. The difficulties which <Col N="1296" /> have arisen in the Killarney pilot project exemplify the need for an open, patient and facilitating approach to developing a range of future options. This will be the approach across the board.</P>
    <P>These readily agreed changes to the Bill will deliver confidence and certainty about the overall directions. This is a framework for positive change and empowerment all the way around. Everyone agreed on the need for new directions. The Bill delivers those new and positive directions to the benefit of all.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a modern rebalanced structure for the Central Fisheries Board reflecting its national role and the norms on State boards. A direct link with the regional boards will be maintained through the nominations of a chairperson and a chief executive of a regional board. Two members will be nominated by the Ministers for the Environment and Local Government and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. This reflects the links between fisheries, the environment and heritage and biodiversity. Three ministerial nominees with relevant professional or business expertise will contribute a new focus to the board's work. Central board staff will nominate a board member also. The board membership is designed to position the board and its executive to deliver on its core mandates of policy planning and advice and specialist services.</P>
    <P>The trout and coarse fish co-operative societies review group report made wide ranging recommendations for change. It is now clear that a majority would prefer to continue the existing structures. I am happy to respect their view. The funding and accounting mechanism will channel matching Exchequer funding for co-operative projects through the regional boards. This will facilitate better administration and accountability. It will also help to integrate the co-operatives more closely with the mainstream of regional fisheries development.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of the National Salmon Management Commission in line with the recommendations of the task force. The commission will advise on salmon management policy and strategies and will take forward the detailed work on the salmon tagging scheme. The commission will have 16 members nominated by the relevant organisations and four other nominees. The angling organisations have already sent in their nominations for the commission and I will shortly confirm nominations from the commercial salmon netting interests. The commission will ensure consensus on future national salmon strategies. This new consultative and advisory forum will directly complement the work of the central and regional fisheries boards as well as the Marine Institute.</P>
    <P>Section 29 provides for waiving of the payment by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara of interest unpaid, including interest on interest unpaid, under sections 20 and 21 of the Sea Fisheries Act, 1952. These technical provisions will enable interest charges payable by BIM as a result of bad debts <Col N="1297" /> associated with loans to fishermen in the past to be waived, thus addressing the long standing imbalance on the balance sheet of BIM. The oil crises of the late 1970s and early 1980s and high interest rates caused severe financial difficulties for fishing vessel owners. Many found themselves unable to make repayments on BIM loans. In certain cases loans were deemed irrecoverable. While the level of irrecoverable debt was revised substantially upwards in the late 1980s, the necessary waivers were not provided in order to balance BIM's debt position. The BIM balance sheet at 31 October 1999 shows a large technical imbalance between repayments due to the Exchequer on advances made to BIM and the value of loans due to BIM by fishermen. The sum of £13.6 million is technically due by BIM to the Exchequer, while the value of loans is just £3.9 million. This leaves an imbalance of £9.7 million. Finance sanction was granted last month to waive the repayment of advances amounting to £9.7 million.</P>
    <P>Existing legislation can only be used to waive the repayment of future interest and does not provide for the waiver of interest arrears. Approximately £4 million in interest arrears is now due by BIM. As interest is charged on interest arrears, the latter will continue to accumulate substantially unless action is taken. This provision will clear these interest arrears once and for all.</P>
    <P>Section 30 amends the Marine Institute Act, 1991, to extend the institute's functions to include matters relating to shipping and shipping services. I am also establishing, within the Marine Institute, the Irish Maritime Development Office as a development and promotional agency for the Irish shipping and services sector. Locating the office initially within the Marine Institute is a highly cost effective option, as well as providing major strategic opportunities for both organisations.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a dedicated development agency for the promotion and development of our shipping industry and onshore shipping services sector, is a milestone for the industry. With 95 per cent of our trade carried by sea, there are real opportunities to develop the Irish fleet, consolidate and develop employment at sea and onshore, attract ships to the Irish Ship Register and improve the shipping services sector.</P>
    <P>It is forecast that there will be a major growth in world shipping over the next 15 years. Seaborne trade is set to expand exponentially. Much of the world's shipping tonnage is due to be replaced over the next ten to 15 years. Corresponding increases in related services are also predicted.</P>
    <P>Ireland is well positioned to take advantage of these trends. These opportunities include acquisition and operation of additional tonnage, and financing new and second-hand ships, building on the proven success of the Irish Financial Services Centre.</P>
    <P>The remit of the office will be to promote and assist the development of Irish shipping and Irish <Col N="1298" /> shipping services, in conformity with the EU guidelines on State aid for maritime transport, to promote Ireland as a centre for ship registration, to develop and implement a strategic framework for the shipping industry and its ancillary services sector, and to liaise with and support the industry, and advise on policy initiatives and the overhaul of the legislative and fiscal framework for merchant shipping so as to underpin development and generate employment.</P>
    <P>There will be full consultation with the shipping and shipping services industry in the formulation and implementation of the development plans. I am setting up an advisory group to the IMDO and I will shortly appoint its chairman and members, including representatives from the shipping and shipping services sector and the IDA.</P>
    <P>I want the IMDO to be fully operational by the millennium. I will work closely with the Marine Institute to deliver jobs and create a new confidence within the shipping industry to encourage investment and innovation.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been further amended to underline, for the avoidance of doubt, that seafarer training may be one of the policy matters for implementation by the IMDO. This is a necessary adjunct to the IMDO's remit, given the critical importance of seafarer training in shipping development and the upcoming development of a new national maritime college.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the Seanad and look forward to hearing the views of the Senators. I wish to request that a clerk's correction be made to the Bill as passed by Dáil Éireann. Section 2 of the Bill deals with interpretation and provides that the &ldquo;Act of 1980&rdquo; means Fisheries Act, 1980. Unfortunately, an error has occurred in the Long Title of the Bill whereby the Act in question is referred to as the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1980. In view of the urgency of this legislation I wish to request the Chathaoirelach to direct the Clerk of the Seanad under Standing Order 121 to make the necessary corrections to the Irish and English Long Title of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I also welcome this Bill. Unfortunately, it has arrived very quickly, having just left the Dáil. Because the Bill has been introduced here immediately a technical misprint such as the Minister has referred to is inevitable. This Bill's passage through the Dáil has been extremely helpful to the parties directly affected. When the Bill was first published many people were unhappy with it. It was disappointing that the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources had not engaged in more detailed consultation or had not at least heeded the views of various organisations and groups until the last minute. The Minister met the parties concerned for two hours the morning before the Bill was taken in the Dáil and ironed out many of the difficulties that surfaced with regard to various aspects of it. The Department's officials should remember that matters concerning their Department can cause a lot of difficulties and aggravation and that it is not wise to play puck with fishermen at any stage. It is wiser to listen and respond positively. I am delighted that the Minister has seen the wisdom of taking that line during the course of the debate in the Lower House and has made amendment accordingly to the Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill is important because fisheries, including lakes and rivers, have always been an important factor in Irish life, both within local communities and in more recent years as a source of economic development, particularly in the tourism sector. For that reason it is important that a proper structure and accountability is put in place with regard to the various bodies concerned.</P>
      <P>The fisheries boards were established in 1980 within the ambit of the Central Fisheries Board. The reality is that the Central Fisheries Board never stood for or did a lot. Only one or two reports emanated from it over intervening years despite legislation recommending that it should report every five years.</P>
      <P>The need to devolve power to the local regions is extremely important. Involvement of local people and people who have a direct interest can only work to the best advantage in the long run. I hope the structures that the Minister has put in place in this Bill will work to the mutual benefit of all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers of the Central Fisheries Board have been diluted as a result of this Bill. That is no harm. I note that it is accountable, to a degree, to the Department of the Marine and Natural <Col N="1300" /> Resources and to the Minister. It can advise the Minister on policy relating to the conservation, protection, management, development and improvement of inland fisheries and the efficient and effective performance by the regional boards of their functions. Definition of the functions of the regional boards needs to be clear. There has been a looseness and a lack of accountability over the years. I hope a more vigilant approach and closer interaction will take place between the Department, the Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries board.</P>
    <P>If we compare the regional fisheries board and the Central Fisheries Board to health boards the level of interaction is not comparable. That is the reality. They just get on with their business and not many people know about them or what they do. Hopefully, that will change. I am delighted the Minister saw fit to amend the Bill to take into account the specifics relating to the representatives elected to the boards. Maintaining the existing levels of representation for the salmon, trout and coarse anglers is extremely important. These people know their own region, they know exactly what is happening and appreciate the value of fishing locally. Their understanding can assist the administrators and bureaucrats and, working hand in hand can, both parties can work efficiently to expand and improve the inland fisheries across the country.</P>
    <P>There have been difficulties. The economic take from inland fishing tourism has declined in recent years due to a number of factors. One is that there has been much pollution, particularly in some of the lakes. Coarse angling and trout angling on some of our rivers and lakes has diminished quite dramatically. In many cases tourists have not come in recent years to rivers and lakes traditionally fished by nationals and non-nationals alike because the level of fish stock has declined so considerably.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that while there will be involvement from the Departments of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the Environment and Local Government, there will be no representative from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. This Department has a huge input to make in how inland waters will be maintained. It is vital that it should be closely involved. I ask the Minister to examine the involvement of a representative from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on the boards because many of the present difficulties arise from the agriculture sector.</P>
    <P>They also arise from sectors relevant to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Many small towns and villages have no proper sewage treatment systems, no tertiary treatment plants and pollution is caused directly by local authorities. That matter is being addressed by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and much work was done in recent years, but there is still a long way to go.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1301" /> A lot of work has been done on Lough Derg, for instance, and the water quality has improved. The House debated a report in that regard recently. This matter also concerns Bord na Móna, which is not mentioned in the Bill, yet it is a major contributor according to various reports on pollution in Lough Derg.</P>
    <P>These public bodies need to be closely involved because if there is to be development in the rivers and lakes, we must ensure that there is high water quality which is conducive to the life of fish stocks. It is as simple as that. If that is not achieved then we will go nowhere.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the decline in angling tourism in economic terms over recent years. I am quite familiar with a number of local communities where there was a good tourism sector years ago but where there is now no angling tourism. This is very unsatisfactory. The parties concerned need to be very vigilant to ensure that the tourism continues.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Minister has stepped back from the position of appointing the chairpersons to the regional boards. Democracy should always take precedence over diktat and in this instance the Minister has wisely seen the need for local democracy and for the local members of the regional boards to elect the chairmen. I commend him on that decision. In this case the Minister left it to the last minute, but at least he responded positively after consultation and he must be commended for that.</P>
    <P>In referring to prescribing organisations, the Minister is obviously talking about agricultural organisations. I presume he means ICMSA or IFA or representatives from these organisations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Teagasc is included. It is good to have it involved and, indirectly, one comes close to have departmental involvement by having Teagasc advisers involved. That is commendable. I had great concerns about that matter.</P>
      <P>On the provision for the angling clubs, the Minister recognises the unique contribution they make to angling and inland fisheries. Their contribution cannot be underestimated because many of these club members work on the rivers and in various hatcheries and spawning grounds, doing all the necessary work, which nobody ever hears about but which can take hours of their time. Angling clubs often spend weekends and even Christmas holidays looking after spawning grounds. This work is not always recognised. One cannot put a cash value on it, yet it is vital to the development of inland fisheries. Over the years these associations have done wonderful work and made a wonderful contribution to their own clubs, to the wider community and to the national economy. It is important they get full and due recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also hope that in the course of these clubs communicating with the Minister's Department <Col N="1302" /> they will meet a less bureaucratic response and approach than they do on some occasions. There should be a recognition of what is involved by the people concerned and that when these people, who are acting on a voluntary basis, contact the Department they should be received in a way that is not too formalised. I am aware of a number of instances when there has been a very formal bureaucratic response. That does not work in these circumstances and I appeal to the Minister to ensure a more understanding and co-operative approach is adopted by his Department. I will not go into the specifics now but I will give the Minister details later.</P>
    <P>The enhanced consultative process relating to the salmon tagging is very welcome and has been discussed for quite a long time. Hopefully, the recommendations will be made shortly by the salmon commission.</P>
    <P>Share certificate holders will be allowed to elect five members to the committees. This is very welcome. I am delighted that the Minister has seen the wisdom in allowing the share certificate position to remain an option rather than make it compulsory. There was a long history of compulsion in this area which did not go down well and was not successful in he past. The Minister has seen the wisdom of the non-compulsory approach.</P>
    <P>Overall the details of the Bill are welcome. We must not underestimate the importance of co-operatives and it is important that the existing structures relating to fisheries, particularly trout and coarse fishing co-operatives, remain in place. It is extremely important.</P>
    <P>Section 30 of the Bill amends the Marine Institute Act, 1991, and gives it an additional power or responsibility with regard to shipping and shipping services. This is a very wise move and I am delighted the Minister has taken this initiative. Shipping has been left to various harbour authorities in the past and has been in no man's land. Giving specific responsibility to the Marine Institute is very wise. I hope the Marine Institute will adopt a proactive approach in defining a specific Irish shipping policy and shipping related services. It could be a great industry for the country but it has been an industry for a very select few. It was not considered attractive for many other interests to get involved in. This may have been due in part to the fact that EU funding for mobile assets versus fixed assets had an impact on how people decided to invest their money.</P>
    <P>We are the only island nation in the EU. When the EU Commissioner with responsibility for transport addressed this House, we put this point to him. I hope it will be seriously addressed because there is a potential for huge development in this industry. The institute should outline specific policy in regard to shipping. Ireland is increasingly an exporting nation and we need to develop methods of transport. To a large degree, our transport costs define our competitiveness.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1303" /> We must also examine the type of shipping services which are provided to ships docking here. Ireland has lost a great deal of potential shipping services business to Scotland and northern England. I hope the Marine Institute will address this issue to make Irish shipping services more attractive. I hope that in ten years' time, we will see a definite improvement in the shipping and shipping services industries. I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to speak for the 15 minutes stipulated by the Deputy Leader.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see the Minister in the House following the indecision of the past 24 hours. I welcome this long awaited Bill which has been in preparation for up to two years, a fact which led to the deferment of elections to the regional fisheries boards on two occasions. Not long ago, the contents of this Bill threatened to evoke scenes similar to those which resulted from the infamous rod licence dispute in the mid-1980s. The main concerns expressed came from the regional boards and the fisheries representative organisations and related to the balance and mix of the elected representatives. Happily, the difficulties which existed have been overcome through consultation by the Minister and his officials over the past month with representatives of the angling associations which outlined the changes their members would like to see to strengthen their role and involvement in the boards' work. Many of these changes were incorporated in the Bill through the amendments tabled by the Minister at the Select Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</P>
      <P>The fisheries boards were established in 1980 and, in the past 20 years, they have been involved in the management of the inland fisheries and sea angling sectors. The Bill attempts to redress the many deficiencies which have existed in these sectors for the past 20 years. The system's weaknesses were identified and reviews were carried out. Coopers &amp; Lybrand produced a report in 1994 commissioned by the Central Fisheries Board. A further report was prepared by Price Waterhouse in 1995 in which the organisation and management of sea and inland fisheries was reviewed. Many of the problems identified in the Price Waterhouse report will be rectified through the provisions contained this Bill. The problems identified related primarily to the confusing overlap between the roles of the Central Fisheries Board and the regional boards, the lack of clear direction and cohesion in the service, the size and composition of the boards and the lack of adequate accountability in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> The Bill's overall objective is to provide proper management and conserve and develop our inland fisheries to the highest possible standards. The Bill recognises the vital contribution to be made in the future by local fishing interests in the development and conservation of the inland fisheries. The role of the Central Fisheries Board will primarily be one of providing specialist support and co-ordination services to, and on behalf of, the regional boards. The board will be responsible for the preparation of national fishery development plans in conjunction with the regional boards. It will also advise the Minister on the policy and effective performance of the regional boards of their functions.</P>
    <P>The size of the Central Fisheries Board is to be reduced from the current complement of 13 members which includes the chairpersons of the seven regional board chairpersons and five ministerial appointees. The new nine member board, including the chairperson, will be appointed by the Minister. Two of the nominees will be drawn from the chairpersons and chief executives of the regional fisheries board. The number has been increased from eight, as originally intended, to nine members to include a member of staff of the Central Fisheries Board to be nominated by the staff. Two further members will be appointed on the nominations of the Ministers for the Environment and Local Government and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. The other three nominees will have relevant management and business competencies. Section 23 also provides that at least two board members shall be women and at least two shall be men.</P>
    <P>The board of the Central Fisheries Board will no longer be dominated by the chairmen of the regional fisheries boards, as happened in the past. The inclusion of a regional board chief executive officer in addition to a regional board chairman is very important to ensure that decisions taken at Central Fisheries Board level reflect the requirements of the regional fisheries boards in operational terms, given the specific role of the Central Fisheries Board in the provision of specialist support services to the regional boards.</P>
    <P>The Bill devolves primary responsibility for conservation, development, management and promotion of the inland fisheries and angling to the regional boards. In addition to the clarification of their existing brief, the regional boards are to be given new roles in the co-ordination and development of catchment management plans, acquisition and management of fisheries and the issuance of eel fishing authorisation. This authorisation was formerly issued by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The size of the regional boards has varied between 20 and 21 with seven members being appointed by the Minister. There will be 16 members on the new boards, at least four of whom will be men and at least four of whom will be women. The reduction in the number of members on the boards is a positive development as the regional fisheries boards in particular were too big to operate effectively. In the past, the <Col N="1305" /> major criticisms of the boards were that they were too narrowly focused, had little or no representation from the wider community and were dominated by fishery interest groups. Arising from the amendment of section 7, the regional boards will comprise a number of elected members as set down by ministerial order with eight ministerial appointees. Of those eight appointments, one shall be a staff member of the board concerned and the others shall be nominated by organisations outlined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The demands of the Trout Anglers Federation of Ireland, with which I have a particular association, have been recognised by the Minister through the maintenance of the current levels of representation for salmon, trout and coarse anglers and life members of the Inland Fisheries Trust. The chairpersons of the regional boards will, as heretofore, be elected by board members in line with the clear preference of the boards and the various interests represented. It is not clear whether the Minister agreed to TAFI's demand to have a member of the organisation appointed to represent anglers on the Central Fisheries Board. Perhaps the Minister could clarify that point.</P>
    <P>I have been contacted by members of the sea angling fraternity in regard to representations. To date, they have been represented as life members of the Inland Fisheries Trust but have never been represented on the board in their own right. No mechanisms existed through which sea angling representatives could be elected on to the seven regional boards in the same manner as drift net fishermen, coarse anglers and club members. Perhaps the Minister could consider this matter when he reviews the new boards' membership.</P>
    <P>The central and regional boards have jurisdiction over sea angling, an area which has developed rapidly. There is great potential for further development in this area. Sea angling is becoming increasingly important as a recreational activity and a tourism revenue earner. It is timely that we look at this valuable resource which must be conserved, protected, managed and developed. The Minister has acknowledged this through his provision of a safety grant for sea angling boats.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also met the demands of the angling associations by agreeing to the clearly expressed preference of the development co-operative society members to continue with existing arrangements whereby shareholders elect their own representatives to the committees, one nominated member being the development officer of the regional board staff and one being a ministerial nominee. It has been left to the co-operatives to decide whether the holding of share certificates should be compulsory. The Minister has agreed to maintain the <i>status quo</i> in this regard in spite of the fact that the co-operative review group report recommended change. Under the new arrangements, both the central and regional boards will have the statutory power to appoint committees which may include persons <Col N="1306" /> who are not board members. This is important, particularly in the case of the regional fisheries boards as the establishment of local committees at river catchment level is an essential element of the catchment management process in which the boards will now be required to engage and which is widely acknowledged as the way forward for inland fishery management.</P>
    <P>The devolution of responsibility to the regional boards must be accompanied by accountability. The Bill sets out clear arrangements for provision of timely reports and accounts, audits of accounts, etc. Each regional board must prepare an annual report within three months of the end of the year and, based on these, the Central Fisheries Board must produce an overall report for all the boards within four months. The Bill also contains detailed financial and accounting arrangements. The regional boards must submit annual statements of accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General within three months of the year end.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the establishment of a salmon commission to advise the Minister on salmon management policy and the setting of a total allowable salmon catch and quotas for the taking of salmon, in line with the recommendations of the Salmon Task Force Report. I note that the tagging system will be brought in only in consultation with this commission. The tagging system will be of benefit to all because it will provide information.</P>
    <P>Another source of valuable information has been the funding of fish counters. In all, 35 have been introduced, with grant assistance through TAM. I thank the Minister for the initiative on behalf of the Rosses Anglers' Association which is in my area. They have received funding through TAM for a counter at the entrance of Dungloe Lake where we brought the Minister to show him the situation and where he met with the members of the association. They have developed a fantastic leisure and tourism resource in north-west Donegal. This has been development mainly through their own resources. I would like to see more funding available to the fisheries board to assist organisations like the Rosses Anglers' Association to develop their resource and to provide additional tourism infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The 1998 Bord Fáilte report showed that while visitor numbers have risen over the previous five years, the number engaged in angling has declined. We have huge potential in our inland fisheries and marine leisure to attract many more tourists to our country. This Bill will help to develop our inland fisheries to their full potential to attract tourists, to create jobs and give long hours of pleasure to many anglers, such as Senator O'Toole.</P>
    <P>The role of the Central Fisheries Board and regional agencies will be strengthened by this Bill. The concept of regionality with devolved powers being given to State agencies to act regionally and locally in support of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources is being greatly strength<Col N="1307" /> ened by this proposed legislation. It is essential that all State agencies are qualified to make maximum use of available EU funding aid in Counties Donegal, Cavan and Leitrim. The Northern Regional Fisheries Board is best placed to gain maximum advantage for fishery development in two areas.</P>
    <P>The first is through participation in Border, midlands and western operational committees. The post of regional fisheries board chief officers is now being designated chief executive officer and will allow six chief officers of the boards to sit on the operational committee. Under the Local Government Act, 1991, and the 1999 order setting up the two regional assemblies and operational committees, these officers will have a critical role in formulating work programmes and grant applications for EU funding to carry out the work of these programmes. The Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1999, will greatly strengthen the ability of regional chief executive officers to act on an equal footing with other chief executives on the operational committee, and further strengthen Ireland's claim of creditable regional and local government.</P>
    <P>The second area of fishery development is through the INTERREG II Erne salmon management programme. The Northern Regional Fisheries Board is the applicant and grantee of £1.77 million to fund a major restoration programme for wild salmon on the Erne. The chair of this large inter agency steering group of fishery authorities North and South has been vested in the Northern board. The Northern board's ability to devise new schemes and create their own resource base necessary to draw down the EU funds will be greatly strengthened by the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The eel fisheries provisions are set out in section 27. Eel fishery on the River Erne is funded through the peace and reconciliation programme. A number of those operating eel fisheries on the Erne have contacted me about their present difficulties. In 1997 the price of silver eels was approximately £2.60 sterling. Today's price amounts to between 80p and £1. The collapse in the price is causing severe hardship to these fishermen. The reason I have been given for the collapse of price is that many silver eel farms on the continent have collapsed and have flooded the market with cheap silver eels. The Erne system has received a major investment over the past two years under the Erne eel enhancement programme funded by the peace and reconciliation programme. The Minister launched the programme in Ballyshannon and expressed hope for the future of the industry. The programme is investing just under £1 million in the industry which is confined to the development of the eel population in the system. However, unless something is done urgently, there will be no silver eel fishermen in the system. Is there anything the Minister can do?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> The next peace and reconciliation programme will have £5 million available in the Republic of Ireland for suitable cross-Border projects. The ability of the Northern Regional Fisheries Board to participate and compete with other agencies for these funds will be greatly strengthened by the new legislation which will underpin the bona fides of regionality within the fishery sector.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the various initiatives he has introduced during the past two and a half years. He has given long overdue recognition to our fishing industry. In the past ten days he has succeeded in increasing our mackerel quota for the year 2000 by 10,000 tonnes to 70,000 tonnes. A week before that, he succeeded in having the proposed 130 per cent replacement tonnage rule scrapped. He improved the situation of our whitefish fishing fleet with the investment and tax incentives given to that sector, coupled with the grant assistance for safety improvements on vessels. We have also seen the development of piers, harbours and slipways. The Minister has encouraged the development of marine leisure and associated facilities.</P>
    <P>This is the last Bill to be passed in this House during the present millennium. It is a comprehensive blueprint for the structure, management and organisation of our inland fisheries services into the new millennium. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming the Minister to the House I have a sense of <i>déjà vu.</i> I was sitting in this seat the last time a Minister for the Marine came here with rushed legislation relating to fisheries which had to be signed before a Christmas recess, and we were paying the price for years after. I take a dim view of legislation being rushed through in this way. I do not believe it is necessary. There are issues which we need to have spelt out and clarified.</P>
      <P>I recognise that the vast majority of the measures in this Bill are hugely welcome. The Bill is doing something which needs to be done. There can be no argument about that. However, there are a number of things about it which I do not understand. I do not understand &ndash; and I would like a detailed explanation &ndash; the relationship between the regional and central bodies outlined in this legislation, and the relationship between them and the new Inland Waterways North-South Implementation Body. It certainly seems, in terms of the authority which the implementation body has, that this cuts across aspects of the role of the regional boards as outlined in section 8 of the Bill and similarly that of the central board. I would like to know whose writ runs in such situations. There are very broad responsibilities given both to the regional boards and to the central board. We need to find out who will have authority in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Senator Taylor-Quinn who outlined that the regional boards have the autonomy to select, appoint or elect their own chairperson. <Col N="1309" /> I could not find that in the Bill. Perhaps the Minister would draw my attention to where it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the fishing interests wanted it done otherwise for their particular reasons. The majority wanted to appoint their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. The other issue is the question of ship registration, in which I have a great interest. There is a passing reference to ship registration at the end of the Bill and in the Minister's speech. I have been discussing with quite a number of people over the past two years how one can get a ship registered here without going through a process appropriate to a ship the size of the <i>Titanic.</i> It just seems impossible at the moment. I have never been through the process but I have spoken to people who have imported craft from other countries and tried to have them reregistered here. I intend raising on the Adjournment in the future why we do not make this simpler, more streamlined and more appropriate. There are many boat owners here and in Britain who do not have proper written proof of their ownership. This is particularly difficult for people who travel between here and the Continent, particularly France and Portugal which have very strict rules in this area, and I would like to hear what the Minister has in mind. I fully support his proposal, but I do not understand how it might work or how he intends it to work.</P>
      <P>A significant part of the legislation is concerned with the responsibilities for and importance of salmon fisheries. I have no problem with this &ndash; indeed, I support it &ndash; but I intend tabling amendments to ensure the interests of people who fish for eels are taken into account. I have a number of reasons for doing this, one of which is the need for representation. Many would argue there is a conflict between eel and salmon fishing. Commercial eel fishermen on the Shannon claim they have lost out through the authority which groups such as the ESB exert on salmon fisheries. Eel fisheries, which are mainly located around Ardnacrusha, east Limerick, north Tipperary and the Clare border, feel their interests are not being represented in the legislation. The conflict, which is similar to that concerning the badger on dry land, is age old and I do not pretend to present myself in any way as an expert who can solve it. Certainly there is a view that commercial fishermen feel their interests are not being properly protected, represented and advanced in the Bill, and it is important that this is recognised. For this reason I will be asking the Minister to examine a proposal to include under section 7 organisations involved in the promotion and development of commercial eel fishing. I will return to this on Committee Stage, but I hope that the Minister will respond on Second Stage and give an indication that he will take account of what I am saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I say is not meant in any personal way, but there are some very important aspirational sections in the Bill. There is talk about the <Col N="1310" /> importance of trout and coarse angling, but in many of our major waterways there is no such angling. This year I was in Banagher for the annual pike angling competition which attracts the best anglers. No pike were caught that day, something which never before happened in the history of the competition. These are the realities. I would like to know when a salmon or brown trout was last caught on the Shannon &ndash; I suspect it was a long time ago.</P>
    <P>In terms of accountability people who make a living from and who love the environment should be represented. The Bill lists many organisations in this context. However, I am asking the Minister to include representation for people with a commitment to the development of commercial eel fishing, which will be of major interest to those involved in the inland waterways. I am certain that if the Ulster Canal is reopened the issue will have a North-South dimension in terms of Lough Neagh. Eel fishermen in particular should have representation.</P>
    <P>Those who have more knowledge than I describe eels as the prince of fish, a view which has been held for centuries by many people. It is certainly important that eel fishermen and eels are at least mentioned in the legislation in terms of inland fisheries. Section 8 says a regional board shall &ldquo;encourage, promote, market and develop angling for salmon, trout, coarse fish and sea-fish and, for the purposes of any or all of those kinds of angling, provide such facilities and amenities, if any, as it thinks fit&rdquo;. This excludes commercial and leisure interests which have existed for a long time. Those involved in eel fishing feel they have been left out of the loop. There is no need to keep them out of the loop. Rather we should ensure they are involved and we should make appropriate changes to the Bill to ensure eel fisheries, which have always been excluded from fisheries legislation, take their rightful place. Some priority should be given to this species which seems to be ignored all the time.</P>
    <P>In one part of Clare people felt strongly enough to stop the development of a golf course because of concern for a very minor element of the local fauna while the Minister is well aware of the concern expressed by people in south west Clare when it was proposed to put a huge mast at the end of Loop Head. I now put the case for east Clare and ask the Minister to examine the issue. These people along the Shannon deserve our support. They are a small body of people who will never win or lose an election. They will not be on the Marian Finucane or Joe Duffy radio programmes for half an hour and there are no tax credits for eel fishermen. Not too many people will speak on their behalf and a huge amount of credit will not accrue to the Minister for taking my suggestion on board, but as somebody who cares about the environment I ask him to listen to the Shannon eel fishermen. Including them in the Bill will not mean representation, but it would at least give them a voice and they could then <Col N="1311" /> find their own space within the broad community of committed people.</P>
    <P>I hope to hear a very positive response from the Minister and hope it might not be necessary to discuss this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Dr. Woods, to the House and commend the legislation. I commend the Minister on the flexible and open way he has approached the legislation, particularly the way in which he has dealt with the representations made to him regarding improvements and how comprehensively those improvements have been included in the amended Bill as passed by the Dáil. If it were otherwise far more amendments would have been tabled in this House.</P>
      <P>I empathise with Senator O'Toole's recollection of the difficulties in which we can find ourselves as a result of rushing legislation through the House. On the most famous occasion which led to the rod licence dispute, not only was the legislation rushed through the House but it was not considered in detail by either House, with the number of contributors being very few. Hopefully we will not find ourselves in such a situation again.</P>
      <P>At the outset I wish to declare, as I am required to, that I have a vested interest. I am a landowner, a riparian owner on a stretch of the River Liffey and I am also a trustee of the North Kildare Trout and Salmon Anglers Association.</P>
      <P>I could bore the House and the Minister, as I have done in the past with his predecessors and other Ministers, with my angling odyssey around the country since the 1950s and my accounts of the deterioration in water quality since then, particularly the devastation of the River Shannon through the activities of Bord na Móna. I am one of the people who caught a trout in the River Shannon in the late 1950s. One also fished for salmon at that time above Banagher. Only someone with a lot of time on their hands and not much expectation of catching either species would try to do that now. It has even become difficult to catch pike. We must remember what a local authority did to Lough Ennell, what happened to Lough Sheelin as a result of pig farming and the more recent example of Lough Leane in Killarney. The great western lakes are also threatened.</P>
      <P>Protection of this resource is the critical issue and that message must be got across to the Minister and the central board. In some ways that is secondary to the arrangement of the administrative structure, which is dealt with in the Bill. However, that is not to say the arrangement is not important. We have a resource of such environmental and economic magnitude it is criminal the way successive Administrations have failed in their responsibility to protect it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must be congratulated on his flexibility during the consultations. The original Bill was almost like a White Paper which was <Col N="1312" /> amended considerably. I commend the Trout Anglers' Federation of Ireland, the National Association of Rod Anglers and FISSTA on considering the Bill in detail and submitting its views which the Minister took on board. I commend the secretary of the National Anglers' Representative Association, Mr. Paddy Byrne, who is a member of my club in Newbridge, on his detailed study of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the role of the Central Board under section 5 should be specified in more detail. If responsibilities are devolved to regional boards, which should be done so they can regulate their affairs, one of the difficulties is that the central board could become an irrelevancy as the regional boards would then report directly to the Minister. It would be unfortunate if the central board lost its co-ordinating and development roles. The central board has looked after the fisheries under its control over the years. I do not have a problem with the fact the River Erriff will become the responsibility of the regional board rather than the central board. However, we must be careful to strike a balance between the various organisations.</P>
    <P>In the past the boards have managed the fisheries and they have protected the fish as well as they can, given their resources, but they have failed to protect the water. It is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Department of the Environment and Local Government under the water pollution Acts to ensure the water is protected. If the fisheries boards had a stronger and more active role &ndash; I know they have officers who look after incidents of pollution &ndash; there might have been fewer incidents where water quality and fish life were seriously affected.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 5(6) which deals with partnership. A strong partnership between the fisheries boards, the private owners and the angling clubs is essential. The best improvement to the Bill was the provision to ensure that the angling representatives got their full place in the sun in terms of representation on the board. However, there are fundamentally conflicting interests represented on the boards. Some of those interests are not disposed towards angling and the protection of the resource. Section 7 (B) states: &ldquo;organisations which, in the Minister's opinion, are representative of persons whose professions or occupations relate to agriculture&rdquo;. I have no difficulty with Teagasc being represented. However, as a practising farmer, I am not sure that farmer representatives are the appropriate people to have on a fisheries board.</P>
    <P>There are also many cases where the aquaculture activity is inimical to the development of the fishery. That is what happened to the sea trout in the west. That was an environmental crime of monumental proportions but they still insisted they had nothing to do with it. As a scientist, the Minister knows it is difficult for science to establish an empirical connection. It is like what happened in the case of Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme <Col N="1313" /> where the High Court found that what came out of the chimney stack was the only possible explanation for what happened to a herd of cows.</P>
    <P>Angling clubs must be brought into the system of protection, development and management of the fisheries. The angling clubs have been to the forefront in protecting the resource. Angling clubs in my county have brought incidents of pollution to the attention of the fisheries board which has tried to rectify the situation. However, the angling clubs are left to pick up the pieces and to restock the water when a fish kill occurs.</P>
    <P>My local angling club has used the joint funding system extremely efficiently in recent years. We have improved access and stiles along the river bank. Some £18 million was allocated in the last national development plan to angling, while £118 million was allocated to golf. I know golf is more expensive to develop and it is beneficial, but there is a certain imbalance when one looks at the value of the resource.  </P>
    <P>I applaud the Minister for allowing elected members of the staff of the central board to be members of the board. This issue was discussed on Committee Stage in the Dáil. I wondered why the chief executive of the central board was not a member of the board when someone from the regional board could be a member.</P>
    <P>The reporting of the accounts is important. The central board must report within four months of the end of the year and the regional boards within three months. That suggests that the central board has only a month between the last day on which the accounts of the regional board could be received and the presentation of its own accounts. That is a short timescale which might cause some difficulties.</P>
    <P>As a life member of the Inland Fisheries Trust, I welcome the election of shareholders. I can claim some of the credit for the fact that the previous legislation protected the life members of the trust. For a small amount of money our rights have been protected in perpetuity.</P>
    <P>Catchment management has been controversial. It is the way forward but it must operate in partnership. There are many catchment schemes which involve angling clubs, private owners and the State. There must be some element of co-operation to ensure each part of the catchment is protected and developed. That must be done in partnership on a voluntary incremental basis.</P>
    <P>Catch and release must receive more consideration in future, although there are question marks about its value for the protection of fish stocks, particularly in the case of salmon. That raises the question of resources for staff and research. If the administrative system is good but there is an inadequate level of staff, resources and research, the whole thing will fall to pieces. Mr. Ken Whelan has done marvellous work in the laboratory in Burrishoole but there are not enough people like him. The Minister knows the value of research. The regional boards were guaranteed five staff but they did not arrive. I have heard of cases <Col N="1314" /> where the regional board fisheries officers have been paid their salaries but have not been given the resources to look after the water. That is crazy, particularly in the current economic climate.</P>
    <P>There is traceability in agriculture. I cannot understand why it is not possible to have the same traceability in salmon. Some of the management practices in salmon farming are extremely detrimental to the environment. Similar practices would not be tolerated in agriculture. If that salmon is stocked on a supermarket shelf, the person buying it is entitled to know from where it came and the circumstances in which it was reared.</P>
    <P>The promotion and development of this resource must be examined. Bord Fáilte and the fisheries boards both have roles in promoting it but we are falling between two stools. We have the capacity to attract high spending tourists to the State to enjoy this resource but we have lost many of those tourists who came in the past. If this legislation helps to bring those people back it will be very welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. This legislation is designed to establish a new administrative structure. What will it administer? The people working in the industry are committed to the development of fisheries and angling but a serious environmental problem arises as a result of poor water quality in the rivers and lakes. It is not long since this House debated the report of the monitoring committee on Lough Derg and Lough Ree. We all expressed our concern and frustration about the problems with water quality and the effect on the industry. The Minister referred to the importance of the environment. That should be at the top of our list of priorities, not further down. The best administrative structure in the world will not be able to administer anything if we do not address water quality and its effect on fish stocks and the wider industry.</P>
      <P>Every year in April and May the anglers of north Tipperary are not to be found there, they are all at the Corrib because there are not sufficient stocks of fish in their own area. That is appalling and should be of great concern to anyone connected with fishing or the tourism industry. Until we address that issue all other efforts will be in vain. I welcome the commitment of the Minister to this area and the attention paid to the issues raised when the Bill was published. I was informed of local concern about representation on the boards. The Minister has since addressed that and I congratulate him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inland fisheries catchment management must be examined. I went back to the local angling groups which had spoken to me when the Bill was first published to ask for their views on the amended Bill. This issue arose again and again. The anglers to whom I have spoken accept this is a new concept but there is concern about how it will work. The Killarney experience is a cause for <Col N="1315" /> wariness. I was given as a comparative example a legislative imperative that the ICA, IFA and other local interests be represented on the board of the local GAA club. That expresses how people feel about the introduction of catchment management as a result of this Bill. The Minister's objective is positive but I have been asked to urge that there be consultation on the issue to ensure that angling interests are heard.</P>
    <P>There is concern about stretches of river which have been under the ownership of clubs for decades. The perception is that a club must produce legal evidence of their ownership of a stretch of river. It may not be possible to achieve that because the ownership has been traditional, has grown up out of practice over a number of decades or because other practices have arisen instead. It may not be as simple as producing a deed. Concern about the requirement appears to arise from the catchment management concept. I would welcome clarification from the Minister on this point.</P>
    <P>Is there a commercial advantage to be derived from ship registration? We constantly hear of Spanish registered vessels all over the world, especially in Irish waters, although they may be owned by people living in countries other than Spain. It is not an area of which I have any great knowledge or experience. Perhaps the Minister will clarify why this issue has arisen and why registration is necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>I welcome the funding the Minister has allocated under the national development plan for the development of the industry. While funding is excellent and essential to the development of the industry, at what will it be directed? The fundamental question of pollution, the quality of our water and our aqua environment must be urgently addressed. Investment is also essential to ensure the development of the industry, whether it be marketing at local, national or international level, or to develop the infrastructure. What will happen to the infrastructure if the basic product is not as good as it could or should be? We fool ourselves if we do not address the fundamental issue of water quality and the local environment.</P>
    <P>I again thank the Minister for his open approach and I congratulate him on the Bill. I hope we will not have to return to hidden time bombs. Given his open and flexible approach to representations, I am sure these will not arise and that all interests are well represented and heard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill. It is expansive legislation, containing 31 sections. Although it is to some extent overdue it addresses many of the issues facing the fishing industry, including inland fisheries and sea fisheries research. The Bill is primarily concerned with inland fisheries. It is important this area be addressed and that it receives proper funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sport, angling and tourism represent one aspect of the inland fisheries industry. Another <Col N="1316" /> aspect is concerned with the development of the industry on a business footing for the purposes of job creation. Both aspects need to progress in tandem. While angling is very important we must ensure it does not dominate the entire industry and we must not fail to recognise the great production opportunities, for example, the provision of the wonderful food in our waters.</P>
    <P>On previous occasions I have spoken strongly on water quality and it would be remiss of me not to say something about it here, especially as it affects the River Shannon and its catchment area. The second interim report on the issue, published by Clare County Council and Roscommon County Council, identified massive pollution of the River Shannon and its tributaries, especially Lough Ree. All involved, whether it be the public bodies, industry or farming, must take some responsibility for what has happened. They have all contributed to a very serious situation involving the destruction of one of the finest waterways in Europe.</P>
    <P>Over the last 50 years we have used the River Shannon as an outfall for all our waste and in my lifetime nobody has thought it worth their while to undertake an hour's maintenance on the river. Everybody has used it to offload what is of no value to them and we are now paying the price. I am glad the problem has been identified in a report, the compilation of which I was partly responsible for through my membership of Roscommon County Council. I have also spoken about the problem in this House over the past ten years. I am glad somebody listened. I compliment Clare County Council for joining with Roscommon County Council in commissioning this study. I also appreciate the subsequent verbal and moral support offered by other local authorities.</P>
    <P>The crunch issues will arise when these local authorities will have to implement by-laws to ensure that the protections necessary will be adequately implemented. The Minister's Department is not the only one involved. The Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Enterprise, in so far as it is concerned with energy and public transport, are all involved with the River Shannon to a greater or lesser extent. Indeed, there is a plethora of bodies and agencies sharing responsibility for the river but there is no one body with overall control.</P>
    <P>Unless our water quality is of a good standard we will not have an inland fishing industry covering the River Shannon, its tributaries and, indeed, other waterways. Instead the River Shannon faces an escalating problem with the proliferation of the zebra mussel. The Shannon Eel Fisheries Association has brought to my attention the massive potential of the eel industry in the river. According to figures from the association Lough Neagh, which has a water size of similar mass, has been the source for the creation of a massive industry with 400 full-time jobs. Some 700 tonnes of eel are removed from the lake on an annual basis. This compares with the removal of only 70 <Col N="1317" /> tonnes from the River Shannon, where the industry supports only 40 to 50 part-time fishermen. None of them has a licence and they do not know if they will be fishing next year or the following year. They operate at the behest and under the goodwill of the ESB. Surely a river with the potential to create jobs and an industry requires a more focused and organised control and development plan for the eel industry?</P>
    <P>The ESB has done great work since it took over the River Shannon and its tributaries. Some of my own family were involved in the selling of the fishing rights on the River Suck in the late 20s and early 30s. The ESB has managed the industry since but has not developed it and this is a mistake. A fine indigenous industry could be developed in the catchment of the River Shannon, perhaps through co-operation, and its potential should be examined.</P>
    <P>In recent times I have had contact with inshore fishermen and their families. Traditional inshore fishermen and fisherwomen are becoming an extinct species. They feel they can no longer make a livelihood at their traditional occupation and are obliged to sign up for community employment schemes. The number of young people entering the industry is diminishing so fast that the average age of inshore fishermen is now over 50 years. This is a big mistake. We are an island country and room should be provided for those families who traditionally made a living from this form of fishing. If anything, we should expand this industry. I support the co-operation system and it is good that grant aid is available for it. However, it should not be developed to the detriment of traditional fishing. Through the all-party strategic management initiative, we have had meetings with these fishermen in Dungarvan and Killarney where we brought together representatives from the south and south-east coasts and they told a tale of woe. This is unfortunate because there is great opportunity in this sector for families who have traditional expertise and we should examine the possibility of helping them.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry is the Cinderella of the Irish economy and this became apparent when we negotiated our entry into the European Union. At that time our greatest asset was the sea around our coast but the agricultural lobby won the day and the fishing industry is no longer high on our list of priorities. Figures for our receipts from the European Union are often bandied about but if we compare those receipts with what has been taken from our seas we will see that we have not got very much in excess of what we have lost to the European Union.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry has never enjoyed the proper understanding of the Irish people. I am glad the Minister has introduced this legislation to deal with all the areas of inland fishing. The concerns felt by many people must be addressed but the debate on this Bill gives Members of the Oireachtas and associations outside an opportunity to explain their difficulties and their points of view. One of the reasons fishermen are not <Col N="1318" /> seen lobbying in hotels near to Leinster House is that they are busy working. They are only at home when the winds are too high or the seas unsafe. Unlike other interest groups, they are not available to come and make their case. Because the fishing industry is so varied, its representation is fragmented and we do not get an overall view of its problems. The general public associate inland fishing with angling and leisure activities. They do not think of it as an industry. It is an indigenous industry whose potential has not been tapped. The debate on this Bill affords us an opportunity to highlight some of the difficulties of the fishing industry. We must continue to address the difficulties of the industry, whether inland or offshore.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been in Government for a long time and whatever portfolio he held, he always dealt with it very thoroughly. His unique contribution to the social welfare system must be recognised and in his short time as Minister for Agriculture he took many important forward steps. Had he remained at that Department for longer he might have introduced some important innovations. He is the right man in the right place at the right time. He will reform the fishing industry thoroughly. He has already met many groups and I know him to be a Minister who listens and who likes to take careful note of people's views. I compliment him on bringing this legislation forward. I know it will address many of the problems of the fishing industry and I hope some remaining difficulties can be accommodated on Committee and Report Stages.</P>

I thank him for his kind reception yesterday of the delegation from Killarney which included the Lough Leane Anglers' Association, the Killarney Salmon and Trout Association, the River Laune Fisheries Association, the Clonkeen Fishing Club and the Lakes of Killarney interest. We are grateful to the Minister for his willingness to listen and for his patience. No doubt he will listen further. I acknowledge the good grace with which he accepted amendments in the other House, particularly from Deputy Finucane but also from Deputy Bell.</P>

    <P>The great fear in my area is that the catchment management arrangement would superimpose a club for the entire catchment, that an annual fishing fee would be required as well as the State licence and that people whose forebears have had a boat on the Lakes of Killarney for hundreds of years would no longer be guaranteed the right to fish there. They were most concerned that a democratic state could make such an assault on what they regard as their traditional rights. They were also fearful about the acquisition of fisher<Col N="1319" /> ies. What happened in Killarney was a particularly bad experience and, as the Minister pointed out, is merely a pilot project. It did not work out satisfactorily or successfully and it should not have happened. We certainly would not like it to happen again.</P>
    <P>There is also great concern about protection. In my part of the country the protection has been virtually non-existent and certainly ineffective. I appeal to the Minister to provide the extra staffing required for this purpose. The prime concern must be the quality of the water. We must ensure that the boards are better able to manage the fisheries in future. The angling clubs must be anchored in the process because they have effectively been doing this job, restocking and so forth.</P>
    <P>The Minister has shown goodwill towards permitting a voluntary buy out of commercial salmon fishermen. From the point of view of tourism, that would greatly assist the situation if and when it is allowed to occur. I also understand the Minister made changes to the legislation in the Dáil with regard to the regional boards and the appointment of chairmen. That will provide for a more democratic structure.</P>
    <P>There was a particularly bad experience in Killarney and I trust it will not recur. The regional fisheries boards must set down proper guidelines and more consultation is required for the requisite level of resolution. It is also essential that a good relationship is seen to be established between the clubs and landowners along river banks and the boards. In other words, existing rights and entitlements should be respected and security of tenure should be built in and guaranteed.</P>
    <P>I accept the good aims of the Bill. Protection, however, is not happening although that is probably a staffing problem which can be rectified. There is a need for first rate co-operation with the interests involved. I am anxious to hear about the tagging scheme envisaged in sections 24, 25 and 26 which, again, fishermen might regard as a huge intrusion on their way of fishing. I am delighted the Minister offered to visit Killarney with his officials in the new year and I look forward to welcoming him there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I tend to be somewhat ungracious in not welcoming Ministers to the Seanad but this Minister is always welcome. It is many years since he and I first discussed social welfare issues in the dark days of the 1980s when money was counted in pennies and adjustments in social welfare were fought with great pain and sometimes at great cost. One of this Minister's long standing memorials will be his far sighted introduction of a sophisticated computer system. He is a man with a vision for the future in many areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no wish to repeat the comments of other contributors but one could, although it is probably an exaggeration, talk about the dance band on the <i>Titanic.</i> We are talking about developing inland fisheries at a time when the real possibility <Col N="1320" /> exists, given the rapidity of our economic expansion, of a deterioriation in water quality that is so fast that many inland fisheries will become unusable or will be of no benefit. It sounds unimaginable but there is a real possibility of those levels of pollution.</P>
    <P>Inland fish and marine life are sensitive creatures. They are sensitive to the presence of metals, to changes in Ph and to eutrophication which destroys the oxygen content of the water. This is not the Minister's remit but it ought to be his concern. A profound problem is developing which involves contradictory issues. Despite the introduction of the rural environment protection scheme, we are trying to intensify agricultural production. The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development attended a recent Seanad debate on agriculture. While he was positive about REPS and the 30 per cent of farmers who participate in the scheme, he did not know what proportion of agricultural production was being produced on their farms. That is the more significant figure. He also did not know what proportion of the entire acreage being farmed was under REPS.</P>
    <P>It is possible that the 30 per cent of farmers in REPS might represent far less than 30 per cent of the acreage being farmed and also less than 30 per cent of the volume of production in farming. If 30 per cent of farmers are operating environmentally advanced farms but they represent only 15 per cent of production or less and if the imbalance of production between smaller farmers and industrial farmers gets worse in the future, as it will, the problem of environmental damage by intensive agriculture will get worse. At the risk of sounding pompous, I counsel the Minister to keep an eye on what is happening in agriculture.</P>
    <P>He should also keep an eye on Bord na Móna which is regularly criticised for its less than sympathetic handling of fisheries. Sensitive fisheries can often be a wonderful incentive to behave. The sugar factory in Mallow, for example, is particularly careful about its liquid effluent because the Blackwater, one of the country's best salmon fisheries, flows past its premises. It does not want the hassle of causing major damage to the salmon stocks so it tends to be extremely careful. However, there are other areas where there might not be the same quality of fisheries.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran's point is valid. It was made to a number of Senators by interests outside the House. We should not look on inland fisheries as just a hobby. The 400 full-time jobs on Lough Neagh is a significant number of jobs. Jobs in this sector tend to be located in areas where it is often difficult to locate modern industries. There is a need to ensure there is a commercial focus to all this. If recreational and commercial interests come into conflict, the recreational interest should suffer. If there is a possibility of giving people, especially along the Shannon, a proper and worthwhile life, then those who fish at weekends for a hobby will have to fit themselves around it, as is required in <Col N="1321" /> other areas such as shooting and hunting which must fit themselves around the commercial needs of agriculture. One must be clear about that.</P>
    <P>I am not sure one can argue too much about the Bill's content. I know the points which have been made. I am surprised by the issues raised by the people working to develop a commercial eel fishery and their request to be represented and identified as a separate interest, even though eel fisheries are referred to in the Bill. I am surprised by those who work in this area because it is obviously an area which could be developed substantially. One of our peculiarities in this country is that, for many years, we have never acknowledged that eels are regarded as a great delicacy. In my home town where I grew up, most people regarded eels as fish which came from water which was polluted with sewage and which no sensible human being would eat. In fact, they are and always have been a wonderful delicacy and I am partial to them. I had a deal with my mother for years that, as long as I cleaned them out and skinned them, she would cook them. She was not prepared to handle them because she did not like the look or feel of them. There is a huge market for eels, as the Lough Neagh fisheries have demonstrated, and we need to move in that direction.</P>
    <P>Tourism is a good industry and serves a purpose but it is not the best way to give people in rural areas a living. It is the least worse alternative but it is not an alternative to jobs based on indigenous resources. I hope the legislation achieves its purpose. I have a succession of questions to ask on Committee Stage about details of the legislation, but I welcome the Minister's attempt to innovate. I am astonished at the complexity of legislation in this area. The 1980 Fisheries Act takes up nearly 200 pages of one of the volumes of legislation for that year. We seem to have put together extraordinarily complex legislation for what is supposed to be in most people's eyes no more than a hobby. I would have thought that level of legislation would at least have been the basis for an industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. Bills have been rushed through the House before and we have seen what has happened with previous legislation on the fishing industry. I oppose the rushing of the Bill through the House. That said, I will assist its passage because I am aware of the timeframe involved and that we must be finished before 6 p.m. I will assist the Minister in whatever way I can. I do not intend to speak for too long. Nonetheless, we should not rush the Bill through the House. It has been in preparation for the past two years, yet we must now rush it through. Senator O'Toole has tabled a number of amendments and it will take some time for it to pass through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill was first published about two years ago and, in fairness to the Minister, he has acceded to many of the demands made by various organisations, the Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries boards. I am delighted and <Col N="1322" /> pleased that the Minister has facilitated most of the people because it is not easy to please everyone. In fairness to the Minister, he has done his best to facilitate most of the organisations and interests involved. Deputies Finucane and Bell in the other House are to be commended on the manner in which they have worked on the Bill to improve it for all involved in the fishing industry and for everyone in the country.</P>
    <P>I have been actively involved in discussing this Bill with various organisations in recent weeks. I have had meetings, along with Deputy Finucane, with the Central Fisheries Board, the regional fisheries boards, FISSTA, the Federation of Irish Salmon and Sea Trout Anglers, and TAFI, the Trout Anglers' Federation of Ireland. In fairness to the Minister, he has gone a long way towards meeting the needs voiced by all those interests and this will ensure the Bill is good legislation. The Bill is welcome and I hope it will improve all aspects of fishing throughout the country, be it fishing on our seas, lakes or other waterways.</P>
    <P>I intend to go into some detail on the sections when we are on Committee Stage. However, perhaps the Minister could address some aspects of the Bill when he is summing up. One aspect relates to the formation of the regional boards. Section 7(1)(c) states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may by order alter the number of elected members of a regional board.</P>
    <P>Prior to that the composition of the boards is set out and the various organisations which will comprise the membership of the boards. However, at the end of the section, it states that the Minister may alter by order the number of elected members of a regional board. Will the Minister clarify that when he is summing up? The measure suggests he can, with the stroke of a pen, abolish the elected members or remove the elected representatives of interested groups from the board. Perhaps the Minister would clarify the matter before I table an amendment to the section. The measure should be deleted from the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is no representative of local authorities on the regional boards, although authorities have played a significant role in restoring life to lakes. My local authority, Mayo County Council, put together a study to restore life to Lough Conn and Lough Cullin and it involved all the vested interests, such as the regional fisheries board, the county council, especially the planning section, fishing organisations and farmers. I compliment everyone involved because we can now see the value of what has happened with life being restored to those lakes. I am disappointed that there is no representative from any local authority on the regional boards. I hope the Minister includes a section which grants representation to local authorities. While there could be several local authorities within the remit of a regional board, there should at least be one member designated by them to be a member of the regional board. I am delighted the Minister has changed his mind on the composition of the regional <Col N="1323" /> boards and decided to revert to the original format. This will be welcomed by the majority of interested groups.</P>
    <P>The local authorities, fisheries boards and the Office of Public Works are all involved in the management of our lakes. Lough Lannagh, on the edge of Castlebar, needs to be cleaned. Responsibility for this and other issues should be transferred to the regional fisheries board or the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. It is currently a problem for the Office of Public Works which may have to construct a weir to maintain the lake water at a certain level. This matter should be addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>While the Central Fisheries Board welcomes the provisions under which powers will be devolved to the regional fisheries boards, it still has a significant role to play in co-ordinating their activities and making recommendations on funding for works. This is to be welcomed and the Minister is to be complimented on bringing it about. If the matters to which I have alluded are clarified it may not be necessary for me to table an amendment on Committee or Report Stages. Given the interaction between them in relation to planning permissions etc., I am disappointed that the local authorities are not represented on the regional fisheries boards.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment all involved. I have no doubt the fishing sector will benefit greatly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Burke summarised the Bill fairly. He is concerned however that it is being rushed through. It had to be deferred for two years in succession because of our failure in securing agreement. The options were to defer it for another year or proceed with it. The Senator has grasped its importance, not only in terms of devolution but also in terms of a new role for the Central Fisheries Board which has to be elucidated. The devolution of authority and responsibility for rivers, important lakes and State facilities from the Central Fisheries Board to the regional fisheries boards has presented difficulties. Several Senators mentioned the Moy fishery over which a major battle was fought. People now understand what is involved. There was, however, great fear of the proposed changes, which was understandable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan raised the question of innovation. It is innovation in management. This is the modern way. I wrote a book on the subject in 1970 which was published by the Institute of Public Administration. It has become a big issue internationally in recent years. It is a different form of management where support for the regions is provided from the centre, where the regions are not dictated to and where individuals are encouraged to participate and accept responsibility. One cannot, however, have one without the other. A degree of maturity has to be shown in devolving authority. This is happening <Col N="1324" /> quickly. The representatives of the angling associations now recognise that the scenario will be different.</P>
    <P>On the composition of the regional fisheries boards, various investigations have been carried out during the years and reports prepared. Senator Bonner mentioned a number of them. The purpose was to ensure the boards would be more businesslike. The review group made similar recommendations. Anglers were of the view, however, that the boards would lack balance with others having more of a say and as a result there was great mistrust. As we do not want to take risks I am happy to retain the current balance. Our first priority is to devolve authority. We can then decide where we should go from there.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke said that Deputies Finucane and Bell worked hard on the Bill since its introduction on 5 November. They were constructive and helpful in relation to it. I would have been much happier if I had received it from the parliamentary draftsman much earlier in the year but, as we are all aware, there was pressure to produce the legislation dealing with Northern Ireland. I advised each of the associations in advance that they should look at the Bill as published and convey their views to us immediately. That is what happened. We received many submissions and the views expressed coincide with the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke is concerned that under the provisions of section 7 a Minister may by order alter the number of members. That is in the 1980 Act and it is contained in this Bill. Such an order would have to be laid before the Houses and could be contested if necessary in the normal way. Members can see from the discussions that there might be situations in which it was felt desirable to add another class, representation or member to the board. This provision continues that option if it is needed at any stage.</P>
    <P>I can tell Senator Burke that it is the same power that has existed since the 1980 Act. Members can see in section 11 of the 1980 Act where it comes from. All the elections since 1980 are arranged, including electoral classes, under an order. The order will be laid before the Houses. The Senator also mentioned the importance of local authorities. They will be involved in the boards and that can be seen in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The composition of the board is now welcomed. I have explained where that came from. We will now have a statutory right to be involved in catchment management. We have been doing some of this on a pilot basis to see if we could get people to come together. We have led the way in dealing with a good deal of the water pollution problems. I said that the water quality is not good for fish and, if that is the case, it will not be good for humans. From that point of view we are in the front line against pollution problems. We took the initiative and people co-operated with us. We resolved some of the problems and drew up plans to resolve others. I accept that this is a huge task and there is a great deal of work to be done in that area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1325" /> We discussed the Shannon problem a short while ago while debating another Bill. I have every intention of attempting to do something serious about it but I cannot do so unless I get the co-operation of agriculture, environment and others sectors. I also need their time as well as their goodwill. It is not difficult to get their goodwill but we are interested in their time, investment and action. We hope to follow up here with a statutory backing for our involvement in such actions on the catchment approach. The catchment approach is voluntary. To make that clear we inserted the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; in one of the amendments that passed through the other House.</P>
    <P>The new and important role of the Central Fisheries Board has been mentioned. I have had some discussions with the board about it and I hope early in the new year to have a full discussion. I want to stimulate and encourage the Central Board to take the lead role, to do the co-ordination and to take a stimulating, supportive, developing role for the other boards around the country. I also want it to do that in practical actions. It will take a little time to work all those things through but at least we will be on the right road and one that I hope will be successful.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole and other Members subsequently mentioned the eel fishermen. Those fishermen are an electoral class for the elections to the boards. However, problems do exist, especially in relation to the Shannon and ESB dimension. I have met their representatives. The problem is that the ESB holds the licence and, therefore, that category does not come in. Everyone who has a vote must have a licence and because they have a licence through the ESB they do not have the number of votes. That is a serious problem and I undertook to examine it.</P>
    <P>One of the things I will do is set up an eels strategic review group to examine all the issues. We are going to do that following discussions with the eel fishermen. We will examine all the issues then, including strategic development as well as the regulation of the eel industry. Early in the new year the group will be set up. The other points mentioned by Senator O'Toole will be covered in his amendments.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn raised the need for a representative from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development with regard to water quality. Senator Dardis and another Senator also raised this question. Rather than having a farming representative we changed it to a representative so that we can have someone from Teagasc. If it was left purely as farming we would be limited and it would have to be a farmer. Now there is an option to have people from Teagasc. In some cases that may be the best option. There will be a representative from the Department on each regional board. It is not precluded as a possibility on the Central Fisheries Board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" /> Senator Taylor-Quinn raised the issue of share certificates. The Senator got it the wrong way around. Originally in the Bill we were making them voluntary. They want them to continue to be compulsory. It was the review group who suggested that they should be made voluntary. We said fair enough, if people want them voluntary then we will have them voluntary. Once the Bill was published and when we came to discussing it subsequently they said they would prefer if they remained compulsory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Provided they are resolved to have them compulsory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. They have the option of having them compulsory if they so wish. They can have it either way. There was a desire to maintain the compulsory option.</P>
      <P>Senator Bonner raised the possibility of representation for individual organisations on the Central Fisheries Board. They will be comprehensively represented on the regional boards. The Central Fisheries Board will be a different type of board and will be closer to the normal State board. We had discussions with them on that. They felt that as long as they were well represented and had the representation they had previously they would have good representation.</P>
      <P>Sea angling is an electoral class for the regional boards. There will be at least one on each board. Funding of £24 million is included in the national development plan.</P>
      <P>The collapse of the price of eels arose because to a flood of cheap silver eels in Europe. We have provided funding for the Erne development and it will be very interesting. We will review the eel problem in the context of the eel strategic review group. In that context we will look at the Erne problem.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole asked about the relationship between the inland waterways body, the Implementation Body on fisheries, the Irish Lights Commission and the regional fisheries boards and Central Fisheries Board. There will be no overlapping of responsibilities between the new implementation body and the boards. There is a complementary relationship and links just as there was between the boards and the Office of Public Works. The inland waterways body is responsible for navigation and development of the water bodies that come under its aegis. There will be a close relationship between the Foyle, Carlingford and the Irish Lights Commission and the regional boards. The last section in the Bill excludes the areas of Foyle and Carlingford from the remit of the board because that involves North-South sharing and the exclusion of Carlingford area from the Dundalk Fishery Board. That area is specifically excluded in the Bill and is a reflection of the sharing which takes place in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole raised the question of eels. The eel strategic review group, which I have mentioned, will deal with the kinds of problems to <Col N="1327" /> which he referred. Senator Dardis and Senator O'Toole referred to the importance of differentiating very clearly between the Fisheries Bill, 1987, which was a rod licence Bill, and this one, which is a very different type of Bill. The 1987 Bill introduced a licence and a licence fee for trout and coarse angling. This Bill involves regional and local empowerment, encouraging angling clubs, etc. It is a new framework to be linked with the £24 million provided under the NDP. It is a completely different situation where we are giving out money rather than looking for money from people. Things are very different now.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis also referred to the representation of aquaculture on the boards. Aquaculture includes shellfish farming as well as salmon farming. There will only be one representative from that industry on the whole board and if one is going to co-operate with people in a region and work these things out, it is preferable that they work them out there <i>ab initio.</i> There is a reason aquaculture and inland fisheries cannot be developed in a compatible way, as they are in many places around the country.</P>
    <P>On annual reports, the Central Fisheries Board has to submit its own report and those of each regional fisheries board within four months. They can collate the information in advance. I note the point made by Senator Dardis but now all the boards of semi-State bodies are required to submit their reports within six months and this is in keeping with that. Annual accounts are dealt with separately and not within the same time frame. Difficulty with delays on some of the annual accounts involve the Comptroller and Auditor General's office because there is such a volume going through that office, they have some difficulty being up to date. They have them all within a year in any event.</P>
    <P>The analogy with the GAA clubs, raised by Senator O'Meara, is not apposite. We are discussing a common shared public resource. The question of ownership, entitlements and legal evidence is not a prerequisite of catchment management. Most of the problems raised, for instance, by the people from Killarney related to a pilot study where difficulties have arisen. The first thing to bear in mind is that the catchment management approach is a voluntary approach, the problem with which is that problems can be unearthed in the course of these discussions. If they are, then it is better that they be faced and solutions found. There are no threats to anybody. On that issue, I have undertaken to go down early in the new year to have discussions with representatives of the Killarney anglers and try to deal with the problems they have had for some time. We will try to find a resolution for some of them.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan raised the question of catchment management. I stress that this concerns consultation. He also raised the matter of tagging. FISSTA and the other angling organisations were very keen on tagging and the salmon commission <Col N="1328" /> will now be introducing these. All the organisations will be represented on the commission. They will introduce the tagging. There are many practical problems and there are various people who do not want it. There have been cases where people said they were not catching any salmon, only one, two or three but when it came to how many tags they wanted, five were not enough. It is going to bring out these kinds of problems in different areas but we will have to deal with them as they arise. The salmon commission will have the task of doing that now.</P>
    <P>I have covered very briefly the problem of pollution which was raised by Senator Taylor-Quinn, the questions about chairpersons and so on. I have explained that fairly well. I have no vested interest in any of this. I wanted to do what people wanted and what the reviews and the study groups recommended. When one produces the Bill people say, &ldquo;That was fine, I said that at the study group but I have talked to more people now myself and I do not want to do it that way, I want to do it a slightly different way&rdquo;. We have had all those discussions and consultations. However, we can progress from there now.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn referred to a less bureaucratic and formal approach. We will consider that where possible and we will try to ensure it happens. She raised questions about the IMDO, the Irish Maritime Development Office, and providing the shipping services which she felt was a wise move. A question raised by Senator O'Toole was on the IMDO, which is mainly for the major commercial vessels. We will examine how to relate that to the leisure sector. I plan to bring in special procedures for leisure craft registration and the new IMDO will help me to develop a simplified scheme for these boats in the non-commercial area where they have much expertise. A group is examining that and has given us an interim report. The full report will be produced by the end of February. We will then have an opportunity to examine that urgently for the coming season. We want the necessary degree of regulation without being over-regulated. That is where we will have to find the balance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>A standard European report is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Some matters will be standardised with Europe, for instance, if a boat is brought over to Spain or France, immediately one has to comply with their requirements which are very minimal from a safety point of view and only require the completion of a course. If we have something similar, it will match that. This is the sort of thing the group is examining now. It has submitted an interim report and the full report will be submitted quite soon. I assure Senator O'Toole that his concerns will be addressed. On the registration of vessels, the registration relates to commercial vessels but again the group will deal with that issue, particularly concerning <Col N="1329" /> power boats and jet skis. These will be dealt with in the report.</P>
      <P>I was asked why there was a need for an Irish register in regard to the IMDO. That would have many benefits in regard to the services which we supply and the fiscal incentives required to employ more people in this fast growing area. Up to 75 per cent of the shipping industry is shore-based and we want to attract more of those jobs in Ireland. This is an area in which we have lost out enormously in the past 20 years. We lost Irish Shipping which was the worldwide flagship for the Irish shipping industry. In any event, we want to get back into that sector and the IMDO will be instrumental in achieving that.</P>
      <P>I referred to the implementation bodies. There is an exclusion involved here in so far as Carlingford Lough and Lough Foyle will be run by the Implementation Bodies. That is how North-South sharing will operate and the legislation caters for that. We are not directly involved in the inland waterways but the Office of Public Works is involved in their maintenance. As far as fishing is concerned, other than the Carlingford and Foyle areas which will be run separately, there will not be any change in regard to the regional boards.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis referred to traceability which is one of the reasons for the tagging. There is some argument as to whether full tags are required or whether there is some other means by which farmed salmon can be traced. That issue is currently being discussed. There is no doubt that traceability is essential.</P>
      <P>Considerable emphasis was placed on eels and their importance. A strategic review group will be established early in the new year to examine that issue. Senators referred to the Killarney pilot catchment scheme. The emphasis here is on voluntary participation. I would be happy to meet with fishermen and those who are concerned about their boats being on the lakes at an early stage in the new year.</P>
      <P>This Bill is about the devolution of power and, in time, its provisions will have a major impact on the development of the inland fisheries resource.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to a minor point regarding the protection of molluscs which I neglected to mention on Second Stage and which relates to the proliferation of zebra mussels. Signs are posted on the great western lakes, for instance, warning people to ensure their boats are properly cleaned. However, I am not sure whether the level of observance is adequate. I visited North Carolina last year where rangers patrol the lakeshores inspecting people's boats. I am not suggesting that would be possible here but I wonder what measures can be taken to ensure that this pest does not proliferate further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a hugely important issue. It is too late to talk about the mussels not proliferating because there are already bucket loads of them in evidence along the Shannon's tributaries and they may proceed to the lakes. An environmental balance must be struck at some stage whereby the mussels will reach a level of equilibrium with their environment. That must have happened in other places. There must come a stage at which the mussels will no longer continue to increase in numbers because the environment will be unable to sustain them. The mussels have carried out one great job &ndash; they have cleaned the Shannon's waters to an unprecedented level of visibility. It is now possible to see clearly ten feet down to the bottom of the river. That is the only positive comment I can make about the mussels. It seems to me that if the ecosystems have been damaged by the mussels, as they certainly have with the resultant lack of coarse fish, in particular, in many places, nature will fight back at some point, the ecosystems will find a new balance and the mussels will no longer increase at their current level. Would such an event improve other elements of the ecosystem and could the zebra mussels have a positive influence in that regard?</P>

      <P>Zebra mussels can cause major problems for some people. Guidelines are in place on this matter and they must be checked frequently and be properly implemented. Senator Dardis expressed concern about the level of observance of warnings. It seems to me from parliamentary questions that the situation is reasonably well under control and that the zebra mussels are not spreading too rapidly. The Marine <Col N="1331" /> Institute has produced some reports on the situation to date. I will ask it to produce a comprehensive report which will take the Senators' concerns into account, particularly in regard to whether the mussels may have any beneficial, as opposed detrimental, effects and on how it might be possible to keep the mussels under control.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat confused. In terms of the Central Fisheries Board's powers and functions, the 1980 Act states that the central board shall co-ordinate, where it considers necessary so to do, and direct the performance by regional boards of their functions. I cannot find any authority given here to the Central Fisheries Board to direct a regional board. Perhaps it is included in the Bill but there is a contrast here with the explicit power given to the Minister in section 10 of the Bill to issue directives. I am not particularly keen about the kind of decentralising which leaves powers in the Minister's hands to give orders and takes powers away from the centralised body. That is not necessarily decentralisation. In fact, many would see it as the opposite of decentralisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very essential element. If the power to direct were left with the central board, everything would have to be cleared by it before it could go anywhere else. That would mean that all the time of the central board would be taken up with that kind of activity. We are devolving that type of responsibility to the regional boards. However, having devolved responsibility, we have provided for a situation in which the central board advises the Minister that there is a problem and wants the Minister to give a direction. It is common in legislation to have a function in reserve, for example, the function of giving a direction where that is required. The board has the function of advising the Minister in that regard. The Senator has put his finger on the kernel of the Bill. This is something that was debated considerably beforehand. Power cannot be devolved without involving authority, and if authority is involved, it means that the regional board directs, and that it has responsibility for management and control in that region. However, if the central board feels, on any issue, that the board is being unreasonable, it is open to it to advise the Minister and request him or her to give a direction to the regional board. That is why that function is kept in reserve with the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was a need for the Minister to give a direction to the central board, the officials in the Department would advise him or her of the need for the central board to take a particular action. That is included in the legislation. The Minister can request or direct the central board to undertake some action. In a way it is management by exception. Let us not forget what the alternative was, which was the problem. The alternative was that the central board had the power to direct everything, which meant it was responsible for that direction. One cannot have one without the other in that respect. That meant the central board would be involved in clearing everything, which meant the regional boards had little authority in their own right. That authority has now been devolved to the regional boards. In response to the concerns of the central board where there is a need for direction, we introduced that measure which is included in other legislation, that the Minister can, on the advice of the board, give that type of direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to pursue this too far. The Minister said it is management by exception. However, what is to prevent a Minister &ndash; not this Minister obviously &ndash; from making a stupid direction to the central board? There is no procedure whereby he must take advice. The central board can give advice, and I am quite happy with the principle of decentralising power to the regional boards. I do not want to jump to section 10 lest the Chair remind me that I should not, but it is difficult to discuss this without reference to section 10. Section 10 is fairly bald. It says that &ldquo;the Minister may, from time to time, give to the central board . . .  directions for the management, conservation, protection, development or improvement of fisheries. . . &rdquo;. That is a fair mouthful. I could understand a provision that the Minister may give directions to regional boards on the advice of the central board. However, it appears that there is hardly a function of the central board where the Minister, without any accountability other than to the Oireachtas or to a committee of the House, can give a direction, and these directions are not even subject to scrutiny as statutory instruments. It is a classic bit of Irish decentralisation where we give power but, just in case it is not exercised in the way we want, we reserve the right to stop it being exercised. I am not madly keen on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Directions can be in relation to positive as well as what might be called negative <Col N="1333" /> events. The fishermen who spoke to me had almost the opposite view. They did not want too much power in the local region &ndash; on the catchment side particularly &ndash; preferring the Minister to look after matters rather than local interests who might make decisions they would not like. We discussed this <i>ad nauseam</i> with the board. The central board wants to keep power. However, the whole purpose of this is to devolve power. Having done that, and to meet its concerns, we made sure that directions can be given by the Minister. The Senator said that the Minister is not accountable, but the Minister is responsible to both Houses of the Oireachtas and has to answer questions in the Houses, on the Adjournment, on special notice, during ordinary Question Time, in relation to the making of orders, etc. One finds that, from time to time, it is necessary to make things happen in particular areas. For instance, it may be a question of devolving power and authority in relation to a particular river. This arose in the case of the Moy. Everybody was happy to devolve authority in respect of the Moy. However, there were certain people who were not too happy about it. I could go into the reasons, but one does or does not devolve authority, and the people on the ground in that region wanted it devolved and had done a huge amount of work to make sure everything was right. However, up to the day it happened there was resistance. This will clarify situations like that. There is no need for worry about that because a Minister, in any situation in the future, will have to come before the House, and the House has the widest possible involvement and supervision of the actions of a Minister. If things were happening where there was no relationship, that would be different. The central board wanted, in exceptional situations, to be able to advise the Minister if it was concerned about something and ask him to give a direction. That is reasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a certain amount of ambiguity if the words &ldquo;where necessary&rdquo; are included. The board might ask the Minister to give a direction where there is friction between the central board and the regional boards. Perhaps it might be better if the words &ldquo;where necessary&rdquo; were left out. I can see the Minister's point, but if he could give the necessary assurances for which the central board is looking, we might be able to get over the issue. It seems there are certain reservations about the words &ldquo;where necessary&rdquo; in this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The concern was about who would consider it necessary. In other words, <Col N="1334" /> would the Central Fisheries Board take action where necessary on its own initiative or would the Minister? I know there were some suggestions that the Bill might be amended to say &ldquo;where necessary the central board considers&rdquo;, but I am not sure that is required because the legislation is reasonably clear. However, it would be no harm for the Minister to elaborate on it.</P>

      <P>I am still confused about the relationship between the Bill and the implementation bodies. I am aware of the decision taken this week in relation to Carlingford and Irish Lights, however, that is not what I am talking about. My understanding is that there is a further development in the North-South Implementation Bodies in terms of inland waterways which will give a North-South body authority to implement certain things regarding&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for interrupting the Senator, but does this relate to section 5?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes it does. It also relates to what I said earlier. The functions of the central board are outlined in section 5 and include administering &ldquo;schemes, grants and other financial facilities requiring the disbursement of European Union and such other funds&rdquo; under the new section 8(2)(c) and having &ldquo;regard to the need for the sustainable development of the inland fisheries resource&rdquo;, etc., under the new section 8(2)(f). Subsection (4) of the new section gives authority to the central board to charge fees for certain services. There are many other functions, but in regard to these examples there will be a conflict between the board and the North-South Implementation Body dealing with certain inland waterways in places such as the Shannon and the Erne.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I have a fundamental misunderstanding of the provisions, but it seems there is a serious conflict between the responsibilities outlined in the Bill for the central board and the authority of the North-South Implementation Body concerned with inland waterways. This is only an opinion as I have not heard enough detail regarding the North-South Implementation Bodies and the extent of their authority. In fact, I have asked on three or four occasions in the House for a detailed explanation in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with fish while the body responsible for waterways is dealing with canals. The relationship will be similar to that which exists in terms of ourselves and the Office of Public Works. The implementation body will be participating in some of the functions of the Office of Public Works, but that is not a matter for this Bill. Rather it is a matter which concerns the Office of Public Works and the body responsible for inland waterways, which is not part of our remit. The position is very clear in terms of our remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1335" /> As mentioned by the Senator, there has been a demarcation with regard to Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough. There will be no change in terms of my Department and the inland waterways, but there will be a change in so far as we will relate to whatever arrangements are arrived at by the implementation body responsible for inland waterways, just as we currently relate to the Office of Public Works. That is a matter which falls outside the Bill. It is a parallel issue but does not change the position for us, except that we could be dealing with the Office of Public Works and a body in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have yet to see how the legislation in that regard will be designed, but I see no problem with it. We are dealing with fish and inland fisheries throughout the country, with the exclusion of Carlingford Lough and Lough Foyle &ndash; that is very clear cut. It will be more difficult to design legislation for the inland waterways, but whatever the final outcome we will relate to the relevant body in the same way we currently relate to the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Cathaoirleach has returned. He will be aware and can confirm for the Minister that not a month has gone by in the past four years that I have not raised the confusion and conflict of interest arising from the dozens of different bodies having authority over certain elements of our waterways. With due respect to the Minister, it does not matter whether we are talking about a canal or an inland waterway as fish are part of both. I understand the point made by the Minister and agree that the function of the Office of Public Works might be transferred to a new body. This Bill further complicates the issue. A precise example of what I am saying can be found in the new section 8(2)(f) of the 1980 Act which is outlined in section 5 of the Bill. It provides that the central board shall</P>
      <P>in the performance of its functions, have regard to the need for the sustainable development of the inland fisheries resource (including the conservation of fish and other species of fauna and flora habitats and the biodiversity of inland water ecosystems).</P>
      <P>This is in conflict with or parallels the responsibilities which will be given to one of the other bodies. The new section 8(4) provides that</P>
      <P>The Central Board may provide such services for the management, conservation . . .  or promotion of fisheries or matters relating to fisheries, and charge such fees in respect of the provision of those services.</P>
      <P>This is relevant to the operation of weirs and many matters which will impact on many other river users who will have nothing to do with fishing. There is a huge conflict in this regard and this will make the position worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago, under the tutelage of Fianna Fáil, the House introduced the Shannon River <Col N="1336" /> Council Bill, the aim of which was to get rid of some of the complications. I put it to the Minister that this section creates a further complication in terms of specifying the authorities of the central board. There is nothing wrong with the responsibilities outlined, but it is a formula for conflict which will give rise to difficulties of interpretation. There will be people running up and down both sides of the river, people from inland fisheries and river wardens, with different conclusions being arrived at &ndash; I cannot see it being otherwise. Responsibility for flora, fauna, etc. must rest with whoever has overall control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Overall control will not change. That is why I said the inland waterways and the Office of Public Works currently have responsibility for navigational channels, including canals. We were requested by the National Safety Council, and the Government agreed during the summer, to take over responsibility for the safety of our inland waterways and rivers. That is an evolution in the way we approach such issues. We have the professionalism to do it.</P>

      <P>The Senator mentioned biodiversity, which is more in keeping with our responsibilities. We must be concerned about the &ldquo;conservation of fish and other species of fauna and flora habitats and the biodiversity of inland water eco systems&rdquo;. This gives us a statutory involvement in something which is crucial to the fishing and angling sectors. It has been suggested that a Shannon authority should be set up to look after everything.</P>

Efforts have been made to improve the Barrow by the Barrow Drainage Board, the Barrow Navigation Board, the New Ross Harbour Commissioners and the <Col N="1337" /> Office of Public Works. It is difficult to get a consensus on how things should be developed. I would like an overarching system which tells them to get their act together. I know that is not a prudent or politically correct thing to say when one is trying to get everyone on side, but otherwise it will become a recipe for doing nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>But I agree with the Minister about devolving power to the regions, which the Bill does effectively and well. However, it could cause people to question the need for the central board and why the regions cannot report directly to the Minister. Can the central board direct itself or, if it considers it correct, can it proceed without any reference to the Minister? </P>
      <P>Section 5(2)(f) relates to the protection of the national heritage within the meaning of the Heritage Act, 1995. The forestry people are active in Inchagoill in the middle of Lough Corrib, which is an important resource. I am unclear about how the various authorities interface with one another in protecting that natural resource. There are heritage items on the island, such as an early Christian church and one of the earliest Christian crosses in Ireland. I am unclear about the central board's role in this regard. It seems it should be the Office of Public Works and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources which decide what needs to be done, almost without reference to the central board or to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody wants the central board to be a talking shop. It should promote, support, facilitate and co-ordinate activities in this area. Will the central board govern itself or will it be told what it should promote, support, facilitate and co-ordinate? Perhaps the Minister could clarify what is meant by &ldquo;where necessary&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The phrase, &ldquo;where necessary&rdquo;, means the central board will decide where it is necessary to promote, support, facilitate and co-ordinate. The issue only arises with ministerial directions. This is a different type of management. People understand the type of management where someone is told to do something and if they do not do it, their wages will be docked. Senator Burke is right that there are solid functions in co-ordinating and advising the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no strategic plans for all these developments. There are different studies for lakes in different parts of the country but we cannot base plans on those. We must have strategic plans for the development of the resource which are well worked out. That is the type of thing the board has not had the time or the opportunity with which to deal. By delegating functions to the regional boards, the central board can do more to support them and to help them to develop in different areas. Central board officials might become worried that it will just be a talking shop. <Col N="1338" /> However, that will not happen. If it does, it will not be doing the job we want it to do. We want it to support, promote, co-ordinate and develop these plans.</P>
    <P>One of the first things I asked the board to do in 1992 when I became Minister for the Marine was to develop a plan. When I was Minister for Social Welfare, we put together a plan after arguments and debates so that at least we knew where we were going. Although the central board had experts and specialists, it did not have plans. It prepared an excellent short term plan on which we got £17.5 million or £18 million. One does not get that level of money unless there is a good plan.</P>
    <P>I accept this is a new approach. I plan in the early part of the new year to meet the new board to ascertain how this will work. It needs to put new energy and drive into it. Why should I be faced with all the problems in the areas around Killarney or anywhere else? There are issues which should be resolved but that does not mean a local or regional board should deal with them from the first instance. There are issues which are not being resolved which must be pulled together and co-ordinated. That would allow us to see what is happening on the Moy and in Killarney and the lessons which can be learned. People would have to sit down and plan where they are going. We must also look at what we are doing in comparison to other countries and the lessons we can learn from them.</P>
    <P>There is an exciting and interesting role for the central board but it must be developed. It will be a new role and it will answer many of the questions which are raised again and again but which are never resolved, leading to more debates and legislation. What else can I do? I cannot co-ordinate all these things; I work long days as it is. There is not enough time for me to do this. The central board will have to meet people, co-ordinate and develop. The people down the line will be responsible for their own expenditure. The central board will help them to install modern management and accounting techniques. One of the reports mentioned savaged the lack of accounting procedures. That must be put right. There is a lot of work to be done before the central board would run out of steam. It will have a creative role for a long time.</P>

The Minister stated that the Bill is based on the principles of devolution, subsidiarity, partnership and quality of service. Those involved in eel fishing have a view different to the views of other groups. They feel they are victims of large bodies such as the ESB. I do not know if that is true but these people feel they have a problem and that their interests are very different to those of salmon fishermen, for instance. Their views should be heard.</P>
      <P>They are also bothered that while great trouble has been gone to to mention many different kinds of fishing, eel fishing is not mentioned. It is different to coarse fishing and trout fishing and deserves a mention in the legislation. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment and to include those involved in the development of commercial eel fishing.</P>

      <P>The Senator is concerned that eel fishermen are not mentioned in the Bill. Eel fishermen are already an electoral class for elections to the board. They are recognised. There are, however, problems on the River Shannon. The situation arises there because ESB holds the licence and the eel fishermen have an arrangement with it for a sub-licence.</P>

      <P>It is difficult for the layman to understand legislation; it is difficult enough for us to pursue it, that is why we have the parliamentary draftsman and legal advisers. Both points are covered in the Bill. They have an entitlement in the elections and I explained that to them. Their difficulty, which we will examine and attempt to resolve, is that their licence comes from the ESB and, because the votes are related to licences, they do not have the number of licences they would otherwise have on the Shannon. We will look at that for them. The function already exists for the promotion and develop of all fisheries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. It would put the Minister in a dilemma if he accepted an amendment because he would have to return to the Dáil with the Bill and he would not want to do that. There may, however, be an escape clause for him in section 7(1)(c). That allows the Minister to alter the number of elected members of a regional board by order. Under the 1980 Act the Minister can lay an order before both Houses of the Oireachtas when this legislation is implemented. He could alter or vary the number of elected members and he could also give effect to this amendment. I therefore support the amendment. The people concerned have made a good case for their representation on regional boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the reasoning behind the amendment. The Minister has correctly pointed out that the categories are specified within the co-operatives and the other organisations. If one goes down the road suggested there is a need for consistency. It is suggested that some other group, say the coarse fishermen, should not have to jump the fence but should be able to get in at the first hurdle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point made by both Senators. The problem only arises in the Shannon region because of the special circumstances applying there. There is no problem in other areas. The parliamentary draftsman will not accept this amendment because it is global in scope. That is covered, in terms of category, fishing types and elections. The only place where a problem with elections arises is in the Shannon region and that is because of the ESB. We must look at that separately and return to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Burke mentioned other ways of inclusion and of getting more representation for the Shannon region in terms of individuals and numbers. We will look at that also. I am amenable to making whatever changes are necessary to ensure they have the representation their num<Col N="1341" /> bers merit in terms of elections. We will look at that separately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct and it covers a huge area. The strength of any democracy should be measured by how well it treats its minorities. I see the Minister's point about the representational area although I do not fully agree with it. In any event it is well balanced on the other side. The people concerned are dealing with large bodies and they feel they are not getting a fair deal from the largest body on the river, which controls everything on it, including the water levels. They already have an interest in salmon fishing and in this context the commercial eel fishermen believe they are losing out and that their voice is not being heard. I do not intend to press this amendment, but I will be taking a different view on amendment No. 2 because it takes a different approach in singling out specific areas of fishing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of aquaculture I agree with the Minister's concern with balance, but it should weigh towards those who protect the resource. In <Col N="1342" /> the Bundorragh-Delphi Fishery near Lenaune fishermen are rearing salmon, going to sea and returning. The fish are being cropped by anglers within the system. Is that aquaculture or another activity? Perhaps it needs to be specified.</P>

      <P>This is a different category to salmon farmers. Senator O'Toole correctly points out they are already within the IFA. I have referred to their role in this context. By contrast, these people ranch, which is different from salmon farming. They rear the fish, the fish then go to sea, return and are cropped. The other matter deals with aquaculture and the Minister kindly referred to the position of Teagasc. Organisations, professions or occupations relating to agriculture mean, by definition, the IFA and the ICMSA in addition to Teagasc. As a practising farmer I have problems with the involvement of farmers in the protection of this resource.</P>

      <P>It is necessary to have a balance with aquaculture. The question here is to try and ensure it occurs from within. That is the purpose of having people on the board. The balance is very substantially in favour of the anglers because only a few people in total from areas such as aquaculture will be included. At least they will be included to help in development work. In this regard the Bundorragh-Delphi Fishery has been very successful, although it is a half-way house.

      <P>&ldquo;(f)encourage, promote and develop commercial eel fishing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We are discussing what the regional board shall do. When I made an earlier proposal the Minister argued that the people I was seeking to have represented could find representation under other guises and were not, in fact, excluded. I wanted them specifically mentioned because I felt they were not being treated equally with other groups. Nevertheless, I agreed not to press that amendment.</P>

      <P>Paragraph 8(1)(e) states that the regional board shall &ldquo;ensure that any oyster or other mollusc fishery in its fisheries region is protected in accordance with such direction of the Minister as relates to a fishery of that kind&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (f) states:</P>
      <P>encourage, promote, market and develop angling for salmon, trout, coarse fish and sea-fish and, for the purposes of any or all of those kinds of angling, provide such facilities and amenities, if any, as it thinks fit,</P>
      <P>We are back to that phrase &ldquo;as it thinks fit&rdquo;. I wonder why it is repeatedly used in the Bill. There is no reference to eel. It is not covered. It is not referred to as a coarse fish, it is not necessarily a sea-fish and it is obviously not salmon or trout. It is the only fish excluded.</P>
      <P>I could probably live with a single word amendment and the insertion of the word &ldquo;eel&rdquo;. However, there is another issue. This is an industry. The commercial eel fishing industry is small but it is an industry. People are worried about it and they are simply seeking support. I propose that we insert a new paragraph to provide that one of its functions would be to &ldquo;encourage, promote and develop commercial eel fishing&rdquo;. I do not believe that will happen under the Bill as it stands.</P>
      <P>People in the industry believe it cannot develop because their relationship with the ESB is an unequal one. Now they see another body descending on them but they believe they will not have equality of treatment because their industry is not mentioned in the legislation. It is not included in section 8. A reference to eel fishing should be inserted either by including the word &ldquo;eel&rdquo; in paragraph (f) on Report Stage or by accepting the new paragraph to &ldquo;encourage, promote and develop commercial eel fishing&rdquo;.</P>

Earlier in the section there is the broader cover for encouraging, promoting and developing &ldquo;in accordance with such development plan, promote and encourage the management, conservation, protection, development and improvement of the fisheries. . . &rdquo;  The issue is covered in the Bill. We have the power to do what the Senator seeks in his amendment. What needs to be done, particularly for the Shannon, is to look at what is needed for that area. We will meet the fishermen early in the new year to devise a plan to remove the problems they have and see what else needs to be done on their behalf. We will have to make further arrangements at that stage.</P>
      <P>The general concept of encouraging and promoting is included in the Bill and it can be done. If anything is missing, the Minister can direct that something is done. There is no way we will leave them out. They were extremely concerned, particularly the fishermen on the Shannon. I met them and told them we would take action on their behalf.

      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's amendment. As the Minister pointed out, there is a difficulty for eel fisheries on the Shannon with regard to the ESB's salmon fisheries. As a result, the eel fishermen consider themselves to be at a disadvantage and they believe the eel fishery in that area is being damaged.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate that the Minister will meet them and put in place the necesssary arrangements to satisfy them, it would be a pity if anything in this Bill precluded such arrangements. Other fisheries are recognised in the Bill but the word &ldquo;eel&rdquo; does not feature. The fishermen might feel more protected if eel fishing were mentioned in the paragraph, as Senator O'Toole correctly suggested. In paragraph (f) it should be possible to insert the words &ldquo;eel fisheries&rdquo; after &ldquo;trout&rdquo; or &ldquo;coarse fish&rdquo;. That might meet the difficulty.</P>

      <P>They are on the boards at present and that will continue. The only problem is in the Shannon area and that is an ESB problem which might require new legislation. I have met the fishermen and I told them we would take action on that early in the new year. There is nothing more I can do. I do not need the powers in this legislation to do anything more. In the new year we can see what legislative changes are needed. The problem relates to the legislation and the current position of the ESB and we will have to discuss that urgently. I said I would do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not about angling. The only reference to angling is in paragraph (f). The Minister can ignore that paragraph because I only suggested it as a fall back solution. I accept the Minister's argument about that paragraph. I am proposing the insertion of a new paragraph after paragraph (e) which would state &ldquo;encourage, promote and develop commercial eel fishing&rdquo;. I do not seek to replace the existing paragraph (f) but to insert a new paragraph which focuses on commercial eel fishing. It involves a small group of people in Senator Taylor-Quinn's constituency about whom many of us are concerned. They feel left out and I ask the Minister to accept that.</P>

      <P>The Senator knows I cannot accept the amendment. It is not necessary especially when it is separate from a paragraph which is concerned with encouraging, promoting, marketing and developing sea-fish, coarse fish and the angling side generally. Putting it between the two means it is part of general fishing and, as such, it is already covered. If I included that paragraph, it would be necessary to include every other type of fishing and state the same with regard to each, which is unnecessary. Eel fishing is already covered in the legislation so I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Under existing legislation one regional fisheries board may employ another to provide protection and ensure conservation. The Naval Service is hired by the regional fisheries boards and from time to time one finds officers of different boards on board Naval Service vessels. In many instances salmon fishing vessels are arrested. What criteria are laid down on how these officers should fulfil their role? I am aware of instances where nets have been taken from fishermen. In some instances only the quantity of net in excess of the legal limit was taken while in others the entire quantity was confiscated. Why is there a lack of uniformity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it dealt with in legislation? We are dealing with management, conservation and protection. In relation to conservation and protection, these specific operational procedures take place. On a number of occasions there have been discrepancies and inequality in the application of the law. I would like to know how these officers can, in one instance, take the entire net off a fisherman and, in another instance, take the surplus net over and above what is legally allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something that would be co-ordinated by the Central Fisheries Board. It is an operational matter, a day-to-day matter which occurs all the time. It has no specific relationship to this. If there was a major issue that the central board felt the Minister should be advised on and <Col N="1351" /> that he should issue some direction on, that would be different but they operate under separate legislation which covers the penalties. If someone exceeded themselves in relation to penalties that would have to be dealt with. This is inland fisheries.</P>

      <P>In the interest of trying to be helpful, and I know that there is pressure on the Minister, he gave me assurances earlier when I pushed the issue of eel fisheries. He is aware that I have tabled other amendments. In section 10 it states:</P>
      <P>18A.&ndash;(1)The Minister may, from time to time, give to the Central Board or a regional board policy directions for the management, conservation, protection, development or improvement of fisheries. . . . </P>
      <P>I do not want to push these issues tonight but I would like to hear the Minister say that, following consultation with the eel fishing interests, he will give a direction, if necessary, under this order for their protection and development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to compliment and criticise the Minister. I congratulate him on setting a six months deadline for publication. However, I would love to see it much earlier. When I came into the House in 1993 publication deadlines were not mentioned. Reducing it to six months is a step forward. I urge the Minister to consider making <Col N="1352" /> the time shorter. I know it is three months for regional boards and four months for the Central FisheriesBoard. He is moving in the right direction regarding the publication of accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is trying to do that with all reports and they are all nearly into the six month period. The financial side causes the most problems because it must go to the Comptroller and Auditor General. With the new pressures the Government has placed on that aspect the Comptroller and Auditor General has had some difficulties in some cases. There are some special instances where the Comptroller and Auditor General must take more time. I accept the Senator's point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister and his Department will ensure that this will be done. In the 1998 legislation there was a section that stated it should be every five years but in reality only one or two reports have been published by the Central Fisheries Board over the past 20 years. This shows a total disdain for the legislation. I hope the Department will ensure that this does not happen on this occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 22 is badly drafted. Section 22(1) states: &ldquo;The Act of 1980 is hereby amended by the substitution of the following for Part V.&rdquo;  That should read &ldquo;the Act of 1980, as amended by Fisheries Act, 1997&rdquo;, because the Act of 1980 contains a section 54 which was deleted by the Fisheries Act, 1997, and this is profoundly misleading. Furthermore, since section 55 has been removed reference to sections 55A and 55B, etc. are quite anomalous. It should be section 55 followed by section 55A, etc. The use of &ldquo;55A&rdquo; in the section is incorrect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We took up this matter with the parliamentary draftsman on a number of occasions during the drafting of this Bill. He confirmed that this is the correct expression. I had better not try to go into the reason because there are a number of blanks where things were removed previously. We cannot put something back into the blanks so we must insert things after them. It is something like that. It is a complicated matter but he confirmed that that is the right way to do it.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that the Minister is present. It is good to have opportunities to raise matters in Private Members' time because unless we had raised this matter last year and again this year, we may not have had the Mental Health Bill, 1999, as quickly.

      <P>This motion is in response to not just this report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals but because Senator Henry raised it last year in Private Member's time and I had pleasure in supporting her on the matter. It is a very serious issue. Despite the fact that the Mental Health Bill has been published, it addresses a specific issue but I will keep to the inspector's report.</P>
      <P>With regard to the national development plan and the moneys allocated in it, which I raised when we debated it, specific areas are referred to. It will seek to address major unmet needs &ndash; I am glad the word &ldquo;major&rdquo; is used because they are major &ndash; in the provision of modern accommodation for the mentally ill and the physically disabled, to provide facilities for persons with an intellectual disability and to develop a range of facilities for the elderly, because there are elderly people in mental institutions when they should not be, and to provide a comprehensive, quality and accessible acute hospital infrastructure. These elements are all interlinked.</P>
      <P>I am sure nobody would disagree if the Minister took the funding from a few kilometres of our national roads and infrastructure, to radically improve the position in mental hospitals. It would go a long way to improve the dire situation described in the inspector's report. That is how I would prioritise the allocation of the pounds, shillings and pence. Infrastructural needs are important but a small part of the infrastructural moneys could eliminate the tremendous problems in hospitals as outlined in the inspector's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At Christmas time one thinks of <i>A Christmas Carol,</i> Ebeneezer Scrooge and Dickens. &ldquo;Dickensian&rdquo; is the word I would use to describe the conditions highlighted in chapter after chapter, area after area, mental hospital after mental hospital. I would use the word &ldquo;antediluvian&rdquo;. The conditions are totally inadequate and unacceptable as we approach the millennium. It is not as if we <Col N="1355" /> were raising this for the first time &ndash; last year Senator Henry introduced the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for debate. Up to then I do not know if the reports were ever debated. Perhaps that is why we are so horrified because the general public would not have been aware of the issue. They were not aware until Vincent Browne highlighted it in his radio programme and had to give it two weeks of exposure due to the tremendous response he received. Maybe this was due to the anonymity of radio where one can ring in and give an impression of what one sees. One may not feel able to do it otherwise because of the sensitivity and confidentiality associated with mental health problems. He aired this matter very passionately and recently the subject of the psychiatric treatment of prisoners and the Central Mental Hospital cropped up again. We have raised this matter many times in this House on the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>What disturbs me most is the fact that mentally ill patients are still the stigmatised Cinderellas of our health system. The reason is that they are voiceless and cannot speak for themselves. Due to the sensitivities I mentioned, their families find it very hard to raise the issue publicly. We rely on the inspector, Dr. Dermot Walsh, through his report to get the Minister's attention and the attention of the health boards throughout the country to alleviate the plight of so many people.</P>
    <P>We heralded the patient's charter as a great step forward but, unfortunately, there is not parity of implementation. The mental health sector is one where there should be parity of implementation, because as I pointed out, they are the weakest element of our society, they are voiceless and vulnerable, and they should get the greatest protection and care. This is extremely important. I hope that there are officials in the Department of Health and Children who monitor the patient's charter to ensure it is implemented because it benchmarks the most basic of patients' rights, the rights of those in mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>In the short time available I cannot go through the report page by page but I will pick out obvious areas. For instance, plans were mooted to have an acute psychiatric section in Beaumont hospital and this has not happened. I do not know why. What happened to the idea? Is there a problem having a psychiatric service in general hospitals? I had thought, and the inspector suggests it, that it could be an integrated process and that we would not just decide to put our mental health patients away from the general hospitals. I thought that was one of the Minister's objectives.</P>
    <P>When Tallaght Hospital opened there seemed to be an unacceptable time lapse addressing this sector and patients were in dreadful conditions in St. Loman's hospital. Why is there such a problem in bringing the psychiatric patients from the dickensian conditions to new hospitals? Perhaps it is an industrial relations issue but, if so, it <Col N="1356" /> should be addressed so that patients get the priority they deserve.</P>
    <P>With regard to the mid-west region, I compared last year's report to this year's report and I am glad that there are positive signs. Stiofán de Búrca of the health board is in charge of mental health services and I have spoken to one of the psychiatrists, Peter Kirwan, over the past year to find out whether there have been improvements.</P>
    <P>Looking at Limerick in particular there were just two areas where money, and money alone, was the problem. The inspector's report states &ldquo;The only advance since the previous inspection was the transfer of five patients to a community residence at Dooradoyle&rdquo;, which is something we wanted very specifically &ndash; moving the patients out to the community, and we are talking about just a handful. The report noted that no progress had been made on the implementation of the Mid-Western Health Board's development plan, which would involve the gradual relocation of mental health services currently on the campus of St. Joseph's hospital, at a capital cost of approximately £5 million. We are still reeling from the billions spent in the budget. A sum of £5 million is a pittance. This facility is available and the goodwill is there, but the money has not been made available.</P>
    <P>The second matter about which I am concerned is the provision of bungalows at Lisnagry for patients with an intellectual disability &ndash; an issue referred to in the national development plan. There are three bungalows there already. They provide for patients with an intellectual disability and I am glad that although the report states that they have progressed not due to insufficient capital funding, they have progressed. I am not just here to knock &ndash; there are positive things that have been done. Further development of the positive elements is needed. There are three bungalows already but if the 36 patients earmarked for the bungalows do not move there soon, some other needy patients will be put there even though they have been earmarked for St. Joseph's hospital. I am aware that the problem was an industrial relations one in that instance. However, such problems should not be allowed to go on and on; they must be addressed instantly to ensure that facilities are available for the people for whom they are intended.</P>
    <P>The inspector recommends that capital funding be provided to place long stay patients from St. Joseph's hospital in community residential settings. I know the Minister wants that to happen and I hope it happens as soon as possible. The inspector also recommends that the plans to provide community residences for people with intellectual disabilities in St. Joseph's, Lisnagry, proceed immediately. That can be achieved if the industrial relations problems are resolved.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the response of the Schizophrenia Association of Ireland which Senators received today. The association echoes the inspector's comments and those made in this House recently. The association refers to equity, <Col N="1357" /> quality of service and accountability and points to &ldquo;a devastating lack of will&rdquo; to apply these basic principles which are part and parcel of a democracy. The association points to the many worrying issues highlighted in the inspector's report about the disturbing lack of attention to patients' rights.</P>
    <P>Vincent Browne, on his radio show, highlighted issues in regard to the prescription of medication, the lack of regular reviews and the lack of adequate information provision to patients. The inspector felt that the prescription of drugs in some locations was often arbitrary and was made without regard to appropriate clinical diagnosis.</P>
    <P>On the issue of seclusion, it transpired that authorisation was often provided 24 hours after an episode of seclusion commenced. Patients' notes also indicated a lack of medical input relating to specific episodes of seclusion. On the recertification of involuntary temporary patients, the inspector states that where decisions are made to extend the temporary patient reception order or recertify patients, the reasons for doing so should be clearly set out in the patients' case notes. As I read the report, I found that these issues arose across the board in different hospitals in different areas. In some instances, patients were treated in hospital and subsequently discharged without the consultants having made any entries in the case notes. That means there was not any objective evidence that patients had been seen by consultants.</P>
    <P>The inspector points out that hospital furniture was found to be dilapidated and shabby, curtains were either missing or falling off the rails, there was a shortage of bedside lockers and screens around beds and there was a lack of privacy for patients, visitors and staff. Reference is also made to the fact that some patients did not have personal clothing. These matters can be addressed without money. What era are we living in when we read such horrific observations? </P>
    <P>The inspector raises many other issues, among them the need for the provision of multi-disciplinary teams. I was very saddened to read that of the 900 admissions to St. Brendan's hospital in 1997, 229 patients had no fixed abode. Where were they to go when they were discharged back into the community?</P>
    <P>The report is absolutely frightening and it is a cause of shame for all of us that these matters have not been addressed. I appeal to the Minister to accord high priority to this area. I hope we are still a caring nation and that we would look after the needs of the most vulnerable in our society. I do not believe there is a single person in this country who would not forgo an additional kilometre of road, for example, to see priority being accorded to this issue. I hope that next year's report will not contain a single word of indictment of a system which should not be as it is. I ask the Minister to immediately allocate the funding necessary to alleviate unnecessary suffering.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and thank Fine Gael for tabling it. I am at risk of developing a serious sense of paranoia because I have used my <Col N="1358" /> own Private Members' time, which only arises once every 15 months, to debate the previous two reports of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals. I am very disappointed that the Government did not provide time this year for the report to be debated. This is not a party political matter and I fail to see why there was such a reluctance to debate the report in Government time.</P>
      <P>I am interested in the amendment tabled by the Government as we are all very pleased to see the publication of the Mental Health Bill. However, the Bill is quite limited and it is difficult to know why it took almost 20 years to produce it. That is not the fault of the current Minister. The Bill deals with the issue of involuntary committal. If the issue had not been dealt with soon, we would have been faced with a very serious situation in the European courts. The Bill also provides for the establishment of a commission to deal with the mental health services and proposes to designate the Inspector of Mental Hospitals as the inspector of mental services. I welcome those measures.</P>
      <P>While the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, which is produced on an annual basis, is useful, it is not equivalent to an examination of the entire range of mental services as it does not encompass services provided outside hospitals. It is very worrying that some areas can be de-designated as happened in regard to people with an intellectual incapacity in St. Joseph's unit in St. Ita's Hospital.</P>
      <P>I want to concentrate on the substance of the motion which related to the content of the 1998 report. Some improvements have been made over the years and the inspector goes out of his way to point these out. In regard to the situation in Sligo, he states that a great deal has been accomplished in recent years and the service is to be congratulated on increasing community based residential accommodation, reducing in-patient numbers and providing a very attractive mental health centre and day hospital in Markievicz House in Sligo town. If this can happen in an area which, only five years ago, received a terrible report from the inspector, it can happen everywhere. The inspector's comments should encourage people to attempt to upgrade services in their areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report must properly concentrate on the practical workings of the mental hospitals. It is worth noting some areas of improvement but it is astonishing to note the areas in which improvements have not been made. The sharing of personal clothing may seem to be an insignificant issue but it is terribly important to patients not to have to share clothes, including underwear. That is very degrading. The issue is only mentioned twice in this report whereas it was mentioned repeatedly years ago in relation to hospital after hospital. That is a very welcome improvement. However, lockers are not provided for all patients and they are essential, particularly for long-stay patients, who comprise up to 70 per cent of patients in some of our major hospitals. It is <Col N="1359" /> important that such patients would have easy access to their belongings.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see Senator Glynn in the House because he will have a good deal to say on ward conditions. I was somewhat disappointed recently to hear him call for the disestablishment of the position of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals on the grounds that the inspector's report contained nothing but criticism. The report praises some developments. I am sure the Senator was disappointed to see the report on the hospital in which he works &ndash; St. Loman's in Mullingar &ndash; in which it was recommended that one ward was in such bad condition that it should be closed down immediately. That is not to cast aspersions on the hospital staff because it must be equally difficult for them to work in these conditions as it is for the patients to live in them. &ldquo;St. Loman's&rdquo; seems to be an unfortunate name because the report also states that the conditions in St. Loman's in Palmerstown are appalling. In fact, election literature was found in some of the toilets and since there has not been an election for some time, one can only wonder how long it was since the toilets were cleaned. Like Senator Jackman, I am at a loss to know why patients could not have been transferred to the newly built premises in Tallaght because of an industrial dispute. Patients cannot be kept in terrible conditions while an industrial dispute is resolved.</P>
    <P>There are some very depressing examples in the report of how little has changed over the years. Year after year we hear that local management at St. Ita's appears to have very little control over the way maintenance is applied there. This relates to such basic things as gutters not being cleaned, filling up with leaves, and grass growing in the leaves in the gutter so that water pours down inside the building making the walls damp. Surely it can be organised that management is in charge of such maintenance. One sees from reports that this sort of thing occurs all too frequently.</P>
    <P>Let me talk about staff. It is very worrying when psychiatrists write to the papers because they feel they are working in conditions which are worse than those in the Third World. Why would they say that? We know the medical profession here does not go in for shroud waving. In today's paper, Vincent Browne, who has done much work in this area, abuses doctors very strongly for not speaking out more about conditions in hospitals. Psychiatrists are put in areas where they, with the rest of the staff, are working in extraordinarily poor conditions. As a member of Comhairle na n-Ospidéal, it worries me very much that so many psychiatric posts are temporary. Why is that? This is not good for morale in the service, it is not good for the people there and it is not good for the patients. Another thing that is important is that a very high level of junior staff who have not much training in psychiatry do a great deal of the front-line work there. This may be important in sections where the inspector criti<Col N="1360" /> cises the fact that seclusion orders are put down by juniors frequently, or that prescriptions are not updated often, all very serious areas. The junior staff area must be looked at too, and an increasing number of psychiatrists recommend that frequently.</P>
    <P>The nursing area is terrible. Everywhere seems to be at least 20 per cent understaffed, and in some places they are working with staff who have no training in psychiatric illness. This is very serious. I could go on. As regards staff who could help people to become rehabilitated, to go out, there are many people who could live in residential homes in the community in contact with the wider world but there are no step-down facilities for them. The Dublin area is by far the worst. There is a terrible shortage of facilities here. One has to worry if the major psychiatric hospitals in Dublin and Cork, St. Brendan's and Our Lady's, are unloading their long-stay patients into St. Stephen's in Cork and St. Ita's in Dublin because they are hoping to sell their centre city premises for high prices, as I believe is happening.</P>
    <P>Let me address the situation in the Central Mental Hospital where there is still slopping out for long-stay psychiatric patients. For years it has been suggested that something should be done about this. It is really appalling and an indictment not of the Minister but of all of us. I remember the new unit there being empty for about ten years while people were deciding what to do with it.</P>
    <P>Lack of correlation between psychiatric services in prisons and the Central Mental Hospital is an ongoing disgrace. We know that 25 per cent of prisoners who have been in either the Central Mental Hospital or in psychiatric institutions are going backwards and forwards between them because there are no hospitals for them to go to. Sr. Uí Cuív is the only person I know who is trying to do anything with them. There is a revolving door policy. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform talks about a revolving door. It is a revolving door between psychiatric hospitals and jails. There are people in our jails who should not be there but they are there because of their psychiatric illness, and we are doing little or nothing about them.</P>
    <P>The situation regarding mental illness and homelessness is pointed to by the inspector, which shows how bad it is getting because I have not seen that pointed out before. I do not know how we are going to deal with these people. I have talked frequently about the people I trip over as I go home down Baggot Street at night. Now they are on television and in the newspapers. Between their mental illness and their addiction to alcohol and drugs, they are appallingly difficult people to deal with. However, we must deal with them. When people in the general population say we must deal with them, I ask them to remember this when they refuse permission for day hospitals or community services in their area. I see it repeatedly said &ldquo;not in my <Col N="1361" /> back yard &ndash; mental services are to be set up but not in the area in which I live&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;acknowledges the need for improvement in the mental health services as outlined in the Report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for 1998; welcomes the publication of the Mental Health Bill, 1999 which will reform existing provisions regarding involuntary detention for psychiatric care and treatment; and commends the Minister for Health and Children for the additional capital and revenue funding allocated to mental health services over the lifetime of the National Development Plan.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen. He is the first Minister for Health in my lifetime who has taken a sustained interest in mental health and psychiatric services. Everybody in this House knows that mental health is the poor relation of the medical services and has been for many years. A cardiologist appearing on the 9 o'clock news can bring more pressure to bear on the Department of Health and Children with a 15 second sound bite than years of beseeching by patients and relatives and by staff in the psychiatric services.</P>
      <P>This year alone an extra £12.2 million is being provided for mental health and priority is being given to forensic psychiatry. As our psychiatric hospitals wind down, as people are moved into the community and there are different concepts of provision of mental health services, the corollary is that our prisons are expanding. We are building more prisons than we have since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>As well as welcoming the expansion of the forensic psychiatry service, I welcome the expansion of the psychiatry of old age. With an increasing elderly population, the demand for this service is expanding all the time. To be parochial for a moment, I congratulate the Psychiatry for Old Age service on the north side of the city of Dublin. It is providing an excellent service. The waiting time for a consultation is about a week which, given today's medical and hospital services, is astonishing and amazing. I congratulate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Mental Health Bill as a basis for discussion on a new departure for the development, delivery and overseeing of psychiatric services. I welcome also the Mental Health Commission. This Mental Health Commission is going to have a difficult job. It will have to strike a balance between ensuring openness, transparency and accountability in the delivery of the highest quality of service and preserving patients' rights to confidentiality and dignity in their dealings with psychiatric services. The commission will have to deal also with the problem of a patient who is not in a fit condition to give informed consent. This is a very thorny area. Several speakers <Col N="1362" /> have referred already to the lack of case notes in patients' files, especially those in long-stay institutions. This is an area where we will have to upgrade case notes, the quality of reporting and the quality of decision making in treatment planning.</P>
    <P>The Mental Health Bill will lead to setting up a mental health commission, a new and badly needed departure in the delivery of psychiatric services. The old system is flawed, slow and cumbersome and, in spite of all the good work by people working in the area, this is not in the best interests of patients. One of the problems I notice in dealing with patients on a day to day basis is the strict demarcation of facilities on the basis of where a patient lives. Where one lives can work against one. For example, as a general practitioner dealing with an orthopaedic problem, I can refer the patient to the orthopaedic surgeon best suited to treating them. I know all the consultants in my area, if not personally then by repute, and I deal with them on a fairly regular basis. As a GP I do not have the freedom to send a psychiatric patient to the consultant I feel is best suited to treat their problem. There is a demarcation, which I am sure exists throughout the city and the country, which does not work in the best interests of patients. A patient on one side of the street has to attend one hospital while a patient on the other side must attend another hospital. In this day and age this is not good enough. The system is driven by bureaucracy and administration, not by patients' needs, and it must change.</P>
    <P>The commission will have to face the fundamental problem of vested interests working throughout the health services, not just the mental health services, whose only wish is to maintain the <i>status quo</i> as that is the easiest way for them to continue and does not disturb them or the people they represent. The fact that it might not be in the best interests of patients suffering from mental problems is neither here nor there in their book.</P>
    <P>I do not intend debating the forthcoming mental health legislation but we will have to deal with difficult questions and find answers. For example, section 7 of the Bill says that those with personality disorders and people who are socially deviant or mentally handicapped will not be part of the remit of the Bill. From my experience, as I am sure everybody in the House will know, these people suffer and can develop psychiatric problems. One of the problems I have noticed over the past 30 years is that the psychiatric services are not prepared, or do not want, to appear to deal with these problems. They want to put them to one side and have them dealt with by specialists. There is a good reason specialists should deal with these problems, but it should be within the remit of the mental health commission.</P>
    <P>Finally, Senator Henry spoke about hospitals and the appalling conditions in some of them. I think this is down to the management of hospitals and that we cannot put the full blame on the Department of Health and Children. I use the <Col N="1363" /> analogy of hospitals and hotels, although it should not be taken too far. Managers of hospitals and hotels have one thing in common, namely, to ensure service is delivered to their customers &ndash; and that means patients in the case of hospitals. I have never seen a hospital manger dine on hospital food, check the hospital toilets or stand behind reception dealing with customers. In a hotel one pays only once for the service provided, but in hospitals a person could be paying twice or three times through taxes, VHI and cash deductions for services rendered.</P>
    <P>The problem with the health services, and I refer mainly to the psychiatric services, is that there exists too much of the poor law mentality in our attitude towards their delivery. For this reason I welcome the mental health commission because if it is given power, money and teeth, it can, for a modest financial outlay, change the concept and standards of mental health care in hospitals and, as Senator Henry said, in prisons. We should not confine its remit to designated mental health services as mentioned in the Bill. Rather we should ensure the commission has an input into psychiatric training, continuing education and can check the bona fides of persons or organisations purporting to improve mental health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. Like Senator Henry, I wish to say that it is with regret that we have to use Private Members' time to discuss an area of health care which is of increasing importance. I acknowledge the work done by Vincent Browne in bringing the issue of mental health and the associated services to public attention, including my attention. In his programmes and articles he puts his finger on the button and makes us sit up and take action on this very important issue.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which the Minister published yesterday. Clearly, it is not a matter for debate tonight, but I welcome the important provisions contained in it and the significant progress being made in mental health services in general. Over the past number of years a very significant shift has taken place in the population of hospitals and an increasing number of people, quite properly, are moving into the community, being restored to health and to where they always lived. There is also a positive policy of placing people in the community, either in sheltered accommodation or under very low supervision, and of welcoming back to the community people who are and will continue to get better and, please God, return to full health and to where they always lived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to compare this progress with the dickensian conditions which are still clearly present in a number of our psychiatric hospitals. The report of the inspector is excellent. It is thorough and goes through each institution, making very significant comments. I would like to address the comments on quality care issues raised in the <Col N="1364" /> report which are very important. The report states:</P>
    <P>The importance of patients' rights across a broad range of issues was stressed and the responsibility of mental health services in such matters was highlighted. It is both ethically correct and clinically desirable that newly admitted hospital patients are examined, reviewed and assessed by senior medical staff within 24 hours of admission.</P>
    <P>This seems a very fundamental procedure but it does not happen, perhaps due to pressure on people working in the system. I acknowledge the tremendous work done by all the medical, nursing and caring staff in our hospitals. Nevertheless it is a matter of great concern to read that the inspectorate felt drug prescribing in some locations is often arbitrary and made without regard to appropriate clinical diagnosis. The number of patients, particularly long stay patients, who are on numerous drugs simultaneously, often at high dosages, was striking. In some instances the prescriptions have not been reviewed for some considerable time. It is important to review medication at frequent intervals. There appeared to be an increasing number of sudden deaths in psychiatric hospitals, some of which were attributed to drug related effects. I was shocked to read this and hope the Minister will immediately instruct health boards and all the people who work in psychiatric hospitals to take critical note of what is contained in the report and ensure that by the time of the next report these issues are clearly dealt with and significantly removed from our attention. It is very important to bring these matters to public attention.</P>
    <P>I was shocked and thought I was reading a document from the last century by the description of St. Mary's Hospital, Mayo, where&ndash;</P>
    <P>Much of the accommodation for patients was provided in large institutional rooms that combined sleeping accommodation, dining space, day facilities and a nurses' station all in one area. For most of these patients there was little to stimulate or interest them. They had their final meal at 4.30 in the afternoon and some were in bed by 5 p.m. to accommodate the nursing roster. Concern was expressed at the fact that there were two patients in bed in the day area who were dying and this space was shared by fellow patients from the same ward. This situation was unacceptable.</P>
    <P>This is utterly unacceptable. I spoke to the chief inspector having read the report and he told me that situation will not arise again. In fairness I spoke to the psychiatrist who works for the hospital who pointed out an alternative view, namely, that those people were dying with their family, that is, the people with whom they had lived for many years. To them this was their home and this was the context in which it should be viewed. I am deeply concerned by all these issues <Col N="1365" /> and feel they must be tackled in a clear and succinct manner.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Opposition want to go forward together. We all want to change the system and to make it better. Fine Gael will insist that it is made better and that more care, time and attention is paid to the mental health issues which affect thousands of our population. I pay tribute to the people who help to look after mental health patients in the community, particularly those who are here tonight. We will ensure that this issue is kept at the top of the health agenda until the radical changes which are urgently needed are made.  </P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Senator O'Dowd and other speakers on their contribution. Did Senator O'Dowd's party show the same commitment in Government which it is now showing in Opposition? We need to improve the mental health services and the amendment acknowledges that. Under the national development plan we will provide the resources which were not provided by previous Administrations.</P>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the contributions to this debate and I fully recognise the need to improve standards in our mental health service. The Inspector of Mental Hospitals plays a crucial role in providing an independent and detailed analysis of our mental health services. On the publication of the report for 1998 I was the first to acknowledge that much needs to be done to develop the quality of our services. I also stated that I intended to facilitate health boards in bringing about the improvements and developments identified by the inspector.</P>
      <P>The Framework Document, The Psychiatric Services &ndash; Planning for the Future, which has been the cornerstone of the policy of successive Governments over the past 15 years, developed the concept of a comprehensive psychiatric service located in the community close to where people live and work. It was envisaged that this would replace the centralised and largely institutional services which were planned at a time when modern treatment methods were not available. The policy outlined in that document is still valid today. The problem lies in the rate of progress in providing the alternative facilities it recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the shortcomings identified in the inspector's report, there have been many improvements in mental health services, which have been outlined in successive annual reports of the inspector. These relate particularly to the increase in the number of acute psychiatric units associated with general hospitals. In 1983, prior to the publication of The Psychiatric Services &ndash; Planning for the Future, there were ten such units in place. This has now increased to 17. Approximately one third of all psychiatric admissions in 1998 went through these units. The number of community residences in 1983 was 111 with less than 1,000 places. In 1998 this had increased to <Col N="1366" /> 386 with almost 3,000 places. In the same period the number of in-patients has reduced from approximately 13,000 to 5,000.</P>
    <P>The challenge now facing the health services is to provide all our in-patients with an alternative to care in large psychiatric institutions. Unfortunately, the rate of progress in providing this alternative service has fallen behind. It must be acknowledged that the mental health services have frequently lost out to other services which have been given priority in the allocation of development funding.</P>
    <P>It is time to make a concerted effort to tackle in a determined and comprehensive manner the problems in our mental health services which have been so clearly highlighted in the inspector's reports and in this evening's debate. As a first step, I have allocated an additional £12.2 million revenue funding to the mental health service for next year. This represents an increase of over 100 per cent on the additional funding provided in 1999.</P>
    <P>The lack of multidisciplinary teams in many areas of the mental health services has been highlighted by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals in his report. Some £2.9 million has been allocated towards the further development of community based mental health services, including the improvement of psychology and social work services. Extra funding is being allocated to the health boards in 2000 for the recruitment of additional paramedical staff to address this issue. The precise numbers of additional staff will be worked out in discussions with the health boards early in the new year.</P>
    <P>An additional £1.1 million has been allocated to further developments in child and adolescent psychiatry services. This funding will provide for the appointment of additional consultants in child and adolescent psychiatry and for the development of multidisciplinary teams to focus on specific areas, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</P>
    <P>The increase in the number of people living to advanced old age requires the development of specialist mental health services to meet their specific needs. Old age psychiatry services have been expanding in recent years and an additional £1 million is being allocated in 2000 to further this development. The details will be discussed further with the health boards early in the new year.</P>
    <P>In his report for 1998 the Inspector of Mental Hospitals referred to the fact that some patients in psychiatric hospitals have been in institutional care for many years and recommended the establishment of dedicated teams to plan their reintegration into the community. Some £0.25 million is being allocated to the Western Health Board to fund such a specialist-led team which will commence a rehabilitation programme for long-stay patients in St. Brigid's Hospital, Ballinasloe. If this pilot project is successful, a similar approach will be considered for other hospitals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1367" /> Some £1.35 million is being provided to facilitate substantial improvements in the forensic psychiatry services in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. These teams will liaise with the Director of Prison Medical Services and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding the provision of appropriate psychiatric services in our prisons. They will also assist in the management of disturbed behaviour within the health board mental health services. An additional £1 million has been allocated towards suicide prevention programmes and £2.5 million has been provided towards the implementation of the new Mental Health Bill which I circulated yesterday.</P>
    <P>The provision of capital funding is essential if the mental health services are to be transformed in the way we would wish. I have ensured that substantial capital funding under the national development plan will go towards the development of mental health facilities. Over £140 million capital will be provided over the lifetime of the plan for the service. A significant part of this funding will go towards the development of acute psychiatric units linked to general hospitals as a replacement of services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 17 acute units already in place, a number of units are currently at various stages of development including the Mercy Hospital, Cork; Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, which I intend to announce in the next few days; St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park; James Connolly Memorial Hospital; Ennis General Hospital; St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny; Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe and at Nenagh, Portlaoise, Castlebar and Sligo General Hospitals. A further four acute psychiatric units are under consideration as part of the national development plan at Dundalk, Wexford, Mallow and Mullingar. At the end of the period of the national development plan, it is the intention to have the programme of acute psychiatric units completed, which will mean there will be no further acute admissions to the old psychiatric hospitals. The plan will also provide for more community facilities, such as mental health centres and community residences, which will accelerate the phasing out of the old institutions.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that many of the points raised in the inspector's report relate to clinical and administrative issues associated with the provision of care. I expect them to be addressed by the relevant professional and management staff in the health boards and hospitals concerned. To assist service providers in attaining excellence in care delivery, the inspectorate prepared guidelines on good clinical practice and quality assurance in mental health services. The guidelines are based on a checklist used on inspections embracing the main issues relating to the satisfactory clinical and administrative practice. The document sets down a series of desirable and achievable standards of care both in relation to the physical structure in which care is delivered and <Col N="1368" /> the clinical and other issues connected with the provision of care.</P>
    <P>The guidelines are seen by the inspectorate as an educational endeavour to increase awareness of the main quality issues in service delivery and their monitoring, refinement and improvement. I arranged to have the guidelines published and circulated to mental health professionals and service providers in the country. The Inspector of Mental Hospitals is currently paying particular attention, when carrying out inspections, to the extent to which the procedures recommended in the guidelines are followed.</P>
    <P>In September of this year I made a commitment to publish new mental health legislation before the end of the current session. Yesterday I fulfilled that promise with the publication of the Mental Health Bill, 1999. This Bill will significantly reform existing legislation concerning the involuntary detention of persons for psychiatric care and treatment.</P>
    <P>In many respects the Bill I have published goes further than the proposals originally envisaged in the White Paper on mental health legislation. This is particularly the case in so far as the rights of detained patients are concerned. I noticed that Senator Henry regards it as a small Bill. It contains 73 sections and deals with protection of patients' rights, something I regard as a priority in the context of a legislative response to transform and modernise mental health services. Provision is made in the Bill for an automatic, independent review of each decision to detain a person for psychiatric care and treatment within 28 days of their detention. Reviews will be carried out by mental health tribunals consisting of a consultant psychiatrist and a legal assessor and operating under the aegis of the mental health commission. The review will focus on two issues, whether the person concerned is mentally disordered and whether the correct procedures were carried out in detaining them. A tribunal will be empowered to order the release of a patient if it considers that he or she does not require to be detained involuntarily.</P>
    <P>Some commentators have referred to the fact that the White Paper proposed a review of detention after seven days and have suggested that what is contained in the Bill published yesterday offers less protection to involuntary patients than was promised in 1995. That is incorrect. The White Paper proposed that a procedural review of the legality of a person's detention would take place within seven days of involuntary detention. The type of review envisaged then would have been a paper exercise which simply checked that all the correct procedures had been carried out. It would not have touched at all on the crucial question which must arise in all cases of involuntary detention &ndash; whether the person is mentally disordered to the extent that it warrants a restriction on his or her liberty. The White Paper did not consider that the type of fundamental, clinical review which I am proposing was necessary until a person had been detained continuously for over <Col N="1369" /> a year. Therefore, my proposals represent a major advance on those put forward in the 1995 White Paper. I hope the columnists take note.</P>
    <P>The new Mental Health Bill will also have major implications for the role of the inspector. Under its provisions, the existing office of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals will be replaced with the office of the inspector of mental health services. The inspector will be employed by the mental health commission, also established under the terms of the Bill, and will thus have complete independence from the Minister and from his or her Department. This represents a major improvement, in my view, on the proposal in the White Paper that the office of the inspector be associated with the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>In addition to the annual inspections of in-patient facilities which are carried out at present, the new Bill will require the inspector to carry out an annual review of all mental health services. The inspector's review of the services, including reports of inspections carried out, will be published along with the mental health commission's annual report.</P>
    <P>Another important new role for the inspector will be the regulation of standards in the mental health services. A register of approved centres, in which each hospital or in-patient facility providing psychiatric care and treatment must be registered, will be maintained by the mental health commission. Regulations will be made specifying the standards to be maintained in all approved centres, including requirements in relation to food and accommodation, care and welfare of patients, suitability of staff and the keeping of records. The execution and enforcement of these regulations will be the responsibility of the inspector of mental health services.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for providing the opportunity to debate the content of the reports of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals and the mental health services generally. The initiatives which I have outlined will, I hope, reassure Senators that mental health services are not being neglected by this Government and that the service shortcomings identified by the inspector are being addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister coming to the House. I recognise the task he faces and the task the State as a whole faces in this area.</P>
      <P>I would not have read this report if I was not a Member of this House. Like many citizens, I would have been unaware of the publication of the report. Most Departments attempt to publish damning reports like this in a clandestine manner. It says a great deal that to have this debate we had to wait until Private Members' time at 6 p.m. on a Wednesday evening. The Minister and the Department have a case to answer for that alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry has been seeking a debate on this for a year. It was not until recently that I read the report and it shocked me. I felt as I did when I read the visitors' report on Mountjoy Prison. It opened a world which was new to me, one which <Col N="1370" /> I did not know existed. Once this world emerges, we must reject it as unacceptable. Even in the understated style used in the report, the picture it reveals is terrifying. I urge everyone to read this report.</P>
    <P>I hope this debate will be the first step on the way to dealing with mental health in a way which is fitting in a rich, modern society, not one that seems to be dealing with it as Charles Dickens would have done a century ago. We have often heard the comment that democracy is best judged by how it looks after its minorities. If mental health patients are a minority, we stand indicted. I am grateful to the Fine Gael Party for devoting its Private Members' time to this subject. There is no party political gain to be made from it but the party took it because Senator Henry drew attention to it and the Fine Gael Members have given us the time to debate it.</P>
    <P>I do not blame this Minister any more than I blame the previous three Ministers. There have been Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour Ministers and they all stand indicted for what has happened. Minister after Minister has dodged the issue. Why did they do that? They preside over a Department in which there is a culture of denial. No Department is better at running away from problems or trying to sweep them under the carpet than the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>None of these crises is a one-off; they are connected. There is a culture of denial, aided and abetted in this case by the medical profession, which has sold the past at the expense of its patients. The reason for that is the relentless pressure caused by the minimal resources we have devoted to the problem.</P>
    <P>Inspector Dermot Walsh has done a great job in this report. He details the over-prescription of drugs as a solution to the problem. It is part of a strategy of patient care. Any psychiatrist will tell you that drugs are the route to follow whenever there is a problem and nothing else can be done. That is the challenge we face. The starving of resources to address the whole problem of mental health has been ongoing on an annual basis and it has allowed this unacceptable problem to accelerate.</P>
    <P>The solution of seclusion and restraint, as detailed in the report, entails the use of straitjackets and padded cells. I had not heard this terminology for some time. I am pleased, therefore, that this scandal has become public. Like other citizens I accept responsibility for what happened, although like them I was unaware of the practices described in the report.</P>
    <P>Recent Ministers, the Department and many psychiatrists in the mental health area have a case to answer. However, we will never get to grips with this problem unless we deal with the real culprits. The Department is not alone in fostering a culture of denial. It has been able to indulge it only because a similar culture is prevalent throughout society &ndash; we are all guilty.</P>
    <P>The uncomfortable truth is that many people do not want to know about mental health. It has <Col N="1371" /> traditionally been regarded as a taboo subject, to be kept out of sight and ignored in the same way as TB and cancer in the past. Nevertheless, because we have been able to drag our taboos into the open one by one we are in a position to tackle the problem outlined here. We are just as guilty as any Minister in turning a blind eye.</P>
    <P>A small step towards a resolution would be to enact comprehensive mental health legislation. I hope the Bill published yesterday will fulfil that requirement. Senator Henry has demanded it for some time. Enacting it will be a demonstration of our determination to ensure that the problem is fully addressed.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry said the new Bill is small in content but large in scope. The Minister referred to expenditure of £140 million over five years. That is just over £20 million per year. In a recent budget the Government allocated £20 million to Croke Park. I am not critical of that, but it puts expenditure in this area in context.</P>
    <P>If we are to solve the problems outlined here we must do so with determination. That is the challenge we face. I welcome this debate and the publication of the new Bill. We must ensure that as a nation we meet the challenge before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I read sections of this report last Saturday afternoon, having finished reading a review in <i>The Irish Times </i>of the book written by Mary Raftery and Eoin O'Sullivan, which is based on the subject matter of the television programme &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo;. The experience filled me with sadness and disgust that we as a nation were able to tolerate for so long the treatment meted out to orphans in orphanages and patients in mental hospitals without seeking to find out what was happening. If some of the outrage at the budget had been exercised against the practices and malpractices in the treatment of patients in mental hospitals in the past we might not have to read the lurid details contained in this up-to-date report.</P>
      <P>It is about time we as a nation honestly examined our conscience. How is it that we lock people away and sweep their problems under the carpet? When I grew up in the 1950s we treated in the same way unfortunate women who happened to find themselves pregnant and could not find a husband. Much happened in this country in my time that I hope we will not take into the new century.</P>
      <P>I was very encouraged by the Minister's speech and by the promise of new legislation to replace the Mental Treatment Act, 1945. It is not before time. Our understanding of psychiatry and the development of psychiatry as a science has moved on dramatically since the 1945 Act. It is time our laws responded to the knowledge at our disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new legislation is welcome and it will be discussed in detail in this House. The Minister outlined some of its provisions. When it is enacted we will have put in place a modern legislative system to underpin different practices, <Col N="1372" /> codes of practice and provisions which will differ from those prevailing today. Given the Minister's remarks, I am more optimistic than I was this morning.</P>
    <P>Legislation alone will not be enough. There must be a dramatic shift in the attitude of the public and the practitioners who treat psychiatric patients. A dramatic shift in our cultural approach to the manner in which we treat them is required because if the public demands a high standard of care based on best practice it will be forthcoming. That will only occur when debates like this happen more frequently and when the public is given a better insight into the way in which patients with mental disorder were catered for in the past by the public services. It will then demand that a different approach is taken.</P>
    <P>The inspector draws attention to the nature of quality care, which appears to have been remarkably absent in far too many instances. I hope that is a feature of the past. To that end we not only require new legislation but a total change in attitude to the provision of care. That will demand a very high standard from the professionals.</P>
    <P>The role of the inspector will be substantially changed in the context of the impending legislation. That is also important. An inspector should arrive unannounced to make an inspection. It is not good enough that notice of his arrival is circulated. When I was a teacher we washed behind our ears when we were told of an inspector's visit. It is most important that a system be put in place which allows for the arrival of an inspector at any time without notice.</P>
    <P>When I read in Mary Raftery's book the description of a visit by a Department of Education inspector to an orphanage in the midlands and the glowing report he wrote, it sent shivers down the back of my neck. He wrote a glowing report about the care that was being given to the children and lyrically described the heroism of the people who were dealing with orphans in such a humane and compassionate way. It has since transpired that this was one of the institutions where orphans were treated with extraordinary brutality. The Minister, to his credit, has opened the departmental archives and we have been able to see the inspector's report. It is important that inspectors arrive unannounced and at any time.</P>
    <P>There is a connection between homelessness and the closing down of the big and bad old institutions. They had to be closed and they were not closed soon enough. I am glad that they will all be phased out. However, unless there is a consequent follow through and proper provision at community level, people who have been institutionalised for years will be worse off if they are allowed out into the community without the necessary support services. It is critical that we put proper community based services in place to cater for the needs of people who have been in mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>I am glad that provision will be made for teenagers. A number of young people are being discarded by our education system but there is no <Col N="1373" /> proper psychiatric provision for teenagers. I am glad that this is to be catered for.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the House debates the report of the inspector annually. That is the only way we can establish for ourselves whether there has been an improvement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I spent a cathartic half hour denouncing the Government this morning during the debate on the Appropriation Bill and I wish to be more constructive this evening. A fundamental issue of resources is involved and our society must make a fundamental choice about the allocation of resources and whether we should allocate them to the public or private sector. I do not wish to dwell on the question of allocating resources because it would be wrong to pretend that the condition of our psychiatric hospitals is the fault of a particular Government. It is the fault of Irish society, as Senator Henry said earlier. I could take issue with the present priorities of the Government but that would be a short-term criticism. There is a long-term issue to address.</P>
      <P>Mental health services have always been the easiest area in which to make financial cut backs. At a meeting during the height of the health cuts in the 1980s, I heard someone say that a person who needs cardiac surgery will be happy to appear on a platform and declare that he cannot get the necessary surgery because of health cuts. Someone who needs to be admitted to hospital for acute schizophrenia will probably not be able to demand it and, if he is able, will be profoundly reluctant to do so. Ministers for Health do not deliberately take advantage of that reality but there is a process of prioritising which means that when they get around to spending on the psychiatric services there is no money left.</P>
      <P>For my own benefit, I did a spreadsheet showing the change in expenditure on the health services between 1989 and 1999. The overall percentage increase was 144 per cent which means that expenditure more than doubled. Expenditure on general hospitals increased by slightly more, by 147 per cent. Expenditure under the title, Psychiatric Programme &ndash; Diagnosis, Care and Prevention of Psychiatric Illness, in the same period increased by 69.98 per cent &ndash; half the rate of the health services, overall. That is fair comment.</P>
      <P>The Minister's figures raise a question about gaps in our service. He said that in 1983 there were 1,000 places in the community and 13,000 in-patients. Now, there are 3,000 in the community and 5,000 in-patients. I am very glad that many of those who used to be in-patients are no longer. I am also concerned that many of those who used to be in-patients are now living on the streets. I am very concerned that we would continue a programme at a time when we have increasing needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case I forget to do so I should declare an interest. My wife is a consultant psychiatrist. I say this in case there might be a conflict of interest, <Col N="1374" /> although if there is to be a conflict it will be between me and my wife when she reads what I have to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>She has far more sense than to read the Official Report of Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>The fact that our ageing population will put increasing demands on our service has been mentioned. Senators have also mentioned the suicide problem. I am reluctant to use the term &ldquo;suicide crisis&rdquo; but there is an increasing incidence of suicide in our society. The World Health Organisation has identified depression as the second biggest illness which the world community will have to worry about in the next century. There is a debate in the psychiatric services on whether what the WHO calls depression really is so. However, we must recognise the fact.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to list any of the horrific details in the inspector's report. I assume these conditions will be corrected very quickly and that no Government will allow such conditions to continue. Perhaps that is a generous assumption, but I assume from what the Minster has said that we are going to see an end to leaking roofs, the absence of privacy, inadequate toilets, poor food and all the other things that are complained about. However, that is not nearly enough.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that regulations, which I assume will have the force of law, will be made specifying the standards to be maintained in all improved centres, including requirements in relation to food, accommodation, care and welfare of patients, suitability of staff and the keeping of records and that the enforcement and execution of these will be the responsibility of the inspector. This gives the inspector considerably greater powers than he used to have. Previously, he simply had the power to report. He will now have an enforcement role and one which I hope he will be encouraged to play by the Department of Health and Children. It is extremely important that he should do so.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Senator Glynn that the position of Inspector of Mental Hospitals should be abolished. The Minister's proposal to give the inspector real powers is the correct one. These reports have slowly but surely galvanised Irish society with regard to what is happening in our psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beyond what is in the report in terms of physical conditions, we need fundamental changes in services. The inspector mentions the need for paramedics, occupational therapists, social workers and so on. There is a need to make it clear that doctors who are employed in the public health service should make the public health service their priority and the priority of their time. The public health service is not the banker on which one builds one's private practice. It is the priority. That priority should mean that somebody who is paid up to £90,000 per year to work 33 hours <Col N="1375" /> should work those hours and that ancillary services, such as offices, secretaries and so forth, would work exclusively in the public health area and not provide a State subsidised support for the private practice.</P>
    <P>It should also mean that where outpatient clinics are held, only where it is medically appropriate would anybody other than a consultant psychiatrist see somebody in that clinic. I am not of the opinion that in every case a consultant must see the patient because some of the patients might be returning for a routine appointment. However, it should be part of the contract that the only situation in which a patient should not be seen by a consultant psychiatrist is where it is medically appropriate. Inconvenience, holidays and other commitments are no reason for people not doing their job.</P>
    <P>The buildings will be sorted out in the next couple of years and the issue of staff training is being tackled. After that we will be obliged to sort out the quality, intensity and continuity of medical care for psychiatric patients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Opposition for affording Members the opportunity to debate the mental treatment legislation and the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals. As Fianna Fáil spokesman for Health in the Seanad during the last Administration, I did not let a week pass without calling on the then Minister for Health to bring forward this legislation. On that basis I compliment the Minister, Deputy Cowen, on his initiative in this regard. His predecessors, even though they were regularly called upon to do so, did not respond positively and put off bringing the legislation forward. Indeed many of the comments which emanated from previous Ministers were concerned with civil liberty considerations. That issue should not have been to the fore and I am pleased that, after so long, somebody has the courage and has taken on the responsibility to update 60 year old legislation.</P>
      <P>The Mental Treatment Act, 1945, is out of tune with what practitioners in the health services consider appropriate treatment. It can safely be said that professionals in the service have been acting outside the law for many years. If the provisions of the 1945 Act had been strictly implemented in the past 20 years, many people in the nursing and medical profession would have been deemed to be in breach of the law because they were implementing a more liberal approach than that laid down in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seventeen years ago a document titled Planning for the Future which dealt with the psychiatric service was published. It was an important document which appeared to contain a recipe for the future of the psychiatric service. However, there was a major omission. Nobody thought it worth their while to resource the plan and everybody knows what happens to the best of plans if they are not given financial resources &ndash; they become aspirations. It was implemented in piece<Col N="1376" /> meal fashion and the customers of the service, the psychiatric patients, were the victims of a plan that was never resourced and was being implemented under 60 year old legislation. That is the context in which we have been dealing with the psychiatric service in recent years.</P>
    <P>I know the current Inspector for Mental Hospitals and I knew his predecessor. I worked in the health service for many years and I have a keen interest in the area. I am pleased he has identified so many problems in the mental hospitals. In the year before the arrival of the third millennium it is amazing that an Inspector of Mental Hospitals would be obliged to report on matters such as the gutters on a building not working or a radiator being out of place or there being no door in a shower room. Where was the local manager of the hospital, the local clerk of works and the hospital administrator? These people must have had responsibility for the maintenance of their buildings. If they did not have responsibility or did not have the resources, they had a responsibility to highlight that and ensure it was dealt with.</P>
    <P>Health boards have responsibility and should take some blame in this area. Over the years members of health boards, health board executives and the administrative sections geared themselves towards the pressure area of high-tech medicine and forgot the psychiatric service because there was nobody there to speak up for it. Yesterday was an important day with the publication of the legislation and today is equally important in that we are debating the inspector's report in the context of that legislation.</P>
    <P>There are 73 sections in the Bill and they cover a wide range of important issues. The most important is patients' rights and these are given extensive coverage. We have heard about farmers' charters and patients' rights but nothing has been heard about the rights and protection of psychiatric patients. In fact, rather than a supportive environment, in recent years there was a reduction in the number of people being trained in that area. Non-professionals and people with no training were working in the psychiatric service to an inappropriate extent.</P>
    <P>The fact that catchment areas are sacrosanct is a major concern. My colleague, Senator Fitzpatrick, already referred to this issue. It is inappropriate that somebody who goes to their general practitioner and wishes to be treated within the psychiatric service has no choice as to who will treat them. They must go to the psychiatrist in the district mental hospital or the unit in their area. If I have a sore thumb or need to have a toenail removed, I can choose where I will go to have the procedure carried out. I have a statutory right to have it done in the Mater Hospital in Dublin or in Castlebar, Galway or elsewhere. Why does a psychiatric patient have a lesser right than a patient in the general service? Patients' rights are vitally important.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1377" /> It is generally accepted that people who were discharged from mental hospitals were not provided with alternative accommodation and proper services. Having been left without support, many of them ended up in prison. That is a sad outcome. I hope the new legislation will ensure there is a full psychiatric service attached to the Prison Service. Look at what has happened in America and other jurisdictions and at the level of suicide, injury and trauma in prisons which do not have psychiatric services. That is a message for us. It should be an important part of the new legislation that we do not forget there are people in other situations and in the charge of other Departments who are in need of psychiatric care. The education system provides a full service in prisons. Is it not as important that we ensure the health of those in prison is protected?</P>
    <P>One of the psychiatric services in the Western Health Board area has been closed in recent years. I am glad to see the Minister has provided £250,000 for a pilot scheme to extend the rehabilitation of another. The day of the large mental hospitals is gone and they are no longer needed, but alternatives to them are needed. Funds and resources must be part and parcel of the new legislation. Planning for the future was a recipe for disaster because it was not funded. This is good legislation and, while I hope there will be amendments to it as it goes through both Houses, I hope there will be a definite decision to resource it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfair to say that the Leader of the House denied a debate on this issue. He said it was possible to have this debate in tandem with the new Mental Health Bill. I welcome the Bill. Many promised it but the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, delivered it.</P>
      <P>I will take up where Senator Finneran left off in discussing the planning for the future of the psychiatric services. I recall that the programme manager of the Midland Health Board said he would never allow the mistake made in Great Britain, when a similar situation obtained there, to be repeated here. When community services were brought on stream, hospitals were run down. However, this is what has happened here and my worst fears have been realised.</P>
      <P>If one examines the statistics for the number of residents in psychiatric hospitals at present &ndash; statistics referred to throughout the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals &ndash; it is noticeable that too many people who administer the planning for the future of the psychiatric services are preoccupied with the numbers now in psychiatric hospitals. As Senator Finneran rightly said, the resources were not provided to devolve the service into the community. Patients were discharged into the community but resources were not provided for them. I say that as someone who worked in that service for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a motion before the House about the unavailability of acute psychiatric beds in the <Col N="1378" /> Eastern Health Board area. An interesting study was conducted on bed occupancy, or inappropriate bed occupancy, in the Eastern Health Board area. It is interesting to note that the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals states that, in the Laois-Offaly catchment area, 54 persons were lodged overnight in St. Fintan's but were not formally admitted to the service and, in the Longford-Westmeath catchment area, 109 patients were lodged overnight in the hospital but were not formally admitted. The reason for this is because they sought bed and breakfast. They had nowhere to go. The acute services in our psychiatric hospitals are used not for hospital purposes but as a hostel for people who have nowhere else to go. That is a scandalous outrage and a gross abuse of an acute service.</P>
    <P>Senators Ryan and Henry commented on a remark I made on the Order of Business pertaining to this report that the position of the inspectorate should be abolished. I restate that and I will say why. In the context of the devolution of acute psychiatric services, large hospitals were not built to treat modern psychiatric illnesses or patients, rather they were built as asylums to keep people in. My belief, which is shared by many who work in the psychiatric services, is that the inspectorate should be an inspectorate of hospital services. I made the comment before the publication of this legislation and I am satisfied an inspectorate of health services would suffice. If we are spending time and money in devolving services to a multidisciplinary arrangement at general hospitals &ndash; something I warmly welcome &ndash; an inspectorate should not exist which focuses on something belonging to a bygone era.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to reporting. There is no excuse for bad reporting by either medical or nursing personnel. Paper and pens are plentiful and everyone who works in the psychiatric services, both in the medical and nursing disciplines, is well able to write. A comment was made about medical charts being signed. If memory serves me correctly, one would have to be a midge to sign in the space provided on medical charts. A new design of medical chart would be appropriate. Reference was also made to patients wearing their own clothes. That is an important matter and I am pleased that in the hospital where I worked nursing staff accompanied patients to purchase their clothes. That is how it should be and it is welcome.</P>
    <P>One group have not been mentioned are the relatives of some of the forgotten people. Senator Quinn spoke about why some people found themselves in psychiatric hospitals. Far too often, patients in such hospitals are not visited by their relatives. If they are, it is on an infrequent basis. When patients pass to their eternal reward, I regret to say that the first question asked is whether they left any money.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry touched on an important point when she referred to staffing. When the schools of nursing in the various hospitals were closed in the early 1980s, it cut off the lifeblood of what <Col N="1379" /> was prior to that a reasonably well served service. I can only speak for my health board, and St. Fintan's and St. Loman's hospitals had two marvellous schools of nursing. It is some time since either had a student but, thankfully, that will change. I have been calling for a college of nursing in the Midland Health Board area for 14 years and the only one who heard my call was the Minister, Deputy Cowen. Last Thursday, he formally launched the school. It is fully operational and students are attending it at present.</P>
    <P>With regard to support services, I wish to record my appreciation of the Mental Health Association and also the members of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul who visit residents in psychiatric hospitals who have no one to visit them, or if they do, who will not come.</P>
    <P>Successive speakers said <i>ad nauseam </i>that psychiatry is a discipline in its own right. As Senator Quinn said, it is the first to be attacked when resources are scarce. Senator Finneran put his finger on it. There is no excuse for grass growing in gutters, water flowing down walls and broken doors. The inspector also referred to a lack of curtains and screens. There is a case to be answered. Many of the decisions taken in the 1980s by successive Ministers on foot of that famous document, &ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo;, were cost driven and it was the psychiatric services that got the chop.</P>
    <P>I thank Vincent Browne. Some local newspaper reports in County Westmeath were less than favourable. I feel sorry for those who have nowhere else to go. I also feel sorry for the nursing and medical staff who do their best in adverse conditions. St. Finian's ward has been mentioned. It was decided deliberately not to provide the necessary finance to upgrade it as a decision had already been made to close it. I rest my case.</P>

      <P>Because of the sensitivity of the issue the debate in a sense has been muted. As a consequence I will not be too hard on the Minister. Suffice to say I hope we will not debate the next report and find nothing has been done. What Vincent Browne said on his radio programme and in his newspaper column obviously caught the imagination of the nation. People were shocked. I am concerned however that when some other issue is highlighted it will take precedence.</P>
      <P>Those who contributed to the debate &ndash; I thank them for supporting me &ndash; were shocked when they read the report. They found its contents hard to believe. What concerns me however is that successive Ministers would have been aware of them. Even though we are all aware of the vulnerability of the people concerned &ndash; they are voiceless and silent &ndash; the amount provided is minimal in terms of the sum required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been raising the issue of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder &ndash; ADHD &ndash; for the last two years and this is first occasion on which I have received a response from the Minister. The report produced for the Joint Committee on <Col N="1380" /> Health and Children at my request has yet to be debated in the Dáil or Seanad. A sum of £1.1 million is to be allocated to fund further developments in child and adolescent psychiatry services which will provide for the appointment of additional consultants and the development of multi-disciplinary teams to focus on specific areas, including ADHD. However, this sum would not solve the problems being experienced in the Mid-Western Health Board region.</P>
    <P>Parents of children suffering from ADHD have to voluntarily fund assessment in the United Kingdom. The amounts spent by health boards abroad because of the failure to provide services here were listed in a recent edition of the <i>Sunday Independent.</i> Parents know from the age of one and a half to two years that the reason their child is lively is not that he or she is hyperactive but that he or she is suffering from a disorder. They spend their time trying to convince their general practitioner of this and are sent from one psychiatrist and psychologist to another knowing instinctively that something can be done for their child. Because the disorder remains undetected, some of these children end up in prison. The Minister's response is therefore inadequate.</P>
    <P>Teenagers suffering from depression are still being treated side by side with adults in ward 5B of Limerick Regional Hospital. This is unacceptable as they are unable to cope in such conditions for weeks at a time. The inspector recommended that appropriate provision be made for the development of child and adolescent and later life psychiatry services. He stated that in Limerick there was no separate unit for child and adolescent in-patients and that a priority for the service should be the provision of a dedicated regional unit for the child and adolescent service. It is shocking that we are unable to focus on teenagers who present with depression and give them the privacy they need. This would not cost a fortune but the inspector's recommendation has been ignored.</P>
    <P>The director of the Central Mental Hospital, Dr. Smith, said that at least 100 prisoners from Mountjoy should be in a psychiatric institution and not in prison. What kind of society is this? These are the issues that should be debated as they are the underbelly of a successful society. It is up to us to spread the word that funding should be provided immediately.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he would prefer the inspector to be employed by the mental health commission established under the terms of the Bill. In this way he or she would have complete independence from the Minister and the Department. I admire Dr. Dermot Walsh for being so open. From where would the funding come? It comes down to a question of pounds, shillings and pence. There is not one Senator who would begrudge additional funding to deal once and for all with the problems in our psychiatric services so harrowingly outlined today. I hope that words such as &ldquo;dickensian&rdquo;, &ldquo;horrific&rdquo;, &ldquo;harrowing&rdquo; and &ldquo;antediluvian&rdquo; will not be used next year in <Col N="1381" /> responding to the needs of the weakest in our society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I appreciate that the Minister increased the essential repairs grant in the past two years and, although that increase was wel<Col N="1383" /> come at the time, it would seem the amount of money now available to local authorities in the block grant for the essential repairs grant scheme is insufficient. Neither is the grant sufficient in individual cases. I ask the Minister to seriously consider increasing the grant available to individual applicants and also to increase the block grant provided to local authorities. About 500 applicants are currently waiting for the grant in the Mayo County Council area.</P>
      <P>While the scheme has resulted in valuable work being carried out over many years, it is restrictive. I am aware of many rural houses in which people, mainly elderly, live in poor conditions. For one reason or another, these people are unable to carry out repairs to their homes. The terms of the scheme stipulate that a house may only be improved for the duration of its inhabitants' lifetimes.</P>
      <P>The Minister should make it easier for applicants, older couples and those living alone, to obtain the grant. I am aware of a number of applicants who have applied for the essential repairs grant but they cannot get it because Mayo County Council does not have sufficient money. Engineers carry out reports throughout the county and funding is being eaten up at the beginning of the year. Mayo County Council requires a bigger slice of the cake in regard to the essential repairs scheme.</P>
      <P>Essential repairs under the scheme are confined to window, door and roof repairs. In some cases, applicants would be willing to donate funds themselves in order to do a proper job on their houses. Local authority engineers appear to be opposed to this in many cases because they feel that the work carried out on the houses might be too good. The Minister should examine this carefully. I am aware of cases in which people were refused grants because the families of elderly couples provided money for houses to be repaired on the understanding that they could avail of the essential repairs grant. However, when the engineers examined the work, they felt that the work was too good and was over and above essential repairs work. The scheme would seem to be overly restrictive in such instances. Family members or the inhabitants themselves should be able to combine the essential repairs grant with some of their own money in order to carry out a proper job on their houses. Perhaps the level of grant could be increased to £6,000 or £7,000.</P>
      <P>It is difficult nowadays for people to get tradesmen and workers and the cost of materials has increased, as have worker's wages. Our tiger economy has resulted in increased costs in the past two or three years. I hope the Minister will respond favourably to my request.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat surprised at the Senator for raising the essential repairs grant scheme, given that significant improvements to its terms and conditions were announced as recently as two weeks ago in the budget. Under the budget, the effective maximum grant available under the scheme was increased from £4,500 to £6,000. This increase was in addition to the substantial improvements to the scheme which I introduced in December 1998. Prior to last year's budget, the effective maximum grant stood at just £1,800 and it was increased to £4,500 last December. In short, I have increased the effective maximum grant payable under the essential repairs grant scheme by more than 230 per cent in the past 12 months. In addition, I amended the terms of the scheme to allow grants to be paid in urban areas.</P>
      <P>Of course, the essential repairs grant is not the only option available to assist those who are most in need of having essential works carried out to their houses. The disabled person's grant scheme assists disabled persons to carry out necessary adaptations or improvements to their dwellings. I have also twice improved the terms and conditions of this scheme in the past year, and the effective maximum grant now stands at £14,000 with the grant now covering 90 per cent of the approved cost of the works compared to a maximum of £8,000 and two-thirds of the approved cost of the works when I took office.</P>
      <P>To meet the additional expenditure under the disabled person's and essential repairs grant scheme, I have allocated over £18.4 million in next year's Estimates &ndash; up over 75 per cent on this year's provision and more than four times the amount provided under the scheme as recently as 1997 when Senator Burke's party was in Government.</P>
      <P>The Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly can also assist elderly people to improve their housing conditions. An extra £1 million was provided in the budget for the task force which, together with the increase of £1 million already provided in the abridged Estimates, brings the total allocation to £8 million in 2000 &ndash; almost twice the amount spent under the scheme in 1997.</P>
      <P>On the general point of extra funding for housing, the overall provision for the local authority and social housing programme has been increased by over 60 per cent in next year's Estimates. This is clear evidence of my and the Government's commitment to meeting the housing needs of the disadvantaged and the elderly in our community.</P>

I welcome the additional funding which he has provided and I thank him for coming to the House.</P>
