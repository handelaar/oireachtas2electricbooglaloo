      <P>A communication has been received from the Secretary to the Department of the Taoiseach that the Government, on the nomination of the Tánaiste, on the 16th March, 1956, appointed Daniel Spring, T.D., to the office of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take to-day items No. 1 and No. 2 on the Order Paper, provided the Minister for Finance is able to begin on the Central Fund Bill not later than 4 o'clock.  I think that will be feasible.  I understand that it is expected that the Supplies and Services Bill will be finished in the Dáil to-day.  The business for to-morrow, therefore, will be the Road Transport Bill, and the Supplies and Services Bill.  Items Nos. 4 to 11, which concern the Department of Industry and Commerce, are being postponed, with the agreement of the Tánaiste, until after Easter.  On the Adjournment, it is proposed to adjourn until 18th April.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the ordering of the business to-day, I should like to formulate something in the nature of a protest, arising out of the fact that sometimes some of us in the back benches here in the Seanad are not quite clear as to what precisely has been decided, or what precisely is proposed, or for what particular reason.  I should like to mention two illustrations of that.  On 7th March, we were assured by the <Col N="1526" /> Leader of the House, in his own words, column 1215:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Motion No. 14 will be taken, if we come to it, either to-day or to-morrow.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I stress the word &ldquo;to-morrow&rdquo; because it was the general opinion of the House that we would meet on that Thursday, 8th March, but, in actual fact, there seemed to be a sudden decision that we would not, after all, meet on that Thursday, and that we should leave several items on the agenda untouched. I felt on that occasion that the House had been insufficiently taken into the confidence of the front benches.  I felt that the consultation had not been wide enough.  I am not suggesting at all that there was any conscious intention to do that, and I am not criticising the ordering of the business from the Chair; but a similar kind of thing happened on the last night of meeting.  I said at the beginning of the meeting on 15th March at column 1433, that &ldquo;we will be dealing largely with the Central Fund Bill and the Supplies and Services Bill next week, and I should like to know whether it is hoped that we may get through this agenda to-day, and, if not, whether it is the intention to use our right to meet to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I was assured by Senator Hayes, in his own words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is our intention to endeavour to get through the business to-day, but it is not the intention to meet to-morrow.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am quite sure that that reply covered the facts, but there seems to have been a sudden decision later on not to &ldquo;endeavour to finish&rdquo; the agenda; and I felt myself I was not quite clear how that decision had been reached, or for what reason, or indeed exactly what had been agreed.  If I might refer the Seanad to column 1490 of the same debate, it becomes apparent, I think, that it was not even clear perhaps to all in the House just what had been agreed because you, Sir, state at column 1490:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is agreed that the House will continue on this stage.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1527" /> Later on, it seemed to be understood that we had agreed simply to finish the Superannuation Bill and then to adjourn altogether, whereas some of us were under the impression that we would finish that stage of the Superannuation Bill and then continue with the rest of the agenda.  Quite clearly, some members understood one thing and some understood another.  I myself am interested in the motion on corporal punishment which I handed in before Christmas, and I should not like to see it inadvertently postponed until after another school year is over.</P>
    <P>Again, I have no intention of criticising the Chair, nor indeed of criticising the front benches, save in so far as they sometimes assume that the back benches know all about what has been decided and subsequently fail to explain sufficiently or to consult sufficiently the back benches when suggesting decisions in relation to the order of business or the changing of an earlier decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that we do our best.  It is not easy to order business here sometimes. When the Dáil is meeting, Ministers are not always available here.  There is always a difficulty in arranging the business with a view to having the appropriate Minister present.  But I am at one with Senator Sheehy Skeffington about the proceedings last Thursday evening.  I was absent for a short time and I am not clear what happened, and I am not clear either why it happened.  All I can say is that we shall do our best to make the position clear.</P>
      <P>It is not usual for the House to meet merely for the discussion of a motion on the Order Paper.  The House generally meets only for the transaction of Government business and then transacts other business afterwards. Neither is it always possible to consult what the Senator calls backbenchers. I do not think that would be a proper description of himself.  It is difficult to consult them and nearly impossible to consult the lone-benchers. All that I can say is that we will do our best to see whether we can get any better scheme.</P>

    <P>Agreed to take Final Stages to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On this stage, I understand that we can speak only on what is in the Bill and not what we would wish to see in it.  I must confess that I rather plagued the House all during this measure about what is in the Bill rather than what is not in it.  On this Final Stage, I should like to express my disappointment that the Minister has not seen fit to put down an appropriate amendment to sub-section (f) of Section 10.  We discussed that at the last meeting of the Seanad and the Minister promised to consider it.  I think it was made quite clear from all sides exactly what the feeling of the House was in regard to that matter. I can only express my deep disappointment that the Minister has not had regard to what were obviously the views of the House and put down the appropriate amendment which was suggested.</P>
      <P>However, I do not think any of us would wish to hold up what is good in the Bill for what are obviously very serious shortcomings.  All I could have hoped to do here was to point out the shortcomings and I hope I have done that adequately.  If I did not satisfy the Minister on the point, I feel that I have satisfied a lot of people in the House as to these shortcomings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Bill is now about to pass, might I say that I am sorry the shortcomings are still in the Bill, sorry that I have not presuaded the Minister to make the appropriate amendment to this sub-section and sorry, too, that I should have in my ignorance done something by questioning the ruling of the Cathaoirleach at the start of the Committee Stage?  I know that I was <Col N="1529" /> treated with gentleness which I probably did not deserve as I was probably out of order.  I will cease on that point and express my disappointment again that the Minister has not had regard to the views expressed all round this House in regard to sub-section (f) and has not brought forward the appropriate amendment.  I am sure he has since the last meeting given further consideration to the matter, but, as no amendment appeared on the Order Paper for Report Stage, we can take it that he has set his face dead against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like briefly to associate myself with what Senator Murphy says and to express regret that the Minister has proved inflexible.  I rather accused him the last time of being frequently inflexible and he hotly denied it.  I am sorry that the three disputed sections are still maintained quite unaltered.</P>
      <P>I very much regret that it is part of the Bill that an employee of a local authority may lose all his pension rights for being absent without leave for a short time; I very much regret that the clause is still inserted which prevents a man, if he happens to be in poor health, from making an agreement with the local authority for the payment of some kind of annuity to his widow on his death, and I particularly regret the failure to remove Section 64 which stands unchanged, by which a jail sentence of even a few months' hard labour deprives a person of his entire pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer once more to Section 64.  We are confined to referring to what is in the Bill but I am sorry that Section 64 is still in the Bill.  I spoke about this matter last week and I cannot allow this occasion to pass without referring to it again.  The more I think on the matter, the more unfair and unjust it seems to me that the community should be divided into two classes.  The criminal law lays down certain penalties for certain crimes.  If a person is found guilty by a jury and sentenced by a judge, he expiates his crime, but if that person should be sufficiently unfortunate to hold a pension, he pays a double penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1530" /> Let us take the case of a man retiring at 60 years of age, with a reasonable expectation of life, who forfeits a pension of £300.  What that amounts to is that the person is being fined in a capital sum that may be worth anything up to £6,000 or £7,000. It is exceedingly unfair and unjust that the community should be divided into two classes.</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed his horror of Deputy Walsh's amendment that the law of testamentary disposition should be altered as a mere consequential result of a debate on the Bill, but here the criminal law is being altered in an exceedingly important respect by introducing this section.  The people who will suffer as a result of this section will be the innocent dependents of a convicted man.  The Minister replied on the Committee Stage, on which occasion I did not exercise my right to speak a second time, but I do so now.</P>
    <P>In his attitude to this matter, the Minister takes the same kind of line as any Minister in the House of Commons would have taken years ago when anybody suggested that hanging must be abolished for stealing more than the value of £1.  Is the Irish Parliament never going to reform the law?  Is the Minister for Local Government never going to say that he would like to see the law of local government better than it is, or must every statute be debated on the basis that, because similar sections exist in old British statutes going back into the past, the Seanad must bow its head to these laws and say they can never be altered?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, must say that I am rather disappointed by the attitude of the Minister on this measure.  As Senators will recall, there was a very wide discussion on certain sections in the measure, especially Section 10.  I understood, when we were discussing Section 10 on the last occasion the Seanad met that it was the intention of the Minister to give further consideration to it.  He also, I think, said he would have to consult the members of the Government.  I do not know whether that has been done.  In any case, I imagine it is due to the House that the Minister would tell us exactly <Col N="1531" /> what has happened in the meantime.  It appears to me that he has now taken up what one could nearly describe as a disinterested attitude.  I should like to know also from the Minister how it is proposed to implement this measure, when it becomes law.  I understand it will rest with the local authorities to adopt the measure or not, just as they like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to associate myself briefly with what has been said and to express my grave disappointment that the Minister has persisted in the line he took from the beginning, of refusing to give way to the amendments put up in this House and, indeed, in the other House to almost the same extent.  More than once during the debate, the Minister paid homage to democracy.  For instance, when complaint was made that Part III of the Bill can be put into operation only by resolution of the county councils&mdash;their servants not getting a pension scheme until such a resolution is adopted&mdash;the Minister said that that is democracy.</P>
      <P>Again, I complained that certain county committees refused to honour the allowance, or grant, or bonus given to civil servants.  The Minister said that that was democracy.  When certain suggestions are put before the Minister in order to point out, as was strongly pointed out from all sides of the House, that there were certain clauses that should be removed, the Minister persisted in his attitude and has not been convinced.</P>
      <P>We have before us now a measure which contains certain penal provisions that should not be in a Bill of this kind.  They are regarded by those at whom they are aimed as something in the nature of insults, if I may put it that way&mdash;a want of confidence, a suspicion on the part of the authorities that they must always be watched as, otherwise, they will not discharge their duties properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister hinted some time during the debate that there would possibly be an amending Bill very soon.  It cannot come too soon. I believe it will come soon, because, <Col N="1532" /> in my opinion, there are sections in this Bill that are bound to cause trouble and that will have to be amended in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. P. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to thank the Seanad for the very constructive manner in which they have received the Bill and the very constructive suggestions they have made.  However, I should like them to realise, as I told the House on a former occasion, that I consulted deputations of all Parties of this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon; I consulted deputations of all Parties and some members of this House who wished to come on those deputations&mdash;and they were deputations of political and non-political Parties.  I let it be known to all the political Parties that any of them who wished to send representatives from either House would be welcome to do so.  As a result, I accepted a considerable number of amendments and they are incorporated in this Bill.</P>
      <P>A lot of discussion has arisen here to-day about Section 64, the imprisonment section.  This House voted on that section and the voting was somewhere in the neighbourhood of 17 to seven. That shows how little interest the minority have in this particular section. It was a free for all vote of the House and 17 out of the 24 Senators present voted in favour of this section. Can anybody suggest to me that that section does not meet with the wish of the majority of the House?  I think it was Senator O'Brien who accused me of changing the law.  I am not changing the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am accusing the Minister of not changing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose I accepted the amendments which have been suggested to me.  What happens? We have one law&mdash;that is, the 1948 Act&mdash;for the persons who are to-day in receipt of pensions and we shall have a new law for those who will be in receipt of pensions under this Bill. <Col N="1533" /> Why should we discriminate?  No member of this House has made a suggestion to amend the old Bill.  It would be unfair to discriminate between pensioners of the past and pensioners of the future.  If there were general agreement that the one law should apply to all&mdash;as I am trying to make it&mdash;then I could see something in the suggestion.  I think it is a very wrong procedure to victimise people for certain actions of theirs in the past and to let pensioners in the future off scot free.  The House expressed its view on the section.  There was a free vote of the House.  I did not try to intimidate or make a suggestion and, out of the 24 members present, 17 said they were in favour of this section.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators expressed views on Section 10 (1) (f).  I gave the House an assurance, and I give it again, that that sub-section is not being inserted to victimise in any way the striker.  It is being inserted for a very good reason, that is, so that we or the local authority can chastise individuals who willingly absent themselves from their place of work.  In my view, it is but right that they should be penalised in some way or other.  I have discussed the matter with trade unions and with representatives of all political Parties of the Lower House. I have heard the views of this House. I say now, with confidence, that, no matter what I have heard from these other individuals, nothing has impressed me yet that I should amend the section.</P>
      <P>Senator Kissane wanted to know when the Bill will become an Act.  Part III of the Bill becomes an Act immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to know what steps the Minister proposes to take to see that the Bill will be implemented when it becomes law, because, as far as I understand, it is a matter for the local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Immediately this Bill becomes an Act, Part III will apply to all local authorities who have already adopted Part III of the 1948 Act.  The remainder of the Bill will become an Act by an Order made by me, which I hope to make before 1st <Col N="1534" /> April.  In other words, the entire Bill will become an Act before 1st April, except in so far as certain local authorities who have not adopted Part III of the Superannuation Act, 1948, are concerned.  The local authorities concerned are Cork, Donegal, Leitrim, Roscommon, Sligo and the South Cork Board of Public Assistance.</P>

    <Title>Central Fund Bill, 1956 (Certified Money Bill)&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Fund Bill, as members of the House are aware, is an annual feature.  This year, in addition to fulfilling its customary and main function in giving legislative effect to the Vote on Account which has already been passed by the Dáil, the Bill provides for the establishment of a Capital Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I may first deal with the main items included in the Vote on Account.  The Vote on Account which is always taken at this time of the year represents, as members of the House are aware, roughly one-third of the total sum needed to carry on the services of the State in the coming financial year.  It is approximately the amount that is required to carry on <Col N="1535" /> until the end of July, that is say, for the first four months of the year.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill, therefore, authorises the payment of £36,200,000 from the Central Fund.  Section 1 and Section 3 of the Bill are in the usual form.  Section 1 authorises the payment from the Central Fund of a sum of £5,504,458 which amount is the total of the Supplementary and Additional Estimates which were passed during the current year, while Section 3 provides in the normal form for borrowing by the Minister for Finance to the total of the amounts mentioned in the first two sections.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, this Bill is being utilised for the purpose of dealing with the establishment of a Capital Fund and Section 4 provides for the establishment of that fund.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for the coming financial year total £109,123,280.  The corresponding figure for the current year is £105,488,093.  In other words, the Estimates for next year represent an increase of £3,635,187 over the original Estimates for this year.  As I mentioned in the other House this increase can be attributed largely to additional remuneration for civil servants, teachers, Army, Garda and others, an item which will cost the State in all almost £3,500,000 more next year.  Of the other major variations, the largest occurs in the provisions for grants to health authorities which, in the coming year, are up by £971,000.  This additional amount in the State grants payable to local health authorities is partly the result of the increased cost of existing health services and also the result of the additional cost in the matter of the extension of the health services, due to come into operation at the end of this month.</P>
    <P>The agricultural grant is up by £249,000, while there is an increase of over £256,000 in forestry.  That forestry increase, I should mention, includes an additional £153,250 for forestry development. That will enable us to increase the area that will be planted during the coming year.</P>
    <P>An extra £153,000 is being provided for university education, of which <Col N="1536" /> £127,500 will be borne on the Vote for Universities and Colleges and the balance on the Vote for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Constructional works at Shannon and Dublin Airports will take an additional £100,000 next year, but higher receipts, mainly from catering and landing fees, will serve to reduce the net increase in the Vote for Aviation and Meteorological Services to £85,300.  It is expected that additional grants under the Undeveloped Areas Act will be payable next year and accordingly I have provided an extra £165,000 for An Foras Tionscal.</P>
    <P>In the case of agriculture, there are substantial increases in the amounts expected to be spent on the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme, the increase being £250,500, and on grants for the pasteurisation of separated milk, where the increase is £160,000, but increased Appropriations-in-Aid from the American Grant Counterpart Special Account cover the extra cost of these schemes and serve to keep the net increase in the Vote for Agriculture at a total of £41,000.</P>
    <P>The Estimates Volume contains for the first time provision to cover our commitments as a member of the United Nations, roughly £93,000 being provided for this purpose.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the main increases, apart from increases in such Estimates as Primary Education, Posts and Telegraphs, Garda Síochána and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners which are due largely to additional remuneration.</P>
    <P>The two largest decreases occur in the provision for flour and bread subsidy and the Grant-in-Aid of the Hospitals Trust Fund.  A decrease of £760,000 in the case of the former item is possible because of the decrease in the cost of both native and imported wheat, while the amount required from the Exchequer by the Hospitals Trust Fund towards the financing of the hospitals building programme is down by £1,000,000.  In the current year, £618,000 less is being provided for payments to the Social Insurance Fund, but, as I explained in Dáil Eireann, there will in fact be a substantial saving on this Vote in the current year, because the employment situation has <Col N="1537" /> proved to be better than was anticipated when the provision was originally settled.  The Estimate for Transport and Marine Services is down by £136,000, but, I may say, that while the provision for the G.N.R. shows a decrease of over £146,000, exact requirements under this head cannot be forecast with accuracy until the end of next September, when the board's financial year concludes.</P>
    <P>In the case of Public Works and Buildings, there is a reduction of £302,000 in the provision of new works and alterations.  This year's provision has proved to be excessive.  There is a reduction of £125,000 in the amount required for the new runways at Baldonnel which are now approaching completion and this also helps to account for the decrease.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will be aware that I availed of this opportunity given by the introduction of the Vote on Account this year in the Dáil to give a general survey of the economic conditions and trends, and also to take advantage of that opportunity to state the measures which the Government are taking to correct the serious balance of payments situation which has arisen.  These measures include an attractive new issue of saving certificates to encourage savings, restriction on hire purchase transactions, to discourage spending in advance of earning, and the imposition of a special import levy on a wide range of less essential commodities by which it is hoped to curb imports and substantially to reduce the balance of payments deficit.</P>
    <P>This levy, which was imposed by Emergency Imposition of Duties Order, will be retained only so long as the balance of payments situation so requires and it is intended that the revenue accruing from it should not be available for general purposes, but should be paid into the Capital Fund to which I referred a few minutes ago and applied out of that fund towards the financing of the general State capital programme.  This procedure will ensure that the revenue from the levy will not be used to finance current spending, but will instead relieve&mdash; temporarily and only, of course, to a <Col N="1538" /> small extent&mdash;the great difficulty of raising the required capital for public purposes.</P>
    <P>But I want to stress, as I stressed in the other House, that the primary purpose of the special import levy is its deterrent effect and that its revenue-producing effect is only of quite secondary importance.  In fact, so far as I am concerned, it would be better that it should produce less revenue, because then it would mean that it would have had a greater deterrent effect on bringing in imports of a less essential nature, without which we shall have to do for the moment and until such time as we are enabled to raise production, agricultural and industrial, to a higher level.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides for the establishment of the Capital Fund. The proceeds of the levy will go first into the Exchequer but an equivalent amount will be charged on the Central Fund and will be paid into the Capital Fund from time to time.  An account of the fund is to be prepared in respect of each financial year and to be presented to each House of the Oireachtas, with the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General thereon.</P>
    <P>I assume that the members of the House would not wish me to repeat here the statements I made in the Dáil in relation to our present economic situation and the measures which the Government consider desirable to deal with that situation at the present time.  I assume that members of this House have had the opportunity of reading the Dáil Debates to that extent, and, so far as the debate of yesterday is not available, of reading in this morning's newspapers what was stated on all sides of the House yesterday.  I assume, as I say, that members of the House would not wish me to unduly weary them by repeating what was said in the other House, but needless to say, if there is any particular point that any Senator would wish me to advert to in my reply, either in relation to that aspect of the discussion, or in relation to the Estimates Volume, I shall be happy to try to do so to the best of my ability when concluding the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill presented by the Minister to the House this afternoon affords the House one of the very few opportunities it has during the year to consider and give its verdict on Government policy.  This afternoon, the Minister presents the House with a request for a cheque of £32,000,000 odd to carry on, out of a total amount of £109,000,000 odd&mdash;the largest bill that was ever presented to this country.  When we come to examine it, and to compare it with past demands, we find, going no further back than 1947-48&mdash;and in that period we heard very great criticism of the then demand&mdash;that the demand then was for £58,918,165.  The demand put before us to-day is almost double that of 1947-48.  The cruel and callous demand that was placed before us in 1952-53 was £92,268,588.  Last year, in 1954-55, we had a demand for £104,931,089.  When we take into consideration, as we must, the Supplementary Estimates that will come forward during the course of the year, and when we add to this sum of £109,000,000 odd, the sum of £3,000,000, which, I assume, will be made available in the coming year also for the National Development Fund, we arrive at the figure of £112,000,000.</P>
      <P>We have not the whole picture before us to-day&mdash;we will have to wait until we have the White Paper and until we have the Budget statement from the Minister, to get the full picture of what the total demand will be on the people of this country&mdash;but if we only take the figure on the Book of Estimates presented to us&mdash;and I am sure the Minister, the Government and the experts have gone through the Book of Estimates and have done as much pruning as they possibly could in this matter&mdash;we find ourselves presented to-day, under the circumstances in which we find ourselves, with this huge demand of no less a sum than £112,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Book of Estimates, we find there is no provision made for many of the things we hoped to see provision made for in the coming year.  A Bill has been introduced in the Dáil&mdash;one which I and those of us who come from he Gaeltacht areas are very interested <Col N="1540" /> in&mdash;to establish a new Ministry, the Ministry for the Gaeltacht.  There are great things expected from the establishment of that Ministry and if the things expected from it are to be achieved, there must be some moneys made available to this Department. But we find there is no provision made in this Bill for such a Ministry.</P>
    <P>We also find there is no provision made&mdash;there is nothing in this Bill, as a matter of fact, except a reduction of £1,000,000 in capital expenditure&mdash;for the purposes of capital expenditure, that we might direct our attention to and that might suggest to us, that we are going to get the increased production we hear so much about.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill affords us, as I say, an opportunity of reviewing Government policy and looking back over the year to find what has been done and what has been achieved. If I were to attempt to summarise the activities of the Government during the year, I would do so in one phrase, that is, that it has been one great gamble.  It has been one gamble after another.  The first gamble was taken in January of 1955 when the Minister took the step of ensuring that there would be no advance in our bank rate. At that time, when we were discussing the Central Fund Bill, he put before us the benefits that would accrue to the State and the nation in general from the decision then made.</P>
    <P>That decision was questioned, not alone by members on this side of the House but by members on the other side, as to whether, in the national interest, it was a wise decision; but the decision was made, and it was held out to us that, if we allowed our bank rate here to follow the lead given across the water, it would be bad for industry and commerce, and it would result in the creation of more unemployment throughout the country.  However, that decision has been reversed, and no explanation as to the reasons why the Government changed its approach and changed its views in this matter, which was so important this time 12 months, has been set out by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The announcement was hailed with the blowing of great trumpets, that, for once in the life of an Irish Parliament, <Col N="1541" /> a decision had been taken in the interests of the Irish people, that no longer had we a Government that was prepared to follow the dictation and the lead of the Government across the water, the lead given by the Bank of England, or the advice of the Central Bank, or any other financial authority. The decision was hailed by the Minister and his associates as one that should be generally accepted by the people.  However, we have seen the results of that and we have seen the Minister and the Government reverse their decision, and we must expect that, if the Minister in his announcements this time 12 months was right as to the consequences that would result from the increase in the bank rate&mdash;the effect it would have on industry and commerce and on unemployment&mdash;we must come to the conclusion that the Minister has accepted that these results will follow from the decision that he has been compelled recently to make.</P>
    <P>The next great gamble was the tea gamble.  A Government decision was made to maintain the then existing price of tea at a cost of £1,000,000. Provision was made that Tea Importers, Limited, would borrow £1,000,000 from the banks in order to maintain the then existing price.  It was amazing at that time how, in particular, the Labour Party claimed that they, as a responsible part of the Government, were responsible for forcing this decision, much against, I am sure, the wishes of the Minister for Finance.  But they claimed credit for bringing about a position that the price of tea should be maintained.  We were promised, when we were discussing this Bill this time last year, that an announcement would be made in September of 1955. The announcement was not made until October of 1955, but then the gamble was over, and the only parties who won in this particular gamble were the banks.  They lent the £1,000,000 to Tea Importers, Limited.  Tea Importers, Limited, imported the tea and the tea consumers of this country now have the pleasure of knowing that, for the next three years, on every lb. of tea they purchase, they will be paying from 2d. to 4d. per lb., not for the cheap tea they consumed during the <Col N="1542" /> period of 1955, but to repay the interest on the £1,000,000 that was borrowed in order to give them that tea.</P>
    <P>That is not the full picture.  We have recently seen that there has been a considerable reduction on the tea market in the price of tea.  That reduction, which is being passed on to the tea consumer across the water, cannot and will not be passed on to the tea consumer in this country, because of the gamble that was taken by the Government in relation to this matter in January, 1955.</P>
    <P>The next decision was that £1,000,000 should be saved by the reduction of the guaranteed prices paid to the Irish farmer for the growing of wheat.  It was one of the very few guaranteed prices for produce the Irish farmer had. The reason given at that time by the Minister for Agriculture was that a very undesirable element had entered into the production of wheat in this country, and that, in order to eliminate that very undesirable element, it was necessary to reduce the price of wheat. Nobody, not even the Minister himself, accepted or believed that that was the reason, because the people remember the Minister's attitude over a long number of years to the growing of wheat and beet and the other crops for which the Irish farmer had a guaranteed price.</P>
    <P>What has been the result?  We see the results in this Book of Estimates. In an attempt to bring about a saving of £1,000,000, we have had a considerable reduction in the acreage of wheat; and, arising out of that reduction in the acreage of wheat, we have also had a reduction in the general tillage acreage and, side by side with that, a reduction in our live-stock population, more particularly in our pig and poultry population.  We have had a reduction of something in the region of 20,000 in milch cows.  Those of us who know the farming community will admit that the milch cow is the basis and foundation of our cattle production. When we find a reduction of 20,000 in our cattle population, then our position is not one upon which we have very much to congratulate ourselves.</P>
    <P>The next decision of the Government <Col N="1543" /> was to save something&mdash;I have not got the exact figure&mdash;by the removal of the subsidy on flour for biscuit and confectionery manufacture.  The Minister, making this announcement, put before us that it was only right that those people who liked to have a biscuit either for tea or otherwise, or who favoured confectionery, should pay, and that this particular business was in a position to stand up to the conditions the Minister proposed imposing on them.</P>
    <P>I remember well, when this Bill was before the House last year, questioning the wisdom of this decision.  I was told by the Minister that provision would be made particularly to make flour available to those people in the biscuit and confectionery trade who were engaged in the export market, because an export market had been built up at the time in this business.  I and the representatives of the industry who waited on the Minister were assured that some concessions would be given. What has been the result of the withdrawal of this subsidy?  I think every Senator has been supplied every week with an extract showing the number of persons unemployed, employed and otherwise.  We find that, as a result of the withdrawal of this subsidy, no fewer than 477 persons have been rendered unemployed in the biscuit and confectionery trade, the majority of them in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>That has resulted entirely from the decision made by the Minister.  When representations were made in recent weeks to the Department of Industry and Commerce, a last minute effort was made to relieve the position somewhat by a reduction in the price of the sack of flour.  Assuming that the sack of flour contains 112 lb., there is a reduction of something in the region of 10/- in each sack of flour made available for this industry.</P>
    <P>If we examine the figures the Minister has in relation to flour, biscuits and confectionery imported and sold at a lower price than that at which they could be produced in this country and if we examine the conditions of employment, the effect on our <Col N="1544" /> export market and the number of persons who have been rendered unemployed and the amount of money they have drawn in unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance, there will be very little difference between that amount and the concessions now made.  The cost to maintain the subsidy at the rate existing this time 12 months would have encouraged our people to make greater progress in our export market about which we hear so much.</P>
    <P>The next decision of the Government to relieve the burden of taxation was the removal of the subsidy on rural electrification.  This matter was the subject of a motion in the Dáil and I do not wish to detain the House too long on the matter, except to draw attention to the fact that the subsidy on rural electrification was made available by the previous Government. Naturally, the areas first affected were those areas which were prepared to accept rural electrification, because of their proximity to the distribution centres.  We must, therefore, conclude that the areas now outstanding are the more remote areas.  They are areas to which we should like to have the facilities of rural electrification extended.  Having reached the stage of helping the people we would like to help most and for whom the subsidy was originally intended, we find that the Government decides to withdraw the subsidy.  Already we have complaints. I am sure the Minister for Finance has had complaints in his Department with regard to the special charges enforced upon the people in rural Ireland as a result of this decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <P>The time will come when Senator Burke may even like to get a little support from the constituents of South Mayo.  There is another decision&mdash;only one of the many steps taken by the Government&mdash;and that is the step involving the passing on from the central authority the responsibility <Col N="1546" /> of financing matters in respect of which the Central Fund should and was properly charged.</P>
      <P>Last June or July, we had before us a Public Health Bill, the main purpose of which was the placing in abeyance of some sections of the Public Health Act.  The word &ldquo;abeyance&rdquo; covers very appropriately many of the steps we have taken in recent years.  One of the provisions of the Act to which I refer was the transfer from the Central Fund to the local authorities of the responsibility of providing medical treatment for insured persons. In passing that section, we transferred from the Central Fund to the local authorities the sum of £75,000 for the provision of medical services originally provided from the Central Fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that at a meeting of the Westmeath County Council, the Senator would like to put forward that alibi.  Facts are facts. The Senator went into the Division Lobby in this House and voted on that particular section of the Bill transferring from the Central Fund to the Westmeath County Council the responsibility of providing the funds to meet the requirements of those persons who have paid for, and are entitled to receive because of the payments they have made by way of contribution, medical treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision was made in the 1955 Act.  The responsibility has now been passed on to the local authorities to provide this treatment for persons who, by paying into their insurance, should be entitled to receive medical treatment.  That medical treatment must now be provided by the local authorities.  These are the gambles that have taken place during the year.  The question we should ask ourselves, in examining this Bill is: Who has won?  In the first instance, in relation to tea, the consumer still goes on paying for the next three or four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1547" /> We have now arrived at the position where the Minister presents us with the highest bill ever presented to a Parliament in this country, and under the most peculiar circumstances.  It comes at a time when, over 12 months, we have had the experience of four appeals to the Irish people to invest their money&mdash;two by responsible corporations, one by the E.S.B., and one by the Government itself.  Only one of the loans was a success.  We must ask ourselves, in all seriousness, at least one or two questions.  Are the citizens of this country not prepared to invest their money in the loans that have been or will be floated either by the Central Government or by local government?  If that is the case, why?  I think that that is one of the questions that poses itself to the Minister to-day.  The Cork Corporation floated a loan which was not successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like Senator Hawkins to withdraw the suggestion that the Cork Corporation loan was not fully subscribed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government found that the people did not respond to its appeal just a month ago.  The question that arises is whether the citizens of this country are prepared to invest their money and whether the money is available.  These are questions to which the Minister should find answers.</P>
      <P>Appeals are being made to increase agricultural and industrial production. How do we set about doing that?  We first set about doing it by suggesting that those persons who have invested their money in Irish industry and built it up to what it is to-day are sheltering behind tariff walls.  As a matter of fact, if at least one of the Ministers in the Government had his way it is not sheltering behind tariff walls that these people would be but behind the walls of Mountiov </P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the greatest distortion of facts that could be carried out by anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this the proper approach that would leave one to expect the people of this country to put their money into Irish industry? Is this the way to encourage those who are at the moment engaged in Irish industry to expand and develop their industry and to seek the export market that we hear so much about and that is recommended to us?  I am sure the Minister would like, if he could, to obliterate from the records of this House and from the minds of those people who are interested in these subjects all the things that have been said.</P>
      <P>Having that approach, on the one hand, to those people who built up Irish industry and have brought it to the position in which it is to-day, we then set sail not to one continent but to two continents to hold out inducements to people to come here and give us, first, the &ldquo;know-how&rdquo;, to come with their knowledge and their finance and to build up industries here.  Many of the statements that have been made suggested they should come and go into competition with many industries that are now in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is hardly fair to make that statement.  They are told very definitely they are not to be in competition with those industries which already exist.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, we have an appeal for greater agricultural production.  What has been our <Col N="1549" /> approach in this direction?  It has been to reduce the guaranteed price to the farmer for wheat, resulting in a reduction of tillage, of live stock and in agriculture in general.  The question then must pose itself as to what is needed in order to take our country out of the very difficult position in which we find ourselves.  I suggest that the one thing that is necessary is leadership.  We have not that.</P>

      <P>Within a month, the Minister for Finance, in no less a place than Galway City, spoke before the chamber of commerce there in a very detailed way on what he considered our present position to be.  For some reason best known to the Cabinet, the Parliamentary Secretary, who is looked upon as a wizard of finance, took himself to Loughrea, County Galway, and made a pronouncement there.  The Minister for Defence betook himself on the same Sunday to Longford and another statement was made there.  Both of those statements were contrary to the statement made by the Minister for Finance in Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no wonder that the people were bewildered as to whether the position is as was stated by the Minister in Galway, or as stated by him now when putting these proposals before us, or whether it was as the Parliamentary Secretary had stated in Loughrea.</P>
      <P>The question has been asked as to why we cannot increase our agricultural production in order to relieve the position.  Last year, there was a good deal of talk about maintaining the prices for live stock and the Minister then expressed the hope that the ruling prices would continue.  They have not continued, and we have seen during the 12 months that have elapsed a fall in the prices of our live stock, and of course the Minister for Agriculture, in his usual bombastic manner, suggests that that reduction in the price was brought about by Fianna Fáil and the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1550" /> I should like the House to remember that, having regard to the fact that Fianna Fáil is the largest political Party in this country, having in its ranks the greatest number of farmer representatives and being the political Party which has the support of 50 per cent. of the total voting strength of the country, it would not be good policy for anybody to suggest or write on behalf of Fianna Fáil that there should be a reduction in the price of any one item which this country produces for export, and particularly a reduction in the price of cattle.</P>
    <P>The Minister prefers to shelter himself behind the mud-slinging campaign which he initiated at the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis when he attacked Fianna Fáil and said that they were responsible for the falling cattle prices.  On the very evening the Minister made that statement, I listened to a report of a cattle market from Radio Éireann and it was stated that there had been a considerable reduction in the price of cattle at that market.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the question of the proposals which the Minister has put before us by way of import levies, I will say that the financial position is such that it demands that action should be taken.  I doubt whether the steps taken by the Minister are steps which are going to be effective.  The Minister had stated here and in the Dáil that the levies which he is placing on this wide range of imports, numbering 68 in all, will, he hopes, reduce the balance of trade deficit by something in the region of £7,000,000.  I consider that we are approaching this problem in the wrong way and that what we require above all at present is an increase in production.  There is not one item in the Book of Estimates, nor has one syllable been uttered by the Minister, to indicate that steps are being taken to ensure that there will be that increased production.  The Minister has stated that our reliance must be placed on agriculture, but what provision is being made in the huge sum of £109,000,000, which will eventually be in the region of £112,000,000, to bring about an increase in the national production?</P>
    <P>One of the measures taken by the <Col N="1551" /> Minister deals with hire purchase. Speaking on the Central Fund Bill last year, I drew the attention of the Minister to this question of hire purchase. I had then in mind a very definite approach to the problem.  I do not think that the Minister's approach at the moment is the right one.  I do not agree with Deputy Morrissey that it is wrong for any worker who is helping to create greater production to have an autocycle for going to work whether he has it on the hire-purchase system or otherwise.  Hire purchase has now come to be part of the make-up of many countries, and I do not hold that it is wrong for workers to have wireless or television sets, provided they are prepared to make the contributions for the payment of those articles.  I do hold, however, that the time has come when we should examine critically the whole Hire Purchase Act and when permanent legislation should be introduced to remove many of the loopholes which exist in the present Act and which are being availed of, not by all, but by a few of the unscrupulous persons who are engaging in this kind of activity.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter which has to be considered.  We have in this country, side by side with the hire-purchase schemes, a form of sales which are referred to as &ldquo;deferred payment&rdquo; schemes where a person can take away an article and pay for it weekly.  That is something which could provide an opportunity for people engaged in hire purchase to evade the proposals the Minister now puts forward by transferring to this other form of activity.</P>
    <P>I referred at the outset to the removal of the subsidy on rural electrification, and I want to come back to that important matter now.  When rural electrification was introduced, it was held out as bringing to the women in the rural areas the facilities available to their sisters of the cities and towns and as a means of stemming the flight from the land.  Now having extended rural electrification to many areas, we are taking steps to deprive the womenfolk in the country of the many facilities and helps that their <Col N="1552" /> sisters in the town have by way of washing-machines, &ldquo;fridges&rdquo;, cookers and so on.  Not alone are we increasing the deposits as far as hire purchase is concerned, but we are also raising the price, putting a levy of 25 or 37 per cent. on the total cost of the article.  Therefore, we are putting these helps out of the reach of these people in rural Ireland to whom we have given light and power at considerable expense.  We are setting about depriving them of the facilities this light and power could give them and the happiness, the comfort and the contentment these facilities could give in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is because of these considerations that I for one am not prepared to agree that the Minister has approached this problem from the right direction.  He has made provision that whatever moneys accrue to the Exchequer as a result of the levies placed on the importation of these articles will be put into a particular fund, but that will not make very much difference&mdash;particularly it will not make very much difference to young people.  We have had many commissions and committees sitting to tell us the solutions to our many problems, and among these problems are late marriages.  The introduction of levies comes at a time when in our city, and in towns throughout the country, many young people have come to the conclusion that they will get married after Easter.  As a result of the imposition of these duties, they will now be compelled to consider again the demands that will be made on them.</P>
    <P>Two additional charges are being inflicted on them.  The price will be increased and the down-payment will also be increased.  Where these young people have made provision on the basis of a certain sum of money, that sum will have to be almost doubled before they can reach the decision, or give effect to a decision they have already reached, to set up house for themselves.  Taking into consideration the amount of money involved, £7,000,000 is not a very considerable sum, and will not make any great impression on this balance of trade that the Minister has referred to, particularly when we are making no <Col N="1553" /> provision for encouraging increased production.</P>
    <P>When the 1942-43 Budget was under consideration, as I said at the outset, it was referred to as a very harsh and cruel Budget.  The terms and taxations imposed under that Budget still exist and in addition to these now, we are to have increased bank rates, increased hire-purchase rates and the new levy that the Minister proposes. At that time, when we made the case that it was in the best interests of the people that our balance of payments should be attended to and that these reserves that we held abroad should be maintained, we were told that our approach to it was that we were providing money for John Bull to fight the Mau Mau.  But I wonder now would it be in keeping to suggest that this present situation is that we are providing money to fight the Cypriots? Times have changed.</P>

      <P>I was very pleased to read to-day the statement made by the Tánaiste.  I am sure it is not one he would have made during the General Elections of 1948 or 1944.  He said that &ldquo;if the Government failed to act in the situation which was now presenting itself to the country, then they would be responsible for running down valuable external assets.  He would not mind if their foreign assets were to be used for importing goods that would be used for productive purposes and wealth-creating activities at home, but it would be dangerous to allow the assets to dwindle by using them for the importation of non-essential or luxury goods.  The simple issue confronting us to-day,&rdquo; Mr. Norton said, &ldquo;is that whatever we import must be paid for.  They can be paid for only in two ways&mdash;by expanding our exports, or running down our external assets which are profitably invested abroad.&rdquo; If they failed to take the necessary steps now, they might have to cut down the importation of essential goods later on with the grievous consequence that such a step would mean a lowering of the standard of living.  If <Col N="1554" /> the country had not sufficient external assets available for essential goods, then they would have to borrow.  If they borrowed in such circumstances, they borrowed with their hands in financial handcuffs with no bargaining power and no say in regard to the rates of interest and other terms which would be dictated to them.  That situation would be dangerous for the country.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nobody here,&rdquo; the Tánaiste continued, &ldquo;would desire to see either our good name or the political or economic security of the country put in a pawnshop, no matter what flag might hang over the pawnshop.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is, to my mind, a great pity that both the Tánaiste and many of these people who have come to realise the importance of our external assets and what they mean to our people here, and particularly our workers, took so long to be educated.  But it is better late than never and while some steps had to be taken, I will say, in conclusion, that I for one would not agree that the steps the Government and the Minister have proposed, and which the Minister now puts before us, represent the best means of dealing with the position, or will have the effect of achieving the objects which both the Minister and we all naturally wish to see achieved.</P>

      <P>In the first place, I wish to say that the actual Estimates themselves which are embodied in the Bill before us seem to be reasonable, in view of the rising wages and rising prices in the country.  In so far as the Book of Estimates shows an increasing expenditure which reflects rising costs and wages and rising payments to Government servants, it is very hard to see what the Minister could have done to keep the Estimates down.  He has reduced a number of Estimates, but a number of others have increased almost automatically.  The country must be prepared to pay its own servants and there is nothing we really can do about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to discuss the Estimates in detail, but I wish to make a few remarks about the general financial position, which is usually <Col N="1555" /> discussed in this debate.  The outstanding feature at this moment, as everyone knows, is that the balance of payments in this country has gone very wrong indeed in the course of the past 12 months.  The adverse balance for the year 1955 is estimated at something in the neighbourhood of £35,000,000.  This is an extremely serious position, in view of the fact that the adverse balance shows no sign of automatically self-correcting itself. It is not as though it were a case where there was some temporary feature that could be expected to disappear in the course of time; on the contrary, the adverse balance of payments shows signs of getting worse rather than better.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the trend ever since 1947 has been disquieting.  It is the same trend as was noticed by the, at the time, much-despised Banking Commission of 1934-38.  The growing deficit in our balance of payments was referred to in the Report of the Banking Commission, of which the Minister's father was a most respected and valuable member.  We were accused at the time of being unrealistic, pessimistic, academic and cassandras&mdash;all the adjectives that could be invented by highly educated and exceedingly eloquent critics were hurled at us.</P>
    <P>The trend which was visible then has again appeared in the fifties.  It was arrested by the war in 1939, when external assets were piled up&mdash;not through any great merit on our part, but because our imports were interrupted by the war.  Therefore, the situation is extremely serious.  It is not self-corrective.  It does not contain the seeds of its own correction.  It is part of a long-period trend which has been going on since the early thirties, and even earlier, and was interrupted from 1939 to 1947.  It is a trend which shows every sign of continuing in the future.  As was said by several speakers in the Dáil, it is obvious that the greater part of the excess of imports is the result of excessive consumption.  If it was anything in the nature of a repatriation of our capital investment abroad, it might be tolerated, or even approved, but it cannot be justified on <Col N="1556" /> those grounds.  It is not an importation solely for investment purposes; it is largely an importation of consumer goods which we cannot afford with our exporting capacity at the moment. Therefore, as a nation, we are, of course, living beyond our means.</P>
    <P>It is the imperative duty of any Government, which is so unfortunate as to be in power at a time like this, to correct this trend.  I say &ldquo;so unfortunate&rdquo; because the measures which the Government, in my opinion, is morally bound to take will be measures which will necessarily be unpopular and will, no doubt, have a very bad reception amongst large sections of the community.  The Government is asked to do something in the nature of a deflationary programme and a deflationary programme is like a slimming treatment for an individual prescribed by a doctor.  It is not very pleasant for a doctor to prescribe it and it is still less pleasant for the patient to pursue it.  Nevertheless, it may be a condition for gaining good health; and I have no doubt, knowing the Minister's courage and independence of mind, that he is a good doctor and that he will not be deterred from giving good advice to his patient by considerations of fleeting unpopularity.</P>
    <P>If the correct measures are not taken, it is only a matter of time&mdash;it is as certain as day follows night&mdash;that this country will be faced with an extremely unpleasant situation.  On the one hand, we will lose all our external reserves.  The amount of our free external reserves is already becoming quite low.  Some of the figures which are quoted in popular controversy are unreal.  The only external reserves which could be used to meet the balance of payments over a short period are the sterling assets in the commercial banking system.  Once they are exhausted, the other external assets could be made available for meeting a deficit in the balance of payments only by measures which I do not think the present Government, with its tradition of honouring the personal liberty of the individual, would be very willing to take.  The alternative to this exhaustion of our reserves&mdash;<Col N="1557" /> the two evils may go together&mdash;is the devaluation of our currency.</P>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that recent experience in England and in other countries in Europe is that devalution is almost invariably a matter of necessity and not a matter of choice.  Where countries have devalued their currency, it is almost invariably a reflection of the bad principles they have pursued in an unwise internal policy which has enabled them to keep the parity of exchange at the old level.  I would regard devaluation of the Irish currency as a confession of defeat.  It would give, perhaps, a temporary relief; but, as I said, it would be an expensive one, and I hope that we will not be driven to that.  Unless the correct medicine is prescribed by the physician and taken by the patient, this country will find itself without free external assets or faced with devaluation of its currency, which, as I say, is a confession of defeat.  It is not a solution of the problem; it is not a cure; it is a confession of defeat.  It is a confession that the right remedies have either not been attempted, or, having been attempted, have failed.</P>
    <P>We heard Senator Hawkins say to-day what is undoubtedly true. Everybody is agreed that, if a man is living beyond his means, the better way of getting him back into solvency is to increase his income, rather than reduce his expenditure.  We are agreed that in this country an expansion of production, both agricultural and industrial, is the desirable object of Government policy.  The Government and the Opposition are agreed on that.  Everybody is prepared to pay lip-service to that principle, but, without going into any details regarding the great difficulty of expanding production, and, above all, of expanding production for export, I want to make this one point: that programme takes time.  It is a long-term programme. We hope it will be achieved in the long run, but, especially in the case of agricultural production, it takes years.  In industrial production, although it might not take so long, the potential capacity of Irish industry to produce exported goods is not very great.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1558" /> We are all agreed that, in the long run, this must be the object of Government policy; and, therefore, with the object of building up increased production, that the Minister must aim at an increase in internal domestic savings; and, to that extent, his savings policy is amply justified.  It may be that internal savings in this country may not be sufficient to finance the amount of investment required for the expansion of exports.  In that case, the attraction of foreign capital, which was debated here recently in connection with the Avoca Mines, will help to fill the gap.  But something more than the mere increase of our domestic savings and the attraction of foreign capital is necessary.  A great deal more efficient management and efficient labour is necessary in order to build up exports.  There must be a reduction in costs, and our exports must be able to meet the exports of other countries on a competitive basis.  Therefore, restrictive practices, whether by businessmen or by trade unions, must be discountenanced and must be, as far as possible, removed.</P>
    <P>All these things I am saying are platitudes; everybody will agree with them.  Everybody will agree in a general way with what I am saying. But, meanwhile, we have a short-period problem.  Assuming that we get a great expansion in savings; assuming that we attract a great deal of foreign capital; assuming that we build up an increased supply of managerial ability, labour, skill, knowledge, and efficiency; and assuming that restrictive practices are removed, it will be some years before the balance of payments is put right by the increase on the exporting side of the account.  Therefore, the Minister is faced with a short-period problem.  This will involve him in doing something which, I think, would be unpopular; but it would not be like the Minister to flinch from doing something in the national interest, if it should happen to make himself, or his Party, or the Government unpopular.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go into detail on this matter.  The duties imposed are good as far as they go.  They will probably reduce imports.  If they reduce imports <Col N="1559" /> to the full extent that is hoped, they will reduce the adverse balance by about 20 per cent.  The other 80 per cent. calls for more heroic and more unpopular measures.  What is really required is a reduction of expenditure, either by the Government or by private people in the country.  The balance of payments is nothing more than an indicator of internal inflation. The balance of payments is simply the hand of the barometer showing that the pressure internally in this country has become too high.  And, pending the expansion of exports which we all recognise to be the ultimate solution of the problem, some sort of reduction of the pressure of internal expenditure is imperatively required.</P>
    <P>That expenditure is largely in the hands of the Government.  The Government should, if it can&mdash;and here I know I am asking the Government to do something which is almost impossible to achieve in a period of rising prices&mdash;reduce current expenditure. There is another type of Government expenditure which can be reduced in the short period, can be postponed, and can be made a bit slower, and that is Government capital expenditure. The Government, directly or indirectly, is the author of a good deal of investment and a good deal of capital expenditure in this country on houses, hospitals, roads, and other things.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it is the duty of the Government, however unpopular it would be, to postpone whatever capital expenditure can be postponed, with the object of relieving the pressure of expenditure internally, and in that way doing the only thing which is really sound in this problem, that is to say, disinflating the internal situation, with the object of getting the external situation right.  It cannot be too often repeated that the balance of payments is only a symptom.  It is nothing in itself.  It is the sign of a rise in temperature.  In the case of an individual, if a doctor finds a rising temperature, it simply means that the patient is in a feverish condition and what the doctor has to do is to try and get that fever down.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1560" /> One way to get the national fever down is to reduce, if possible, a certain amount of Government expenditure. I admit it is almost impossible to reduce current expenditure, but a certain amount of capital expenditure can at least be postponed.  I am afraid one is driven to the conclusion, however distasteful it may be, that a certain reduction of expenditure by individual people will also have to be either encouraged by exhortation or perhaps by good example on the part of the Government, or, if not achieved in that way, imposed in various ways in which the Government can impose it.</P>
    <P>The steps taken in regard to the import levies are good as far as they go. The hire purchase measures are also good.  I think they have come rather too late, but they will be to some extent effective.  I am afraid, however, that, before this campaign for restoring health to the financial and economic system of this country is completed, the doctor, the Minister for Finance, will have to apply other unpalatable remedies, if he wishes to succeed.</P>
    <P>I do not want to drag into the debate the very controversial and difficult subject of interest rates.  A great deal of the discussion on interest rates loses sight of the fact that the long-term rate of interest, which is far more important in this country than the short rate, has already risen.  It has already risen, owing to the fact that the rates in the sterling area generally have risen.  If the rise in the rate of interest that has taken place here is inconvenient to the Irish Government, Irish business and farmers, I really do not think it could have been prevented by anything that anybody could have done.  A great deal of the discussion in the Dáil and in the newspapers is about the short-term rate interest, the money market rate.  Why, it is asked, should the short-term rate of interest go up because English rates have risen?</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into that discussion in this debate.  What I wish to say is this&mdash;again, I know it is unpopular but that is no reason for not saying it; indeed.  I think it is a reason <Col N="1561" /> for saying it&mdash;the despised Banking Commission of 1934-38 foretold with almost uncanny prediction what has been happening to-day.  The Banking Commission regarded it as almost axiomatic that English and Irish bank rates would have, in the long run, to move in sympathy.  Last year, Irish rates were held down after the Bank of England rate rose to 4½ per cent.  I do not know precisely what went on behind the scenes.  I do not know what part the Minister took, what part the Central Bank took or what part the commercial banks took, but I was interested, as a member of the Banking Commission whose prophecies appeared to be falsified, to see that, by the end of the year, the prophecies of the Banking Commission had come true and that Irish rates were rising.</P>
    <P>I am looking forward with considerable attention to the course of Irish rates.  If Irish rates are raised in the near future, I will not be greatly surprised. I think it will be the result of forces largely outside the control of the Minister, the Central Bank and the commercial banks.  I think that a rise in interest rates in this country, apart from the long-term rate of interest which has risen already, will not do very much harm and will not do very much good.  From the point of view of a correction of the balance of payments, I do not think it will do very much good.  I do not think that a rise in the short rate of interest will do much to correct the disequilibrium in the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>In the 19th century, the historic and traditional method of restoring equilibrium in the balance of payments was to raise the bank rate.  Gold was attracted in and the whole balance of payments position became more favourable. We are living in entirely different circumstances to-day, and I think that, if the bank rates are raised in Ireland, it will not be directed towards a correction of the disequilibrium in the balance of payments.  I do not think it will do very much in that respect.  It will simply be to avoid certain inconveniences inside the banking system.</P>
    <P>This whole question of the rise in the short rate of interest has been exaggerated in public discussion.  It has <Col N="1562" /> been largely the result of misunderstanding. The long-term rate of interest, which is the most important, has already risen and will remain up until the whole financial atmosphere, not only of the sterling area, but of Europe generally has settled down.</P>
    <P>Another thing the Minister may have to face in his Budget is increased taxation. It will not be popular, but if the public refuses to respond to savings appeals, if it refuses to save enough voluntarily in order to reduce expenditure on imports and build up the savings necessary for investment, then saving may have to be forced on it through the very unpalatable method of increased taxation.  Therefore, I for one am looking forward to the coming Budget with emotions anything but pleasurable.  Knowing that the Minister is a person who does his duty, I think his duty on this occasion will be one which I should not like to be doing.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure, therefore, will have to be delayed in certain directions. Everything in the nature of rising costs of production will have to be resisted to the utmost capacity. The only hope of expanding exports is to produce them on a competitive basis.  The vicious spiral of prices and wages chasing each other upwards is something very difficult to deal with. It is something that will have to be dealt with as forcibly as possible.  The restrictions on imports may have to go further.  They may have to be backed up by quotas and actual prohibitions. Although the restrictions on imports are good as far as they go, I do not think they are the ideal method of getting the balance of payments situation right.</P>
    <P>The reason is that, so long as the internal inflationary pressure is allowed to remain, so long as the patients' febrile condition continues, the incomes generated internally, if they are not spent on imports, will be spent on something else and to the extent they are spent on something else, they may reduce resources available for export, and put up costs and prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister is perfectly aware of what I am saying.  I am not saying this for the Minister's instruction <Col N="1563" /> because he knows a great deal more about it than I do, but possibly there may be Senators who, perhaps, have not considered that the mere restriction of imports, by way of import tariffs, quotas or prohibitions, may not really get to the root of the trouble. The internal purchasing power will continue to be spent on something else. Therefore, in the short period, the problem before the Minister is to get down the patient's fever, to get down the internal expenditure, to increase internal savings and, after that, to increase internal investment.  If the investment is increased in the right directions, if it is intelligent, if it is directed towards the production of exports, if it is accompanied by efficiency in the managerial field, if it is not upset by undue restrictions in the labour field, production in a few years, we hope, will increase.</P>
    <P>When production increases, we hope exports will increase and when exports increase, we hope the Irish balance of payments will be balanced at a high level and not at a low level.  Imports and exports, in the long run, have to be balanced.  That is elementary. Everybody agrees with that to-day. Every newspaper reader agrees to that. It has become part of the platitudes of the man in the street.  But, just as in the case of an individual, income and expenditure can be balanced at a high level or at a low level.  If they are balanced at a high level, it means a nation is living well, while living within its means.  If they are balanced at a low level, it means that it is living within its means, but not so well. Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that, while always keeping as his ultimate objective balance at a high level, during the next two or three years, during which I hope he will continue to occupy the unenviable position he now occupies, his main preoccupation must be to try to make the country pay its way on a rather reduced import bill.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to hold the House very long with my contribution to this debate, because I realise that the ground has been fairly well covered by the speakers who have preceded me. Like those previous speakers, I realise that there is a situation in this country to-day that calls for remedial measures, but, at the very outset, I would say that it is not to-day that we should be facing up to this situation, because we should have done it several months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very serious position regarding the deficit in the balance of trade, which has been and which is very unfavourable to this country, should have been attended to long before now, in my opinion.  It is not to-day or yesterday that advice was available to the Government as to the trends that were taking place in this country.  We remember a few years back when the Central Bank made reference to the serious position that was developing even then and the more serious position that was likely to <Col N="1565" /> develop <i>vis-a-vis</i> the balance of trade, etc.  The advice then given by the Central Bank was scoffed at by members of the present Government.  Now, I think they realise there was foundation for the prognostications made by the members of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>We were told by certain members of the present Government that we were paying too much attention to the &ldquo;sacred cow&rdquo; of sterling.  They were the words that were used.  Now the members of the Government themselves have to pay attention to that &ldquo;sacred cow&rdquo;.  They realise the importance of our sterling balances and, like Senator Hawkins, I welcome the change of front on the part of certain spokesmen of the present Government whose policy it was to belittle our sterling assets a few short years ago.  They now admit that our sterling assets are profitably invested and that it would be disastrous for this country if those sterling assets were allowed to be frittered away.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, the measures the Government are taking to-day are somewhat belated, but I suppose it is better late than never.  A similar situation developed across the water and the Government there as far back as five or six months ago took what they thought were appropriate measures to deal with that situation. Whether the measures they have taken will have the desired effect or not remains to be seen and whether the measures taken here by the present Government will be effective also remains to be seen.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his opening statement that the primary purpose of the imposition of these levies on certain goods being imported into this country is to reduce imports and that the question of any gain for the Exchequer is only of secondary importance. That is, I think, a correct statement to make and it is a statement with which I agree.  At the same time, it is to be expected that as a result of the imposition of these levies on imported goods, a certain amount of money will accrue to the Exchequer.  I understand from the Minister, and in this of course I may be wrong, that the proceeds arising from these levies <Col N="1566" /> will be put into a separate fund.  If that be the case, it will be appropriate at the present time to inquire to what use these moneys will be devoted when they are realised.</P>
    <P>Here I make the suggestion that whatever sums will accrue to the Exchequer as a result of these import levies should be invested in the land of the country, with a view to achieving increased agricultural output.  We have heard over the past few years many references to the matter of agricultural output and many expressions of opinion on the part of certain politicians that the primary necessity is to increase output.  That is something with which everybody agrees, but what is the use of indulging in such platitudes, if no positive measures are taken towards that end?  I suggest that it would be a very good gesture on the part of the Minister and the Government, if they would take a decision to utilise the money that will be got from the increased taxation on the goods which are subject to these levies for the purpose of achieving increased agricultural output.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that it has to be said that the Government has given no great indication of their intention to do that, or to give the necessary encouragement to achieve increased production from the land, because we all remember that one of the first measures they took on assuming office on the last occasion was to cut the price of wheat produced by our farmers.  We pointed out at that time that that was a very foolish step to take from the point of view of the economy of the country and that, in fact, it was a decadent policy.  Everything that has happened since then has proved us to be right, because we find that no less a sum than £10,000,000 has been paid out over the past year for imported cereals which could have been produced at home, if the farmers had been given the necessary encouragement and the necessary inducements by the Government.</P>

      <P>I am not bound to do that.  I am merely mentioning the figure of £10,000,000 for cereals and if <Col N="1567" /> the Senator wants the figures for wheat, he can get them as well as I can.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of increased sugar output which could be achieved in this country and which should engage the attention of the Government. At present we are importing £2,000,000 worth of foreign sugar which, indeed, could be produced at home.</P>
      <P>In debating these import levies in connection with the Vote on Account, we are somewhat in the dark because we have been told by the Minister that we are to get a further dose of medicine, if this dose is not sufficient.  At the present time, we do not know what measures the Minister may take when he introduces his annual Budget, so that we have not all the facts at our disposal for a proper appraisal of the present economic position, or of the measures to be taken to remedy it.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned that the present Government has given very little encouragement to the farmers of this country to increase their agricultural output.  Tillage, as a result of their policy, has gone down very substantially and I am afraid that the cattle population is falling along the same lines.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned the tillage farmers and the serious blow that was dealt to them when this Government took office.  I must also assert that the dairy farmers are not getting the attention from this present Government to which they are entitled. One instance of that has been mentioned several times recently, and that is, the delay on the part of the Minister for Agriculture in making available to the people of the country, especially to the farmers, the report of the Milk Costings Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>Because they found, the people who did make any attempt to <Col N="1569" /> save, that their money was dwindling in value.  They naturally said to themselves that they would be just as well off, if they spent their money.  I think it would be good policy if the Government would make sure to give some positive encouragement, so that the people who go to the trouble of saving would not find that, after all their trouble, what they have saved is very diminished in value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something drastic needed to make that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards this question of saving, there is little use in talking about it, if the necessary encouragement is not given.  The best encouragement the Government could give the people of the country to save is to do some saving themselves.  I remember when the first Coalition came into office, the then Minister for Finance told us that he was going to examine every Department of State, with a view to effecting economies.  We were all given to understand, of course, that the time had come when drastic economies were going to be effected. But what happened?  Instead of economies in the various Departments, we find that, at the end of the term of office of the first Coalition, the cost of running these Government Departments had increased.  We find that the cost is still increasing and that the Government are looking for a bigger sum this year than has ever before been looked for by a Government here. In other words, it appears that the cost of central administration and the cost of local administration are going hand in hand, reaching higher and higher levels year after year.  The question is: when is the Government going to do something about it, something about effecting economies in their own Departments?  If they gave that example to the people, I am sure it would have a good effect.  Example is better than precept, we are told, and it is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, as I said at the commencement, we all realise that it is necessary to take some measures to curb inflationary trends here, but we perhaps are not agreed as to the best measures to be taken.  There are certain <Col N="1570" /> items here which are the subject of these import levies and they certainly could not be classified as nonessential goods.  House furnishings and house furniture&mdash;surely they cannot be classified as non-essentials?  I am afraid that the effect of the levies in the case of house furniture and furnishings generally will be that people, such as newly-married couples setting up new houses, or intending to set up new houses, will find it very, very difficult to do so.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude where I began.  I say again that it is a pity that the Government did not face up to this situation, this serious situation, some months ago, even when the Taoiseach himself went down the country and referred to certain &ldquo;stresses and strains&rdquo; that were appearing on the horizon.  The Minister for Finance himself also referred to these stresses and strains, although he did not make use of the same words.  But then we had the extraordinary position that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government took a totally different view and tried to create the impression that there was no need at all for disquiet in connection with the financial and economic position of this country.  The difficulty was that the people of this country did not know where they were; nor did they know where they were until they found themselves confronted with these rather drastic measures that we have under discussion to-day in connection with the Vote on Account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold very much the same views as Senator O'Brien.  I am afraid what I would have to say would be very much a repetition of what he would say, the only difference being that he would say it very much better than I could hope.  In the first place, I would like to say that I agree with the measures which have been suggested to redress the adverse balance of trade.  The hire purchase restrictions and the tariffs imposed will reduce the ability of the individual to purchase goods with that part of his income which remains to him when he has paid taxation, whether that taxation be direct or indirect.  I think he is entitled to expect that the Government <Col N="1571" /> will exercise due economy in the way they expend that portion of his income which the individual pays to them by way of taxation, and also the savings which the individual entrusts to the State by subscribing to national loans, the purchase of savings certificates, and in other ways.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister, and I am sure he has it in mind, that every endeavour should be made to prune expenditure so far as possible, particularly capital expenditure of a non-reproductive nature or which will be reproductive only in the distant future. Personally, I can only feel that expenditure of this nature is directly inflationary, since it has the effect of putting purchasing power into the hands of the community, but it produces no goods or services which will absorb that power.  It seems to me that the standard of living of any country is dependent on the resources of that country. In countries such as the United States of America, where they have unlimited raw materials, fertile land, a vast market, and an industrial population, a very high standard of living can be enjoyed.  In Britain, whose national wealth is roughly double ours, a higher standard of living can be enjoyed there than here.  I would say that the standards of living here and in England are roughly similar; and that leads me to think that our troubles to-day are due to the fact that we are trying to maintain a standard of living which will be only possible in some years' time when our production has increased very materially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been pointed out already that, if we are to surmount our present difficulty, production must be increased, not only for home consumption, but also for export.  I am sure we all agree with this and I am sure we all agree that, over a period of years, it will be possible to increase agricultural production for export.  I am afraid I am not so certain about the possibility of increasing our industrial production for export.  Generally speaking, our industries here were established in order to provide the needs of the home market. The home market is a small one and that meant that the volume of production to satisfy the demand was small <Col N="1572" /> and, from that, it followed that costs of production were high.  Similarly, in virtually every case in this country, raw materials have to be imported from abroad, and this places us in a worse position from the point of view of transport costs than other countries who are going to compete in the export market.  That applies not only to the import of raw materials, but also to the export of finished products.</P>
    <P>As an example, I understand that the cost of sending goods to Liverpool from Dublin is the same as the cost of sending them from Liverpool to Canada. Here are two of the many difficulties&mdash; the many factors&mdash;which make for higher production costs in this country. It seems to me that one can hardly view with optimism the prospect of industries here competing in a highly competitive export market.  One may argue that, with the most modern equipment, production costs can be reduced, and that no doubt is true; but remember the new plant has to be bought and the money to pay for that plant can only be found by industry, either from profits which it has retained&mdash; and in these days of high taxation it is by no means easy&mdash;or, alternatively, it must be raised by the issue of new capital, which again is difficult.  When that capital has been raised, it naturally has to be remunerated.  With all the hazards involved, I think you will find it difficult to persuade those who have charge of industry to take the risk of expanding their plant for a problematical export market.</P>
    <P>We should all bear in mind that during the past few years we have passed through a period when there was a relative shortage of goods and an expanding demand.  I think we are going to face a time when competition is going to be greater, and I think that temporarily the demand for goods may reduce somewhat.  In spite of what I have said that I am not optimistic as regards industrial exports, I do feel that, over a period, we probably can increase them somewhat.  I do not think we can ever expect to be a big exporting nation.  I know that there are various industries here which export quite a big part of their products; but I think we would be misleading ourselves if we argued from that that <Col N="1573" /> other industries would be able to follow their example.  In my view, therefore, the long-term solution for this country is to reduce expenditure so far as possible.  So far as the gap left in the balance of payments is concerned, that will have to be met by an increase in agricultural output.</P>
    <P>In what I might call a remarkably fine speech made by the Minister for Agriculture recently, he stated at column 1145 of Volume 45, No. 13:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The object of this Government is to get from the land of Ireland&mdash;for nowhere else can we get it&mdash;a standard of living sufficiently high to ensure that all our people will have an opportunity to live in their own country in circumstances of modest comfort.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, I think, sums up the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Central Fund debate, it has been the practice in the Seanad to touch upon quite a number of different Departments and different topics as has been done to-day.  We suffer in the Seanad from not having a Question Time.  We have not got the right to ask the Ministers questions at any time, and consequently we tend, perhaps, to abuse the privilege given to us under this Bill and the Appropriation Bill to raise certain matters in relation to a variety of Departments, and I hope that the Minister will forgive me if I take the opportunity to raise what might appear to be a heterogeneous series of questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point that has been mentioned several times is the question of the raising of the bank rate.  It struck me when Senator O'Brien spoke to-day that he was exceedingly modest&mdash; I might say diffident&mdash;because anybody reading the debate on the same Central Fund Bill last year will notice that Senator O'Brien indicated very clearly to the Minister that, in his opinion, the Minister would undoubtedly have to allow our bank rate to follow that of Britain.  The Minister did not state the contrary categorically.  He did admit that the field of manoeuvre was small.  He did contend, however, that our bank interest rates do not necessarily have to run absolutely with <Col N="1574" /> those of Britain.  Events, I suggest, have shown him to have been over-optimistic, shall we say, and shown Senator O'Brien to have been exactly right.</P>
    <P>The bank rate, I understand, at the moment is in the neighbourhood of 6¼ per cent., and I notice that yesterday in the Dáil a spokesman for the Government threw it at the Opposition that, if they had been in power, the bank rate would not be 6¼ but 7 per cent.  One question I would like to ask the Minister for Finance would be: is he in a position to give an assurance that the bank rate will not in fact become 7 per cent. within a measurable number of weeks?</P>
    <P>Now, in relation also to the bank rate, I should like to advert to the fact that, quite obviously, increasing the bank rate increases the profits accruing to the private banks.  I notice that, in relation to the levy that is to be imposed on imported goods, the Minister has earmarked it for certain capital expenditure.  It seems to me unjust that the private commercial banks should, by reason of the fact that our people must be forced and squeezed into saving more, derive an increased profit therefrom.</P>
    <P>If, of course, we owned our banks, if we had taken the bold step, which will eventually become necessary, of nationalising our banks&mdash;and I feel sure I have the support there of at least Senator Hickey&mdash;if we had taken the step long ago of nationalising our banks, the Exchequer and the community would derive benefits from this increased bank rate which is rendered necessary by the situation in which we now find ourselves.  Nevertheless, at the moment, were we to try to meet this situation by establishing another form of tax, a purchase tax on luxuries, on a certain range of goods, a purchase tax which would apply not only to goods imported, but also to goods made here, in the luxury or semi-luxury class, not merely would we discourage buying and spending on semi-luxury goods, but we would ensure a direct increase in revenue to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that <Col N="1575" /> the Minister's hesitation in instituting anything of that kind is related to the employment situation.  Nevertheless, I feel myself that he would get rid of a rather awkward situation, had he decided upon that method rather than upon a levy.  The awkward situation which will arise from it is, first, that people may abuse the position and try to sell stocks that they have already on hands at increased prices.  The Minister has very firmly said he will try to deal with that.  I will put the question whether he will be able effectively to deal with that when it concerns as many items as 68 or 70. That situation would not arise, as I say, if the method of purchase tax had been applied.</P>
    <P>The second danger is that, with this increased measure of protection for Irish goods, which is represented by this supplementary duty and supplementary tariffs, there is a danger which has been specifically foreseen by the Minister, that, perhaps, some Irish manufacturers, or indeed wholesalers or retailers, might be tempted to increase the price of our already very much protected home produce.  I suggest that both those dangers would have been avoided, or could not have arisen, had the Minister decided upon purchase tax rather than import levy.</P>
    <P>While on this topic, I cannot pass from it without stating my approval of the measures the Minister has introduced in relation to hire purchase.  As some Senators have said, I would regard these measures as being long overdue, but it is a thing for which the Minister and the Government merit congratulations, that they have decided to grasp this nettle and to insist at least upon a percentage of the value of the article being paid down as a deposit.  In some cases, I should like to see the deposit a little higher still, but I think the Minister has acted wisely.</P>
    <P>I do feel, though I think it is a part of Government policy, perhaps sometimes misguided, that all these appeals for saving and so on are not likely to have very much effect in the circumstances already referred to by Senator Kissane, in which people feel that <Col N="1576" /> money they save is somehow going up in smoke, losing its value, and I feel that some kind of compulsory saving, such as the putting up of the price of luxury goods by a purchase tax and thereby removing them from the grasp as it were of the spenders, would be, in fact, more effective.</P>
    <P>Another thing on hire purchase ought to be mentioned, I think, and that is that in one sense the hire-purchase system represents a kind of poor man's overdraft.  The rich man can get an overdraft from the bank to buy goods he cannot really afford.  The poor man gets his overdraft by means of hire purchase.  The squeeze will be felt in many poor families, and I am glad, therefore, that the Minister has not prevented the buying of particular articles by this means and that he has made a discrimination between definitely luxury articles, like television sets, and more useful everyday things.</P>
    <P>Now, under the heading of the Vote for the Department of Justice, I should like to raise one or two points.  I mentioned the other day, and expressed the hope, that the vastly improved conditions in the Bridewell might have a parallel in the cell accommodation provided in Garda Síochána barracks throughout the country, particularly in view of the fact that, in many of these barracks, it will be necessary and legitimate, under the Prisons Bill which we have now passed, to detain prisoners in these cells sometimes for several weeks.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister for Justice for an assurance on that point, and I am afraid that, owing to a misunderstanding, he assured me there would be &ldquo;no change&rdquo; in the conditions in Garda barracks!  What I asked him to assure me of was that there would be a change, and that most of the wretched cell accommodation would be improved upon the model already followed by the Department in relation to the Bridewell.  They could go further even, because in the Bridewell they were restricted by the building, which they could not change, but I should like again to urge the point that they will see to it that the kind of standards the Department has rightly <Col N="1577" /> regarded as necessary in the Bridewell will be provided, or even improved on, in country Garda stations.</P>
    <P>I should like to advert also to the conditions provided, not for prisoners, but for Civic Guards.  I stressed the other day to the Minister the fact that these prisoners in detainee prisons are theoretically presumed innocent, and I also mentioned that, judging by the conditions provided for the Gardaí in city barracks, the Garda Síochána are, in the eyes of the Department, presumed guilty, though of what offence is not clear.  If Senators were to take the trouble to go, for instance, to the Civic Guard barracks in Store Street, and to examine the accommodation, and examine the kitchens and dining-room accommodation both for the Guards themselves and for the sergeants, and to examine the club rooms, I do not think that Senators would feel that we are behaving rightly towards these men.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Seanad realises that 21 Civic Guards live in Store Street barracks.  It is not just a question of their going in by day. That would be bad enough.  They live and have their being there.  They have their dormitories and club rooms there.  The sort of conditions we provide for them there are grossly inadequate. It is not that we do not know better, for there are Civic Guards' barracks in the city where better accommodation is provided for the Guards and I mention Pearse Street barracks as one.  The contrast between the kitchen accommodation and the club accommodation in Pearse Street and Store Street is very remarkable. I should like to draw attention to that fact and suggest that, unless we insist upon providing good, decent, living conditions for Civic Guards living in these barracks, we cannot expect them to be so eagerly insistent upon the provision of reasonable conditions for prisoners.  The mental attitude inculcated by that kind of provision for Civic Guards is bad, when you relate it to the sort of treatment or accommodation expected for prisoners.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn to the Vote for Education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I might reassure the Seanad that I shall not on this occasion refer to corporal punishment if that is the fear at the back of Senators' minds.</P>
      <P>As briefly as I can, I want to refer to new schools in Finglas to be built at the cost of £97,000.  That seems to be a fairly considerable figure.  I understand that the foundation stone has been laid and that the school is to provide 20 class rooms.  Admittedly, there will be administrative blocks and kitchens as well, but, nevertheless, the class rooms are the central part of the school.  Incidentally, the cost works out at £4,000 or £5,000 per class room, and there will be provision there for 800 children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point of general principle I should like to refer to is this: the Council of Education suggested that the ideal number in a class room ought to be about 30.  They felt that, in the ordinary circumstances, that would be the ideal.  They also said that it certainly should never exceed 40.  I draw attention to the fact that, if you have 20 class rooms for 800 children, <Col N="1579" /> you are aiming at an average of 40.  I deplore the building of new schools retaining an average which has been recognised by our Council of Education as being far too high, because, if you have an average of 40, you will be lucky if you do not have some classes with considerably more.</P>
    <P>That is related in my mind to the whole question of overcrowding in classes which I would go so far as to say is the major defect of our primary school system in Ireland to-day.  I do not want to assign blame in the matter. I think most members of the Oireachtas would be prepared to take some blame for this system.  If it were possible to institute one single reform in relation to our educational system in primary schools, in my opinion, the most effective one, the one that would have the major number of indirect effects, would be a reduction of the sometimes extraordinary numbers in individual classes, and class rooms.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I should like to mention an article which appeared in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> in February, 1955, in relation to a school which, they say, is 135 years old and of which it is said that &ldquo;a good spring cleaning might demolish the whole place&rdquo; and in which 90 children are packed into a single 44 ft. by 17 ft. class room. The date of the article is 27th February, 1955.  The parents of the present teachers taught in the school for nearly half a century and were promised a new school as a wedding present.  The <i>Sunday Independent</i> said the parents threatened &ldquo;drastic action&rdquo; if the school authorities continued to ignore their plight.  That was February, 1955, and the fact is that nothing was done. That school was Rich Hill in Limerick. The parents were forced to call a school strike which they did not want to call. I understand that to this day very little has been done to build a school.</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Senator, nor do I want to prevent him making a general statement on policy, but I should like to quote, on a point of order, what is allowed on this Bill.  I quote from the &ldquo;Rulings and Precedents of the Seanad,&rdquo; which <Col N="1580" /> say that, on Second Stage of the Central Fund Bill:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Broad general questions on Government policy may be discussed but any question which is no affected by the expenditure in the Bill is out of order; legislation may not be advocated.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I accept that, and I shall endeavour to avoid unnecessary details.  I should like to turn away from that point then to a question which is not one of detail, but of general policy&mdash;the question of building grants for secondary schools. Building grants for secondary schools are simply a necessity, but, in fact, the only grants which might be used for that purpose are the present capitation grants&mdash;the moneys relating to capitation, laboratories or woodwork instruction. It seems to me that that is the sort of thing with which the Department ought to concern itself, and for which the Department ought to ask money, helping not only the primary schools but secondary schools to build.</P>
      <P>I adverted before, and others have done likewise, to the whole question of not allowing a teacher who has got all the qualifications necessary to become a registered teacher, to draw any increments until he or she has taught for a whole year after attaining these qualifications.  I suggest that that principle is a very bad one, because, although I would not say it compels, it at least strongly urges teachers to leave this country, and go to another country where they get this incremental rate straight away in the first year after qualifying.</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment, I was speaking about the Vote of the Department of Education and I should like to say something in relation to the voting of moneys for <Col N="1581" /> pensioned teachers.  It has always seemed to me that, in almost any administration, when it is a question of increasing allowances, pensioners are left to be last in the queue.  I think the reason for that is that pensioners cannot go on strike.</P>
      <P>I should like, as but one example, to refer to the case of the pre-1950 pensioned secondary teachers, most of whom did their teaching quite a long time ago now, in the early years of this century, when, during their working years, they were, I think we can all agree, inadequately paid and worked extremely hard.  It is quite obvious also from the fact that there was no pension scheme until 1929 and that when pensions came to be calculated, the years of service prior to 1939 were only credited on a very limited scale, that the sort of pension which pre-1950 pensioned secondary teachers got is inadequate.  I should like to have seen some further provisions for this in the Vote in relation to the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>I find, for instance, that one teacher who retired in 1938, an individual case, is getting a pension of £128 a year. Another teacher who retired in 1945 is getting only £66 13s. 4d.  I will not quote other figures, but I make the point, in relation to these teachers, as well as to other pensioned teachers, that the attention of the Department, when they are estimating, ought to be drawn to the justice of such claims, which is not diminished by the fact that they cannot make a strong protest since they are pensioners and are, by that very fact, precluded from taking strike action.</P>
      <P>There is another point in relation to the Department of Education which I should like to mention.  I notice that, in Vote 42, a fairly generous provision is made for scholarships for people who are to be students at one time or other of the two excellent training schools for teachers of domestic science.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well. <Col N="1582" /> I will pass, in that case, to the Estimate for the Department of Defence. I should like to draw attention to the fact&mdash;to me it is surprising, though I expect there is some explanation; perhaps it escapes me&mdash;that the Estimate for Defence alone, apart entirely from Army pensions, is over £7,000,000 and that is almost double the figure that was considered necessary in 1947-48.  Two points strike me as surprising&mdash;the amount, which seems very big&mdash;it is almost the same amount as we spend on education&mdash;and the fact that it has been found necessary, since 1947-48, almost to double the figure.  It is, among these Estimates, one figure which seems to me to be capable of reduction, without, I think, losing anything of the quality of our Army, which is high.</P>
      <P>There was one other point of detail there, but, in deference to the ruling of the Chair, I will omit it.  A point which I raised last year and which I think got sympathetic considertion from the Minister was whether it was found possible to envisage any change in relation to the Government Publication Office; whether in relation to the situation of the showrooms and salerooms, any steps have been taken to get better accommodation.  It is obvious that these premises are a kind of show window for Government publications and the present position is not so good.  This is an office which can do a good deal of work in bringing to the notice of the public these publications which are of a major interest to a wide section of our population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask in relation to the Gaeltacht Services Vote, where I notice there is an increase of £48,000, whether that Estimate includes provision for the Ministry of the Gaeltacht? I am rather inclined to think that it does not, but I should like to hear what the Minister has to say about it.  I should also like to know whether it is the Government's intention to appoint a young and active Minister to the post, rather than be content with appointing somebody who has perhaps not proved a success in another field, or to regard the appointment more or less as a position of retirement. <Col N="1583" /> All of us would welcome the appointment of a young and active Minister.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the question of the Milk Costings Commission which Senator Kissane mentioned. I think we cannot insist that the Minister publish the report, but we would all welcome an early publication of it.  I think the lessons to be derived from these findings might not necessarily be those which farmers would have us believe.  There is a suggestion that the only way in which we could get increased production of milk in this country is by raising the price.  I should like to suggest, somewhat paradoxically, that you might in fact increase production by lowering the price.</P>
    <P>I would explain that by this means: a lot of the milk is at present produced by &ldquo;uneconomic cows&rdquo; and by farmers whose farms are not, in the sense of milk production, economic farms.  It would not be a paying proposition for such farmers to remain in production, if the prices were lowered, but those remaining in production would be encouraged to have much better milch cattle herds, producing greatly increased quantities of milk.  Therefore, I think it possible that, by decreasing the price, you might improve the quantity of milk produced, and I think also the quality.  It might encourage the elimination of the &ldquo;uneconomic cow&rdquo; and perhaps also the farmer who, in relation to milk production, is an &ldquo;uneconomic farmer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am rather puzzled in relation to the Estimate for the Minister's own Department, and particularly Vote 9, dealing with public works and buildings and which relates to the costs incurred in the maintenance and the supply of furniture, etc., for the various Departments.  The points on which I should like enlightenment are why it is that, of all Departments, the Department of Finance requires by far the biggest vote for maintenance and supplies?  I find, for instance, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, which has quite a lot of offices throughout the country, requires the not inconsiderable vote of £42,000, which is <Col N="1584" /> quite a lot and, if you add in rates, fuel, and so on, we see a total of £70,000 for Posts and Telegraphs.  But the Department of Finance requires £238,000 for maintenance and supplies, which is the only six-figure Estimate here, and seems, on the face of the figures, to be very high, when you compare it with any of the others.</P>
    <P>I am quite confident that there is a reasonable explanation and I am asking, perhaps, more in a spirit of curiosity than of criticism, but, perhaps, other Senators would like to know why in regard to maintenance, and so on, the Department of Finance seems to be one of our most expensive items.</P>
    <P>In a slightly minor key and again, perhaps, in the same spirit of curiosity, I would ask the Minister if he could give us even an indirect idea as to just what sort of work the £7,500 which is estimated for the Secret Service is spent on?  I am not asking for particulars&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <P>I conclude with one point of general principle relating to what I might call the conditions of work of civil servants in general.  I understand there is something like a ceremony, when a civil servant retires and goes on to the superannuation scale&mdash;a symbolic &ldquo;removing of the gag&rdquo;.  The civil servant who has had to keep his opinions to himself all this time is allowed at last to express his opinions and become a full political citizen once more.  I should like just to make the point that in relation to all civil servants, most of us would welcome <Col N="1585" /> the granting to them of far more freedom of expression of their political rights, interests and opinions, than is permitted at present&mdash;not perhaps for very senior civil servants, but for a wide variety of junior civil servants, whose freer expression of their views would benefit the whole country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to associate myself with Senator O'Brien and Senator Guinness who spoke earlier, because I agree very much with what they said.  I do not agree with Senator Guinness that we could not get a considerably increased output in our industries for export because, although I agree the position internationally has become more and more difficult, and that we are facing more and more competition, I believe that, if we could have closer co-operation between management and labour in our industries, we should be able very considerably to increase the amount of exports produced in this country.  In the same way, I agree with Senator O'Brien that we will have to seek some means of increasing our agricultural output, because, after all, agriculture is the basis of our economy.  If our farmers are not reasonably prosperous, the rest of the country must suffer in consequence.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties I think we have to face in industry, and, to a lesser extent, in agriculture, is what has been referred to by Senator O'Brien as restrictive practices&mdash;both, as he said, among workers and employers. I agree with him that we must try wherever possible to wipe out these restrictive practices which are not in the interests of the public as a whole.  My attention was very recently drawn to what I consider to be one of the most serious restrictive practices, taking place at the moment in Dublin. I feel that some attention should be drawn to it in the Seanad because I do feel that it is seriously affecting the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of our great exports is cattle and one of the problems we have to face to-day is competition from the other cattle producing countries.  I am told that we are continually exporting cattle to the Continent on three <Col N="1586" /> foreign-owned ships.  I may say this information was given to me by a member of a trade union.  We are exporting cattle at the rate of 150 to 200 head on each ship from Dublin to continental ports.  Each of these voyages lasts approximately ten days, that is, from Dublin to the continental port and back to Dublin, and as I said, each ship carries from 150 to 200 head of cattle.  Under present union regulations, these ships are forced&mdash;or were forced&mdash;to carry live-stock attendants who were paid at the rate of 15 guineas per voyage, provided it did not last more than ten days.  If it lasted longer, the additional rates to be paid were 32/- per man per day.</P>
    <P>These men who originally travelled on the ships did care for the animals on board; but because of their frequently unsatisfactory behaviour, which often resulted in delays to the ships, both at Dublin and at continental ports, it was decided by the foreign owners that they could no longer use these Irishmen as cattle attendants on the ships.  Now the position is that every time these ships sail from Dublin to the continental ports, they have to employ live-stock attendants&mdash;one man to each 30 beasts being allocated per ship.  Each time one of these ships is at sea they are employing 15 to 21 men who never set foot on the ships and are, I understand, idling on the docks all the time the ships are at sea.</P>
    <P>The point is: this is costing every farmer in this country who is exporting cattle, an additional 15/- per head on the price of these beasts when they arrive at the continental port.  It gives employment at the maximum to 45 men, or rather gives them payment, but not employment.  I consider if these men were employed gainfully in some other job, it would be of benefit to the country at large and would mean we would be able to export our cattle at 15/- per head cheaper.  That is just one small issue showing the difficulties our agricultural community have to face in competition with other countries.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to the increase in the bank rate.  He <Col N="1587" /> asked the Minister if he intended to take steps&mdash;I will not quite use the word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;&mdash;to make use of the additional profit which would accrue to the various banks as a result of the increased bank rate.  I think many people have a complete misunderstanding of the use to which the increased bank rate would be put.  As I see it, an increase in the bank rate is not to provide increased profit for our bankers&mdash;far from it.  It is to increase and encourage savings, and you must remember that, when deposits are made in the banks, the banks have to pay interest on those deposits.  The bank rate must be such as to encourage those people to make deposits, and, in consequence, to make savings. An additional advantage of an increase in the bank rate is that it has a tendency to discourage increases in overdrafts.  In fact, it should have the tendency to decrease the amount of money out on loan, and, so far from increasing the average profits gained by a bank, to increase the bank rate has quite the opposite effect.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington has mentioned the question of a purchase tax. I know that, in the past, from looking back on previous debates in the Seanad, there has been discussion on purchase tax and I think that, in many countries which are facing inflationary problems, the imposition of a purchase tax would possibly be a good thing, but there is this disadvantage in a purchase tax: it means that a small number of traders in the community have to bear the burden of that tax, because, where a purchase tax is imposed, it means that the trader pays that purchase tax when the goods reach his shop, or reaches his industry, if it happens to be raw material. The impact of that is not passed on to the consumer until the consumer actually buys the goods.</P>
    <P>If we want to impose a tax of that kind, I think a sales tax would be far fairer, in that the burden would not fall on anybody, until the goods were being bought by the final consumer.  In the case of a purchase tax, the burden must fall equally on home produced goods, as well as imports, and I think <Col N="1588" /> that in a country such as ours, where we have protected industries, the Minister has wisely adopted an alternative, an alternative which, if properly applied, should prove a much better system of reducing imports and consumption.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I should like to compliment the Minister on his Emergency Duties Order.  I think, if anything, the Minister has not gone as far as we might have liked, and I know that, talking to the business community in the last week, I have found the feeling that everybody expected the Minister to take considerably stronger measures.  The very existence of that feeling makes one wonder whether or not these measures which he is taking will achieve the desired effect, the effect which the Minister is anxious to achieve.  I would say, as the Minister, I think, said in the Dáil, that if all sections of the community are prepared to accept these Orders and prepared to do everything in their power to make them work, the Minister will have achieved the desired end.</P>
    <P>There are one or two sections of the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Order which are not very clear and, possibly, if I draw the Minister's attention to them, he might be able to clarify them for this House and subsequently might make a statement for the public which would allow them to read into the Order what was intended.</P>
    <P>I was told to-day by two grocers that the new duty would apply to fresh fruit imports.  Now, I cannot find, having read through the Order this afternoon, any mention of fresh fruit, and, in particular, of oranges, and I hope the Minister has no intention of including fresh fruit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>Fresh fruit is definitely not included&mdash;without question, no.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Two other sections, I think, require a certain amount of clarification.  The words &ldquo;personal clothing or wearing apparel&rdquo; in Part I of the Appendix are being taken in a wider sense than that used in the Schedule and this has created a number of difficulties in interpretation. For instance, it appears that straw <Col N="1589" /> braid might be considered wearing apparel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Senator's pardon&mdash;I did not hear the technical word he used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Straw braid.  It can be used for making hats.  It is also used for a number of other purposes. I am reading from a memorandum which came to me yesterday.  It is suggested here, and I would like to see it done, that the words should be interpreted in the same way as the tariff.</P>
      <P>The second point which has been raised&mdash;it was given to me by a fairly big importer who is anxious to assist and comply with the Order in an effort to restrict imports&mdash;is that the Appendix says &ldquo;fancy or ornamental articles or any other material for personal and domestic use&rdquo;.  That is rather ambiguous.  Nobody knows what to expect and people would like to see this phrase replaced by a list of articles.  It may be rather difficult for the Minister to draw up a list of specific articles, because there are so many things that do not come under any particular heading.</P>
      <P>I also wonder whether the Minister will, in the near future, give some clarification of how he intends these emergency duties to be passed on to the public.  Only yesterday, I received a price list from a wholesaler, and, just to take one quotation from it, I find that the wholesale price is 20/-, the new duty is put down as 5/- and we are told in this particular case &mdash;it is a controlled price&mdash;that the price to be passed on to the public is 5/-. It is clear that the wholesaler is taking a profit for himself on the emergency duty but he has no intention of passing any of it on to the retailer.  I feel that these emergency duties should, in fact, be rather like the purchase tax in England, in that nobody, whether it be the distributor or the wholesaler or the retailer, should take any profit on them.  These are emergency duties and should be passed equally.  I hope the Minister will make a statement on it either in this House or at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1590" /> I did notice in this morning's newspapers that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has issued a new Order in respect of the price of gramophone records.  As some members of the Seanad know, I have a particular personal interest in the price of gramophone records, but I do notice that Section 3 says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No person shall sell gramophone records of any description at a price exceeding the price charged for comparable records in the week ended March 10th, 1956.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What I would like to find out from the Minister is what effect that Order will have on the new Emergency Imposition of Duties Order which does add 25 per cent. to the price?  Surely that would contravene this new Order which was made by the Minister yesterday. That is a matter which might be clarified for the importers of gramophone records.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I should like to deal very briefly with the statutory instrument dealing with hire purchase and credit sales.  I think, like most Senators, that this is a very desirable Order and that it has been long overdue, but I feel that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has not taken the powers which would be necessary to see that this Order is properly enforced.  We do know the difficulties which arose when the British Government put restrictions on hire purchase.  One of the first things that happened across the water was that the moneylenders put up big notices and put out advertisements saying: &ldquo;Come and get your deposit from us&mdash;6d. or 1/- a week&rdquo;. As far as I can see, there is nothing in this Order to prevent the moneylenders providing exactly the same facilities for citizens of this country. If we are anxious to see that minimum deposits are paid in hire-purchase transactions, the Minister should try to take steps to close that loophole.</P>
    <P>Another loophole which I think exists in the Order is this question of the deposit.  A few days ago, I saw an advertisement in the newspapers saying that trading cheques would be accepted, in lieu of a deposit.  Now, trading cheques have been in existence <Col N="1591" /> for a great many years and they are used by the poorer members of the community in order to get essential supplies, of clothing, of groceries and things of that kind.  They were never intended to be used as a deposit for a frigidaire, a bicycle or articles of that kind.</P>
    <P>It is most desirable that some steps should be taken to prevent trading cheques being used for deposits under hire-purchase agreements.  At the same time I would urge the Minister not to interfere with the normal course of trading cheques, because they are extremely valuable to the poorer people in this community.</P>
    <P>Section 5, sub-paragraph 3, of this hire-purchase Order says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This article does not apply to a letting of particular goods for a period or periods not exceeding one month in all&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It appears to me that, if I have a customer who is unable to pay the 25 per cent., 33 per cent., or 50 per cent. deposit on an article, there is nothing to prevent me letting him have that article for one month for which he will pay me a letting or hire charge.  He can return the article to my premises for one day and I can have a fresh hire charge put on.  That can go on until such time as he has paid the deposit money.  Then I can sign the normal hire-purchase agreement with him.  I do not know how the Minister is going to deal with all these things, but I think it is well to raise them.</P>
    <P>A further point is the provision, under Article 4, Section 3, which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In calculating the minimum deposit for the purposes of this article account may be taken of any allowance for goods taken in part exchange for the goods to which the agreement relates, if that allowance is thought to be reasonable in relation to the value of the goods so taken in part exchange.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I understand that the normal practice in England, particularly in connection with hire-purchase agreements covering furniture and articles of that kind, is <Col N="1592" /> that the salesman says: &ldquo;Have you not got any old articles of furniture at home&mdash;an old chair with three legs, maybe?  Let us have a look at it; it might easily be of some value.&rdquo;  A person brings in an old three-legged chair which has been in the rubbish dump for a great many years.  The salesman says: &ldquo;You have got a very valuable article there, and I think a reasonable price for that would be £50. That will be part of your deposit.&rdquo; Most of us would know perfectly well that it would not be worth even 50/- or 5/-.  It is going to be exceedingly difficult to interpret the meaning of the word &ldquo;reasonable.&rdquo;  I should like to suggest that it might be more satisfactory, and more in line with the intention of this Order, if any goods taken in part payment should not be credited to the actual deposit, but should be divided equally over the monthly or weekly instalments.  In that way, I think we would be to a large extent getting away from this desire of inflating the value of goods in order to assist a person in the initial deposit.</P>
    <P>I should like to say, in conclusion, that I think the minimum deposits which the Minister has provided in this hire-purchase Order are, on the whole, reasonable.  I would, I think, have put a 50 per cent. deposit on television sets, because I think they are very much in the luxury class and, if a person cannot afford to pay down 50 per cent. on them, I think in the present circumstances they could well do without them.  I do feel that his reasonable deposits on furniture and pedal cycles are very much in the spirit in which they should be.  Nobody wants to bring in restrictions which will prevent young people from getting married and having the opportunity of furnishing their homes.  Many people cannot find a very large amount for that purpose.  There is a provision at the end for a 20 per cent. deposit on other goods.  I do not think there are many other goods which could come into this class, and the Minister might well have made that deposit a little bit higher.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for his able statements both <Col N="1593" /> in the Dáil and here, and for the fact that he has not been afraid to try to face up to the problems we are facing to-day.  As I said at the beginning, the only fear is that he has not taken enough measures, and I hope that every citizen of the Twenty-Six Counties will show the Minister that he is prepared to put his back behind him and try to obey these Orders, both in the spirit and in the intention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As a countryman, my principal concern is with the rural population, particularly those residing in the undeveloped areas on small uneconomic holdings.  Possibly many people feel that these people are a burden on the community, but I respectfully suggest that it is from those homes that most of our people emigrate and that the amounts which are brought back in the form of emigrants' remittances are much greater than the Central Statistics Office can ascertain, because many of these people bring the money back in the form of cash.  In my experience, possibly up to 80 per cent. or 90 per cent. of the purchase money for holdings in the western districts comes from money earned by these people in Britain and America.  Therefore, they may be contributing considerably to our invisible exports.</P>
      <P>On page 51 of the Book of Estimates, as the Minister will note&mdash;I understand it is the Department administered by the Minister&mdash;the Vote for rural improvement schemes and minor improvement schemes remains static.  The same applies to the Vote for the Local Authorities (Works) Act under the Department of Local Government.  All that means that those rural people must earn less than they did in previous years because of the fact that the wages have increased considerably during the past 12 months, in consequence of the fact that the cost-of-living index figure has gone up by seven points in the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an example of what I mean, in my county, the wages have gone up by 15/- within one year, by three instalments of 5/- each.  That increase of 15/- represented an expenditure of £47,000; and, as the Central Exchequer <Col N="1594" /> puts up approximately two-thirds of road expenditure, it means that the ratepayer would normally be responsible for only one-third, which would be £16,000.  The local authority did put up that extra £16,000, which meant an increase of 1/- in the £ on the rates, but the remaining £31,000 has not been found, because the amount allocated by the Minister for Local Government from the Road Fund this year is the same as it was last year.</P>
    <P>The wages of those employed in rural improvement schemes and minor improvement schemes is tied up to the wages paid to the road workers.  In my county at the moment&mdash;and it is also the position in many other counties&mdash;the wages are £5 per week.  That all means that those people will get less work on these schemes for the coming year.  When one considers the fact that the Minister has already stated that the remuneration of civil servants and other employees of the State has caused an increase in expenditure of £3,250,000, we can see that those people are getting the benefit, but the people in the rural areas, in whom I am particularly interested, are not deriving any benefit under this Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>No doubt that £3,250,000 will bring in increased revenue to the Minister in the form of additional revenue from income-tax, because it must be assumed that most of the extra payment to the civil servants will mean that the extra money will be brought in.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to page 179 of the Book of Estimates.  The grants to local authorities towards the cost of housing schemes have been reduced by £100,000.  There is only a token Vote of £5.  Will the Minister explain the reason for that in his reply?  The Vote was cut by £120,000 last year which means that there is a reduction of some £220,000 in two years.  I assume that there must be some reasonable explanation for this reduction.</P>
    <P>I might also draw the attention of the House to the fact that there is a reduction of £6,000 in the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture for land projects and on page 100, £200,000 in the subsidies for dairy produce. <Col N="1595" /> Does the Minister anticipate that there will be a reduction in the production of creamery butter for the coming year?</P>

      <P>I am merely going through the Estimates.  There is a reduction of £700,000 under food subsidies, the price of flour and wheaten meal.  Apart from the reduction for the previous year, does the Minister now anticipate that there will be a reduced acreage of wheat and that there will be a corresponding increase in the amount of wheat imported?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <P>The Minister has already mentioned in his statement the decreased cost of both commodities. Last year, the Minister explained the reduction in the Vote for the Hospitals Trust and the physical impossibility of maintaining the rate of progress that had been carried on in previous years.  Does the Minister now anticipate that there will be an increased amount obtained from the sweepstake funds this year, or does he consider that the rate of building for the coming year of hospitals will be less than formerly, because there has been a reduction of £2,250,000 in two years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1596" /> It is certainly not consistent with the fact that, when deputations approach the Minister for Health, they are told that there is no money available in the Hospitals Trust for the various plans of reconstruction and improvement of buildings which these deputations consider are required.  I wonder also whether the Minister is not being rather optimistic in making a reduction of £146,000 in the allocation to the G.N.R. Board, in view of the present financial position of that board.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that he does not anticipate that there will be much change in the employment position for the coming 12 months.  To me, that is disappointing, in view of the present unemployment position and the amount of emigration.  One of the few boasts that the present inter-Party Government can make is the fact that there has been a reduction of approximately 6,000 since they came into office.  I suggest that the reduction was greater during the previous régime.  I should refer the Minister to the fact that, for the 12 months prior to leaving office, there was a reduction of 13,000 on the unemployment register.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Senator will also no doubt explain how it rose from June, 1951, to the peak point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>What I noticed is that, for the year ending February, 1954, there was a reduction of 13,000, whereas for the two years from then until the 25th February of this year, there is a reduction of 6,000.  In connection with the serious position that has now arisen in connection with our balance of payments, I note that in 12 months there has been an increase of over 500 per cent. and no country would view that position with any complacency.  A deficit of £35,000,000 in one year is certainly a very serious matter for the country, particularly when the trade balance has been increased by over £29,000,000, due not so much to the importation of capital goods, but, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce has already stated, to the increased importation of consumer goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> I certainly do not criticise the Government for the steps they have now taken to rectify the position.  The Minister only expects a decrease of £7,000,000 in the adverse trade balance in consequence of the levies which he now imposes.  Like Senator Douglas, I wonder whether that will meet the position to any reasonable extent.  When we relate that fact to the decrease in the cattle prices, I fear what must lie ahead for the country.</P>
    <P>The Government have allowed this position to develop over the past six months and, in consequence of the delay in tackling the matter, I fear that the cure is going to be a very severe one, particularly as they were well aware of the position for at least eight months past.  It is noticed that the trade deficit for the 3rd quarter of 1955 was £9,500,000 and for the last quarter £10,000,000.  The dangerous position which we have now reached in consequence of what has happened in regard to the last national loan shows how imperative it is to take the necessary steps to rectify the position.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the loan failed to attract adequate subscriptions. The fact that the loan which issued at 98½ is now quoted at 96¼ is certainly not a vote of confidence in the present régime.  If the position arising out of the loan is any indication of Government policy it is certainly not in their favour.  I should like to quote from a speech made by Senator McGuire on the Central Fund Bill on 15th March, 1955, as reported at column 982, Volume 44, of the Seanad Debates:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A successful national loan was floated.  It was over-subscribed and was at a rate of interest in conformity with what we in this country should pay for public money.  I need not again point out the repercussions throughout the country in connection with the figure paid for the Fianna Fáil national loan some years ago.  It affected rates of lending, and it also affected commercial values.  Estimates of the return from commercial capital investments were completely thrown out of gear because if the people could get 5 per <Col N="1598" /> cent. from a Government loan naturally they would look for more than 5 per cent. on ordinary business risk capital.  Borrowing rates were thrown completely out of order.  The Government has re-established the position as regards borrowing money, at rates which do not adversely affect commercial interests and risk capital in private enterprise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the same occasion, the Minister for Finance is reported at column 1058 as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was in pursuance of that attempt at improvement that the last national loan was issued at a rate of 4¼ per cent. at 96, and members of all Parties in this House are, I know, gratified that what was issued at 96 is now standing at 99?, ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister is possibly aware that in to-day's papers that loan of 4¼ per cent. is now quoted at 88?.  It will also be a shock to local authorities that the rate of interest on loans from the Local Loans Fund has now to be increased to 5¼ per cent.  This, in my opinion, will have an adverse effect on building and will consequently increase rents.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the diminution in savings which took place in 1955 is one cause of our difficulties.  The various Ministers making up the present Government have got to accept a certain amount of responsibility for the position with which we are now faced in view of the fact that they discredited and criticised the warnings which were issued by the Central Bank, by directors of other banks and by financial experts generally.  Did they not encourage extravagance and recklessness and suggest that it would not affect us very seriously to decrease our foreign investments?  If the Minister considers that the levies which are now to be imposed will reduce the adverse trade balance by only £7,000,000 or £8,000,000, I should like to know what he anticipates will be the income to the Exchequer from those levies.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by reading an extract from the editorial of <i>The Leader</i> of 11th February last.  It cannot be <Col N="1599" /> suggested that <i>The Leader</i> is a Fianna Fáil organ, or that it is in any way tied to that Party.  The extract appears on page 3, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the other hand, the financial policy of the Party in power&mdash; however well it looks on paper&mdash; gives frequently the impression of opportunism.  When in opposition, the Party preached a doctrine of optimism, and spoke in all languages to all men.  It supported a policy of reduced taxation for the middle classes, and higher wages for the poorer groups in the community.  It opposed the restrictive wages policy of the pre-1948 Fianna Fáil Government, and denounced the anti-consumption measures of Mr. MacEntee between 1952 and 1954.  On each occasion, Fine Gael's policy in office has partly contributed to the development of inflation, and to an unproductive reduction in external assets.  The result has been the emergence of what Mr. Costello calls &lsquo;stresses and strains&rsquo;, but which others regard as an economic crisis of the first magnitude.  There is little doubt that Fine Gael in office has displayed vacillation in its general economic policy.  That vacillation is hardly conducive to the development of confidence in the long-term programme of Governments.  The tendency to swing from one extreme to the other would hardly benefit the productive programme of investments and savings on which Mr. Costello has laid such stress.  The real victims in the first instance are the middle classes, formerly regarded as the traditional supporters of Fine Gael; in Ireland, however, nearly everyone either belongs to the middle class, or is moving back or forward into it.  Unless Fine Gael in the future displays, at the appropriate time, more responsibility and discards its opportunistic tendencies in financial policy, the damage not only to the middle classes, but to all classes, in Ireland may be irretrievable.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>The field over which we are allowed to roam on this Bill is so wide that I have decided just to concentrate <Col N="1600" /> on one or two ideas of my own in connection with it.  I should like to say, in the first place, that under these new impositions we have been told about by the Minister, any revenue that will be collected from these new duties will not be used for current expenditure but, rather, will be used as a deterrent on imports.  They will not be applied to the ordinary uses of taxation. In other words, they will not be made inflationary because merely to impose extra duties on imports and to get more revenue for the Government and immediately to put it into spending would be just adding to the inflationary situation which the Minister is setting out to deal with.</P>
      <P>The Opposition are objecting to the size of the bill presented here to-day. We can all fairly say we object to this yearly rising bill presented by the State and I suppose nobody more so than the Minister for Finance himself. The Minister for Finance in all Governments is notable for objecting to extra expenditure.  But, having complained about the size of the bill, in the first speech which was made here to-day after the Minister's introduction of the Bill, Senator Hawkins proceeded to complain about all the things that were not being done.  In other words he seemed to think that the expenditure was not big enough.  That is the only thing that could be taken from his statement because if the Government were to provide the things that he and the Fianna Fáil Party have been urging, the bill would be much higher. As well as that we have just heard from the last speaker some criticism about expenditure.  In the past we have always heard about the parsimoniousness of Fine Gael and that if they got into Coalition with any Party like the Labour Party that Party would be held back in everything by Fine Gael. In the past we were parsimonious and now we are accused of being extravagant and reckless.  I admit that there must be criticism.  I feel that it is important in any democracy that there should be criticism of the Government and the Ministers and their actions because it is the essence of democracy to have freedom of criticism.  But that criticism, however, should be constructive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1601" /> I feel that the public in this country are getting tired of hearing what I call &ldquo;blame placing.&rdquo;  I feel it is becoming a national disease affecting not only groups of people but individuals who insist on this &ldquo;blame placing&rdquo; and there is a want of the concerted action that will achieve good results on all planes of the national life.  There has grown up here over the years&mdash;since the beginning of the State&mdash;a very unhealthy degree of destructive and injurious criticism of politicians, business people, professional associations and indviduals of all kinds.  We hear it every day and you can hear people running down the Dáil and the Seanad. We see some of those people, when there is a vacancy in the Seanad, running in all directions to see how they can get it.  They are the first people when they are outside to criticise the Seanad, but they are very keen when there is a vacancy to get inside if they are able.</P>
    <P>I feel that as a result of this outcry on all sides we have built up a sort of restrictive and constrictive national life in all phases of our national affairs. The result is that the Government and the political Parties in response to this situation and to this outcry, are saddling more and more sections of the community and individuals with restrictions and inquiries and all sorts of unnecessary legislation, all of which mean greater restriction on liberty and on the development of our economic life&mdash;agricultural, industrial and commercial.  In other words everybody is attacking everybody else and when they are not attacking the Government they are attacking their fellow citizens.  I think that it is quite an unfair thing to do but it is something which is becoming very strong and is a marked characteristic of our national life.</P>
    <P>I think we should have a different policy here: a policy of encouragement for the people to work together.  We always hear a lot of talk to the effect that we are a Christian nation but I think it would be better to show that by actions rather than by words.  We could show better that we are a Christian community by working in harmony together.  In the early days the Christians were known by their love <Col N="1602" /> for one another but I do not think that anybody coming to Ireland to-day and hearing the debates in the Dáil or Seanad or reading some of the things written in our newspapers by columnists could say that we showed that we were Christians by our love for one another.</P>
    <P>The problem we are facing to-day is a serious one which calls for the increased production of our exports, agricultural and industrial.  It was brought about because we had not the necessary increased production for export and because we were using too much of the consumer goods at home which were needed for exporting.  I feel we would need to be financially strong in industry and to have more harmonious relations between employers and workers and also between the Government of the country and the industrialists and workers as well. There should be a full confidence as between all Parties in this national need and there should be none of this bickering and criticism that we have here to-day.  We have a job of work of national importance to do in all our individual spheres.  The position is like that of a patient who is ill.  We are economically ill.  If a patient is ill the doctor will send him to a climate that is good for his health.  I feel that is what we need in this country.  We need a healthy industrial climate in which we could get over our difficulties and pull together.</P>
    <P>There is a regular campaign in this country to discredit business.  I have spoken on this matter before and, strange to say, part of this discreditable situation is caused by conflict between Labour and employers.  That is an absolutely wrong state of affairs because the fact is that Labour and employers are mutually dependent upon each other.  They are working the same machines and their interests are the same financially as well as spiritually and nationally.  A lot of penal legislation dealing with business and commercial matters has been passed at the behest of Labour and I think that is bad and it is a rather unenlightened way in which to do these things.</P>
    <P>From time to time there have been suggestions of racketeering going on in <Col N="1603" /> businesses which upon investigation have been proved false.  Despite that the same allegations are made the following day.  There is one gentleman who is writing to the newspapers regularly and he complains that in a certain bank in this country this year they paid 1 per cent. less dividend than in 1939.  He is quite correct in this statement. In 1939 people put good money into the banks and they were now being paid in 1956 money which is only about a third or a quarter of the value of the 1939 money.  They are getting 1 per cent. less paid to them than in 1939.  These attacks which are made by Labour on employers naturally invite in turn retaliatory attacks by employers on the workers' organisations. This obviously creates a most unsatisfactory atmosphere.  But employers are not as politically strong and therefore not able to effect very much result from their attacks.</P>
    <P>Now in connection with the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill&mdash;that is purely brought in to meet a certain outcry by trade unions against restrictive trade practices and employers think badly about it because nothing is done about the restrictive practices by trades unions.  The main reason we object to the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill is that it is discriminatory legislation.  If we are going to have inquiries, let us have them for every citizen, then if there are wrong practices in trade and industry they will be shown up and dealt with.  But be fair and do it all round.  Very often, the impact of restrictive trade practices by unions is very much heavier and greater than the restrictive practices in business and industry.  I merely give that as an illustration of what I mean. Therefore, I would appeal that we should try and direct our efforts more to the problems under consideration in a spirit of unity, feeling that we all have the same interest at heart, both from the national point of view and from the economic point of view.  If only we can get a little bit more of that feeling in national life, we could get on better with the job of making the country prosperous and rich and giving a higher standard of living to everyone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1604" /> In passing, I want to refer to the question of prices going up and the accusations flying around as to why they are going up.  I do not want to go into that now too fully because it is a long story.  There are many different ideas of what causes prices to go up but I would like to say that I think very often the problem is not presented in the right way.  We are told every day that we are not giving enough production and there should be more production.  When you say that to the ordinary worker&mdash;in fact to the ordinary businessman&mdash;he really does not know what you are talking about.  It is really a technical word, this word &ldquo;production&rdquo;.  He does not understand that if he does not give more production he cannot have more wages, or if he does not give more production and gets more wages, he does not think there is anything wrong with that.  I suggest a different way of looking at it is to realise that money is no longer based on gold.  It is only a token value.  Its value is merely what you get for it.  If in any particular industry, the workers get more money for the same amount of work, well, they are obviously depreciating the value of that token straight away. How then can they, having demanded more tokens for the same amount of work in their own particular job, take them out and get the same value as before from other people who have done exactly the same thing?  But when that happens everyone is very much surprised and they say: &ldquo;The price has gone up.&rdquo;  What happens is that they depreciate the value of the tokens and destroy the value of the money.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been stressing the necessity for savings and in this particular context.  We are all interested in this.  Savings are the capital from which we get all our goods and services and from which we get our employment and our prosperity in industry.  Savings must be encouraged and although I am always referring to this subject, I think it no harm to repeat that savings are not going to be created by mere exhortation and telling people they must save.  There is more to it than that.  People are not going to save merely because they <Col N="1605" /> are told to do so.  Someone has already said in this debate that to many people it seems better to use their money now, while the going is good, than to save it.  Therefore, it must be made worth while to save.  It must be financially good value to do it and psychologically good value to do it.  In other words, you must get some return on your money when you save it and you must not be regarded as someone to be looked down upon, to be looked at not only as a fool but as a knave, and attacked by both the citizens of the State and by the State itself, by way of penal taxation.</P>
    <P>The first thing that must be done is to increase the rates of interest to the people who are saving, as the Minister has already done in the last loan.  The giving of a greater rate of interest is particularly important at this time. But as well as that, there must be increased rewards given in all possible ways to people who make increased savings and put their savings by. People who are not only putting money by in gilt-edged securities to collect interest, but to those who put savings where we want it most, in industry and productive enterprise of all kinds. Risk investment of this kind should have as big a reward as possible and for this reason there must be recognition of decent profits in industry if you are going to attract capital into industry, rather than have it put away at small interest in gilt-edged securities of all kinds.  This is where I feel Labour is at fault, because they do not seem to recognise the necessity for profits and of good profits in industry, where they themselves will get the most benefit out of it in the form of good employment, and the country will benefit by the goods and exports produced, which will counteract the balance of payments, which we so sorely need to do at present.  Finally, when such money is saved, there must be enlightened taxation in connection with it.  It must not be treated as unearned income and confiscated by taxation at the first available moment, when it has been collected together. These things must be sympathetically considered and recognised by all classes of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hardly have intervened in this debate but for the remarks that were made by the last speaker, Senator McGuire.  I would like to intervene to underline and to approve some of the sentiments which he has expressed.  He has condemned strongly what he describes as blame-placing and destructive criticism.  It is rather a pity that he did not express those views some years ago when the predecessors of the present Government were in office.  I think there was more blame-placing and more destructive criticism, more violent and irresponsible misrepresentation then than at any time in the whole history of this country.  If Senator McGuire raised his voice in protest against that bitter campaign, I am afraid his voice was not heard.  It was probably drowned by the louder cries of those who denounced the efforts of a previous Government to balance the Government's financial accounts and to balance the nation's external trade to the best of their ability.  That action by the previous Government was subjected to such misrepresentation as to be described as &ldquo;a savage Budget&rdquo;, a &ldquo;brutal Budget&rdquo; and words to that effect.  But all these things are things that we would like to forget, except that their effects live on.</P>
      <P>The fact that this country to-day has entered on an economic and financial crisis is due in the main to that campaign against sound management of the country's financial affairs and of the country's business.  If the people who were in opposition three or four years ago had adopted a more responsible attitude, if they had joined the then Government in admitting that the growing deficit in our balance of payments was a dangerous thing and that unbalanced Budgets were also highly dangerous to the life and independence of the country, if they had marshalled public opinion behind the responsible attitude of the then Government, I believe our economic and financial position to-day would be a great deal better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that, during the period of the first Coalition Government, a serious crisis developed in our external trade and in our balance <Col N="1607" /> of payments.  It reached a really desperate position in 1951 when the change of Government occurred, and when our adverse balance of payments rose to the abnormal figure of £61,000,000.  In a comparatively short time, that position was rectified by the Coalition's successors, and, when it was rectified and when the country was restored to a solvent position, the Coalition came back into office.  Now, in the last two years, the crisis has recurred in just as dangerous a field as it appeared in 1951.</P>
    <P>Why is it that this deterioration of our financial and economic position seems to follow the Coalition Government as the tail follows the cat?  Why is it that this Coalition Government cannot remain in office for any period of time without getting the country right to the edge of bankruptcy?  If you have a captain of a ship, who, every time he goes out on a cruise, invariably succeeds in getting his ship on the rocks or on a sandbank, you have to admit that his steering has hardly been very competent or very efficient.  Yet that is what has happened now on the two occasions on which the Coalition has been in office.</P>
    <P>Nobody will now say that the Budget of 1952 was a savage Budget, or that it was an unnecessary Budget, or that it could have been avoided, because its provisions have been endorsed by the present Government.  In addition to all the provisions of the 1952 Budget, we have to-day 68 additional tariffs being introduced, which must add some little to the burden of the community and which must, I think, inevitably bring in some revenue to the State. Even if the Minister may decide to earmark this money for certain purposes, it will, nevertheless, be&mdash;and I think it is not undesirable&mdash;of some help to him in trying to find money for the various schemes which a Government has to administer.  This additional taxation has been described as the &ldquo;Sweetman squeeze&rdquo;.  We are not so unjust at this side of the House as to follow the example of the Opposition in 1952 and to describe it as the &ldquo;MacMillan squeeze&rdquo;.  We are not going to say that the Minister, in <Col N="1608" /> introducing those additional tariffs, has been coerced by the British Chancellor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think he may have been influenced to a certain extent, but it is certainly a strange thing that those who so strongly denounced the Fianna Fáil Government for seeking to rectify this country's position in regard to external trade are now forced to take similar measures and, in fact, to take measures in addition to those that were adopted by Fianna Fáil.  These additional 68 tariffs are not being introduced in substitution for the increased taxation under the 1952 Budget.  They are being introduced in addition to them and in that way they endorse those taxes and emphasise the fact that they were justified.</P>
      <P>One of the things that were used by the present Government, mainly for propaganda purposes, was the cost of living.  It seems to be a subject which is not discussed so much now in governmental circles.  I will not say that it has become high treason to speak of the high cost of living, but I will certainly say that the Minister and his associates are very anxious to discourage any reference to the high cost of living.  But facts have got to be faced.  Fianna Fáil was accused of raising the cost of living, but we are now in a position to view the situation as it stands to-day.  Since June, 1950, the cost of living has risen by 32 points.</P>

      <P>That may be the kind of mathematics indulged in on Westmeath County Council and on Westmeath Committee of Agriculture.  To me, my figures appear to be absolutely clear and logical.  I suppose it may be that, being a good and enthusiastic disciple of the Coalition and having attacked Fianna Fáil so frequently in regard to the cost of living, Senator L'Estrange may feel that he may have succeeded in completely convincing himself of the false accusations that he made, but I think he will not convince anybody else.  When we have a position, as we now have, that the Coalition have been responsible for a higher increase in the cost of living than Fianna Fáil, I am sure that that <Col N="1610" /> is one of the things that will influence them to keep rather quiet on this question.  It is no satisfaction to anyone that the cost of living has risen by 32 points in the last five years.  It is a serious matter because, as Senator McGuire pointed out, it has lowered the value of money and created many serious problems.</P>
      <P>I think it is about time that it was admitted now, as it should be admitted, that Fianna Fáil were in no way responsible for that rise in the cost of living, and if the representatives of the present Government are prepared to admit that, I am sure that we, on this side of the House, would be prepared to say that there were many features in the rise in the cost of living during the last six months of the first Coalition and during the first two years of the present Coalition which were outside the control of that Government. We must remember that there are many things in life, particularly in the economic life of a nation, which a Government cannot control and cannot influence to any great extent; but there is one thing that a Government should do, or try to do, and that is to influence public opinion in the right direction.</P>
      <P>If the Minister and his colleagues will examine their consciences, they will admit that they did not try to influence public opinion in the right direction during the last three or four years.  They led the people to believe that there was unlimited prosperity available to everyone, if they simply could get Eamon de Valera out of office.  They presented a picture that Eamon de Valera, with his ideals of austerity, was stopping the people or preventing the people from enjoying life to the full; and that, if he could be only got out of office, everybody could have a better time, have more money to spend and more goods to consume, and a happier life altogether.  Now we have our Minister for Finance gravely warning our people that consumption in this country has risen to too high a level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of his predecessors, Deputy McGilligan, then Minister for Finance, in March, 1951, on the Vote on Account, made the same statement. <Col N="1611" /> Nobody, apparently, even within his Government, took too much notice of it and it was allowed pass.  But it is on the records of Dáil Eireann, and, I think, it is also on the records of this House that he repeated here that consumption at that time was reaching too high a level.  His successor, Deputy MacEntee, repeated the statement and declared that consumption of goods, particularly of imported goods, was at too high a level in 1951 and 1952, and every member of all the Government Parties went through the country crying out that Deputy MacEntee was saying that the people were eating too much and that their appetites would have to be curbed; and that statement was related to the ordinary worker on small wages and the old age pensioner. There was a reckless campaign waged against the reasonable attempt that was made by the then Government to put this country on a sound economic basis.  That was, perhaps, an occasion upon which Senator McGuire could have earnestly appealed for charity, for a sense of responsibility, for a sense of fair play and for the Christian feeling which we all would like to see praised and practised in this State.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone would be optimistic enough to believe that the measures taken by the Minister by themselves can really remedy the serious position in which the country is placed.  I think that much more energetic measures, not perhaps so much in the field of restriction as in the field of production, require to be taken.  It is true that industry has made considerable progress since the end of the emergency.  It is also true that agriculture, in which there is a wider field for expansion, has not made any progress.  It is a deplorable fact that, in the past 12 months, imports of food for human and animal consumption amounted to £46,000,000, which was an increase of £9,000,000 on the previous year, 1954.  On the other hand, our exports of food for human and animal consumption, under the same category, decreased by £9,000,000, leaving a net decrease in our agricultural exports of £18,000,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> A drop of £18,000,000 in agricultural exports is something which nobody can laugh at or easily explain away.  It is something that has to be taken as a serious feature of our position, because anyone who gives serious attention to our economic problems will admit that it is in agriculture and in the better utilisation of the land that we can hope to secure the increased production and the increased wealth that is so necessary at the present time in order to maintain something approaching our present standard of living.  We can&mdash; and it is admitted that we can&mdash;increase agricultural output by at least 25 per cent., and possibly by 50 per cent., but no serious attempt has been made to get that increase.</P>
    <P>During the past two years we had an attack made on wheat growing in this country, an attack which resulted in a reduction of 130,000 acres in the area under wheat.  It resulted also in our having to import over £11,000,000 worth of cereals from abroad.  In addition to that, of course, we imported other foodstuffs for which we could substitute home production.  Will anyone in this House in the face of the problem that has developed in regard to our external balance of payments now say that the reduction in the price of wheat by £5 per ton and the reduction in the price of barley by £4 per ton in 1954 and 1955 was justifiable? Would it not be better to have kept that £8,000,000, £9,000,000 £10,000,000 or £11,000,000 at home? Would it not have been better to have reduced our adverse trade balance by approximately £10,000,000 through reserving the home market to our own growers of wheat and barley?</P>
    <P>We heard in this House the case made against the wheat grower.  We heard him described as a racketeer, a speculator and as everything that was evil and undesirable.  We do not know what kind of people grew the £5,000,000 worth of wheat imported into this country.  We do not know what colour they were.  We do not know what religion they had and we do not know what their politics were, but we took their wheat without question.  It is only the Irish grower whose conscience apparently must be publicly examined <Col N="1613" /> and whose character may be held up to ridicule.</P>
    <P>We heard it said in this House that Fianna Fáil agreed to a reduction in the acreage of wheat, but no evidence of any kind was produced ind support of that charge.  The Minister purported to read a minute of the Fianna Fáil Government when they were in office which set out a minimum target of 300,000 tons of dried wheat and which sought to make ample provision for that minimum production.  There was never the slightest hint of any intention of Fianna Fáil to reduce the price or to curb or restrict the acreage, but every kind of charge and any kind of accusation was thought good enough to hurl against the wheat growers, with the result that their acreage and output were drastically cut and we had to depend to an increasing degree on the foreigner to supply us with our daily bread.</P>
    <P>What was done in respect to wheat has also been done and is still being done in regard to milk.  The milk producers asked for nothing more than a fair investigation into their production costs, with a view to seeing what it costs to produce a gallon of milk and, having ascertained the cost of producing a gallon of milk, then it would be natural to expect that the cost of production at least would be paid to the producer.  The Fianna Fáil Government agreed to set up that investigation, but, since Fianna Fáil went out of power, that Costings Commission has gone underground.  It is now hibernating.  It is evident that the technical officers on that commission are afraid to deliver a verdict in favour of the farmers lest they might lose their jobs.  They are marking time in their own ground, hoping that if they keep on sitting long enough there may be a change of Government and the threat of dismissal will be removed from over their heads.  It is not a fair treatment of the farmers to have to wait for three years for such a simple investigation.</P>
    <P>As I stated elsewhere, an old churn makes bad butter and that butter that will eventually emerge from the Costings Commission's churn will, I am afraid, be very difficult to digest, <Col N="1614" /> because most people, I think, will be inclined to suspect the figures that will eventually be produced.  It is necessary to dwell on this for a moment because it is the most vital matter affecting production here at the present moment.  If we turn to any of the high producing countries, such as Denmark and Holland, we will find they have large dairy herds upon every farm and those herds are profitably run.  Is it not equally desirable that our agriculture should be founded on profitable dairy herds?</P>
    <P>It is admitted by all agriculturists that, if you want to get the very highest yield per acre&mdash;and yield per acre is the only thing that really matters&mdash; you cannot surpass dairy farming as a means of achieving that production. Dairy farming, accompanied, supplemented and supported by a fairly high percentage of tillage is the pattern in Denmark and in those progressive small countries which balance their accounts with other countries and keep their own people at a reasonable high standard of living.</P>
    <P>Why is it that we must have this distrust, misrepresentation and lack of confidence?  As Senator McGuire pointed out, you can have no real productive efforts, unless those who are engaged in production feel the community are with them and behind them, and that every effort they make to improve their position will not be misconstrued and misrepresented.  All the milk producers ask for is one simple thing&mdash;an investigation into their production costs with a view to finding out what would be a fair price for them and guaranteeing them that price.  They are not asking for anything excessive.  They are seeking the very minimum that anybody engaged in productive industry would ask for.</P>
    <P>There is no use in politicians and civil servants appealing to farmers to keep one more cow and one more sow. That kind of empty headed slogan does not cut any ice, nor does it add one pint to the supply of milk produced in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I was trying to impress upon the Minister and upon the Government was that there are ways and means by which we can increase the volume of agricultural output. The first method is to encourage the maintenance of larger and better dairy herds.  That is not done by mere shouting.  It can be done by creating confidence and security in industry. That confidence and security has been destroyed to a certain extent by the actions or inactions of the Milk Costings Commission.  I hope their report will in due course be forthcoming and that when it does appear it will be acted upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to increasing our stocks and dairy herds, I feel the credit facilities available to the ordinary farmer are altogether inadequate.  I mention this matter because we are at the moment rather in the middle of what might be described as a credit squeeze.  Interest rates have been <Col N="1617" /> raised and restrictions have been placed upon credit.  That may be desirable from the point of view of preventing consumption, but it is very undesirable in as far as it may prevent production.  If a farmer wants to increase his dairy herd and if he has not got very formidable security to offer he may do without the money. That is the position.  It is an extraordinary thing that, even with the restrictions the Minister has imposed upon hire purchase, a man who is unable to raise sufficient money to buy additional cows to improve his dairy herd can borrow as much as £500 if he wants to buy a new car on the hire-purchase system.</P>
    <P>Why is it that free and easy credit is not available to the man who wants to buy four or five or six cows?  Why is is that a man, by signing a hire-purchase agreement, can get £500 to buy an expensive or luxurious car?  It does not matter what he signs, or if he genuflects seven times to the bank manager, he will not get 7d. unless he can produce a lot of sureties which are not required by the hire-purchase people at all.  I am raising this point because I think there is a case for freeing and loosening-up credit facilities when they are about to be used and when the Government are satisfied they will be used and have taken steps to ensure they will be used for really productive purposes.</P>
    <P>If a man wants to buy cows to enlarge his dairy herd or if he wants to buy better cows than he has so as to improve his dairy herd there should be no difficulty whatever about giving him all the credit he requires provided, as in the case of the man buying a car, he undertakes to allow the loan instalments to be collected by the creamery or milk wholesaler to whom he is supplying the produce of his cows.  In that way, easy credit could be given and it would bring about an almost immediate expansion in our dairy herds.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sugar Company is an example of progressive management of an industry.  It provides the farmer who wants to grow beet with credit to the extent of £25 per statute acre of beet to enable him to secure fertilisers, seeds and lime.  A sum of £25 per <Col N="1618" /> statute acre is a fairly substantial amount of credit.  If it were applied to all the land of this country it would come to £300,000,000.  That amount is not required but at least the creamery industry, backed up by the Government &mdash;because I think they would need backing on a project of this kind&mdash; should be able to supply all the credit their suppliers require if they want to improve or enlarge their dairy herds. In the same way, it should be possible to provide all the credit a farmer requires if he wants to purchase fertilisers for his land or so as to increase the quantity of milk supplied to the creamery.  There, again, that loan could be recovered through deductions from the creamery cheque.</P>
    <P>It is on these lines that we can, if we are in earnest about this question, hope to secure increased output from the land.  The prices of wheat, barley, the bacon pig, milk and other such products of intensive farming should be stabilised and, where necessary, raised.  Security should be given. Confidence should be created.  In that way, I think we could move forward towards a higher output from our land.</P>
    <P>During the past couple of years, attempts have been made to disrupt to a great extent advisory services in regard to agriculture, by setting parish agents in opposition to local county instructors.  That is an unwise move which will have a deleterious effect on agriculture, or which at any rate will slow down the efforts being made to intensify agricultural production here.  I hope the Government will desist from these things and will seek rather to secure greater unity and cohesion between all the forces that make for increased output.</P>
    <P>There is really no conflict between the farmer and the manufacturer, or between the country people and the city people.  There should be no conflict between them, for they are all a part of the nation and should co-operate.  Senator McGuire was quite right when he said that there was too great a tendency in this country to ridicule and condemn the men engaged in production&mdash;the man who is doing something to add to the wealth of our country.  There are too many people inclined to criticise <Col N="1619" /> the few who are prepared to produce. If a man in a sphere of culture produces a work of art, whether it be a painting or anything else, there are a hundred prepared to criticise him. When a man seeks to increase production and to develop his land he will find that there are dozens prepared to condemn and ridicule him and to suggest that, if he has got increased productivity, then he got his money from other sources.</P>
    <P>This destructive criticism should be avoided and the Government would go a long way to curbing it, if they were prepared to come out openly now and admit that they were wrong in their criticism and condemnation of Fianna Fáil during the last three years of that Government's office.  If they do that, the people will perhaps be prepared to forgive and to forget the campaign of falsehoods launched against Fianna Fáil and the Independent Deputies who supported them at that time.  The people might be prepared to say that now perhaps, at last, the Government were turning over a new leaf and were prepared to do their best for the country.  I believe, if they do that, the country will respond to that outlook and everybody will try to pull together to make the country more productive and therefore more prosperous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sat here for the past five hours listening to speeches far removed from realities.  I must say Senator O'Brien was refreshing in what he said and he was interesting, as is usual, in what he had to say. Apart, however, from Senator O'Brien, I did not hear from any other Senator any reference to the Bill that is before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the Bill is to give the Government power to borrow £41,704,458 to carry on the work of the nation for probably three or four months and whether it borrows that money from the banks or from any person does not matter.  I submit that it is the sovereign right of the people of this country that this Government should be in a position to issue the necessary money and credit to carry on the work of the nation.  Instead of <Col N="1620" /> that, we have delegated the power to issue money and credit to private individuals who, because they have that power, can issue that money and credit to whom they like and restrict it whenever they like.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien brought me back to something I said some time ago when he referred to the Banking Commission. That Banking Commission was set up some time about 1936 and it issued its reports in 1938.  We had several reports from that commission, minority and majority reports.  I submit that there is more need to get these minority and majority reports before the people to-day than there was in 1939.  Why have we forgotten all about these reports of that commission? I think Senator O'Brien was himself a signatory to one of the majority reports.  I have been asking myself how many Senators and Deputies ever took the trouble to read either the majority or minority reports of that commission.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien is still with us, as are the men who issued the minority reports, all of them men of responsibility. They at that time gave their views on what should be done about the financial structure of this country. Are we now afraid to bring these people in to tell us how we should work to-day in regard to our financial structure?</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister and to everybody else that the time has arrived when all Parties should come together in a campaign so as to give the ordinary citizens an opportunity of understanding the true position about our money issue and about our credit, and how the money is issued into circulation and the important part that money plays in our economic and social life.  But we have heard nothing about it.  Everybody seems afraid to mention the question.  That was one of the reasons why I was so pleased to hear Senator O'Brien giving his views.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien, I think, said that if the banking rates go up it was outside the control of the Government or even of the Central Bank.  I would like to hear Senator O'Brien elaborate on that and I would like the Minister to tell me if the Central Bank since its establishment ever did one scrap of <Col N="1621" /> banking transactions in the interest of the nation.  The people have been gulled since 1942 by being told that the Central Bank could safeguard the integrity of our currency.  Have we any currency?  I would say we have not. We hear people saying that we are linked to sterling, but I say we are not linked to sterling and our currency has no integrity at all.  It is not quoted on the markets of the world because we have no independent currency of our own.  It is as easy to bring money from London to Dublin, Cork or Limerick as it is to bring it from London to Liverpool.  When I saw the figures turned out by the Central Bank, I asked myself the question as to what accuracy there was in those things.  Is there anything wrong in a man bringing trunks full of £1 notes from England over here to buy up thousands of acres of land?  At the moment when he brings in paper money, he can go immediately to the banks and get it transferred into Irish currency.  Is that an independent currency?</P>
    <P>I was sorry to hear some of the remarks of Senator Hawkins.  I could not see the point of much of what he was talking about.  I heard one ex-Minister say in the Seanad that he had listened to a lot of slush, but I read a speech made in the Dáil last week by that same ex-Minister and while I would not like to say anything that would be out of place I could not make up my mind about whether he was talking slush or anything else.  We are not in a position to determine what we should do.  There can be no national economic policy so long as decisions are not with the Government, but with the people who control our money and credit.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire brought up a whole lot of things which are not based on facts.  One would think from him that the workers were responsible for our difficulties and our troubles.  He talked about increased production, and Senator Cogan, too, spoke about production. We know that it is production that creates our standard of living, that maintains it, and that it is only production can increase it.  Why are we talking about production when we are paying 70,000 people every <Col N="1622" /> week not to produce anything?  Why are we preventing them from producing? We have 70,000 people going to the labour exchanges.  They are not allowed to produce, but we have these slogans about production.  I suggest that men like Senator McGuire should talk about something else.  We cannot live on paper money and it is time we dropped those slogans and got down to something practical.</P>
    <P>There was talk about saving.  Senator Kissane spoke about the need to save and I asked him why, and he said the money the investors meant to save was now depreciated.  Anybody can see that up to £400,000 and often £460,000 is set aside to meet depreciation of saving certificates.  Is it any wonder that ordinary working people will not save?  Senator Guinness spoke about the resources of this country and said that they decide the standard of living.  That is obvious to anyone.  The fact is that we have less than 3,000,000 people.  There are 70,000 of them not allowed to work.  There are 164,000 living on 24/- a week.  There are 62,000 widows and orphans living on 34/- a week and 65,000 living on home assistance.  What standard of living have those people?  Senator McGuire referred to the cynicism in the country about the Dáil.  No wonder, when so many people in this country have only that standard of living.</P>
    <P>It was stated in the Dáil in 1934 that this country could support a population of 17,000,000 people.  The man who said that said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I stress that point and emphasise that fact, that we could keep 17,000,000 people at a higher standard of living than we have enjoyed before.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Since 1934, we have not reached 3,000,000 people.  What is wrong?  Is it not obvious to any man who wants to think about it that we are not in power, that we are not in authority? Is it not obvious that we are trying to function here as a Parliament?  What sovereign rights have we?  I will not waste the time of the House because there has been so much unreality spoken in the last six hours and so much trash spoken in the other House last week on the Vote on Account <Col N="1623" /> without any regard to the actual position. The time has arrived when all Parties in this country will have to get together to tell the people, who have not been given an opportunity of understanding, the truth about our money, how it is created, how it is put into circulation and the effect it has on the life of the people of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBergin" hpid="Mr. Bergin Mr. Bergin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bergin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is about time that we realised that the situation we find ourselves in at present with regard to our external assets and our adverse trade balance has been brought about, not by a spending spree, as most of the speeches here would lead one to believe, but by a reduction in the amount of goods we have been able to export to other countries.  Most of the speakers, including Senator O'Brien, gave the impression that it was because of the additional amount of money that was available to working people in particular that a greater additional amount of consumer goods had been bought and that, because those consumer goods were imported, our adverse balance of trade was upset.  That is not the position indicated by the figures.</P>
      <P>The real reason for this difficulty is that we have not been able to export as much as we did.  I was very pleased to hear Senator Cogan, in his speech, going back to the fundamental trouble, as I see it and as he sees it.  No matter what people think about him, Senator Cogan considers himself to be one of the leading people in agriculture in this country.  There are quite a lot of other people who believe that also, but Seantor Cogan admitted that it was the failure of agriculture, and not the failure of industry, that had brought us into the present situation.  Where I disagree with Senator Cogan is that he wanted to put all of the blame for that situation upon the Government. That is something that I completely disagree with, just as Senator Cogan would disagree if the workers in any particular industry became inefficient and if we claimed that it was necessary for the Government to pay them a subsidy to encourage them to work in an inefficient manner.  He would be the first to condemn that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1624" /> Fortunately for my case, that is not the position to-day, because in this year, which has proved to be such a bad one, workers in industry have produced more, whereas the farmers have produced less and exported less.  At the same time, the farmers are claiming increased prices for the work that they do.  I think if we keep that in our mind and if we could direct an appeal to the people concerned with agriculture from the top to the bottom to set that industry right; if, as Senator Cogan says, we could get the people concerned in agriculture to increase exports by 25 per cent., then we would be doing an awful lot more towards righting the balance of trade than can possibly be done by the import restrictions imposed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>This increase in our deficit happened in 12 months and was brought about by the inefficient way in which our major industry has been handled.  The remedy can be brought about by increased efficiency.  There is no other way that we can quickly remedy our trouble.  I am afraid, from the speeches that were made, and in particular having heard the recommendations made by Senator O'Brien, that instead of an improvement being brought about, we will have a disimprovement. I suppose it may be expected that import restrictions will reduce the amount of commodities that will be bought, but, as Senator O'Brien pointed out also, the only real cure is to produce more.</P>
    <P>Now the implication could be that working people should produce more, but you can get the same situation in another way.  If you reduce the number of people who are working and produce the same amount, it is the same as if there was a decrease in the efficiency of production.  That is what it amounts to.  In other words, if we have increased unemployment with the same industrial output, we will be worsening our situation instead of improving it. If the Minister takes the advice of Senator Guinness and Senator O'Brien, and, I think, Senator McGuire, and makes sure that the amount of money invested in capital enterprise by the Government is reduced, it must naturally mean that we will have an increase <Col N="1625" /> in unemployment which will also naturally mean an increase either in our unemployment figures here at home or an increase in emigration.</P>
    <P>Now, it might be thought, if we take a short view of it, that if a person emigrates, he is not a drag on the State to the same extent as he would be if he stopped at home and drew unemployment benefit.  That might be so, but we have to recognise that, in the present state of our economy here, we have, perhaps, the largest percentage of non-producing people of any nation in Europe.  When we consider the very high percentage of old age pensioners we have in relation to our productive workers and, at the same time, the very high percentage of people in the too-low age for production&mdash;in the age up to 16&mdash;we can realise that the people who are producing, particularly in industry, would want to produce with extreme efficiency to get anything like the overall balance, or the appearance of efficiency, that can be got in countries where you have a greater equality between the producing and the non-producing sections.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be very careful not to take the advice of those conservative thinking people, and we must try to maintain the present capital development works and spend the same amount of money and give the same employment as at present.  If the trend that is apparent in the building industry continues&mdash;some letting off has already taken place and it looks as if we are going to have a reduction in the employment content in that industry&mdash;then we will not have any improvement; instead we will have a very much worse picture.  In this city already, you can see it very plainly.  If there are people living in one of our housing estates and if they are working this week and laid off next week, their costs are immediately increased, so that the reduction in employment by the amount available for capital work is absolutely no cure at all.  The only real cure is to do what one Senator said, to make our agricultural industry produce 25 or 50 per cent. more than it has been producing in recent times.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to <Col N="1626" /> make one or two references to some of the speeches that have been made.  I should like to draw the minds of the members of the House back to what Senator Hawkins said about an increase in the interest rate.  Senator Hawkins described the progress of this Government as a series of gambles, and he said the first gamble was the gamble to keep the interest rate here lower than the interest rate in Britain. I think that everybody in the House would agree with Senator O'Brien that it would have been a very good thing had it been possible to maintain that interest rate at the lower level, and I feel that Senators would agree with me that the Government got very little help in that matter. Surely it is one of the tragedies of Irish life to-day that, when a thing is right, it must be derided and an attempt made to destroy it.  At that time, when the Government was trying to do something that was admittedly extremely difficult, an ex-Minister of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Childers at present, went to his constituency and there made a statement that was widely publicised in which he asked the depositors here to transfer their deposits from this part of the country to the banks in another island.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBergin" hpid="Mr. Bergin Mr. Bergin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bergin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the statement of Senator Hawkins that one Minister of this Government, who was now very anxious to have an extension in industry and who was appealing to industrialists to produce more and work better and so on, at one time would have had them behind bars.  I might say that that Minister to whom he referred, as far as I know, did not say that punishment was due to industrialists, but to profiteers.  Just as Senator Hawkins said that he was not including all the hire-purchase people in his description of them to-day, so the Minister in this regard was referring to a small section of industrialists who were profiteering at that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He talked also about the endeavours to get foreign capital into this country. Surely, in the present state of our development, it is a laudable thing to seek to get foreign capital into this country: and surely Senator Hawkins would not  <Col N="1629" /> was also anxious to have both American and Canadian capital invested in this country in his time.  I have a note that Senator Douglas mentioned a custom, if you like to call it that, that is observed when cattle are being shipped to the Continent.  Senator Douglas said that this was a trade union arrangement or trade union agreement. I am sure he said that in all good faith, but, as a matter of fact, it is not so.  The practice is not one that is enforced by any trade union.  It is a custom that has grown up between the drovers and the farmers and must be dealt with by them.  No union enforces a restrictive practice such as the Senator described.</P>
    <P>He said it would be far better if they could have those men gainfully employed, whether on the docks or somewhere else.  That is the kernel of the whole trouble.  That is what leads to the restrictive practices in the trade unions about which Senator McGuire complains.  It is very hard to expect a man to work himself out of a job, while, as Senator Hickey says, we have 70,000 already unemployed.  It is not much use talking about giving gainful employment to 30 or 40 dockers if we have 70,000 already unemployed and for whom we can find nothing to do and to whom we can give nothing to produce. How can it be held that we could possibly find gainful employment for those people in the circumstances?</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire complained also about restrictive practices and he appealed for better understanding between workers and employers.  In a situation where you have full employment, it is quite easy, as can be seen from Britain and America, to get workers and employers together to plan more efficient output and produce more, but where you have men who are all the time looking at the end of their jobs, it is not at all so easy.</P>
    <P>I remember reading one night not a very deep study on economics, but Mutt and Jeff in the <i>Evening Herald.</i> Jeff was painting a wall and Mutt said to him: &ldquo;If you had twice as big a brush, you could do twice as much work.&rdquo;  Jeff replied: &ldquo;There is not twice as much work to do.&rdquo;  That, unfortunately, <Col N="1630" /> is the position in which we find ourselves as workers in this country. If we can produce the same amount with fewer workers, then we will have more workers unemployed.</P>
    <P>Something has to be done to create industries to give employment and until we get full employment, we cannot be said to be making the best use of our assets.  Senator McGuire impressed on us that it is necessary to have profits available in order to have industry, but I would point out that there are no profits in the E.S.B. or in Bord na Móna, and both of these industries are run extremely well and both give a great deal of gainful employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to enter into some of the controversies raised in the course of this debate. Quite frankly, I do not consider myself qualified to argue on most of them, but I feel that, in an important discussion of this type, it is the duty of every member of the House to make some suggestion, if possible a suggestion that might help to solve some of the difficulties with which we are faced.</P>
      <P>It is apparent even to me that, as a nation, we are experiencing a little of the withering blast of the conditions which, regardless of their causes, are quite clearly bedevilling the economic situation and the economic health of many countries throughout the world at the present day.  I doubt very much that, with the best will in the world, we could hope to escape the full consequences of what is occurring all round us in the world at present.  I must say that my sympathy is with the Government of the country who are primarily responsible for the economic health of this country of ours and with the responsible Minister who must be answerable to the country for the condition of affairs under those conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to say that I agree with the general consensus of opinion that the main increase in the Estimates we are discussing is apparently due to the fact that whether we like it or not, we have to meet an increased bill for salaries and for the maintenance of essential services.  We will have to <Col N="1631" /> continue to meet that bill in the coming 12 months.  I hope the Opposition, in their criticism of the Estimates, will not suggest that these increases were not necessary and were not essential in order to maintain the living standards of the people for whom we are responsible.</P>
    <P>Like most of the other Senators who spoke, I listened this evening with very great interest and considerable profit, I must say, to Senator O'Brien. Senator O'Brien's address was most instructive to many of us, but I should like merely to make this comment on one of the points he made, that is, that, as far as I am personally concerned, at any rate, he has not quite convinced me that we should continue to follow, as we appear to have been doing now for so many years, every fluctuation and every whim of the English banks, and that we in this country should accept as inevitable ever rise and fall of the bank rates in England as automatically applying to the conditions in this country.  I should like, of course, to hear a good deal more on that particular point, if possible, from Senator O'Brien.  I hope on another occasion, perhaps, he will give us the benefit of his experience and his very wide knowledge of that subject, because we could hardly have a better authority to enlighten and educate us on these matters.</P>
    <P>I should like especially to refer to one item in the Estimates, and that is in the Estimate for the Central Statistics Office which appears on page 10 in the Book of Estimates.  From the figures set out there, I noticed that the Estimate for this particular Department shows a net increase for the coming year of some £41,620.  It struck me, just glancing through the book&mdash; I have only been able to do that much so far&mdash;that there was something rather peculiar in an experience which I had in dealing with this Department quite recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not propose to talk about that.  I simply wanted to raise a question.</P>
      <P>I have here in my hand one of the publications of this Department which, as far as I am aware, has been published regularly by the Statistics Department, I think, up to about two years ago.  It is the return of all insurance companies operating in this country.  In fact, it is a report setting out by way of summary a statement of all insurance business deposited with the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Insurance Companies Act for certain years.  The last year for which this return is available is the year ended 31st December, 1953.  I had experience over the past 12 months of sending to the Stationery Office for this return.  I was told last year, that although it was published, it was no longer available: it was out of print. Within the past week or two I sent to the Stationery Office again and I was told it had now ceased publication of this return.  The return is important to a number of people in the country and in particular to a number of people in the institute with which I am concerned, inasmuch as it publishes details of the export from this country of a sum in excess of £10,000,000 per year by way of insurance premiums to foreign insurance companies operating here.  I should like to ask a question, if I am in order in doing so.  Is there any significance in the fact that, at a time like this when we are concerned with this problem of our balance of payments, an important return dealing with such a considerable amount of money going out of the country, such as this return has dealt with over a number of years, is now withheld from the people?</P>

      <P>I took it that a publication of that kind would be from the Statistics Office or the Stationery Office&mdash;one or the other.  However, it struck me as peculiar that, at a time like this when we are dealing with this problem, here is an important return dealing with a very large sum of money going out of the country every year, and in which detailed information is given, that is no longer available.  If the Minister is not in a position to deal with that query, I shall understand.</P>

      <P>Apart from that, I believe that, in the circumstances of the time, the Estimates cannot obviously have come as a terrible shock or surprise to anybody.  The Minister is to be congratulated at least in one respect, namely, that he has confined the import levies in this particular Bill to a wide range of either luxury or semi-luxury consumer goods.  In my opinion, that is a better and healthier policy than to make it more difficult for the ordinary plain people of the country to purchase the essential goods which they have to depend on to live. I feel satisfied the Minister is pursuing a reasonable policy&mdash;one which I am afraid we must put up with whether we like it or not&mdash;and I think he deserves the sympathy and support of the House in that respect.</P>

      <P>I am in thorough agreement with one statement made by Senator Cogan.  He said we should have a sense of fair play and of Christian charity.  I, also, should like to see that practised in this House. When Senator Cogan is speaking here, he should tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  The last thing the members of the Opposition should refer to is the cost of living. Senator Cogan said the cost of living increased by over 17 points during the inter-Party Government's term in office.  I want to give him the true figures.  In 1948, the cost of living stood at 99 points.  In 1951, before Fianna Fáil came into power, it stood at 103 points.  That represented an increase of four points.  Fianna Fáil then came into office.  When they were leaving office in 1954 the cost of living stood at 126 points.  Therefore, it increased 23 points while Fianna Fáil were in office.  Since then, unfortunately, it has gone up to 131 points.  During the inter-Party Government's years of office the cost of living increased only by seven points, whereas during Fianna Fáil's reign&mdash;during Fianna Fáil's three years of office&mdash;the cost of living increased by 23 points.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of the measures taken by the Minister to deal with the problem that confronts this country at the present time.  I do not agree with the measures that were taken by Fianna Fáil in their drastic Budget of 1952, when they had to deal with a similar problem.  The present measures affect goods which the people can do without. Fianna Fáil should remember that, in 1952, to deal with a similar case and a similar situation in this country, the loaf was sent up from 6½d. to 9½d.&mdash; an increase of 3d.; flour went up from 2/8 a stone to 4/9½&mdash;an increase of 2/1½; butter went up from 2/10 to 4/2 a lb.&mdash;an increase of 1/4; the inter-Party Government have taken it down by 5d. a lb. since they came into office. Tea was sent up from 2/8 to 5/6 a lb. &mdash;an increase of 2/10.  Sugar was sent up from 4/- to 7/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before Senator Hawkins leaves this House I would remind him that, when he is shedding crocodile tears over people about to be wed, it would be <Col N="1635" /> much better if they were to do without perhaps washing machines or prams for a year or two than to have to do without flour, butter, tea and sugar.  Senator Cogan referred to a reckless campaign that was carried on by the inter-Party Government.  A reckless campaign is being carried on and has been carried on for the past few months by the Fianna Fáil Party.  We all know that had the price of cattle remained as it was we would not be confronted with the present problem. We also know that the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fianna Fáil news organ have tried to down the price of cattle <Col N="1636" /> for the past three or four months.  Day after day in their paper they state: &ldquo;Cattle Down £10 per Head,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cattle Down £15 per Head&rdquo;.  The Minister, thanks be to God, has been proved right when he said early in April that cattle would go over £6 per cwt.  In the Dublin cattle market to-day cattle were up by 7/6 per cwt. and store cattle made up to £7 per cwt.  We are all delighted with that, but we know the people on the Opposition Benches do not like it.</P>
