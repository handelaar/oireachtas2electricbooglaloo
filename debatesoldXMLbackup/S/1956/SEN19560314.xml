      <P>I have received notice from Senator McHugh that on the motion for the adjournment of the House to-night, he proposes to raise the question on the following matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To call the attention of the Government to the sharp conflict of opinion, regarding the proposed new municipal buildings at Wood Quay, between the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland and Dublin Corporation, and, in view of consequent public uneasiness concerning the project, to suggest Government mediation in the matter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am accepting that notice and the matter will be taken from 9.30 p.m. to 10 p.m., or earlier if the business for the day concludes.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether it has been <Col N="1330" /> considered that any conditions, other than those appearing here, might be insisted upon in relation to any given company applying for relief under this Bill.  I want to ask the Minister whether any company, without exception, will get this kind of concession, or whether there is any discretionary power on the part of the Minister in view of certain agreements with companies.  In other words, has it been considered that there might be a limitation of applications at ministerial discretion, or is that within the Minister's power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to suggest a point once more to the Minister.  The Minister told us on the Second Stage that the question really had not been gone into as to whether it might be possible for us to be allowed to buy the copper concentrate from the mines in Avoca, and to arrange for the smelting of that concentrate elsewhere than in Canada. Since the Minister made it clear that that matter had not been contemplated or fully gone into, I wonder would he be prepared to say now that, with the company involved, he would be prepared to consider the question. He told us that the company had agreed to allow us to buy the refined copper derived from these concentrates but the point that seems to me to be at least worthy of exploration is whether, if these concentrates, coming from our mines, are shipped all the way to Canada and afterwards the refined copper is then shipped back <Col N="1331" /> home from Canada to here, even if we are given the opportunity of buying it then, whether, as it seems to me, it might not possibly be more economical were it to prove possible to make arrangements to buy the concentrates themselves at favourable pit-head prices, before any transport costs were added, with the possibility of our getting them smelted somewhere closer than Canada.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the point that, with the return of the refined copper from Canada, we would be certain of the supply and he stressed the fact&mdash; I think, fairly&mdash;that the company in question was prepared to allow us to take a considerable proportion of copper in this way; but I would suggest that the certainty of the supply would be at least equally guaranteed, if we were supplying the concentrates to a smelting firm somewhere else in some nearer country&mdash;Sweden and Britain were mentioned&mdash;and that our supply, derived on the &ldquo;drawback&rdquo; system from our own copper concentrates, would be equally guaranteed. The reason I mention it now is that it would seem to me to be a pity if these possibilities were not even to be explored.</P>
      <P>The Minister admitted that he had no information as to whether there were excess smelting facilities in Sweden or in Britain.  All I am asking now is that he might perhaps be prepared to have the matter looked into, either through the Department of Industry and Commerce or through some other channel&mdash;the possibility of its being perhaps a more economic proposition for us to buy the concentrates at pit-head prices than to have to buy the refined copper after it has gone all the way to Canada and come back to us here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I do not understand exactly what Senator Sheehy Skeffington means.  The price of copper is a world price and, whether it is cheaper to bring the concentrate from Avoca to Canada and get it smelted there, or cheaper to bring the concentrate from Avoca to Britain and get it smelted there, is a matter that does not govern the world price of the <Col N="1332" /> refined copper that would affect us, in so far as the price is concerned. What we were interested in was to make quite certain that, in any position in which there was difficulty of supply, the amount of copper that we could possibly require would be available for our use.</P>
      <P>As far as the question of price is concerned, it does not matter to us whether it is smelted in Canada, or in Britain, or in Sweden.  The only way that I would possibly think we could gain any advantage there would be if it were possible to get it smelted here; but the cost of installing a smelter is very, very large indeed, probably&mdash;I am not giving this as any firm estimate anything from £2,500,000 to £3,000,000, and I do not know whether the supply would be sufficiently regular to meet the economic capacity.  I doubt in some ways if it would; in other ways, it might.</P>
      <P>One must remember this in relation to the question of smelting: people who have smelters start with their smelting capacity and work back, so to speak, from that to their mining activities, and I have no doubt that one of the things at the back of these people's minds at the time they were considering mining in Avoca was that they would be able to integrate it with their smelting programme.  On the Senator's suggestion, they would not be able to do that and I can quite well see that, on that basis, there might be objections from their point of view.  Equally, from our point of view, I cannot see any difference in price.</P>

      <P>It may be a little unreasonable to &ldquo;jump&rdquo; him on it.  If so, he has only to say so and perhaps we could raise it on another occasion.  It is a question that disturbs the minds of a good many people. Could he tell us under this section what are the powers of customs officers in dealing with the importation of books that are part of the personal baggage of a traveller?  I know it may be unreasonable to ask that question now, but it is a question that comes up again and again, and we have not the opportunity which is available in the other House of raising these questions. If the Minister could see his way to give an outline of the answer, I think many would be grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear what the Senator has in mind, quite frankly.  Is it the Senator's anxiety that the Revenue Commissioners have <Col N="1334" /> discretion as to what statutes they implement and what statutes they do not implement?  If that is his anxiety, the position is clear enough that the customs authorities have power to implement all statutes which prohibit importation, whether revenue or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>We know of cases where books were actually taken from the personal baggage of travellers and seized by customs officials.  It is sometimes rather hard to know on what grounds they have done that.  Could the Minister enlighten us, or would it be too complicated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Senator referring to books on the list of books banned by the Censorship Board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to books in general, but, since the Minister raises the point, I should like to know whether the customs officers have any right to anticipate the decisions of the Censorship Board in any way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the position in respect of that is quite clear.  The customs authorities act under the law as it has been enacted here.  If a book is on a list, it is quite clear that its importation is prohibited and the customs officers must operate accordingly. Apart from that, as well as I can recollect&mdash;I am speaking, not so much as Minister for Finance, as from a recollection I had in another capacity on another occasion&mdash;there is another Act dealing with books which can be described as obscene.  The police authorities and the customs officers would have powers under that Act which would govern publications which are not the subject of an exact list. Equally, they would have power in respect of printed articles coming in which were the subject of a certain announcement I made in another place yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of what the Minister has said, perhaps I should come to the kernel of the question and ask if the customs officers have discretionary powers in this <Col N="1335" /> matter to decide what would come under the Acts against obscene literature or not, or must they consult others before they make what seems to be sometimes a snap decision in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is dealt with under the ordinary condemnatory powers of the Revenue Commissioners and on whose behalf customs officers act.  There are in respect of books not merely of the type the Senator has in mind, but of articles that are suspected of being brought in, certain provisions by virtue of which customs officers have power to detain, and there is a procedure, after detention, by which notice must be given to the importer, and, in the event of objection, there is a procedure under which those objections can be resolved subsequently.</P>

      <P>The only thing that I would like to say on that is that the word &ldquo;register&rdquo; is defined earlier in <Col N="1336" /> the interpretation section as meaning &ldquo;the Register of Ophthalmic Opticians&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Register of Dispensing Opticians&rdquo;, so that in the definition to which the Senator has put an amendment &ldquo;registered optician&rdquo; means a person registered in the register of ophthalmic opticians or in the register of dispensing opticians.

I am not too happy about entrusting the prescribing of contact lenses to persons other than ophthalmic surgeons.  I should like to direct the Minister's attention to the fact that the technique of selecting contact lenses is a very delicate piece of work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I can say with regard to that is that at the moment, if contact lenses were not included in the Bill, anybody&mdash;not necessarily an ophthalmic optician but a blacksmith&mdash;could fit contact lenses, if he got somebody foolish enough to go to him.  Contact lenses are included in the Bill so that they can be fitted, under the supervision of the board, by a registered optician or a medical practitioner. I think that adds to the safety of the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (b), lines 38 and 39, to delete &ldquo;also a pharmaceutical chemist or dispensing chemist and druggist&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;a dispensing optician&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1337" /> Perhaps it would facilitate the House if I discussed amendments Nos. 2 and 3 together&mdash;the amendment to Section 9 and the amendment to Section 10. Amendment No. 3 reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In sub-section (1), line 13, to delete &lsquo;by registered opticians&rsquo; and, in line 14, after &lsquo;board&rsquo; to add &lsquo;The registered dispensing optician referred to in sub-section (2), paragraph (b) of this section shall be elected by voters composed only of those on the dispensing register.  The remaining five members referred to in sub-section (2), paragraph (a) of this section shall be elected by registered opticians&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These amendments have been tabled because, as the Minister himself stated, in setting up this board his object is that no group or combination of groups shall gain control of the statutory board, especially in view of the sharp divergence of opinion on optical matters and policy that exists within the profession.  For this reason, in determining the composition of the board, dispensing chemists have been grouped with ophthalmic surgeons or oculists on the grounds of the past liaison between the two groups, and four seats have been allocated to the surgeons and one to the dispensing opticians. The remainder of the statutory board is to be composed of five ophthalmic opticians and one neutral ministerial nominee.</P>
    <P>We all approve of what the Minister has in mind in giving fair representation to all groups on this board and endeavouring to ensure that no one group will, so to speak, control it. There is, however, a certain amount of disquiet amongst the members of the profession of dispensing opticians.  They feel that, while they are more than satisfied with the fact that it is the Minister's wish and intention to allot them one seat on this board, in view of the proposed amalgamations that are taking place between other groups engaged in the profession, in actual working it may turn out that, as the elections to the board would be held, they might lose this seat.  It is for this purpose, and for this purpose alone, to endeavour, so to speak, to <Col N="1338" /> copperfasten what the Minister intends, that Senator McGuire and I are proposing this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench O'Carroll Dr. ffrench O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to associate myself with Senator Crosbie and Senator McGuire in this amendment, because, when speaking on the Second Stage, I pointed out to the Minister that I felt there was a danger in the manner in which the board was being set up that the dispensing opticians might, in certain circumstances, lose the representation which he intended to give them under the Bill.  The difficulty, it would seem to me, is that we want to ensure that a true dispensing optician will be in a position to gain the representation he is entitled to under the Bill rather than a dispenser who would be allied by membership to the Ophthalmic Opticians' Association, because we must remember that if we have a register composed of ophthalmic opticians and dispensers allied by membership to that group, it is quite obvious that a dispensing optician might not be able to secure membership of the board.</P>
      <P>Very wide powers have been given to this board, some of which we will come to discuss later, and I am sure the Minister would be as anxious as we are that representation should be as wide and as truly democratic as possible.  Therefore, I think this is a very fair amendment, to take further steps to ensure that we have what I might call a true dispensing optician rather than a dispenser allied to the Association of Ophthalmic Opticians, and that the ophthalmic opticians would be put in on their own feet rather than on the dispensing optician's vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first amendment, which is to Section 9 of the Bill, that amendment, if passed, would make sub-paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) read: &ldquo;Before the establishment day, the Minister shall appoint six persons each of whom is an optician and at least one of whom is a dispensing optician&rdquo;.  That would be substituted for the sub-section which as proposed at the moment, reads: &ldquo;Six persons each of whom is <Col N="1339" /> an optician and at least one of whom is also a pharmaceutical chemist or dispensing chemist and druggist&rdquo;. Under the proposed sub-section, the pharmaceutical chemist or dispensing chemist and druggist must be a registered optician under the Bill, and there is power later on in the Bill to provide for registration of such persons.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, it is open at the moment, under the section as it stands, to me, as Minister, to appoint a dispensing optician to the first board and accordingly, there is not any need for the amendment, unless it is desired to make it mandatory on the Minister to appoint a dispensing optician, and I do not think that is necessary.  I fully intend to appoint a dispensing optician on the first board.  I have the power and intend to do it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second amendment, which relates to the second and subsequent boards, that is, the boards that will be elected, I feel that it is not necessary, either.  The elections under Section 10 must be conducted in accordance with election rules, and it is mandatory on the board to make election rules which must be approved by the Minister.</P>
      <P>As I understand the sense in which the amendment is moved, it is this, that there is a fear that, by reason of numbers, the ophthalmic opticians could secure by some way all the seats on the board, or certainly influence all the seats on the board, provided, of course, that one of the members of the board must be a dispensing chemist. As I gather, there is a fear that through their numbers the ophthalmic opticians might influence the member of the board who would be a dispensing optician.  In fact, I think the position is likely to be the reverse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the information available to me at the moment, which I concede is not accurate, but which is the latest I have, there are likely to be 140 registered ophthalmic opticians and 170 registered dispensing opticians.  Accordingly, it would seem to me inevitable that the dispensing opticians, who have a smaller membership on the board, because, largely speaking, they are <Col N="1340" /> part-time, but who nevertheless are entitled to vote just the same as the ophthalmic opticians, are more likely to influence membership of the board than the minority of ophthalmic opticians.  Certainly it seems to me inevitable that the majority section on the register would be in a position to elect a person whom they desire to elect when they have one seat out of five reserved for them.</P>
    <P>Accordingly I do not think that there is any need for the amendment, and, furthermore, I feel there is a danger that the amendment, if accepted by the House, might bring about an undesirable situation.  I am aware, as I have already told the House, that there is a jockeying for position by those interested in the matter dealt with by this Bill.  If that were continued for any length of time, the purpose of the Bill might well be destroyed by this vying amongst the different interested groups.  I feel that if the registers are to be split up for election purposes, as is proposed in this amendment, the present divisions will be perpetuated, until perhaps it becomes necessary to amend the Bill later on.</P>
    <P>The best way to provide against perpetuation of divisions is to allow the elections to proceed as provided for in the Bill, with five members of the board who must be ophthalmic opticians, and in these elections we have to have regard to the fact that 170 of the people concerned are dispensing opticians.  The board, when established, will work in the interests of all sections, and not of any one section. Accordingly I cannot accept the amendment.  I appreciate the reasons which prompted the movers, but I think the first amendment is unnecessary, and the second also unnecessary and possibly undesirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench O'Carroll Dr. ffrench O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite appreciate what the Minister says, that the first amendment is unnecessary, but I am not quite satisfied with his explanation in regard to the second amendment, because it seems obvious that certain ophthalmic opticians and the dispensing opticians who come within this Bill can be more powerful than the group of dispensing opticians. <Col N="1341" /> In practice, we could have dispensing opticians working on their own, and we could have other dispensers who are allied by their membership with the ophthalmic opticians and who are, for instance, working as assistants to ophthalmic opticians.  It would seem that such a dispensing optician, with backing from the ophthalmic opticians and from a group of dispensing opticians, could secure election to the board as a dispensing optician.</P>
      <P>I do feel that when we are passing legislation of this nature, we must take account of the worst possible position, and, in circumstances such as I have outlined, a dispensing optician could, with the backing of ophthalmic opticians, be elected to this seat as the representative of the dispensing opticians. We should see that the dispensing opticians get a fair representation, and I think the splitting of the register for that purpose would be a fair thing to do in all the circumstances.  It is the only way to preserve the identity of the dispensing opticians.</P>

      <P>I agree with what Senator Cox has said.  I feel that the words &ldquo;registered ophthalmic optician&rdquo; should be the words in the amendment, if you are going to split the register, and it is only the registered ophthalmic opticians who should have the right to elect the five people who are to be the ophthalmic opticians' representatives on the board.</P>

      <P>There is just one matter which I intended to explain when speaking.  The phrase &ldquo;splitting the register&rdquo; has been used.  The position, under Section 10, is as I have already explained, that the election will <Col N="1342" /> be conducted in accordance with rules which will be drawn up by the board and which will have to be submitted to the Minister.  If they are approved, the first election and other elections will be conducted in accordance with these rules.  Under the Bill as it stands, it is open to the board, if it so desires, to conduct the elections in the manner suggested by the amendment, but that, I feel, should be the function of the board.  I do not think it should be written into the Bill.  I do not think that it is desirable that it should be because that would create a situation in which the board will be composed of three watertight compartments and the kind of divisions which I have mentioned will be perpetuated. It might well be that the first board, when the growing pains have subsided, might decide to hold the elections in the manner suggested by the amendment. It is in accordance with their powers to do so and the best thing to do is to leave the system of election to themselves, rather than to propose something in the legislation setting up the board.  Accordingly, for that and for the other reasons I have mentioned, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Arising out of what the Minister has said, I wonder whether under sub-section (1) of Section 10, the board would, in fact, have power to make rules of the nature which the Minister has suggested.  Sub-section (1) says that the election shall be by registered opticians.  I would be rather doubtful about the position, having regard to that sub-section.  Perhaps the Minister would consider the point?</P>

      <P>I do not want to delay the Minister too much on this amendment, but I wonder if he could give us some idea of the reason for his opposition to maintaining what he calls the &ldquo;three watertight compartments&rdquo;. I do not know his reasons for objecting to the three watertight compartments, or intimating that it might be better if they went.  I think it would be better if they were maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1343" /> If the dispensing optician does not succeed in establishing himself as far as this board is concerned, there is another thing that may happen which I do not think would be in the interests of the health of the public's eyes at all, and that is this question of what I might call the dispenser who is allied by membership to the Ophthalmic Opticians' Association.  I think I am right in saying that the ophthalmic opticians are at the moment organising a course and endeavouring to establish yet another type of medical ancillary in the present extraordinarily complicated position where so many different grades of people are involved. Surely it would not be in the interests of working this Bill satisfactorily that, for example, the dispenser&mdash;who is allied by membership to the ophthalmic opticians&mdash;should be established as yet another type of optician and that he should then be elected to the ophthalmic opticians and take the place of the dispensing opticians?</P>
    <P>Could the Minister give us some idea of why he thinks it would be better if these three groups of doctor, ophthalmic optician and dispensing optician were not maintained?  I think it would be in the interest of everybody concerned and of the best medical work to try to maintain that relationship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The success of this measure will depend upon the standards the first board can lay down and the abuses which I hope the board will deal with.  The first board will consist of 11 members&mdash;four medical practitioners, five ophthalmic opticians, one dispensing optician and a chairman who may or may not be a member of any group.  I hope that that board will be so constituted that it will be able impartially to consider, as the first board, the best way of carrying out its legislative functions under the legislation.  That board will lay down the election rules for future elections.  It will consider also the suggested qualifications put forward either by the ophthalmic opticians or any other group of opticians, and it will decide whether these qualifications will be recognised or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1344" /> Any group of opticians who think that merely by posing something to be a qualification now will lead to its automatic acceptance by the first board are greatly mistaken.  That board will have the statutory function of laying down, itself, the qualifications it will recognise and whatever qualifications it will adopt for the future.  That board will not be dominated by any interest, either by a combination of the dispensing opticians and the medical practitioners or by the ophthalmic opticians as against those other two groups.  I think that board will be able to function properly and will be able to give cothrom na Féinne to the three interests involved.</P>
    <P>I fear that if an amendment along the lines suggested were accepted, we would lay down as a sort of motto for the first board that there would be, all the time, three interests having very little in common, except their special interest in the subject of optics or the matter dealt with in the Bill. That would be undesirable.  In my view, the three interests are equally involved and equally interested.  They have a common purpose in ensuring that the standards aimed at by the Bill are established and they can only be established if they work together.</P>

      <P>The answer to the Senator's question is contained in sub-section 1.  The Minister can abolish the board only if he is satisfied they have not performed any of their statutory functions&mdash;any of the functions which they are required by the Act to perform. The reason for that is that it is never a very sound thing to keep a dog and bark yourself.  If the board do not do what they are supposed to do under the Act, then it is necessary to get a board that will.  The only way in which that can be done is to abolish the board that does not do what it is supposed to do.</P>

      <P>I think what the Senator says is so.  If the applicant or candidate has the statutory qualifications, the board, under Section 25, must register.  There is no question of suitability on other grounds, because the other grounds are not statutory grounds.  That is following the same pattern, I think, as in other similar statutes and probably it is felt that the question of general suitability is not a matter that should be considered in relation to a matter such as this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether there is, in fact, any such person, but it does appear to be clear that from the way it is drafted that a person who is not an Irish citizen, but who had occupied himself in this profession for the requisite period would be debarred from registration, although there is no limitation in the case subsequently of a person who holds the necessary qualifications, when the board is established and is being registered. Even if the amendment I suggest here were adopted, it would still remain <Col N="1347" /> that this person must, within the seven preceding years, have carried on the business of the profession within the State, so that in fact he would have been here.  He could not thus be applying for citizenship when the Bill is passed, because a qualification is that he is a citizen on the date the Bill is passed.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether there is any such person, but if there is such a person the effect of passing this Bill might be, without any fault on his part, of depriving him of his livelihood, and I think that is a point that the Minister ought to consider.  There is no limitation once the board starts operations, in the case of anyone who holds the necessary qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard to this matter can be put in this way: a non-citizen can be registered under Section 25 of the Bill, if he has undergone a course of training or passed certain examinations as will be recognised by the board.  The purpose of Section 25 is to ensure that the legitimate optician who, perhaps, has a qualification which is recognised in Great Britain, or elsewhere, and which the board to be established also recognises as being a suitable qualification can be registered under Section 25.  Again, under sub-section (1) of Section 26, a non-citizen can be registered, if he has qualifications inside the State that would be approved by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In setting up the board, the general purpose of the Bill is, of course, to establish standards for opticians, as well as to deal with the question of abuses.  The way in which that would be done is by specifying qualifications and holding examinations.  Obviously, that would be unfair, if it were applied immediately in respect of many opticians already carrying on business, who, by reason of their age perhaps, or other reasons, could not fairly be asked to sit for an examination, or to take out qualifications which perhaps they have not got.  Therefore, concessions are made under sub-section (2) of Section 26 to those who, over a period of seven years, have been carrying on, <Col N="1348" /> or who are able to show that for a period of seven years their principal means of livelihood was the carrying on of, the business of ophthalmic optician inside the State.</P>
    <P>That is a concession and I feel that, being a concession, there does not seem any reason why that concession should also be extended to non-citizens. It is a concession in respect of those who were citizens inside the State on the establishment date or, who for a specified number of years before, were carrying on the legitimate business of ophthalmic optician.  I cannot see any cogent reason why that concession should be extended to include non-citizens, particularly as I feel&mdash;I mentioned this on the Second Reading&mdash;that there will be a considerable number of non-citizens who, in the face of similar legislation in England in the future, may be tempted to come in here and to avail of any concessions that might be made. However, I have not any strong views on this.  Those are the reasons why the section is as it is at the moment in the Bill.  I felt that non-citizens were given a fair opportunity of qualifying or of registering and that the concessions that were made were rightly confined to citizens of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, I do not know whether there is any such person, but there well may be.  The point the Minister has made about people coming in from outside is, I think, not applicable, because the section expressly says that the person entitled must have done this work inside the State for the past five years, so that it would not be possible for someone to come in from outside now and, at the same time, be qualified under it. The Minister speaks of this being a concession.  In a sense, I suppose it is a concession, but, if the so-called concession were not made to citizens of the State, obviously those citizens would at once be deprived of their livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would again submit that a very grave injustice may be done, if there are such persons who have been working here perhaps for a number of years and have been honestly making their living, and it would certainly do a <Col N="1349" /> great injustice not to allow them on the register, if certain other people were allowed on if they had the qualifications. I ask the Minister to reconsider it.  Probably very few people are affected.</P>

In that case, qualifications were prescribed, but persons teaching for a number of years were allowed on the register.  I was going to suggest that, if there were not many people involved, it would be simpler to accept the amendment.

      <P>Under the Bill, the board has power, as a disciplinary matter, to remove the name of a person from the register.  In other professions, a similar disciplinary body is sometimes given power to say that a person should be temporarily suspended.  It would seem to me that a disciplinary body should have power, in addition to power to deprive a person of his profession for all time, to suspend him for a year or two years, or something like that, which would be a punishment and a deterrent.  I would ask the Minister to agree to give this board powers similar to those held by other professional bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard to the Senator's amendment, as I see it, is that I do not think it is necessary.  The Bill does not deal with practice, as such.  The Bill says that only an optician registered can carry on the business of an optician, be he a dispensing or an ophthalmic optician. Registration gives the right to be in business.  Accordingly, it is not exactly the same as suspending a person by not finally dealing with him.  The board, under Section 29, may remove the name of a person from the register, and, under Section 31, the board may restore that person's name to the register the following week.  For the period he is off the register, he is not permitted to carry on his business and I should imagine that the board, as the thing will work out, will say: &ldquo;We <Col N="1351" /> took so and so off a month ago; I think he has learned his lesson and now we will put him back again.&rdquo; That, in effect, meets the sense of the Senator's amendment.  Under other codes, he would be suspended from practising for a definite period during which he could not practise.  Here, during the period of his removal from the register, he is unable to carry on his business, but the removal may be only temporary, and it does not mean it would be a permanent removal.  I think it is very hard in respect of a board of this kind, where the carrying on of the business concerned depends on registering and continued registration, to apply the rules which, perhaps, apply to the legal profession and other similar professions.</P>
      <P>For those reasons, I do not think it is necessary.  I think the board have the right under Section 29, read with Section 31, to take a person off for such a short period as would constitute a lesson rather than a complete putting out of business.  I think that is what is intended by the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate what the the Minister has said, but I have experience myself of sitting on disciplinary bodies, and, in a borderline case, anyone sitting on such a body is always very reluctant to go to the extreme, whereas if some minor penalty could be imposed, he might be prepared to enforce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know nothing about the opticians' profession, but my impression is that the Minister is now going in to clean up a sort of Augean stable.  If that is so, I think that any disciplinary board would like to have the power to impose a temporary suspension and would hesitate very often to punish, where it meant complete removal.  I fully understand that there would always be the possibility of getting back on to the register.  I think that striking off a register should be regarded almost as a solemn act.  If it were regarded too lightly and the general idea was: &ldquo;I am struck off to-day and, in six months' time, I will be back again,&rdquo; that would take away from the force of what was being done.  Possibly the Minister, between now and Report <Col N="1352" /> Stage, will consider the matter.  I think, with great respect, there is some substance in the amendment.  The power would not have been given in other professions to impose these minor penalties, if it had not been felt that it was a good thing, having regard to what human nature is.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Bill as drawn, an appeal is given against erasure from the register, but it is provided that that appeal can be either to the High Court or the Minister, but not, of course, to both. I would submit that the appeal should always be to the High Court.  I do not know whether the Minister has considered this, but I suggest that it is quite possible, particularly in view of a case which I understand is at present pending in the Supreme Court, that it might be held that, unless there were an appeal to the High Court, the whole provision as to disciplinary powers might be contrary to the Constitution. In the case of every other provision, the appeal has to lie to the High Court, and I would suggest that it would be an alarming precedent, and I am quite certain one that the Minister himself would not very greatly enjoy, that appeals as to whether a name had or had not been rightly struck off the register should go to the Minister and not to the court.  I understand the whole tenor <Col N="1353" /> of decisions of the court in other professions where there are appeals to the court is that the court is very slow to interfere with the judgment of the professional body, and I am quite certain the same principle should apply to opticians, so I would like to move that the appeal should be to the High Court and not to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if this is actually the first case of this kind.  I think that there were other cases previously where an appeal would lie either to the Minister or to the court, and it is just possible, I presume, that a person might prefer an appeal to the Minister rather than to the court, from the point of view of expense.  If the appeal to the court is left optional to the person concerned, it appears to me that, if you take it that the Minister was doing something detrimental to the appellant, the person being struck off the register could desire to make an appeal to the court. Senator Cox will agree that the decision of the courts, which may reach the Supreme Court eventually, on whether or not particular professional tribunals are constitutional, does not affect this particular section.  While I myself have always been in favour of appeals to the court, the section does appear to give an option to the person who might not like to have the expense of going to the High Court and who might prefer to go to the Minister. From that point of view, it does not seem to do any harm to or to take from the jurisdiction of the court, because it leaves the courts there for anybody who wants to resort to them. The real objection to many of these provisions is where they prevent a person going to the courts, but this particular section, as drafted, does not do that.</P>

      <P>I should like, with respect to Senator Hayes, to say that I agree that going to the court might involve a certain amount of expense.  In this country, there is no poor persons' assistance, but, on the other hand, I have never heard of a poor person who was not able to get justice.  It has always been the practice, both of the Bar and of the solicitors' profession, to <Col N="1354" /> assist such persons in a proper way.  I do not think there is very much point in that.  But, on the general question, I think the precedent of substituting the decision of a Minister on a judicial point is one which is a very grave one. As far as I can understand it, in Communist countries, all justice seems to be administered by referring the matter to civil servants to decide.  One of the great distinctions between the two sets of countries is that, in the one case, all matters go to the courts, and, in the other case, they do not.  I am not, of course, suggesting that there is anything sinister in the Bill, but I suggest that this is a precedent which is not of a desirable nature.</P>

      <P>It is not a precedent; that is to say, it is not the first example.  There have been previous examples of appeals in the same sense.  I am surprised at Senator Cox pulling Communism out of the hat in this particular instance.  He places me in a difficulty when he tells me that of course the legal profession is very generous, because I have himself behind me and the Minister in front of me and Senator Walsh on the front bench, and a member of the legal profession in my own family, and I actually am a qualified legal person myself, although, thank God, I never found it necessary to practice.  I do, however, suggest that whatever the generosity may be, or the capacity, of the solicitors and barristers, any ophthalmic optician who has been removed from the register and has the right of appeal to the High Court will necessarily consider that it is going to cost him something, and going to the Minister might appeal to him more.  It seems to me that this widens the choice given to the person.  To say that an appeal to the Minister in this country and in our circumstances, as we have known it, is equivalent to, say, justice in Communist countries, is hardly up to Senator Cox's usual standard.</P>

      <P>I do not think anybody would doubt that it would be more desirable to have the appeal to the High Court than to the Minister. That is how I feel.  It is a little unfair that the Minister should be suggested <Col N="1355" /> because it is cheaper than going to the court.  I do not entirely agree with Senator Hayes, because I do not imagine that anybody will go to the High Court, unless he has a good chance of winning there, and if he has got a good chance, he does not have to worry about the expense.  I favour a decision of the High Court and would prefer that to an appeal to the Minister.  I take it from the sub-section that an aggrieved party can do both&mdash;can go to the courts also.</P>

      <P>That was the point I wanted to make.  If the person who is aggrieved did go to the Minister and felt that the Minister did not give him satisfaction, he would then have the opportunity of going to the court. That is not a new principle or a precedent in this country.  I think that, under the income-tax code, if one does not like the special commissioners, one can go to the court.  Maybe the Minister might consider that giving the person a right to go to the court if he felt aggrieved by the Minister might remove the objections which have been raised on this matter.</P>

      <P>If Senator Cox is right, then the proposal in the section is wrong and I do not want to say that any number of wrongs can make a right.  It is, however, proper, I think, that Senators should know that this proposal is not any Communist proposal put forward by me in this Bill.  It is a proposal that is already contained in the Midwives Act, 1944.  It is exactly similar and it is also similar to a provision included in the Nurses Act, 1950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that whatever may be said about the effect of the litigation which Senator Cox has mentioned, it may be that provisions of this kind will be found to offend the Constitution.  I do not know anything about that, but it does appear to me that it would be fatuous for the Oireachtas here to legislate on a whole series of &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; and &ldquo;ands&rdquo; and that, just because legislation is taking place in which a particular question is posed, we should <Col N="1356" /> in our legislation take that into consideration.</P>
    <P>If, in fact, this form of appeal to the Minister, or forms of appeal similar to it are found to be unconstitutional, then that is that and the law of the land will take its course.  The case for providing an alternative appeal such as this has already been put by Senator Hayes and other Senators: that a person affected by a decision of the board may not necessarily be a poor person. Senator Cox is right in saying that a poor person in our democracy here is not denied access to the courts and to certain persons practising law, but it is not the poor person to whom the costs of legislation might become a serious anxiety.  It is the person such as is dealt with in this Bill who may be carrying on a business which is his livelihood and who suddenly finds that livelihood taken from him.  That person, if Senator Cox's amendment is accepted, would be told: &ldquo;Well, it is too bad, but the only way to get it back is to proceed in the High Court of Justice&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That person, whether advised that his proceedings will succeed or not, will find himself driven by necessity into taking such proceedings which may, on the advice extended to him, not succeed.  Such a person, if he were not a poor person, undoubtedly could, in the example I have given, find himself involved in a considerable expenditure. I feel that it is only fair that there should be an alternative method of appeal open, without the costs involved.  It may be that that might not be as perfect a way of dealing with an appeal, but it will be quick and easy to go to the Minister.</P>
    <P>It will be remembered that in the other parts of the section, there is this encouragement to a person who feels quite genuinely that he has been badly or unreasonably treated by the board and who is strengthened in that belief by legal advice.  He has the right to go to the court and is encouraged to do so, because he knows that, from the judgment of the High Court, he can get compensation or costs, but if he goes to the Minister, even if he succeeds, he will not get any compensation.</P>
    <P>I feel therefore it is not profitable <Col N="1357" /> for the Oireachtas to consider a possible decision the Supreme Court might give in pending litigation. Similar provision, as I have already stated, has been provided in at least two other Acts, and perhaps even more often.  It provides an easy appeal for a person whose livelihood has been taken from him and the person can feel that he has a quick and easy way of having his complaint investigated, without a lot of costs, as would be involved in another form of litigation.</P>

      <P>This is a provision under which the subsidiary committee or the board may erase a name, and if an appeal lies with the courts, the court can award damages against the board or the committee for the loss which the person has contracted in the meantime. That, of course, appears to be very just in the case of a person deprived of carrying on his business by such action on the part of the board.  I believe, however, it is a very novel provision that the tribunal which has to pronounce a decision can render itself liable to damages, if it errs. Again, it does seem to me to be a rather dangerous precedent to adopt. I quite appreciate that, in certain circumstances, the result may be just but it seems to me that no such provision for compensation arises in any other similar case.  Therefore, I suggest it should be deleted from this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My view in regard to the Senator's amendment can, I think, be best put in this way.  I do not think the Senator is quite correct in saying that this is a novel precedent, because it, in fact, provides that, where a lower court, if you like, has erred in <Col N="1358" /> a decision, it can be made to compensate the person affected by the error it has made.  The sub-section does not provide that.  It provides that if the High Court is satisfied that the board acted in an unreasonable manner&mdash;and it will be a matter for judicial determination as to what is unreasonable &mdash;certain things may be done.  I should imagine that the court would be asked to consider whether any responsible board would have acted in the manner in which it did in the particular case it would be considering.</P>
      <P>If the board has behaved in an unreasonable manner in that connection and, by reason of the manner in which it behaved, has deprived a man of his livelihood, wrongly and unreasonably, then, and only then, can the court award such reasonable compensation as it thinks fit against the board.  It does not follow from that that, merely because the High Court disagrees with the view that the board came to as to the conduct involving the removal of the name of the man from the register, they would be entitled to invoke paragraph (d).  The court must be satisfied that there has been unreasonable conduct by the board before it can invoke that paragraph.  I think the paragraph is necessary.  I think there should be some sanction to prevent a board behaving in a way which would be injurious, but which can be quite malicious and quite wrong in relation to the unfortunate person who is affected.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question in connection with sub-section (4) (b).  Part of the sub-section reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where an appeal under this section to the Minister is successful&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) the board may, if they so think fit, pay to the appellant such sum as they consider reasonable compensation for any loss of practice <Col N="1359" /> sustained by the appellant between the decision of the board and the determination of the appeal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder what is the necessity for the words &ldquo;if they so think fit&rdquo;.  If it has been ascertained that the name of the person involved was removed from the register improperly, or without due consideration, one would imagine that it would be right that he should get compensation for his loss of practice, because of that error.  Why should any qualifying words of that nature be inserted in the sub-section?  Furthermore, I would ask the Minister what funds will the board have at their disposal to grant this compensation envisaged by this section of the Bill, or is it the Minister and his Department who will find the compensation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can answer the last question the Senator asked by saying &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  The funds, presumably, will be whatever funds the board get from their legitimate activities under the Bill.  They collect funds and a variety of revenue of that kind.  The reason why, under the sub-section the Senator mentioned, it is not mandatory on the board to give compensation where an appeal to the Minister is successful is that the issue as to whether the board has behaved reasonably or not is primarily a judicial question.  It is not a matter for the Minister, and, if the optician affected wants that determined, he must appeal to the High Court and invoke the court's jurisdiction under paragraph (d) of sub-section (3), to which I have already referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not any machinery available in my Department to consider matters of compensation or things of that kind.  However, where an appeal to the Minister is successful, then the board&mdash;if they feel they had perhaps acted on wrong grounds or on wrong information, or something of that kind, and had, as a result, unwittingly or unintentionally affected harshly an optician&mdash;might themselves on their own motion pay him compensation, but they could not be ordered to do so, unless the appeal had been brought to the High Court, and the High Court <Col N="1360" /> felt they had acted in the manner envisaged under paragraph (d).</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still not too satisfied with the position under this sub-section. The possible appeal that we have under discussion now is the appeal to the Minister.  Of course, as has already been stated, it would be the easier line of approach, I suppose. However, since the appeal is to the Minister, would it not then be right and proper that it should be left to the Minister to order that compensation be paid to the aggrieved person and that it should not be left then to the board? It is not being left to the board under the former section to fix the compensation for the aggrieved person.  Under the former section, it is the High Court &mdash;in other words, the tribunal to which the appeal is made.  But, in the second case, under this sub-section (4), paragraph (b), the tribunal this time is the Minister.  Why not give the power to that tribunal, rather than to the board, to fix the compensation, having regard to all the circumstances of the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would regard that as primarily a matter to be determined by the court.  It is a judicial matter.  I do not regard an appeal in the sense set out here as being a judicial matter. It is a matter of fact, largely, as to whether, on the facts set out, a person's name should be restored to the register or not.</P>
      <P>With regard to compensation and as to whether the board behaved in a reasonable manner or not, these are questions to be determined by a court. The procedure is set out in the section. If a person wants that determined and wants compensation as a matter of right, he can get it on order of the High Court, but not otherwise.  It would be quite an invidious system if we were to establish in the Department of Health a section to deal with the assessing of compensation and matters of that kind which are quite foreign to any Department.</P>

      <P>I take it the Minister would agree that an appeal, say, in a case under the Town Planning Acts from the council to the Minister for Local Government is a judicial function? <Col N="1361" /> I can see no difference between the hearing of an appeal such as is envisaged under this section and the hearing of one under the Town Planning Acts.  I am not quite sure what the procedure is in regard to the hearing that takes place before the Minister.  Is it a matter of an affidavit or is the Minister to hear oral evidence in this connection?  At any rate, I can see no difference between the hearing before the Minister and the hearing before the High Court as set out, because the applicant has the alternative of one or other of those two types of hearings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is quite a marked difference.  An appeal might be successful because the Minister might feel that it was a bit harsh on the facts to take a man off the register. That does not mean that the board was not fully entitled to come to the desision it came to.  The appeal would be successful on that ground.  It might also appear that, in an appeal to the Minister, the board had acted quite irresponsibly and had wronged the person in a very definite way.  Again, I think that is a matter that the Minister should only be allowed deal with by putting the person back on the register and reporting the facts to the board.  If the person injured had considered the question of compensation, that person could have gone to the High Court.  There is a decision open to him and the choice is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A third kind of appeal might exist in which the board unwittingly had acted on completely wrong information, information which, on later investigation, had been proved to have been wrong and incorrect, and the appeal would be successful.  The facts would be reported to the board and, if the optician had been injured in his livelihood for a certain period, the board might consider it reasonable in those circumstances to provide compensation for him, and they are entitled, and they have the power, to do it under the sub-section, on their own motion, when they consider it reasonable to do so.  I imagine they would consider it reasonable to do so only when they found that they had been led as a result of incorrect information, <Col N="1362" /> into taking a decision which otherwise they would not have taken. That is why that power is there and I think it is reasonable to have it in that way.</P>
    <P>On the question of dealing with the board for acting wrongly, that is a matter for the courts and the procedure is there at the option of the person injured and not at the option of anyone else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered that matter and perhaps I could answer the Senator in this way.  The board would have no power to register on the ophthalmic register an optician who was registered on the dispensing register. If, in fact, an inquiry of a damaging kind was taking place with regard to a person on the dispensing register, he would still be on that register and therefore could not be registered on the ophthalmic register.  So that, in fact, the fact that he is on the register is sufficient to prevent the abuses which the Senator has in mind.</P>

      <P>Section 48, sub-section (1), provides that a registered optician, who is not a registered medical practitioner, shall not on or after the appointed day, treat any disease of the eye.  These are matters which obviously require a very high degree of professional skill, but I would suggest that the Bill as it stands might leave it open to anyone to do any of these things, if he is not a registered optician.  The prohibition is merely on the registered optician and the amendment I am suggesting is that no one should be entitled to do these things, unless he is a registered practitioner.  In regard to the general practice of medicine, while a person must not hold himself out as being a registered medical practitioner, there is no prohibition on a person not qualified as a medical practitioner from practising medicine, if he chooses to do so at his own risk. When one proceeds to legislate definitely in respect of something which obviously should be done only by a registered medical practitioner, I suggest that the logical course to adopt would be to say that no person other than a registered medical practitioner should be entitled to do these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Senator has in mind.  Perhaps I might put it in this way: a registered optician by reason of his business is in a special relationship to a person with an eye condition.  His business puts the condition of the eye into the forefront. It is true that any person, with certain exceptions, can treat or purport to treat eye conditions.  It is not intended that they should be interfered with. After this Bill becomes law, the only group of persons in the country who <Col N="1364" /> will be prohibited from treating eye conditions will be registered opticians. Anyone else will be entitled to do it, because to attempt to prevent in a general way any person doing anything to the eye would lead in the end to the absurd situation in which a father could not put eyedrops into his child's eye, or a nurse in a hospital could not provide whatever treatment might be necessary in the way of providing drops for a patient's eye.  I do not think there need be any anxiety about that.</P>
      <P>There is not such a public danger in that as would warrant prohibitions, but there is a possibility of danger, if an optician is permitted to treat the condition of the eye because he is in a public position.  He is brought into a closer relationship, and, by reason of the business he carried on, the business itself might hold out the suggestion that he is qualified to treat conditions of the eyes which, of course, he is not qualified to do.  As Senator Cox says, the same position applies in relation to the practice of medicine. Anyone can proceed to treat any medical condition, if he can get a fool as a patient.  The only prohibition is that he cannot say he is a qualified person, that he is a medical practitioner, but he is quite entitled to do it and in fact quite a number of them do it, but, again, the section means that only registered opticians are prevented from doing this.  That is done for the obvious reason that, if they were permitted, with everybody else, to treat conditions of the eye, then the business they carry on could contain inevitably the suggestion that they were qualified medically to do what they are obviously not qualified to do. For that reason, I think the amendment would carry with it very serious consequences and I ask him, for the reasons I have mentioned, not to press it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" /> I move the deletion of this sub-section because, when we discussed this matter on the Second Stage, the Minister took some pains to point out to us that he was very anxious there should be no possibility of opticians of any kind carrying out treatment.  Section 48 is brought in for that purpose and it goes quite a long way to prevent the treatment of eye conditions or diseases by opticians, ophthalmic or otherwise.  I think it is extremely unwise that this exception in sub-section (3) should have been made in regard to orthoptics. It seems to me contrary, in the first instance, to the spirit of the section and, secondly, to make an exception in one of the most dangerous instances that an exception could be made to this particular section, because, under this sub-section ophthalmic opticians will be in a position to carry out orthoptics treatment.</P>
    <P>Further, they will be in a position to advertise themselves as capable and competent to carry out orthoptics treatment on the direction, not of an eye specialist, mind you, but a registered medical practitioner.  I should just like to put a case to the Minister, as I see it, under that sub-section. Take the position in a country town, in a city, or anywhere else in Ireland, where there is an ophthalmic optician who acquires a reputation, let us say, for the treatment of squint.  According to the sub-section, he is perfectly entitled to hold himself out as a person competent to treat squint, provided he has a written direction from a registered medical practitioner.  A parent will bring along his or her child to this optician.  The parent will say that he would like to have the squint in the child's eye corrected because he has heard that this optician has a very good reputation for dealing with such cases successfully.  All the optician will be obliged to do under the sub-section is to say to the parent: &ldquo;I would like you to obtain a certificate or a direction from a registered medical practitioner.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, the registered medical practitioner would be, in nine cases out of ten, the family doctor.  The family doctor would <Col N="1366" /> probably be a general practitioner and he, too, would know as little as, and probably a great deal less about orthoptics than the ophthalmic optician, and in so far as he was concerned, the giving of a medical direction to the ophthalmic optician to carry out the treatment of squint would be a matter of convenience, and it would be given in the way in which all doctors give certificates of that nature, merely to comply with that regulation.  Once a certificate or medical direction is given by the family practitioner, the treatment of squint would be left entirely to the ophthalmic optician.</P>
    <P>I do not have to go any further than that for anybody in this House to realise that an ophthalmic optician is not a suitable person to undertake treatment of this nature.  Orthoptics is a highly specialised branch of eye-work&mdash;a job in which people are specially trained&mdash;and it is entirely wrong that it should be passed over to ophthalmic opticians and that the only medical supervision would be that it was done under a direction from a registered medical practitioner.  If the section had suggested that it could only be done under the medical supervision of an ophthalmic optician, that would be different, but, again, I realise that it would not be practical either to put into the section that such treatment can only be done under the medical supervision of an ophthalmic optician.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider most seriously dropping this section altogether.  There is no necessity for it.  I cannot speak with facts and figures because I have not had an opportunity of examining the position, but I doubt if there are any&mdash;there may be one or two&mdash;ophthalmic opticians in this country at the moment who are trained to deal with squint.  As I say, there may be one or two, but the vast majority are not trained to treat and deal with squint. It may be said by the Minister that, under the new board, courses will be provided and that ophthalmic opticians may be trained in orthoptics.  Even if they were trained over a period of years it would be most undesirable <Col N="1367" /> that this treatment should be handed over to them and that the only medical supervision would be a certificate from the local practitioner.</P>
    <P>I could visualise a situation where ophthalmic opticians, using the publicity to which they are perfectly entitled under this section, would have squint clinics established throughout the country and would carry on these squint clinics entirely on their own, just covered by a letter from the local doctor.  I would urge the Minister in the interest of trying to maintain a good standard, as far as eye work is concerned, to consider seriously dropping this sub-section altogether.</P>

      <P>I cannot speak with any expert knowledge on this amendment, but I have been asked by several members of the medical profession to speak on it and to ask the Minister to withdraw this section from the Bill.  The profession feels very strongly about it, and I think the case has been put admirably by Senator ffrench O'Carroll.  I can add little to what he said, beyond saying that I do happen to know that there is a very strong feeling among the profession as a whole that the sub-section is undesirable. If the unskilled people, unqualified people, are allowed to treat children for squint, very serious damage may be done to the health of the child, which may last the whole of his life.  I am informed that there are persons in Ireland holding diplomas from London University and Oxford University, for special training in this subject. There are at least two in Dublin, and at least one in Cork and probably others in the country, over and above ophthalmic surgeons and the medical profession as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point Senator ffrench O'Carroll has made does seem to me to be a reasonable and sensible one, that, if the ordinary family doctor, the general practitioner, does not feel equal to dealing with a patient himself, he should hand him over to a properly qualified ophthalmic surgeon, and not to an optician.  If the condition which he is asked to treat is one of which he does not profess to have special knowledge himself, he should not <Col N="1368" /> hand it over to a person who has a lower degree of professional qualification than he has, and, as Senator ffrench O'Carroll says, quite a number of abuses might arise in this way, that opticians might advertise that they were specially qualified to do this work.  It might become a paying proposition, and doctors might, so to speak, fall into the trap and give letters to their patients recommending those opticians, and a great deal of harm might be done to the people suffering from squint.  In view of the fact that this opinion is so strongly held by each member of the medical profession, the Minister might seriously consider amending the Bill in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>I most heartily join with Senator ffrench O'Carroll and Senator O'Brien in asking for the deletion of this section.  I do not think it is necessary to traverse the grounds and arguments of Senator O'Carroll.  I think that from every point of view it is undesirable to permit these people to undertake this work, which might be very tricky, simply because some very busy medical practitioner for some reason has given them their hand.  What I also find rather alarming and sinister in this section is that nothing will prevent him from suggesting that he has provided, or is capable of providing, this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing which is disturbing in this Bill is the question of advertising. Sweet are the uses of advertisement, and we are putting the profession that must not, by its ethical standards, advertise in what may be competition with the profession that lives by advertising. I have lived long enough in this town to know how excellent advertisers some of the opticians are, and how very impressive the advertisements are and what wonderful pieces of apparatus they show and all that kind of thing.  One thing that I certainly think would happen if this section were retained is that the ophthalmic optician would feel it necessary to suggest that he has these powers.  He would feel it his duty to emphasise that suggestion, and it would be a direct incitement to advertise.  For these two reasons, I certainly hope <Col N="1369" /> that the Minister will delete this section, and consider the possibility from time to time that the board when in action, can stress the necessity of controlling the ethics of uncontrolled advertising on the part of the non-medically qualified people who are involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryBarniville" hpid="Professor Barniville Professor Barniville">
      <NameTxt>Professor Barniville</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this amendment, and I would strongly urge the Minister to consider it very carefully, and recommend it not only to the sympathetic consideration of all, but would impress upon him that this amendment, to my mind, is much more in keeping with the spirit of the Bill than Section 7.  On the Second Reading, Senator ffrench O'Carroll gave a short but accurate survey of the attitude of a professional man of many years' standing towards the technician of a few years' standing who perfects his work and reaches a high degree of expertness and skill.  On the Second Reading, the debate was confined largely to the subject of the provision of spectacles.  No professional man dealing with eyes likes the idea of any technician taking full responsibility for the treatment of errors of refraction, but, as the Minister has told us in a very neat right hand cross counter, it is possibly better for him to do that than to have nobody at all to do it.</P>
      <P>This sub-section introduces a point which goes far beyond any question of a register, or even a board of administration. It introduces the word &ldquo;orthoptics.&rdquo;  My slight knowledge of the classics suggests to me that since &ldquo;orthos&rdquo; means straight, orthoptics means &ldquo;straight eye.&rdquo;  But it often involves squints, and there are nearly as many different types of squints as there are amendments to this Bill.  It would be perfectly disastrous that any form of technician would be permitted to deal with anything approaching a squint, because it involves so much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To bring it down to practical politics, supposing I put it to the Minister that I have a carpenter who does work for me and I have a great admiration for his technical skill, and, in my fancy, I bring him in and show him how I remove an appendix.  I make him do it himself two or three or ten times, and <Col N="1370" /> he does it nearly as well as myself, and more cheaply.  Supposing the Minister has a child troubled with his appendix and a friend tells him &ldquo;Johnny MacDonnell&rdquo; in Mobhi Road is a wizard at taking out appendices&rdquo;, will he send his child to that technician?</P>
    <P>I put it in another way.  I can easily attribute to the Minister deep knowledge of the law and its intricacies. Supposing that we have a brilliant young solicitor who has gained all the prizes that he can possibly gain and he inherits a chief clerk in his office who is obviously able to play rings around him in court procedure, would his profession allow him to send that chief clerk to appear for him in court?</P>
    <P>We are not dealing with simple technicalities like errors of refraction or spectacles.  You are dealing with what might be very fundamental trouble in a child's eye, and, without indulging in heroics, everybody knows that a child's eye is one of the most astounding miracles of the Great Designer.  I would just like to quote what Senator Murphy said in his speech on the Second Reading last week, speaking as a member of the Labour Party.  Referring to spectacles, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our view on this matter is that, whilst spectacles could be purchased cheaply in certain shops, it was false economy and was dangerous and injurious to the eyes of poor people, that they should be able to purchase these spectacles, or so-called spectacles.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The same words apply even more strongly to orthoptics, and I would ask the Minister to consider very seriously the deletion of this sub-section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear that this matter is in danger of being exaggerated in relation to its importance. Naturally, I am impressed by the views expressed by Senator ffrench O'Carroll and Senator Barniville on any matter of this kind.  They are perhaps more susceptible than other Senators, because they in relation to their profession feel these matters more keenly.  It may be that many Senators wonder what on earth is meant by orthoptics.  I am told that <Col N="1371" /> it can be described as physiotherapy of the eye and means the exercise of the muscles of the eye.  Physiotherapy is something which has been practised in medicine for some years and is used for the exercise of certain muscles which require to be got back to tone in order that they may be improved.</P>
      <P>If any member of this House has been to see some of our new hospitals, he will have found the physiotherapy department there a very important part of the services available, because, after the doctors have finished and have given all the medical care required to the patient, the patient is then handed over to the physiotherapy department to be encouraged to take the necessary muscle exercises to complete the cure already started as a result of the medical attention.</P>
      <P>The practice of orthoptics, I am advised, is in relation to the eye what physiotherapy is in relation to the muscles of the body.  I am told that at the moment it is carried on quite generally by nurses, and even by doctors' receptionists, and also, to some extent, by other persons, such as ophthalmic opticians.  It is done at the moment not by doctors, but by persons working under the direction of doctors who have engaged in this form of physiotherapy.  It further is a recognised treatment in dealing with certain conditions of the eye which require the exercise of the muscles.  I am advised that since orthoptics is carried out at the moment under the direction of medical practitioners, by nurses and by others, and also by ophthalmic opticians, it would be a very unfair prohibition on ophthalmic opticians to prevent them from doing something which they are now doing and still allow nurses and other persons completely untrained, from the medical point of view, to engage in this exercise or aid to medical care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have considered representations made to me in connection with this matter and I have been impressed by the case put up.  I feel that, while very definite prohibitions are contained in Section 48 to prevent any medical treatment on the eye, this subject of <Col N="1372" /> orthoptics is something which should be exempt.  I provided in an amendment on the Committee Stage in the Dáil that this orthoptic treatment can only be carried out on the representation and under the direction of a registered medical practitioner, after he has given a certificate that he has examined the person's eyes and directs that this treatment should be carried out by an ophthalmic optician.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I cannot agree with Senator Barniville and Senator ffrench O'Carroll in what they say about the ordinary medical practitioner, the general practitioner.  I think that the general practitioner, the family doctor, would be most unlikely to send a patient of his, whether a child or an adult, to any person for specialised treatment or advice, other than a specialised ophthalmic surgeon.  I think it is most unlikely and highly improbable that a general practitioner, feeling that a child required ophthalmic treatment, would send that child to be treated by an ophthalmic optician. What I would regard as probable is that an ophthalmic surgeon would direct that a patient avail of the services of an ophthalmic optician to have this orthoptic treatment carried out. That would not be unusual.  I think the denial of this useful service to the public would be unfair.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment put forward by Senator ffrench O'Carroll, but I want to be perfectly fair to him.  I can recognise the anxiety which he has expressed and which Senator Barniville has felt on this matter, and, while I do not share their fears, I am quite prepared to leave a decision on this matter to a free vote of the House.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to physiotherapy departments and said that, when one goes into a hospital, one sees these departments. That is perfectly true.  You see the work being carried out by physiotherapists, <Col N="1373" /> but what the Minister overlooks is that the people who are being treated are people who have had their fractures and arthritis treated by doctors and who are going to have their physiotherapy done under medical guidance.  That is the important point.  It is done under the guidance of specialists, not under the medical guidance of general practitioners.  I am speaking as somebody without specialist knowledge and nothing I say casts any reflection on general practitioners. In medical work, there is a field for the specialist and a field for the general practitioner.  The general practitioner is not competent to supervise specialist treatment.  Take the position in hospitals to-day.  Is the general practitioner competent to provide specialist treatment in these hospitals? He refers his patient to the specialist in the hospital and that specialist then arranges for specialist treatment under his supervison.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out that unsuitable persons are doing orthoptics.  I know that is so, but that does not make a case for allowing it to be carried on by slightly less unsuitable people.  What we want is that it be carried out under specialist supervision and that is what we must aim at.  At one time, anæsthesia was carried out by general practitioners.  I have been in other countries and have seen anaesthetics given by men who were not doctors at all.  Here certain types were given by persons who were not doctors, but that did not prevent us in this country from moving towards the establishment of anaesthesia on a specialised plane, and we have reached the position where anaesthetics are administered, in our large hospitals at any rate, only by specialised persons. In other countries they make wide use of medical auxiliaries, but I know the feeling generally here in this country is that we should be very careful what we give to the medical auxiliaries and what is to be done under the supervision of a specialist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no reason why we cannot have this work carried out under the supervision of an oculist.  If the Minister were to state in that section &ldquo;The oculist or ophthalmic surgeon&rdquo;, the <Col N="1374" /> position would be entirely different, but I submit, with respect, that so far as the ordinary patient is concerned, he will go to the general practitioner, ask him for a medical direction to an ophthalmic optician and the general practitioner will give that direction merely to comply with a formality.  He will know himself he is not competent to supervise the treatment and he does not feel, by giving the certificate, that he is supervising the treatment.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider the position, because I feel there is no necessity to make this an issue here in the House.  I believe the evidence in favour of keeping this under specialised medical supervision is overwhelming, and, if the Minister looks into the position, I am sure he will reconsider it.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister a question on this?  We laymen may have to vote on this matter in a few moments and it is obviously a very touch-and-go question.  One thing I should like to know.  Supposing we do delete this section, will there be enough qualified medical practitioners in the country to cope with the present demand for this kind of service, or will it mean that a number of people who want this kind of service simply will not be able to get it, if the practising opticians of the moment are prevented from giving it? If that practical difficulty arises, I think we laymen will have to vote for some treatment rather than no treatment at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps if I might just reply to both Senators in this way. It is the last thing I am going to say on the section.  It is impossible to say whether there would be sufficient specialists to carry out orthoptic treatment, whether it be by design or by legislation reserved for them, and I could not answer the question, except to say they do not do it at the moment. At the moment, it is the accepted thing&mdash;I am speaking on the advice available to me&mdash;for a doctor to say that the boy or adult needs orthoptic treatment and that he should go down to the nurse, and in some cases it is the receptionist who does it and, in some cases, an ophthalmic optician.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1375" /> I feel that, out of justifiable concern, the two Senators, Senators Barniville and O'Carroll, have rather magnified the importance of this thing.  It is generally done.  In fact, almost without exception, it is done by unskilled persons, and I am advised that you do not find the specialist doing it himself. There is one thing I would ask Senator Dr. ffrench O'Carroll to appreciate and it is this: under the sub-section, the decision, the initial decision, the primary decision, as to whether the treatment will take place and as to who will give the treatment, is not for some poor ignorant person.  It is the decision of a qualified medical practitioner. It is he who decides what treatment will be given and who will give the treatment.</P>
    <P>Orthoptic treatment cannot be given by an ophthalmic optician, except on the written direction of the patient's doctor, who certifies that he has examined the eyes and directs the ophthalmic optician to give him such treatment.  The direction comes from the person who is qualified to know the medical conditions, to know what is to be done for his patient.  The particular patient will always remain the patient of the medical practitioner, if he directs an unqualified person to give this treatment and that medical practitioner remains responsible in the eyes of the civil law, and in relation to his own oath as a medical practitioner, for what is going to be done for that patient.</P>
    <P>Senator ffrench O'Carroll said that a general practitioner would not be competent to supervise specialised treatment. I quite accept that.  That is why we have specialists and that is why we have general practitioners, but, after all, a general practitioner is not a person who can be shrugged aside.  The general practitioner represents, I suppose, 75 per cent. of the medical profession in the country, the ordinary family doctor, and surely we can trust general practitioners to know when the conditions of the eyes of a patient require the attention of a specialist.  If the conditions of a patient's eyes require the attention of a specialist, the House may be quite <Col N="1376" /> certain that the general practitioner, knowing that he is not competent, by reason, perhaps, of lack of experience, to advise on or treat the condition of that person's eyes, will refer him to an ophthalmic surgeon.  I have no doubt, if the sub-section remains in the Bill, if it becomes law, that, in the ordinary sequence of events, an ophthalmic surgeon will, as a matter of practice and of habit, if he finds that orthoptic treatment is necessary, direct it to be carried out by an ophthalmic optician.</P>
    <P>Therefore, just to summarise, the decision as to whether an ophthalmic optician shall carry out this treatment or not and the decision on the need for it and the type of it will be the decision of a medical practitioner who will be the family doctor and the doctor in charge of the patient in question. That medical practitioner will remain responsible for the consequences of the treatment and for what will be done. He will be responsible in relation to his own conscience and he will be responsible in relation to his liability at law.  In these circumstances, I think that to express the anxieties that have been expressed by Senator Barniville and Senator ffrench O'Carroll, while understandable, is, I fear, magnifying the situation and making something more of this than, in fact, exists.</P>
    <P>The common practice at the moment is that this kind of treatment is given only by untrained persons.  It is necessary. It must continue to be given. Whether this sub-section is removed from this Bill or not, it will continue to be given by young girls, possibly receptionists in doctors' rooms, nurses and a variety of other people except opticians unless the sub-section remains in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to Senator ffrench O'Carroll's question, I will consider the matter.  I do not want to be unreasonable or to give the Senator any short answer in this connection.  However, this represents a ministerial amendment during the Committee Stage in the other House.  It was inserted at my request on the Committee Stage and the Dáil, having fully considered it and having been satisfied that it was necessary, felt that it certainly did not <Col N="1377" /> contain any of the objections the two Senators felt it did contain.</P>

      <P>Under Sections 24 and 25, ophthalmic opticians have to undergo a certain type of training and pass examinations.  Will training in the treatment of squints be part of that course, because, if so, it might allay some of our fears?</P>

      <P>Many of these squints have been cured by an ophthalmic surgeon in 20 minutes.  If a general practitioner sends a child for optic treatment he may keep that child for years, when, as a matter of fact, the trouble can often be cured in ten or 20 minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to intervene on what is a medical debate, but I suggest that non-medical members of the Seanad are qualified to speak on these matters, especially if they are briefed.  I think the Minister must agree that one has not got to be a medical practitioner to discuss a Health Bill.  I have been briefed in this connection by some eminent men and I think I am speaking for a large section of the medical profession.  I do not want to delay the House, but I must say I think the Minister has been blowing hot and cold.</P>
      <P>With regard to one of Senator Cox's amendments, the Minister was very strong that it was all right for certain things to be done.  You cannot prevent the ordinary nurse or parent, or anybody else, from treating eye conditions, but it is different if it is done by people who set themselves up to be experts.  If that is true about Senator Cox's amendment, then it is equally true here.  You cannot prevent parents or anybody from treating squints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the ophthalmic optician is the person whose very name almost suggests that he is qualified.  I suggest that if what the Minister said earlier on the Bill is true, then it is equally true now.  Following Senator Dr. ffrench O'Carroll, I do not think that the mere fact that a person is sent by a general practitioner is necessarily the answer to the objection.  The medical profession generally seem to share that view.  The representatives of the profession <Col N="1378" /> in the Seanad have been unanimous about it.  Although I am not a member, I have been approached and instructed about this matter by members of the medical profession.  I think I am only doing my duty by them in trying to put their point of view.</P>
    <P>There is one last point which I should like to deal with and it concerns the people who hold diplomas in orthoptics.  If this matter is as simple as all that, why should universities such as Oxford and London think it worth their while to provide diplomas in the subject, if it can be done almost by anybody without special training? If people with these diplomas are in Ireland, why should they not get some preferential treatment over people who have not gone to the expense or trouble of getting special qualifications?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The last question asked by the Senator is part of the problem.  Some ophthalmic opticians have the particular diploma which the Senator mentions.  Were this sub-section to be removed from the Bill, all these ophthalmic opticians, whom Senator O'Brien regards as being qualified because they have this diploma from some English university, would be expressly prohibited from providing the service in which they have become expert, while the untrained or unskilled person or nurse or doctor's receptionist would be entitled to do it.  That is a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> which I think the House should not too easily lend itself to.</P>
      <P>Standards and qualifications will be a matter for the board, but, as I have indicated, there are ophthalmic opticians who have already a recognised diploma in this particular subject and naturally they are the ophthalmic opticians who carry out this treatment at the moment.  I should imagine that the board, whose function it will be to lay down standards and to provide what qualifications will obtain in the future, will have to consider what an ophthalmic optician can do in relation to the eye and provide qualifications accordingly.  I think it is largely a matter for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister suggested <Col N="1379" /> that, when a doctor gave a written direction, he might be still held as responsible. The section says &ldquo;at the written direction&rdquo;.  I take it that that would mean that if a doctor wrote on half a sheet of notepaper, it would be a direction to go to so and so.  It seems to me that if there were to be any legal obligation on the doctor, or if he were to be responsible in any way for what happened afterwards, the words should be &ldquo;under the written direction&rdquo;. The words in the section are &ldquo;at the written direction&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Another point that has struck me is that the section does seem almost to ask for advertising.  I should have thought that the point the Minister made would not require the addition of the ultimate words &ldquo;or from suggesting that he has provided or is capable of providing as aforesaid&rdquo;.  These words seem to me almost a direct invitation to a certain optician to advertise.  I am not in the least suggesting that, if these points were met, they would remove the objections which have been voiced here this afternoon, but it seems to me that the last words are practically an invitation to advertise.</P>

      <P>I listened to this discussion with great interest and I have a great respect for the opinions of specialists; but I am not quite clear as to whether I am qualified to vote on this matter, after the discussion.  The position is, surely, that the Bill is an improvement on the present situation in every direction, while it may not be perfect and while it does not do everything that people want it to do.  My sympathies, owing to my associations, are to a very great extent with specialists, <Col N="1380" /> because I know a great many of them.  At the present moment, as I understand it, an ophthalmic optician can do this work; and the Bill, and the particular section of it to which objection is taken, concerns the insertion of a general practitioner between the patient and the ophthalmic optician.  I take it that that is so.</P>
      <P>I have always heard from specialists that the best kind of general practitioner is the general practitioner who knows his limits and who, at a certain moment, says: &ldquo;You ought to go and see Barniville&rdquo;&mdash;not necessarily Barniville, but I am inserting Barniville as a particular person.  Some of them might say: &ldquo;You ought to go and see Dr. ffrench O'Carroll&rdquo; or something of that kind.  I have always heard from specialists&mdash;the most distinguished in Dublin&mdash;that that was one of the principal features of a good general practitioner&mdash;that he would say at a certain stage: &ldquo;Look, I have done all I can for you and you ought to go and see a surgeon.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What is to happen when a parent finds a child with something in the nature of a squint?  What is he going to do with the child?  He surely brings that child to the ordinary practitioner. Is there any way of avoiding the situation in which that ordinary practitioner proposes to treat the child himself?  I think there is none, as a general rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the practitioner prescribes an ophthalmic surgeon, then I take it that Senator ffrench O'Carroll and Senator Barniville are satisfied.  If the general practitioner says: &ldquo;You ought to bring that child to Tralee, Limerick or some place, where she will see an eye specialist,&rdquo; the people here, who oppose this sub-section, would be quite satisfied; but, if he goes on treating it himself, nothing we can take out of or put into this Bill will affect that situation. I would like to know what the objection to the sub-section is.  Those people at present can go to an ophthalmic optician.  Under this sub-section, they cannot go to an ophthalmic optician, unless a general practitioner says that is what they are to do. Whether the wording of the Bill might be amended or not, as Senator Cox says, is another matter.  From the practical point of view, the ordinary <Col N="1381" /> people in the country have not normally access to ophthalmic surgeons. They are dependent, I think, upon a dispensary doctor, upon their family doctor&mdash;upon the general practitioner&mdash;to tell them that they ought to see an oculist or an ophthalmic surgeon.</P>
    <P>If it is true&mdash;and it appears to be accepted that it is true&mdash;that a person not being a doctor is qualified to do this work, why should he not be allowed under direction to do it?  It would be, perhaps, an ideal situation if nobody ever prescribed anything for a child at all except a specialist, but, unfortunately, that situation is not available to us.  Surely, it is best to insert a general practitioner between the patient and the ophthalmic optician rather than to leave the situation as it is at present.  It would be very difficult not to agree with that argument.  We are all at one in wanting to make the best possible decision for the patient. I feel inclined to stand up for the ordinary practitioner and to say that he is not such a reckless and careless person as has been represented.  One would imagine from Dr. ffrench O'Carroll that a person goes to a general practitioner and the practitioner writes out a few lines and he says: &ldquo;Go away to the shop&rdquo; or to the ophthalmic optician.  I do not think that is the way he does his business.  If it is not, then the sub-section does not do the harm suggested.</P>
    <P>It seems to me also clearly indicated that better treatment for the eyes, if it were possible, ought to be made available.  I have serious doubts whether, if we delete this sub-section from the Bill, we are in fact making better treatment for the eyes available to the ordinary person.  That is what worries me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that there are more ophthalmic surgeons available in the country and in the country districts than Professor Hayes suggests.  We have the most specialist treatment now available in the country.  With widespread motor transport, I think there is no difficulty for any person having a child, who may be suffering from complaints of that nature, examined by a <Col N="1382" /> thoroughly competent specialist.  As a father&mdash;I am reticent to speak on this &mdash;I would hate to have my child treated by anyone other than a specialist, particularly for that complaint, and I think these specialists ought to be made available to the poor in the country.  I should like to see, if there is any question of that, that they will be under the direction of a competent specialist and that the person who is giving treatment would have to report back to the specialist on the manner in which that treatment is being given.</P>

      <P>I am sorry for wearying the House and this is the last time I am going to raise the matter.  Senator Cox puts the position quite clearly.  What I suggest to the Minister is in regard to sub-section (3), the last line of which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Or from suggesting that he has provided or is capable of providing as aforesaid.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That line there, to my mind, leaves the initiative entirely with the ophthalmic optician rather than with the medical practitioner, and I believe that that says to the ophthalmic optician that he is perfectly entitled to advertise himself as somebody who is competent to do optics and that, in view of his advertisement, which would be quite in order under that sub-section, the initiative will lie with him&mdash;that the parent will read or hear of his ability to do that particular treatment and will merely seek a certificate from the general practitioner in order to have treatment.</P>

      <P>When I say he must get it, that is not any reflection on the general practitioner.  I am pointing out that the family practitioner in those circumstances, when asked to give a certificate to people who have to go to a recognised firm in the town, established and with a reputation for carrying out a certain type of treatment, it is extremely difficult for him to refuse it.  I do not want to press this amendment.  The Minister knows what is the feeling of the House. We know he will do his best to meet <Col N="1383" /> us.  If he could even drop these last few lines, it might ensure that the parent would attend with the child at the medical practitioner's, in the first instance.</P>

If any part of the sub-section needs to be deleted, if necessary, we can divide on it on the next stage.  Would the House agree to finish the Committee Stage? There will be a Fourth Stage.</P>

      <P>I mentioned to the Minister before the Committee Stage was taken, the question of advertising by people supplying glasses resident in Border towns such as Derry, Armagh, Newry and Strabane.  Those people would be living outside the jurisdiction. They would not be registered opticians, but would be advertising in newspapers circulating in the State.  Those papers may or may not be published inside the jurisdiction, but they would hold out advertisements to encourage people to cross the Border to obtain glasses.  I was wondering if the Minister could in any way prevent these people from enticing our people to come across to be supplied with glasses by people who had not been registered by the board.</P>

      <P>Before Senator O'Connell rose, I should have intimated to the House that, before we take up consideration of the amendments tabled for this Bill, it would be as well if I indicated that there are certain amendments which I consider out of order and may not be moved. These are Nos. 2 to 13, and 16.  I consider Nos. 2 to 5, 7 to 13 and 16 out of order because they increase the charge on the Exchequer, which is not permissible on any amendment by a Private Member.  Amendment No. 6 is out of order as it deals with matters outside the scope of the Bill.  I have so intimated to the Senators who put down these amendments.</P>

      <P>I submit that perhaps we might solve this matter if the Minister was prepared to allow us to discuss these three amendments, Nos. 2, 3 and 4, which are all related to the same paragraph.

      <P>In ordinary employment, a person is looked upon to be still in employment, if he is genuinely out sick and drawing what used to be called national health.  As Senator Miss Davidson points out, when they come to consideration of pension, if that person becomes ill with some disease that takes him a couple of months to recover from, he will qualify, because he is, in fact, in the employment.  But under the Act he is not being paid by the county council.  He is only drawing his national health benefit and it is possible that he may lose a whole year of pensionable service.  We are dealing with a different problem because we have not a really permanent staff.</P>

      <P>Certain local authorities do pay sick leave pay, and <Col N="1394" /> it could be a matter for arrangement that the man could be paid a nominal figure of 1/- a day.  If I might refer the Senator to Section 2, sub-section (b), line 15 on page 6 &ldquo;a day (other than a Sunday) in respect of which the servant was given paid leave&rdquo;&mdash;even nominal pay, I am certain, would qualify him.

      <P>I am not trying to deal with a peculiar case, such as the Minister is discussing, which would be a rather extraordinary one.  What we are trying to cover is the ordinary case of the road worker who finds himself <i>bona fide</i> out sick and not qualified for national health benefit.  The normal case would be that he would be drawing national health benefit, but because the county council has not made special provision for some special payment in lieu of pay, he does not qualify to have that day regarded as service for the purposes of this Bill.  The Minister's suggestion is that the council could pay him while he was sick. The contribution from the council, as far as I know, would be about 4/2 or 5/2 a week.  That is a very small amount, and if the Minister amends the Bill, that would be a nominal payment, instead of asking each individual local authority to pay this 5/2 as pay and 5/2 more towards his contribution. What the Minister is suggesting is that the county council should award him this 5/2.  There would be a double contribution.</P>

      <P>I have never heard before that a local authority has power to pay sick pay to the servants who are unfortunate enough to go sick.  I am aware, of course, that a man immediately qualifies for national health, but before I would be satisfied, I should like the Minister to tell me <Col N="1396" /> under what section and in what Act the local authority has power to pay a nominal sick payment, apart from the national health, which they automatically qualify for by law and which the county council cannot help or hinder. I do say that, if it is so, I am surprised, and local authorities are not aware of that.  But even if it is so, it would not be the best way.</P>
      <P>My view is that the outlook down the country would be that, when a man goes sick he qualifies immediately for national health, and if the county council were to propose to do that, the auditor might have a word to say, because he might take the view that, since this man was not working and was in receipt of national health, this payment must be surcharged, unless there is provision in some Act.  The Minister may be able to trot out the section.  I hope he will, and will give information to us, but even if it is so, and he can trot out the section, I still think that Senator Bergin's approach is the more direct.  It is better to make provision that those days will qualify them, even if they are in receipt of national health, rather than to leave it to the local authority to qualify them or not by resolution and by paying them a nominal sum.</P>

In his reply, the Minister said he was against compulsion, so far as local authorities were concerned.  Yet, under Section 4, he is actually using compulsion in so far as officers are concerned. In this case, the compulsion is to the advantage of the officers.  I should like to appeal to the Minister to consider extending the scope to servants in the same way as to officers.

There is compulsion in regard to the officers.  Surely the same conditions should apply to servants.  I think road workers and other servants in the Minister's own county are deprived of a pension scheme.  If he sees fit to give pensions to all officers might I appeal to him to extend the pension rights to all servants?  The scheme applies to all officers whether or not Part III is adopted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2) to add after &ldquo;month&rdquo;, in line 40, &ldquo;Where a person in the opinion of the local authority is not entitled to have his service recorded in the register such person shall be so informed within one month&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 7 provides that local authorities shall maintain a register to be known as &ldquo;the register of pensionable officers,&rdquo; and, where a person becomes a registered officer, that the local authority shall enter his name in this register and shall notify him accordingly within one month.  It makes provision for the maintenance by the local authority of a register of the persons entitled to come under the superannuation fund, but it goes much further than that.  It places an obligation on the local authority to notify such person that he or she is now recorded in this register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Reading, the Minister said that an employee would become aware whether he or she was entitled to have his or her name on the register by the amount in the pay packet.  I agree that a person whose name is on the register would immediately become aware of the fact, but the person who <Col N="1399" /> is not entitled to have his name on the register is in a much more difficult position because there is no obligation placed on the local authority to inform him within one month that he is not entitled to be so recorded.</P>
    <P>County councils are charged with the carrying out of a number of works on behalf of the central authority&mdash;work on behalf of the Board of Works and the expenditure of money granted for tourist development works.  The men who do the work are recruited by the local authority.  They work side by side with the road worker whose wage is provided from the rates and they may think, where they work for a specified period&mdash;say, 200 days&mdash;that they are people to whom the section applies, and it is only just to such persons that they should be made aware as early as possible that they are not in the class of persons to whom this Bill applies.  We feel it is necessary to place an obligation on the local authority in this connection, so that the persons concerned will be given an opportunity of appealing against their position or of securing employment that would give a pension scheme of one kind or another, whether from a local authority or otherwise.</P>
    <P>In my view, the cost of implementing my amendment would be very small. It would only mean that each person employed by the local authority at a particular time would be notified as to his position.  I would seriously put it to the Minister that we should make provision so that the person whose name does not appear on the list&mdash;who is working side by side with others whose names are on the list, receiving the same amount of money in wages and doing the same type of work&mdash;will be notified if he is not entitled to be a beneficiary under this Act.</P>

      <P>In spite of that doubt in my mind, if it has gone past other people, it should not worry me.  I would support the amendment.  In my view, there is a greater necessity to inform the people whose names have not been registered so that they can benefit by sub-section (3).  During the debate on Second Reading, the Minister said the best way of making them aware of the position was by taking it off their pay packets.  There is merit in that.  I quite concede it.  However, why not go the further step and inform them officially that they have not been included on the register?  When dealing with local authority workers, I think it is necessary that they should be told exactly their position, because otherwise they will worry their representatives afterwards and say they thought they were on the register. They should be notified in writing and, at the same time, their attention should be drawn to the provisions of the Act so that they will know, if they feel aggrieved, that they have a right to appeal.  That is the usual procedure in dealing with these things.  I think the Minister should accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>The proposer of the amendment and Senator Murphy have evidently not read the amendment. It refers to Part II, which deals with officers only&mdash;not servants. Officers are recruited through the Local Appointments Commission, who advertise the terms of the appointment, whether it is pensionable, permanent or otherwise.  Before they become competitors, they know&mdash;in advance&mdash;the terms of the appointment.  I could understand Senator Hawkins putting in this amendment if it were to relate other than to Part II.  What he said related to the servant angle of the Bill, not to Part II which deals only <Col N="1401" /> with officers.  No officer is recruited into the local authority other than through the Local Appointments Commission or through some other competitive examination.  He knows in advance whether the position is pensionable or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has already covered that ground twice.  On the Second Reading debate, he gave us the reasons for not incorporating my suggestion in the Bill.  He said these people would become aware of it very soon when they opened their pay packets.  Now he has forgotten about the pay packets.  He tells us that all the people we are interested in are persons who would be recruited by the Local Appointments Commission and that they would all be bubbling over with intelligence and would already know the conditions of their employment.  I accept that.  I will, therefore, put the suggestion in reverse to the Minister, namely, that we delete the obligation on the local authority to inform them that they are persons whose names are entered on the register.  If they are aware of the conditions of their employment, then surely the Minister, as the person accepting responsibility for having some little heart for the ratepayers, will try to save the ratepayers this little sum by making this concession and withdrawing the obligation and the cost, so far as the local authority is concerned, of informing these intelligent persons of something of which they are already aware.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amendment, I should be quite satisfied if the Minister would go part of the way with me.  I shall be quite satisfied if he will accept the principle and, where necessary, incorporate it in the Bill, that where it relates to servants, rather than to officers, the servants will be notified by the local authority as to whether or not they are entitled to have their names on this register.</P>

      <P>If I understand the Minister correctly, he said that local authority officers were appointed by the Local Appointments Commission and knew beforehand the conditions of their employment and whether they <Col N="1402" /> were pensionable or not.  Suppose I am being appointed as an officer of a county council and know that I am to be a pensionable officer.  If I do not get any word from the county council informing me of that matter, I would think it normal.  I would have no complaint. I do not see why I should go to the county council office to inquire about my position, or appeal to the Minister, or anybody else.  The fact that a person would expect his name to be on the register makes it all the more important that he should be told if it is not on the register.  Suppose that, as far as you know yourself, you are a pensionable officer.  Why should the council write and tell you again? Why not write and tell a person whose name is not on the register that that is the position and thus give him a chance of appealing to the Minister?</P>

      <P>I support Senator Hawkins's amendment.  In sub-section (3) of Section 7, it is obvious that an officer may not be on the register by reason of one of two events &mdash;(1) a definite and positive refusal on the part of the local authority to put his name on the register and (2) a failure on the part of the local authority.  That second point might well be one upon which he would like to appeal, as he is allowed to do here. If, however, he is not being informed that his name will not be on the register, if there is no obligation to inform him, he may be left in the dark and wrongly assume that his name is on the register.  It seems to me that Senator Hawkins has made a very good case for the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand over everything I said on the Second Reading of this Bill.  If Senator Hawkins's amendment applied to Part III, which deals with servants, I could talk to him.  His amendment is to Part II, which deals with officers.  When I was referring to the pay packet on the Second Reading, I was referring to what was deducted from the servant, not to what was deducted from the officer.  That should clarify the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to officers, I think it is but right to point out to Senator Bergin, Senator Sheehy Skeffington <Col N="1403" /> and Senator Murphy that an officer's appointment is advertised.  It is clearly stated in the advertisement whether it is a temporary or a permanent appointment. Under the Bill, if the appointment is permanent, then it is pensionable and there is a duty on the local authority to enter the officer's name on the register and so notify him.  If he receives no such notification, all he has to do is to inquire.  If his name is not on the register, he may appeal to the Minister, but remember there are a number of officers employed in a temporary capacity who are not entitled to have their names registered in this register.  If I could refer only to a few of them, there are, for instance, consulting engineers.  If every consultant appointed was entitled to be registered, you would want to keep a special liaison officer between temporary and permanent employees with his eye on the register and on who is appointed permanently and who is not appointed permanently.  Again, we have planners, quantity surveyors, bog assessors, rate applotters.  All those people are temporary and they know when they are appointed that they are temporary.  They know they are officers applying for a position under a local authority, and they know whether they are temporary or permanent. If they are permanent, they are entitled to have their names entered on the register.  If they are not and do not receive notification, they are entitled to appeal.</P>
    <P>The amendment is to Part II, not to Part III.  I did not intend, and I do not think it is necessary, to refer to it here, but with respect, if I may refer to it&mdash;seeing that the mover of the amendment did refer to it&mdash;the servant, who is usually paid week by week or at the very outside every two weeks, knows from the amount of the deduction of the contribution from his weekly or fortnightly pay packet whether he is a registered permanent servant or otherwise.  I am not going to comment on the fact that their packets may be so large that they may not notice the reduction&mdash;Senator Bergin commented on that.  They will know, if there is no deduction, that they are not registered.  If there is a <Col N="1404" /> deduction, they will very soon inquire as to why there is not and if they are entitled to be registered.  I think that is a simple method.</P>
    <P>We all agree that local taxation&mdash; the cost of local administration&mdash;is very high, and we do not want to add to it.  Somebody suggested that it would not cost the Central Fund anything. They are forgetting about the unfortunate ratepayer down the country.  I think we have got enough employees, be they either servants or officers, without bringing in a few more.  I think the method I have suggested is quite reasonable.  I may also say that I have had interviews with the Local Government Officials' Union and I have incorporated, as far as this is concerned, everything they require in the Bill.  They are quite satisfied.</P>

      <P>Without going into the question which we have deferred for the moment, I should like to ask the Minister was the object or anticipated result of paragraph (f) of sub-section (1) the saving of money to local authority or to State funds?  Is that the object or the anticipated result?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will remember that, on the Second Reading, we devoted a good deal of time to this section and especially to paragraph (f).  But, before I come to that, I would refer to sub-section (d) (1) where this word &ldquo;unfitness&rdquo; comes in again.  We see here that, if an officer is removed for unfitness, he suffers the loss of all his previous service.  Now it is bad enough to be penalised when he does something which is deliberately wrong and unauthorised, but he is also penalised under this sub-section (d) if he is removed for misconduct or for unfitness&mdash;and unfitness does not mean <Col N="1405" /> unfitness, as it is defined there, due to an infirmity of mind or old age.</P>
      <P>The Minister, speaking a few minutes ago, said he becomes constitutionally unfit.  I cannot really follow that.  He said would it not be better for him to be finished and to get his pension, but he does not or may not get his pension because he is removed for unfitness, and any period before his removal is denied to him for pension purposes.  We do not know what this unfitness is about.  That is one point on this section that I would like to refer to and stress.</P>
      <P>I come now to (f).  That was debated at great length.  I may say that I put down an amendment on that and it was ruled out of order.  I expected it would be ruled out and I did not question the Cathaoirleach's ruling.  I put it down because I thought&mdash;the only object was, as the Minister mentioned on the last occasion, to deal with occasions when doctors and nurses might go on strike and leave their patients neglected and on their own&mdash;the Minister would think well of fathering it himself and putting it down as an amendment at this stage and say he was going to accept it.  That was the one point that there was some apparent validity in, although, indeed, I do not think for a moment&mdash;and I do not think it has ever been known&mdash; that doctors or nurses or mental hospital employees would leave their patients neglected at any time; and I do not think it is right that a situation like that would be taken for granted&mdash; that they would go on strike and leave their patients.  There are a great many other officers who are not in that position and who, even if they did absent themselves and go on strike for a period, might cause inconvenience, but that would be the end of it.</P>
      <P>Here is a point I want to refer to also.  The Minister also said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If a man is denied his service like that, he can appeal to the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gather from the Minister that he thought that that was the end of it, that the man would be all right and that he would get back his service almost automatically.  Now, the Minister <Col N="1406" /> knows that there are Ministers and Ministers.  If we could be assured that we would always have a Minister like our genial Minister for Local Government, it might not be so bad to have to appeal to the Minister.  Sometimes it would not be the Minister for Local Government to whom he would have to appeal at all.</P>
    <P>Take the case of the people I was speaking about the previous day&mdash;the vocational teachers.  If they have to appeal, it is not to the Minister for Local Government, but to the Minister for Education, and sometimes, if they are on strike, they would be striking against the Minister to whom they would have to appeal.  The Minister for Education fixes their rates of salary.  If they have to go on strike because they are not prepared to accept that arrangement, then the strike is actually against the Minister to whom they would have to appeal for their pension rights.  I am sure the Minister remembers nearly ten years ago when the national teachers went on strike.  They did not lose their service.  If they did, they would have had to appeal to the Minister in that case and I know how far they would have got.</P>
    <P>Another point is the question of contributions. A man pays contributions and, not only does he lose his service, but he loses the contributions which he has paid, and I doubt the legality of that.  He pays contributions and he certainly enters into a contract, when he pays those contributions, to get the benefit those contributions will bring to him.  Apart altogether from the obvious argument that it is a very great hardship for a person to lose his service of ten, 15 or 20 years, there is no guarantee that an appeal to the Minister will help him.</P>
    <P>There is no guarantee that an appeal to the Minister will help him.  After all, the Minister has inevitably to depend on the advice he gets from his inspectors or local superintendents, or whoever they may be.  I think the case made the last day from all quarters of the House deserves to be made, that this is a penalty that really ought not to appear in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Then there is Section 2.  I do not <Col N="1407" /> know when a man deprived of his service is notified and when he finds out when his service has been denied to him.  Section 2 is not very definite.  It says: &ldquo;the local authority shall give notice in writing of the forfeiture to the officer.&rdquo;  When exactly does he get that notice?  There is nothing definite here.  Does it occur immediately after the circumstances?  Does it occur only when the man is claiming pension rights after ten or 15 years?  I would again appeal to the Minister as strongly as I can to remove this sub-section and I would appeal to him especially to explain what is the justice of denying a man his service because he is removed for unfitness, whatever that is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerMcHugh" hpid="Dr. McHugh Dr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just one or two points I should like to make in support of Senator O'Connell's remarks.  I think we may take it as a general maxim in education that the fewer swords of Damocles hang over the heads of educators, the better. Certainly, it seems to me that the whole of Section 10, sub-section (1) is vitiated to a large extent by paragraph (f).  The vocational teachers, I think, have rightly pointed out that the paragraph which they complain of allows of a narrowing and menacing interpretation and might be used by superiors to promote a feeling of fear and uncertainty.  What gives point to the remarks and what impressed me about their memorandum was that they said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whereas the same conditions applied in this respect to servants as to officers under the 1948 Act, reference to the penal provision in this Bill is omitted as regards servants.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As the Minister implied in discussing another point, the officers go through a pretty severe process before they are actually appointed.  Presumably, in undergoing this process, they have a greater sense of responsibility.  It seems to me to be rather a bad thing to penalise them in a way in which the servants are not penalised.  I am not urging that it should be extended to servants, but rather that it should be removed from the officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I want to make <Col N="1408" /> is that the Senators who earlier heard the Minister for Health talking about the need to safeguard opticians against the possible acting of a board on misinformation will possibly have thought of this, too.  Sometimes a vocational education committee or a senior officer might act on misinformation and an officer might be unjustly penalised and lose 20 or 30 years because he had one slip-up for a day or a couple of days.</P>
    <P>The last point I wish to make concerns something the Minister said about the very uncertainty that would hang over the heads of vocational teachers.  He said that the officers would be safeguarded by the fact that they could always appeal to the Minister. That seems to me to beg the question.  After all, the Minister, if appealed to, will, in turn, consult the vocational education committee who in turn, will probably rely on the advice of the very same senior officer who in fact, unjustly penalised the teacher. For those reasons, I think the Minister should be very cautious about retaining Section 1, paragraph (f) in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator O'Connell, I had an amendment down in regard to paragraph (f) and like him, also, I expected my amendment to be ruled out of order, but, as a trade unionist and a labour representative, I must continue to protest as strongly as possible against a penal clause embodied in paragraph (f) of Section 10. I think it is very obvious to all of us that this is a penal clause, in that, if any group of officers of a local authority take strike action, not alone will they lose their salaries for the period they are out on strike, but they lose altogether their previous service for pensionable purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot find any parallel for that in my experience.  I was wondering exactly why the Minister finds it necessary to put in this penal clause in relation to the officers of local authorities. As Senator McHugh pointed out, it was withdrawn in relation to the servants of local authorities.  I do not know whether I read the papers sufficiently, but I have not seen any account of a local authority being <Col N="1409" /> bedevilled by wildcat strikes of local authority officers.  I think all will agree that there is very little probability of local authority officers taking strike action in support of any particular claim.  What then is the need for this sub-section?</P>
    <P>I say very definitely that these people have a right to take strike action.  I should say in conjunction with that that I should hope that right would never be exercised, but the right should not be taken from them.  It has not been taken from them in so many words here as such, but it has been effectively taken from them in that their past service for pensionable purposes is lost to them, if they take such action.  Civil servants, as such, have not the right to take strike action.  I think that is correct, but local authority officials are not regarded as civil servants.  I notice in this measure dealing with super annuation that local authority officials have a deduction made from their salaries for superannuation purposes.  Civil servants, as such, have not.</P>
    <P>The Minister might be happier about this clause if he could tell us that there was adequate machinery for dealing with any disputes in relation to these officers.  I remember some months ago raising this question of negotiating machinery when dealing with some other Local Government Bill and I think that, so far, there is no machinery for dealing with the salaries and conditions of service of these local authority officials.  I may be very innocent, but I think the Minister, when dealing with this matter on the Second Stage, referred to doctors going to races at Clounanna.  He then, so far as I remember, evaded the point I made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly interested in this clause because the people we are dealing with here are not rash people.  There is very little likelihood that they would ever take strike action, even if there was not this penal clause which takes away their previous pensionable service, if they ever found <Col N="1410" /> it necessary to take strike action in support of their claims.</P>
      <P>The Minister very well knows that there is very little likelihood of such a thing happening.  I think the rules of this union, the Local Government Officers' Union, provide that they must have a two-thirds majority, if they are to take strike action.  I do not know whether they have ever taken strike action, but certainly they have not, to my knowledge.  I do not know if there is any possibility that they would do so in the future, but certainly I hope not.</P>
      <P>My opposition to this sub-section is not to encourage any such group to take strike action or to strengthen their hand in taking it.  My opposition is against the principle of depriving them of the rights given to them under the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The Government subscribes to certain I.L.O. conventions, and, whilst the Minister in this section says in effect that these officers have no right to go on strike, he and we all know this is what the section means and it penalises these officers, if they should do that.  I appeal to the Minister to withdraw this sub-section from the Bill.  There is no need for it.  It is a penal clause which is uncalled for in this present legislation.  It is applied only to the officers and not to servants of the public authorities.  It is a sub-section which applies to these individuals who would be more unlikely than any others to take strike action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bergin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support everything that has been said by the previous speaker and by Senator O'Connell.  I am sure that both speakers have covered the ground fully.  For my part, I should like to go back to the word &ldquo;unfitness&rdquo; contained in this sub-section, because the Minister's explanation seems to refer to constitutional unfitness and to sickness. Under this sub-section, if a person becomes unfit while in the service, he loses not only his job but also his pension rights.  I think that that is a peculiar word to use in this Bill and if enshrined in this legislation, it would be quite dangerous because I can recall an occurrence which took place in <Col N="1411" /> this city some years ago, in connection with a student body.  One of the vocational schools in the city invited a speaker to address them and a teacher decided that the lecturer was unfit.  As far as I know, no reason was given for that decision.  Since then, I have got to know the person concerned very well and I could not see any reason why he should be described as unfit to lecture on that occasion.  That shows that one individual can decide the fitness or otherwise of any person in the service.</P>
      <P>Other reasons given for unfitness can be bad health or old age, and I suppose, dipsomania could be advanced as a reason for unfitness.</P>

Therefore, a person who finds himself holding ideals not generally accepted, or only part accepted by a particular officer, could find himself considered to be unfit for his post, and in those circumstances his pension rights could be taken away from him.  That word leaves a bad taste in my mouth and is akin to some of the most objectionable phrases which I have heard from far across the water in recent years.</P>

      <P>I put the servants out of the Bill.  Let us take this section as it stands.  It merely refers to officers and says that officers who have served certain periods become entitled to pensions, with certain exceptions. Senator Murphy has repeatedly pointed out that the Local Government Officials' Union have never yet been involved in a strike and he cannot visualise them being involved.  Therefore, we must deal with individual cases and not with a body.  That is what I gather from the debate&mdash;that they are not the type of people to involve themselves in strikes and, therefore, we may have individual cases.</P>
      <P>Section 10, sub-section (d), says that an officer is entitled to a pension, provided he has served a certain time, except for any period during which he was discharged from his office for misconduct or unfitness.  Take the case of an officer who is in the employment of a local authority and has served a sufficient number of years to qualify for a pension.  Suppose he becomes a dipsomaniac and says: &ldquo;I am going to continue to drink.  I will continue to serve until I am 65.  Then I will have 40 years' service and you cannot stop me.&rdquo;  What is the local authority's position in such a case.  They can sack him without a pension, but here we say that, first, it may threaten him and advise him to pull himself together or they will deduct the years he has served up to the present for superannuation purposes.  That is not striking at the right of the officer.  He has, should that occur, the right of appeal to the Minister, and if he can prove to the Minister that he has made an effort to pull himself together, I am sure the Minister will consider his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a case where he could, through misconduct or refusal to become <Col N="1413" /> abstemious become unfit, but suppose he goes further, and, as a result of his indulgence, becomes unfit. The same threat is made, and he is cautioned that he will lose his pension rights, but again he has the right of appeal to the Minister.  I think it is rational and reasonable that he is given this caution, that all his past service will go for nought, unless he pulls himself together.  The Minister is the person who will decide finally and I believe that is reasonable.  Remember what Senator Murphy pointed out is that we are dealing with a body of individuals and that there is not much likelihood of them striking.</P>

      <P>I understand Senator Hickey's point of view.  It was clearly put by Senator Murphy that we are dealing with individuals, and not a body and that they have never gone on strike.</P>
      <P>Come now to paragraph (f), which deals with an officer who absents himself from the place where he performs his duty in a local authority or deliberately refrains from performing the duties.  Do not let us forget the last emergency.  We had certain commissioned officers in the Army who deliberately deserted because they thought a particular side was going to invade this country and that they would have an opportunity of coming in on the winning side.  One can imagine, for instance, an emergency arising again.  One can imagine an invasion by X country and certain sympathisers with X deliberately absenting themselves and joining the forces of this invading country.  Is it not right that we, if we could repel the invasion, should have the right to forfeit the years of service which those gentlemen had incurred for pension purposes?  That is one case I can visualise.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with individuals, as Senator Murphy has pointed out.  He has in this case been dealing with individuals.  I am in full agreement with him that this is not a case where we are dealing with classes, but with individuals, and, that being so, look at the damage that could be done by the deliberate absence of these officers of the local authorities. Who is to control them?  Surely we are entitled to tell them, first of all: &ldquo;Watch yourself, you are going to <Col N="1415" /> forfeit years of service, if you do not&rdquo;, and then tell them that if they persist in their attitude, they must go to the arbitrator who in this case will be the Minister.

      <P>I have every respect for the trade unions, but we are here discussing a different section, and I think I am being very fair.  Some Senators have referred to civil servants. Senator Murphy has stated that there is no parallel for this section, but there is no doubt that local officers are in an analagous position with the Civil Service, and this provision in the Civil Service goes away back as far as 1865. Some Senators are inclined to imagine that we are trying in this section to refer to strike action.  If we were referring to strike action, then we would have included servants in this section, because again we come back to that argument advanced by Senator Murphy that we are dealing with individuals. There is no doubt that a strike by servants is quite legitimate, in my opinion, and we have provided for it, in that if they went outside the 200 days' absence permitted, there is legislation to cover them for pension purposes.  We are not trying in this section to hit at strikers, but we are trying to hit at individuals who, through misconduct or unfitness, fail to carry out their duties, or who voluntarily and deliberately absent themselves from their duties.</P>
      <P>We have no intention of referring to strikes.  If we had, we would have included the servants.  We are trying to get at the individual and, in my opinion, this is the only way in which we can do it.  We have gone a long way towards meeting the Senator's point of view by excluding the servants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I think most Senators will agree with me on two points.  The first is that when the Minister for Local Government comes before us, he comes with his brief extremely well prepared.  He knows the legislation he is going to put before us.  He knows the pitfalls.  I think we will all agree that, in nine cases out of ten, he answers the point made extremely cogently.  The second point upon which I think we would agree is that the Minister tends, by reason of this first fact, to be singularly inflexible. I cannot remember the Minister ever having accepted any amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put it this way, then.  I can remember the Minister resisting with all the force and passion of his oratory, nine amendments out of ten, and only in the last ditch, as it were, accepting any amendments, and, not quite regarding them as a personal insult when he had to accept them, but certainly not accepting them without a very considerable, and, I might say, skilful struggle.  I suggest he has been a little disingenuous in relation to this present matter because, on the one hand, as Senator Bergin has said, if a man happens to be a dipsomaniac and is to be dismissed for that reason, it is because he is no longer fit to do his job.  The Minister submitted the view to us this evening, and asked us if we did not think it was better for such a man to be given a pension than the sack.  Of course, we all agreed, but the Minister now asks for the power to give him the sack, without any pension.  The only thing that will prevent that from happening is an appeal to one person, appeal to the Minister himself&mdash;not to an arbitration tribunal&mdash;no representation of the man's union.  The Minister himself is the only barrier we have between justice and injustice in such a case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has just said it seems reasonable that when a man indulges in some &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; or what he even called the &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; of refusing to give up drink, if he was a dipsomaniac&mdash;again, I understood the <Col N="1417" /> Minister to agree that the dipsomania might, in fact, be beyond his control or might be an infirmity&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Not &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo;. I said &ldquo;unfitness&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking subject to correction but if my recollection serves me well I think the Minister used only the word &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; and spoke of the &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; of refusing to give up drink in this case.  I think the record will bear me out and, if it does not, I withdraw it. In effect, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Should we not have a right there to deduct the years served, and so forth?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would answer emphatically: &ldquo;No.&rdquo; And I would underline that word of the Minister&mdash;&ldquo;deduct&rdquo; years of service. &ldquo;Deduct&rdquo; is the wrong word. He means &ldquo;wipe out&rdquo; all the man's service&mdash;20 years have been suggested but it might be 30 years&mdash;in relation to pension.  There is no &ldquo;deduction.&rdquo;  It is a &ldquo;wiping out&rdquo;, and that is what the Minister is asking us to grant him the right to do.</P>
      <P>I suggest, in relation to dipsomania, since that has been mentioned, that perhaps the best cure would be to put the man out on pension, because the sort of niggardly pension envisaged here will certainly very considerably cut down the amount of drink he will be able to buy for himself!  An appeal to the Minister is again the only barrier. It seems to me to confer on the Minister&mdash;upon any Minister&mdash;too much power&mdash;power almost of life and death over not only the man but his family, the power to deprive him of his pension rights when he might be quite advanced in years and incapable of finding any other work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I should like to see the whole principle of pensions related to the work done.  I should like to see pensions regarded as, in a sense, part of the salary.  It is quite obvious that people apply for certain jobs with pensions and put up with certain niggardly salaries, because the jobs have pensions, and the pension is a right vested in the job of which the worker should certainly not be deprived <Col N="1418" /> too lightly or indeed deprived, I think, at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister painted a lurid picture of local officers deserting and joining an invading army, coming in at the head of an army, and suggested that it is for the purpose of avoiding this kind of thing happening that we have to have these clauses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I said the tail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>If this army is successful, the Minister will be replaced and consequently these men coming even at the tail of the army would be able to appeal to their new Minister and get their pension in that way.  The Minister is allowing his imagination to go too far by suggesting that we have no other way of dealing with a man who deserts his country and fights in the armed forces of another country to invade this country, that we have no way of depriving him of his pension unless we pass this Bill, including these sections!  I suggest that the Minister is stating his case in an extremely exaggerated way.</P>
      <P>I would put it to the Seanad that it is, in fact, intolerable to imagine a man, after 30 years of work, being put in the position of having no more pension rights than if he had done no work at all.  That is what we are asked to do under two of these paragraphs&mdash;to deprive the man not of a proportion of his pension rights but of his total rights, after a considerable period of work decently and honestly done, which are all to be wiped out in an inexorable way by these clauses, if we accept them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I am afraid the Minister went a bit too far when he suggested that one of the reasons in his mind when he decided to exclude &ldquo;servants&rdquo; but to include &ldquo;officers&rdquo; was that the servants are a class&mdash;he used the word &ldquo;class&rdquo;.  Are we going to allow class legislation to be included here?  He went further.  He said they had a union behind them.  That was not very flattering for any union that may represent the officers.  He went so far as to say that servants &ldquo;have a union behind them&rdquo;.  The implication <Col N="1419" /> was, therefore, that, because the officers are not so well organised, because their union is more easily brought to heel, we will grant them less.  I would regard that as an unwarrantable class distinction.  I do not think it can be described in any other terms.  Consequently, I would very strongly appeal to the Minister to reconsider this, and to demonstrate, shall I say, yet once more, that he is capable of having second thoughts and accepting amendments or, if not accepting amendments, inserting even better amendments himself on the Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister was not particularly happy in the examples he quoted for us.  Take the case of an emergency.  Is it to be assumed for a moment that we should write into a Bill intended for ordinary times&mdash;non-emergency times&mdash;that will last for a number of years something that will apply only in the case of an emergency?  If any officer were to do the kind of things he suggested might be done in an emergency, surely there is a way of dealing with them.  In the case of an emergency, the Government have all power; and, if I were a member of a Government during an emergency and if an officer did the things or attempted to do the things that the Minister suggested he might do, then I would not be content with depriving him of his pension, but would do something very much more drastic with him.  But it is not good enough, I think, to bring into ordinary legislation for everyday use something which would apply only in the case of an emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is this other matter.  I do not agree with what Senator Murphy said&mdash;or rather the interpretation the Minister took out of what he said&mdash; that there would not be a strike on the part of State or local authority officers. I was speaking the last day, and I am speaking to-day, about a particular body&mdash;the vocational teachers.  These people are well organised&mdash;they have a union behind them&mdash;and there may be circumstances in which they would feel compelled to strike.  I will give you an instance of the kind of thing, <Col N="1420" /> because it actually has occurred. During the Second Reading, the Minister said that in this Bill the officers of local authorities were, in the main, like civil servants.  There were some differences about contributions, but they were treated as civil servants.  I will give an instance.  There was an award made some time ago to civil servants&mdash;I think it was a 7½ per cent. increase.  It was applied, or intended to be applied, to vocational teachers, amongst others.  The vocational teachers in a certain county&mdash;I will tell the Minister which county if he wishes&mdash; have refused to honour that award.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; the vocational committee have refused to honour that award.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the kind of democracy that the union might be forced to strike against.  It is quite possible that the vocational teachers employed by that body might feel themselves that it was the only way they had left&mdash;to strike&mdash;and, if they are prevented from exercising that right, which they are given in the Constitution, by this deterrent, put there especially to stop them, I think that would be a case where a strike might be well justified.</P>
      <P>I do not want to dwell any further on the case made by the Minister about the dipsomaniacs.  I do not know how many of these there are in the service of local authorities, but, again, surely there ought to be a way of dealing with that individual, without threatening the whole service with this deterrent.  I am sure the Minister and his officials could find a great many ways of dealing with individuals of that kind, and that there would be plenty of opportunities of dealing with them, without putting in this regulation that applies to the whole body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These officials are responsible people. They are the kind of people who do not like to be threatened.  They feel themselves placed under a cloud of <Col N="1421" /> suspicion, by this assumption that they would not do their duty.  We have 12,000 to 15,000 national teachers, and although many queer things were done in regard to them, it was never thought necessary to put in a deterrent of this kind, that they would lose their service. They went on strike for a period of eight months.  They lost all that period of service, and no one is grumbling about that, but when they went back into service, all the pensionable service that they had before that was to their credit.</P>
    <P>As I say, there have been no great abuses in the case of national teachers. Maybe there were one or two, but there are ways of dealing with them, if they do not do their duty.  Their salaries can be stopped&mdash;and ought to be stopped&mdash;if they absent themselves without authority or deliberately&mdash;and their pensions for that period of their absence may be stopped and they may lose their rights of promotion, and so on.  But it is a terrible penalty to an officer, who is looking forward at the end of his days to something to support himself when he leaves his job, to be deprived of 20 or 30 years' service for pensionable purposes, and to be thrown out at the end of his long service with a miserable pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I must have wronged the Minister completely because he has now explained to us that the provisions in this section are required to deal with cases of individual discipline.  He has explained that, in order to give the Minister discretion in disciplining individual members, he should have the right to cancel their previous service for superannuation purposes.  In regard to that point, might I say that I have no knowledge of any such provision in other superannuation funds?  I have knowledge of superannuation funds in other services where the member of the superannuation fund pays a certain proportion of his salary equal to that paid by the employer and, if he is dismissed for any purpose later on, the portion which he has paid in to the superannuation fund is his own property. There is no doubt at all that, if he decides to leave, it is still his own <Col N="1422" /> property.  If he is dismissed for anything, it is still his own property, except that the employer has always a lien on the employee's contributions for any money which he might have stolen.  I think that is all right.</P>
      <P>That is not the point I was making to the Minister.  I should say that I think he is taking too much power here altogether for that individual discipline, but I was not quarrelling with him when I rose to oppose sub-section (f) on this point.  He has assured us, however, that it is not intended as an instrument to deal with group discipline; in other words, it is not intended to deter or prevent strike action by a group.  I will put him to the test, however, in regard to that and I will ask him, if it is not his intention, as he said, to prevent strike action or to deter&mdash;I am not quoting his words exactly because I do not remember them, but I think I have the general sense of what he said&mdash;and to test him I will ask if he will be putting in an amendment on Report Stage, to add on to paragraph (f) a provision that it does not apply to any absence in pursuance of a trade dispute.  Perhaps the wording I suggest is not the proper wording, but I think the Minister knows very well what I mean. If he is sincere in his assurances here to-night, in telling us that it is not a group deterrent, that it is not to prevent strike action, that it is simply intended to deal with individual cases of discipline, again, let him give us that assurance and I, for my part, will be prepared to sit down and not say any more about paragraph (f) of Section 10.</P>

He tries to make it appear that, so long as that appeal is there, everything is all right and that there is no risk whatever of hardship or injustice.  The Minister appears to take the view that, so long as the Minister, being a generous and kind-hearted man, as I know he is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not make any provision for the fact that there might be a change of Government and that we might not have the kind-hearted men acting in a quasi-judicial capacity.  Even Rome fell and the Minister should have some regard to the verdict of history.  He should look back and remember that even Rome fell, and you might have in those quasi-judicial positions men who would not be kind-hearted or who would not be as judicial or judicious, as they should be.</P>
      <P>That is really the corner stone of the Minister's case in respect of sub-section (f), together with a hypothesis that could hardly arise when the Minister referred to the possibility of officers of a local authority deserting their posts to join with some invader and coming in as the leaders of an invading army. If that is the argument put forward in justification of that sub-section, surely the Minister should know that treason has ever been regarded as treason and for quite a long time it has been dealt with as it should be.</P>

In practice, here is what happens.  A manager suspends or dismisses an officer and there is an appeal, but the file or the statement of claim, if you like, is compiled by whom before it goes to the Minister? I think that should register with the Minister.  I am serious now because I think I have some cases in mind where there might have been miscarriages of justice.  It is better to err on the side of the individual.  The statement of claim is compiled, I suggest, by the local authority, or, in other words, by the manager.  If I am wrong, the Minister can correct me.</P>

      <P>That is so, but because I was jocose in regard to other matters, I do not want to suggest that the present Minister would not be as fair as he could be and as kind-hearted as he could be in dealing with any officer.  The fact is that the county manager may have prejudices, since he is human, just as a judge can have them.  He can also have pride, and pride and prejudice could ensure that an injustice would be done.  Once an officer is suspended it is a dangerous situation for that person, despite the fact the Senator Murphy does not appear to be interested so long as it does not refer to a group of persons.  The Minister is quite right when he says it deals with individuals.</P>
      <P>When a man who has worked for 25 years, given good and faithful service and contributed to a fund to create a pension right for himself discovers that he is suddenly deprived of that right which he purchased by reason of paying into a superannuation fund&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">

      <P>It is wrong to deprive an officer of a pension right since he has paid into the fund, even if he is removed from office for a good reason as being unfit.  I think, in ordinary justice, he is entitled to the pension right he has purchased over the period <Col N="1426" /> during which he gave good and faithful service.  I think common justice demands that.  It is not just to wield the big stick in this section to deprive him of that right.  The Minister was defining unfitness earlier in this debate. He mentioned constitutional unfitness. I was at a loss to know whether the Minister meant the Constitution of the State or the constitution of the individual.  Perhaps the Minister, when replying, might tell us which he did mean.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wish to make one further observation before the Minister replies to the challenge Senator Murphy has put to him, or the queries he has posed.  I do so to point out that I do not really think the addition of words to sub-section (f) in itself would record clearly and definitely enough the assurance that the Minister has expressed.  I am prepared to accept in all good faith every assurance the Minister has given the House, but what troubles me and many other members of the House is obviously the fact that we could, and probably will, be dealing with many other Ministers under this Act, if and when it is enacted.</P>
      <P>I want particularly to point out that even the addition to sub-section (f) of words providing that absence from duty in the legitimate pursuance of a trade dispute would not of itself remove some of the objectionable parts of this section.  If we look back for a moment to sub-section (d), we find the use of the terms &ldquo;misconduct&rdquo; and &ldquo;unfitness&rdquo;. Quite clearly, we have to visualise that we could, perhaps, be dealing with a local authority or a Minister eventually who would put an interpretation of unfitness or misconduct on some of the officers of the local authority who would in fact engage in a trade dispute.  For that reason, I want to say that it is my intention on the Report Stage to put down a further amendment to this section.  The Minister might, perhaps, note that before offering his reply to Senator Murphy.</P>

      <P>Having heard particularly the two Senators whose amendments to this section were ruled out of order, and having heard them <Col N="1427" /> themselves tell us in their opening speeches that they expected that this decision would be made by the Chair, we had quite a long time of the House taken up to decide what procedure we should adopt before we began the discussion on this Bill.  Be that as it may, the Minister, having a very bad case, adopted an approach in regard to this section of making up his mind that the best thing he could do was as far as possible to distract the attention of the House from what the section proposed to do.</P>
      <P>Speaking to an earlier amendment of mine to Section 7, he pointed out that the officers to whom he referred were responsible persons and were, in the main, appointed on the recommendation of the Appointments Commission, or other various means set up of competitive examinations and so forth by the local authority, whether it was functioning through the county manager or not.  He said that all those officers were responsible officers, and, further, that they were pensionable. Therefore, I hold that this section as far as it relates to officers of local authorities is unnecessary, because those people have already their pension rights provided for under the terms of their contract of employment with the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In making the case for the section, and particularly for the sub-section to which the Senators referred, the Minister drew an analogy with a dispensary doctor who was not in a position to perform the duties assigned to him, and argued that surely the House did not expect that that person should be allowed to continue in the service without somebody having the responsibility of making a decision to terminate his employment and, further, to deprive him of years of service he had already given.  Before this Bill was printed, and as a matter of fact since 1868, the Minister for Local Government, or whatever Department functioned in control of dispensary officers and like employees of a local authority, had the authority and right to remove such persons from office, and to either add or subtract terms of years from their employment, and so forth.  Therefore, <Col N="1428" /> the point I wish to make, regarding the picture drawn for us by the Minister of the necessity for this Bill to deal with those officers who were not acting through an organisation, but were acting as individuals, is that the Department has already sufficient power and has down the years exercised its powers in various ways.</P>
    <P>Hardly a Senator has not had the experience of being on a deputation to the Department of Local Government or the Department of Health, whichever it may be, in relation to action taken in connection with an employee of a local authority such as the Minister has pointed out.  Before we make a decision as to whether we should or should not reject this section in its entirety or try to amend it and make it more acceptable on the Report Stage, I should like to have from the Minister some more definite information as to what groups of officers of local authorities this section will affect. It cannot affect persons who already will be employed, through the fact that their employment carries pensions without any deduction being made from them.  The best thing the Minister could do is to withdraw the section and to resubmit a section giving power, if the power is necessary, to the Minister to do the things that may be required to be done and which I hold this section does not do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerMcHugh" hpid="Dr. McHugh Dr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice of my intention, on the Adjournment, to call the attention of the Government to the conflict of opinion regarding the proposed new municipal building at Wood Quay, Dublin, and the conflict between the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland and Dublin Corporation, and, in view of the consequent public uneasiness regarding the project of the municipal building, to suggest Government mediation in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the Minister has left us with several headaches over this Local Government (Superannuation) Bill, <Col N="1429" /> among them the headache of deciding when, for example, unfitness becomes infirmity when we do not know what unfitness is.  The Minister may think I am putting down this motion in revenge in order to give him a headache. That is not the case, of course. I am paying him the compliment of thinking he would be an admirable person to offer to intervene or mediate in this current dispute.</P>
    <P>The dispute, as Senators are aware, is about the proposed site of the new municipal building, which is bounded on the south by the Liffey, on the north by Christ Church and on the east and west by Fishamble and Winetavern Streets.  It is a site which is conspicuously historic and which demands extremely careful planning. The criticisms which have been made of the plans of Dublin Corporation, the published plans, appear to me to fall under roughly four heads.  The first is that the planning appears to have been unduly rushed.  The selected architects were given a very short time to prepare the plans, and, in fact, were placed under a very severe penalty of £100 a day for delay over the stated period.  There also seems to be a certain amount of uneasiness due to the confusion over the type of building intended. The corporation, on the one hand, in correspondence with the Royal Institute of Architects, maintain that they propose a simple building which cannot be regarded as a municipal building in the accepted sense of the term.  On the other hand, the plans which have been published appear to be those of grandiose and monumental buildings.</P>
    <P>On technical grounds, the institute have levelled certain criticisms against the plans.  For example, they show offices only on one side of the corridor, whereas, in modern planning of large offices, the reverse is the case, and it seems to the institute that this present planning, with offices only along one side of the corridor is wasteful of space and is bound to increase cost. Also there is a good deal of public uneasiness over the cost among taxpayers and ratepayers because there seems to be a considerable disparity between the amount visualised by the corporation, which is roughly £500,000, <Col N="1430" /> and that roughly estimated by the institute, which is between £1,500,000 and £2,000,000.  There is the further fact that the plans show land being built on which is not at present the property of Dublin Corporation at all.</P>
    <P>The result has been that professional comment has been extremely critical. The <i>Irish Architect and Contractor</i> has already criticised in an editorial the proposed building and it is pointed out, with some dismay, that, where you have the modern bus station, or modern airport, or even the modern factory applauded when it is contemporary in style, the style envisaged in this proposed new municipal building is about 30 years out of date.  Some criticism has also been levelled in the English <i>Architects' Journal</i>, and I would like to quote very briefly from the issue of 6th October, 1955.  It says: &ldquo;We have our fair share of rubbish in this country, but it is mainly sponsored by the dimmer forms of private enterprise. No major city in this country, down to the level of Cardiff, say, would allow its corporation to be housed in the type of building shown here&rdquo;&mdash;it shows a sketch of the proposed buildings&mdash;&ldquo;but bearing in mind the trouble Michael Scott had over his bus station, one might well surmise from this latest effort that the phase for modern architecture is over, or ending, in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I find among the architectural graduates a great deal of uneasiness over these various criticisms which have been levelled against the proposed plans.  I do not speak as an architect, but as one who is bound to meet architects, and I find them extremely uneasy about the whole project.  Some of them feel that the contention of the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland that the plans are wasteful of space, destructive of the amenities of the river bank and in basic conflict with the Abercrombie plan, is correct.  Whether it is or is not correct, it is quite certain that the conflict between the institute and the Dublin Corporation has caused widespread uneasiness.  The average Dubliner is fond of his native city and likes to see it well done for, and all Irishmen, I think, would like to see the capital's historic sights properly preserved and <Col N="1431" /> added to in the best contemporary style.  Young architects, in particular, feel there is little chance for contemporary architecture, which they are versed in, if buildings of obsolete style are to be erected.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in the hope that the Government would perhaps exercise its good offices to allay this uneasiness by mediation, I have raised this matter. I have raised it briefly and, I think, in the most correct form because I think a motion which would have divided the House would be a bad thing.  I have raised it in a form which would enable the Minister perhaps to mediate.  I believe he is quite capable of dealing with this very difficult problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. P. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirleach, there is no proposal before me indicating what offices are to be built, to what design they are to be planned and where exactly they are to be located. If and when these plans are submitted to me, it would be my duty to examine them with reference to the propriety of sanctioning the loan and sanctioning the proposal.  Where a proposal of the public importance of this project is involved, the usual procedure is to hold a <Col N="1432" /> public inquiry into it before I finally decide whether to sanction the loan or not.  All persons interested, whether from the financial, architectural, or aesthetic points of view, or any other point of view, can then attend and give evidence.</P>
      <P>Alternatively, the question of locating civic premises on this site may come up in connection with the draft town plan.  Here, again, an inquiry can be held and the planning and all cognate aspects can be inquired into. In either case, the Government mediation referred to in this motion can then be exercised through me.  My intervention prior to the submission of proposals by the corporation is neither practicable nor desirable.  It would be informal intervention, arising out of which any recommendation made by me would bind nobody but myself, and bind myself in a most undesirable way as affecting my functions as the authority sanctioning a loan, or the authority approving of a town plan.</P>
      <P>Before I conclude, may I say that I feel I can rely on the corporation to take every step possible to limit any financial commitment, even of a preliminary nature, to the minimum, until there is a final decision available as to the need for and the details of the scheme.</P>
