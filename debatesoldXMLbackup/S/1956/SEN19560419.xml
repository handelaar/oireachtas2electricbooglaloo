      <P>It is proposed to take Items Nos. 1, 2 and 3 and motion No. 6, presuming the other business is finished in time.  Nos. 4 and 5 will not be taken nor will motion No. 7.  I think, in the light of business in the other House, the House will have to adjourn <i>sine die</i>, but would presumably meet in about a fortnight.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Seanad Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Restrictive Trade Practices (Confirmation of Order) Bill, 1955, until a complete transcript of the evidence presented before the Fair Trade Commission is made available for the consideration of members of the Oireachtas in view of the fact that representatives of the radio trade who gave evidence before the commission have publicly stated that certain sections of the report on which the Restrictive Trade Practices (Radios) Order, 1955, is based are, in their entirety, or in part, contrary to the evidence submitted at the inquiry.&mdash;(Senator Douglas.)</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to enter into the merits of this report about which I have not sufficient <Col N="1880" /> information.  The few remarks I shall make will be devoted to the procedure in respect of the regulation of restrictive practices in this country.  Everybody is agreed that restrictive practices should be regulated.  When I say &ldquo;everybody&rdquo; I mean nearly everybody, because I know some people do not agree with the principle.  However, nearly everybody is agreed that restrictive practices must be regulated by law, but the question arises what type of regulation is the most effective. It seems to me that this debate illustrates very lucidly some of the advantages and some of the difficulties of the legislation adopted in this country.</P>
      <P>There are two main types of procedure in this matter&mdash;an administrative tribunal or a judicial tribunal.  In this country, we have come down on the side, temporarily, at any rate, of an administrative tribunal reporting to the Minister.  In England, on the other hand, a Bill is going through the House of Commons adopting the principle of a judicial tribunal.  I think there is a great deal to be said on both sides, and I think this Bill gives us an opportunity of saying a few words generally on the matter, apart from the particular report on which it is based.</P>
      <P>The arguments against the judicial hearing of applications of this kind are, in the first place, that it is bringing the judges into politics.  The judges are being asked to decide economic and social issues which are outside their proper function.  It is also said that judicial proceedings are long. There well may be appeals and there may be a great deal of delay and procrastination before a decision is come to.  The President of the Board of Trade, in introducing the Restrictive Practices Bill in the House of Commons, said it was his opinion that the administrative type of procedure, which we have in this country, is more dilatory and creates more procrastination, that it involves a great deal of delay and a great deal of uncertainty, and that that is why the British Government have come down on the side of a judicial tribunal in these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the present debate is a very good example of some of the em <Col N="1881" /> barrassments caused by the Irish type of procedure.  But, in saying this, I want to be perfectly clear, beyond all manner of doubt, that I am not in any way casting any aspersion of any kind on the members of the tribunal.  In fact, I want to say that the discussion by the public and by the Legislature is greatly aided by their very valuable report.  I do not propose to delay the House for more than a few minutes; but I want to pay tribute to the excellent manner in which the tribunal has discharged its very difficult and very onerous work and to the great value of its report in these discussions.</P>
    <P>The difficulty that I see about the Irish system of procedure is that it becomes almost impossible to avoid having the issue put before the tribunal debated at least twice&mdash;once by the Dáil and once by the Seanad. That is why I agree on the whole with the attitude of the British Government on this matter, that a judicial inquiry is more rapid, more certain and takes the matter out of current political discussion more than our procedure does.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1953 could have adopted two different lines of procedure, and it seems to me that there is a dilemma involved.  The Act could have authorised the Fair Trade Tribunal to make a report to the Minister and make an Order embodying the findings of that report, without referring the matter to the Dáil or Seanad.  That, to my mind, would have been very objectionable because it would have given to the Minister entirely undue administrative power, without parliamentary responsibility.  Possibly I am old-fashioned and possibly my legal training has given me more than average respect for the rule of law and for the importance of subordinating all activities to the jurisdiction of the courts; but I must say, whether it is as a result of that training or not, or as a result of my experience for a few years as chairman of the Statutory Orders Committee in this House, I feel it is very much in the public interest that discretionary Orders by the Minister and by the Government should be reduced to the narrowest possible limits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to the Cathaoirleach, but I am about to come to the other horn of the dilemma which involves the defects of parliamentary debate and, with great respect, I might ask you to allow me to proceed for just a few minutes.  Then, if you still think I am out of order, I shall sit down; but I suggest that what I am about to say is directly relevant to the amendment before the House, because I am speaking specifically on the amendment, and it is to the amendment that I now propose to address myself.</P>
      <P>The administrative Order by the Minister is one horn of the dilemma which I, as a constitutional lawyer, am inclined to regard with disfavour.  The other horn is that the Minister's Order should be the subject of a Bill.  That is the procedure adopted here.  Hence, we have this Bill before us; hence we have these debates; hence we have these amendments; and hence, I would say, these delays and uncertainties in dealing with the question of restrictive trade practices.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House, especially as you, Sir, seem to think that there is some question as to whether or not I am strictly in order, but I ask you to bear with me for a few more minutes on this amendment. The objection to the second course, as I see it, is that it is quite impossible for you, Sir, or for the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil, or for anybody else to prevent the issues before the Fair Trade Commission being fully discussed on their merits a second time in the Seanad and in the Dáil.  That is what we were engaged on yesterday and are now engaged on to-day.  I would suggest that discussions of that kind are dilatory and hold up the operation of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act; they really involve, in fact, hearing the issues a second time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to go back to the amendment of Senator Douglas.  As I said, if the constitutional attitude is taken that reports of this tribunal should, before being put into operation, be the subject of legislation, I cannot see how it is possible to avoid having all the <Col N="1883" /> issues re-discussed fully in the Dáil and Seanad, and all the issues, which can be quietly, impartially and in a detached manner discussed by the tribunal, being made the subject of political debate, with the Press present, and all the affairs of the particular trade being aired in the newspapers for public consumption.  In other words, it seems to me that the Irish procedure involves us in this dilemma: you either give too much power to the Executive without parliamentary responsibility, or you give too much publicity to the issue by full-dress debates in the Dáil and Seanad on the matters already discussed by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I wish now to approach directly the subject of the amendment and I would ask you to believe me that I am not, in my opinion, being irrelevant, although I bow to the Chair.  If a discussion of this kind takes place, it will naturally be based on the report of the tribunal, and it seems to me it is a very valuable function of the tribunal to provide the Dáil and Seanad with the raw material for a formal discussion on subjects to which they have been directing their attention.  But if, in addition to the report which is before us as a public document, circulated to every member of the Dáil and Seanad, a full transcript of all the evidence and of all the proceedings which took place before the commission is also to be made available to us, it seems to me that in that case our procedure here will amount to a re-hearing of an impartial inquiry which, if I may say so, was not the intention of the framers of the Act.</P>
    <P>There are certain difficulties about this amendment.  The first is that the Fair Trade Commission is not bound to keep a transcript of its proceedings. Secondly, it is not bound to provide anybody with a copy of the transcript, if it does keep it.  Thirdly, part of the proceedings are heard in private and, if a transcript of that part of the proceedings is kept, it would be a breach of privacy and secrecy on the part of the commission for that part of the transcript to be made available to the Dáil and Seanad.  Lastly, if the transcript is in two parts, one part of which <Col N="1884" /> is available and the other part of which is not available, the Dáil and Seanad would be asked to re-hear all the issues before the commission on part of the evidence only and not on the whole of the evidence.  Therefore, it seems to me that if this amendment is accepted and if, in addition to the report of the tribunal itself, all the evidence that has been tendered in public and in private, and all the remarks of counsel and of witnesses and of everybody present at the tribunal were brought before the Dáil and Seanad, really what we would be asked to do&mdash;the 60 members of this House and the 147 members of the Dáil&mdash;would be, without the expert assistance of counsel, to re-hear all the issues involved and debate these issues entirely on their merits.</P>
    <P>Now, as I said, in the Irish procedure, we cannot avoid having a debate on the merits of the issue.  The matter is embodied in a Bill which is brought before both the Houses.  The purpose of that is to enable both Houses to debate the issues afresh.  I think that is the lesser evil as against the alternative of a ministerial Order without any Bill in the Legislature at all.  I think it is the lesser evil of the two.  But if the Dáil and Seanad are to discuss not merely what they read in the report, but also all the evidence and all the remarks of counsel available to the tribunal, then it seems to me we are constituting ourselves into something like a court of appeal on a matter in which we have not really got the expert knowledge requisite to come to a decision.  That is why, addressing myself purely to the amendment, I feel that to provide the Dáil and Seanad with a transcript of evidence would be, as I said, involving us in functions which it is not our duty to perform.</P>
    <P>In deference to your ruling, I do not propose to say what I originally meant to say&mdash;I am afraid to do so&mdash;as to what I consider to be the superior merits of the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill now before the British House of Commons.  I can only state that, in my opinion, it is a better way of tackling this problem.  May I say, however, that if a judicial decision is come to by the Fair Trade Commission, or by a judicial tribunal, <Col N="1885" /> no other body, be it a House of Parliament or, as is the case in England, the Court of Appeal, is entitled to set aside the findings of the tribunal merely because it disagrees with its conclusions.  Even if all the evidence were available here and if we had the full transcript, assuming it was available and assuming it could be put at our disposal without a breach of confidence and assuming that, having read it, we all unanimously came to the conclusion that the Fair Trade Commission's opinion was against the weight of evidence&mdash;speaking now subject to correction by some of the eminent lawyers in this House&mdash;I would suggest that would not be a reason, of itself, for refusing to implement the findings of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The general rule in regard to appeal on questions of weight of evidence is that, unless the finding of the lower tribunal is so flagrantly against the weight of evidence that no reasonable man could find the way the tribunal did, the higher court is not entitled to set the original finding aside: and I suggest that, even if that evidence were available here and even if we unanimously agreed that the findings of the Fair Trade Commission seemed to us, at any rate, to be against the weight of evidence, we would still be transcending our responsibilities, our functions and our powers, if we refused to implement the report simply because we were of that opinion.</P>
    <P>In deference to your ruling, I shall not extend the matter any further.  I would like to discuss the Restrictive Practices Bill at present in the House of Commons, but it might be slightly out of order.  I hope that what I have said was in order.  It was an attempt to suggest that the provision of the transcript of evidence is a matter not within the province of the Fair Trade Commission Act and that it is undesirable and impracticable.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, Sir, I regret that I was not here when the House sat.  I moved the Adjournment last night and I should like to draw your attention to the fact that the bell is not in operation in our part of the House.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the Adjournment last night, I was endeavouring to indicate that there is some difference between the approach that might be expected from this House to a Bill of this kind and that which might be expected from Dáil Éireann.  In connection with this Bill, we are somewhat in a different position from that of the other House, inasmuch as Senator Douglas has presented to this House a case which was not presented to the Dáil.  Therefore, I think we are entitled to view this Bill from a somewhat different angle from the one it was viewed from in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been represented by Senator Douglas that the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission were not in accordance with the evidence submitted before the commission and, whether a transcript of that evidence is presented to the House or not, I think we have available to us the Press reports of that evidence.  At any rate, we have had made available to us a good deal of the evidence that was submitted to that tribunal and it was represented to us in this House last night by Senator Douglas that we are in a position to form an independent judgment on this matter.  Senator O'Brien suggested that it was not desirable that any case heard by the Fair Trade Commission should be reviewed by this House.  There may be something in regard to legal procedure in that, but, as an ordinary layman, I would feel that it is desirable that this House should examine any case that is presented to us and it is certainly desirable that a decision taken by the <Col N="1887" /> Fair Trade Commission, which is of a fairly drastic nature, should be reviewed by some higher body, if possible.</P>
    <P>I think there was a very definite difference between the attitude taken here by the Minister yesterday and in the Dáil in connection with this Order and the views expressed by Deputy Lemass when introducing this Restrictive Practices Bill in Dáil Éireann. Deputy Lemass intimated that he would not be bound automatically to accept any recommendation put forward by the Fair Trade Commission, nor would he be bound to reject automatically any such recommendation but that he would reserve absolute freedom of action in the matter.  Yesterday, the Minister intimated that he was not going to review in any way the decision of the Fair Trade Commission, but, because they had made these recommendations, he would accept them automatically and put them before the House.  I think there is a definite divergence of viewpoint between these two Ministers.</P>
    <P>I know that, in dealing with this matter, the Dáil was in a somewhat different position from this House, inasmuch as a complete rejection of the Bill would be something of a fairly final nature.  Our position is that if we reject a Bill, it means a delay in its operation, and that is the limit of our constitutional right.  The question does arise as to whether it might or might not be desirable to delay the operation of this measure, in view of its fairly drastic nature.</P>
    <P>As I indicated last night, if we had no doubt whatever in our minds that the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission are fair and based on the evidence put before them, then we should accept them without question, but, if there is any doubt in our minds, we should be inclined to defer the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure that a strong case has been made for having the transcript of the evidence put before this House, because, as pointed out by Senator O'Brien, there is a good deal of evidence which would not appear in that transcript, and there might be some evidence of a confidential nature <Col N="1888" /> which it might not be desirable to debate publicly.  If we have any doubt in our minds as to the wisdom of the recommendations, we should not hesitate to give the benefit of the doubt to those who are affected.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that in this matter we are not dealing, in the main, with the big people.  We are dealing with the smaller fry.  Those of us who live near the country towns or villages know that the radio dealers are, in the main, small traders.  They are people who are self-employed and who carry on a very modest business selling radios and repairing sets that are brought into them for repair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they not the small fry of the big combines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be in a position to know that, but I do know that they sell radio sets, and, if there is a reasonable profit on the sale of those sets, the number of sets they would sell in the year is so small that they are entitled to a reasonable measure of profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Senator concede that they should fix the margin of profit themselves, or does he think that somebody else should fix it for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I was coming to.  We have to consider in matters of this kind whether it is right or proper for small people engaged in distribution and production to combine together for the protection of their interests, or whether they should act individually.  Those of us who live on the land, that is the farmers of the country, are frequently admonished by our betters, if you like, the people who hold themselves out as the intellectuals, that we should come together and form collective societies, and other organisations of that nature to fix the prices at which we will sell our products. Frequently farmers have taken drastic action to prevent their neighbours from under-selling farm produce, or for selling below the price fixed by our organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think for that reason that it is illogical to say that the small traders in our country towns should not be able <Col N="1889" /> to protect themselves.  I would like to point out that these people sell only a limited number of sets in the year, but they have to service a considerable number of sets for a modest charge. We all know that every little cottage and homestead has a radio set, and quite frequently those sets go out of order for one reason or another.  The owners are not prepared to pay high charges to have them repaired, and in that way it is not possible for radio dealers to earn very substantial sums in repair work.  Yet, this is work that has to be done, and they do it.  I think their income from their business generally is a very modest one.  That is my personal knowledge of a substantial number of the people engaged in the trade in provincial areas.</P>
    <P>I further would feel that in this matter the first drastic action that has been taken under this Restrictive Trade Practices Act has not been taken against the bigger people in the world of industry and commerce.  It has been taken rather against the smaller fry, and for that reason I feel it might be desirable to defer action as far as these people are concerned, for a while at least, during the period when perhaps some of the bigger people are dealt with.  We all know that, in the ordinary course, when a new type of an offence has been created, the first person to appear before the court on that new offence is rarely as severely dealt with as those who are arraigned subsequently.  Even on that ground, there may be some point in favour of caution in regard to action under the Act.</P>
    <P>I was rather impressed by the figures given by Senator Douglas in regard to the average income of people engaged in the radio trade.  He stated that the gross income of these people would on an average be about £400 per year, and, if you have to keep premises and pay all expenses out of a gross income of £400 a year, that could not be said to be an exceptionally high average income.</P>
    <P>There is another consideration which impinges on this measure and that is that there is a very large section of the people who are left outside the scope of the Restrictive Trades Practices <Col N="1890" /> Act.  They are the trade unions and the skilled workers who work on time rate for salary or wages.  These people are not brought within the scope of this legislation at all and they can form any union they like and be as restrictive as they like in the operation of that union and in the exclusion of entry into that occupation. That is an anomaly of which this House must be aware in the matter of taking action such as the drastic action being taken under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that I am not convinced that this small tribunal of three persons can be so absolutely impartial that there should not be provision for some other tribunal to act over their heads.  This is a commission of three persons and I assume that one of the members would be representative of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want the Senator to pursue that line.  It is not dealt with in the Bill.  I gave a certain amount of latitude to Senator O'Brien, but I do not want the matter pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point I want to make is that the prejudice of the majority of that commission would be brought out against persons engaged in production and distribution.  That is inevitable.  There may be a minority of one in favour of the producer or distributor, but the majority will always be prejudiced against him.  It does not appear from the report of the tribunal whether or not the decisions of this commission are majority decisions or whether, when the majority decides, the entire commission concurs. That is perhaps something which the Minister might explain.</P>
      <P>I wish to say that I was convinced about the motion to delay this Bill and Senator Dr. Sheehy Skeffington's contribution did not strengthen the case for the Bill.  I have on a few occasions found myself in agreement with Senator Dr. Sheehy Skeffington but, when that happens, I always examine my conscience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only one point to make on the amendment of this Bill which has been more than adequately <Col N="1891" /> discussed and covered.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington when speaking yesterday said that the wireless dealers should not be the persons who would examine entrants to the trade.  I must confess I was rather surprised because I am rather sure that Senator Sheehy Skeffington would suggest and insist that university lecturers and professors should be the people who would select entrants to the professorships and lectureships of universities. In the Civil Service, you always find that the Appointments Commission is overloaded with officials when the selections for appointments are made. I think it is inconsistent to suggest that the people who run business or industry and have to meet the practical effects of everyday competition would not be the sort of people who would be competent to select entrants to the trade.  I do not wish to comment further on this amendment.  I propose to give the Minister an opportunity of concluding this long debate on this section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not very much to say on this Bill or on the amendment.  My approach to the matter, I must say, is made with a completely open mind.  I think the salient issue is whether Seanad Éireann or Dáil Éireann is competent to review the work of this body known as the Fair Trade Commission. I imagine, as one individual, anyhow, that if that were the case, then it would have to be regarded as a vote of no confidence in the commission. I do not know to what extent we would concede that the constitution of this tribunal is similar in its rules and procedure to an ordinary court of justice, and the question is, would it be right or proper or competent for the Seanad or Dáil Éireann <Col N="1892" /> to review a decision of an ordinary court of justice?</P>
    <P>There is one difference, however, between this tribunal and an ordinary court of justice, inasmuch as there is no machinery for appeal from a decision of the Fair Trade Commission, and as regards the ordinary courts of the land, with the exception of the Supreme Court, there is always machinery for an appeal.  The only appeal, of course, in this case is to the Minister himself, and from what I can gather, the Minister is in a position to exercise his discretion as regards the implementation of the findings of the commission.  But it has been suggested to me&mdash;not here&mdash;that the Minister is bound to accept the findings of the Fair Trade Commission in their entirety or not at all.  I would like to hear from the Minister if that is or could be the case.</P>

      <P>I do not want to discuss the principal Act, a Chathaoirleach. I merely want to have that matter fully clarified.  As I said, I was under the impression myself, and have always been under the impression since <Col N="1893" /> the parent Act was put through the Oireachtas, that the Minister had discretion as to the implementation of the findings of the tribunal.  The overall position, to my mind, in any case, is whether we approve of the work that has been done by the Fair Trade Commission in their examination of the cases that have been put before them.</P>
      <P>The Fair Trade Commission has rendered a service to the community as a whole, and its very existence could be regarded as a deterrent to what are described as restrictive trade practices. As I said in my opening remarks, if it were to arise here that we would think ourselves justified in having a retrial of any investigation that has taken place by the commission, that would be tantamount to a vote of no confidence in that body, and, if that were the case, then it would be our duty to put an end to that body and find some other machinery for dealing with this problem.  I do not know whether the members of this House or the other House would be in favour of doing that.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that Senator O'Brien has really summed up the position very fully.  On this amendment by Senator Douglas, we are really not discussing the Bill itself. We are discussing whether we should adjourn our proceedings until the transcript of the evidence can be examined.  I think the view is perfectly correct that it would be quite impossible for us to examine the entire evidence given before the tribunal, and that the only thing we can go upon is the report of the tribunal, together with the Order that the Minister has made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Douglas presented his case extremely ably and very cogently.  I myself am by no means entirely in favour of the Restrictive Practices Act, or the consequences that may follow upon it, but it does seem to me that at the moment the only matter before us is to consider whether we should decide not to give a Second Reading, until we have been able to see the full transcript. It would seem to me that if we decided that in this case, we would probably have to decide it in the case <Col N="1894" /> of every other Order, and we would practically be substituting ourselves for the Fair Trade Commission and, to some extent, for the Minister.</P>
    <P>It would seem to me that the point which we may have to consider on the Bill itself is whether, on the report, we approve of the Bill, but I would certainly agree that it would not be a feasible proposition for us to make ourselves into a court of appeal and to inquire into the evidence.  If such a committee were to be appointed as is suggested, it would be in the difficulty that it would have to act purely on the transcript, if it could be obtained, without seeing the witnesses. In other words, it would be a tribunal that would be even more difficult to evaluate than would the findings of the Fair Trade Commission itself.  For that reason, I think we should reject the amendment, although I do think that Senator Douglas has made a very strong case on the merits.  However, I do not think that the Seanad can possibly approach the matter by way of re-examination of the full evidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerMcHugh" hpid="Dr. McHugh Dr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to speak briefly against the amendment of Senator Douglas.  During the course of his speech, I may have done him an injustice in assuming that he was reading his speech; but I must say, in extenuation, that it was extremely difficult to distinguish where Senator Douglas left off and where Deputy McGilligan&mdash; whose speech in defence of the radio dealers he quoted&mdash;began, and where Deputy McGilligan ended and the report of the Radio Dealers' Association began.  Although his whole speech was something of a <i>tour de force</i> it was, nevertheless&mdash;and this is my main ground of objection to it&mdash;an attempt to present one side of a case judged upon by a competent and legally constituted commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point that struck me about Senator Douglas's speech was that he mentioned that he would have been willing to appear before and give certain figures to the Fair Trade Commission. As far as I understand the process by which witnesses can appear before this commission, it would have been quite open to him to present himself, with his facts and figures before <Col N="1895" /> the commission; and, having failed to adopt that course of action, I think it was rather reprehensible that he should plead one side of the case in the Seanad.  After all, the Seanad, as Senator Kissane pointed out, cannot be called upon to rehearse all the evidence of such inquiries.  If the radio dealers' case is to be presented by Senator Douglas, to-morrow or the next day, we may have some Senator advancing only the case of the motor-car assemblers and the day after, if there is a commission to establish uniform phonetic spelling for some of our particular dialects or a commission for atomic research, you may have some Senator briefed to present just one side for or against this particular line. I think it is bad practice when the Seanad is used to name witnesses and to impugn their evidence.  Unless I misunderstand it, I think at least some of these witnesses are civil servants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerMcHugh" hpid="Dr. McHugh Dr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I am merely saying I would like to express myself as disapproving of the procedure which he adopted in order to present his case by naming certain witnesses who were not in a position to defend themselves.  I think Senator ffrench O'Carroll made the same point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point made by Senator Douglas was that apparently the public and the consumers at large have no complaints about the prices charged for radios or about trade practices; and he advances in support of that argument that the people did not turn up and that there was not a large number of complaints from the consuming public brought before the commission.  I think the people on the whole have a good deal of respect for the integrity of the personnel of the Fair Trade Commission, and I think it would be a good idea if Senator Douglas had the same.  He spoke of &ldquo;lies&rdquo; presented by the commission and he spoke of the &ldquo;distortion and twisting&rdquo; of evidence.  All this seems to me to be in very bad taste, because <Col N="1896" /> this was a properly constituted commission, the aims of which were to bring down prices or, at any rate, to see that the consuming public were not charged excessive prices through the operation of restrictive trade practices. I think that the public as a whole are behind the commission and that this House should not be used for what is really an attack on the commission itself.  I hope in that respect that Senator Douglas is a diversionist from his Party line, because I think it would create an extraordinarily bad impression in the country if any considerable number of Senators were to vote in favour of this amendment.  It would be, in effect, an indictment of the Fair Trade Commission.  Therefore, I oppose it.</P>

      <P>I think a good deal of misunderstanding has been disclosed by the approach of some Senators to the Bill and to the parent Act under which this action was initiated.  Before I proceed to deal with some of the arguments, may I clear up some of these misunderstandings?  When I was introducing this Bill yesterday, I said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There was of course no question of my accepting these recommendations automatically.  I examined the report in detail and I considered <Col N="1897" /> each recommendation very carefully. I could have rejected the commission's recommendations in whole or in part but my examination of the recommendations convinced me that the commission were fully justified in their recommendations and that I should make an Order on the lines suggested by the commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Senator Douglas built a goodly portion of his case around the statement, which he says was made by my predecessor, that it was possible to amend this Bill.  I think the Senator, when he saw that portion of my predecessor's statement, was apparently so pleased that he did not think it necessary to apply any check on the accuracy of it, or to take any precautions to see if in fact it had not been corrected later.  I want to deal with that portion of the Senator's statement because he appeared to give an impression that the procedure, which I was asking the Seanad to adopt here, is something very different from that contemplated by my predecessor.</P>
      <P>For the Senator's information, perhaps he would let me quote what my predecessor said on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I can only conclude that my predecessor did not fully appreciate the significance of the question which was put to him by Senator Douglas's late father, but certainly, before the Committee Stage of the Bill passed through the House, and, while the late Senator Douglas was present in the House, my predecessor left no doubt in the mind of the Senator that the procedure which I am adopting in this matter would have been the same procedure as he would have adopted in similar circumstances, because I think there is no other practicable alternative available to it.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking at column 821 of the Seanad Report, dated 18th March, said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;These Orders should stand as a whole and the Houses of the Oireachtas should have the right to <Col N="1898" /> accept them or reject them but not to amend them.  If we give the Houses of the Oireachtas power to amend there is no point in having all this other procedure.  Why have an investigation by a commission if the Houses of the Oireachtas, or a Joint Committee of both Houses, are to go over that investigation again dealing with every minute detail of an Order designed to eradicate unsatisfactory conditions in particular trades?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, he clearly did not contemplate the ordinary Bill procedure, whereunder the Bill is framed by the Department, taken to the Dáil and Seanad and Deputies and Senators amend the Bill in any way they like. He contemplated, as I contemplated, a situation in which all the facts are ascertained by the commission and the Houses of the Oireachtas can accept or reject, as they like.  My predecessor went on to add&mdash;and in some respects this is not really a statement, but a prophecy:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have no illusions about the power which vested interests can exercise in matters of this kind. Senators who have seen the lobbies below crowded with representatives of different trade associations, when some matter affecting the interests of those associations is under discussion, will know precisely what I mean and I am quite certain that when any measure which is likely to break up some profitable trade ring is brought forward, every resort will be adopted either to get the Minister to modify the recommendations of the commission in his Order or to get the Oireachtas to reject the Minister's Order, if that appears practicable at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On 12th March, 1953, at column 690 of the Official Report, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Bill provides that, when the Minister has made an Order, a confirming Act is to be submitted to the Dáil and Seanad.  That Act, I contemplate, will be similar to those passed from time to time imposing customs duty under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act.  It is not intended, nor did I contemplate, that <Col N="1899" /> the Orders themselves should be subject to amendment by the Dáil or Seanad.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to say at column 691:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think it would be foolish to provide for a detailed re-examination of the Orders by the Houses of the Oireachtas, much less to provide for joint committees to examine them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think Senator Douglas will now accept that, however my predecessor fell into an admission that the Bill was capable of amendment on the Second Stage, this series of quotations which I have given will make it clear that my predecessor corrected the position when the Bill was under discussion on the Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say I did not intend to convey that I thought that the present Minister was departing from his predecessor's plan of action? I wanted to convey the fact that I wished he had adopted that suggestion which had been made on the Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator succeeded in kindling some enthusiasm in the mind of Senator Sheehy Skeffington for some elucidation of that point and I hope the elucidation I have attempted will answer Senator Sheehy Skeffington's point, as well as constituting a reply to Senator Douglas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say I could not understand Senator Douglas's approach to this matter at all.  He started off with a lyrical tribute to the chairman of the commission.  He said that gentleman was most impartial, upright and correct in every way and extremely courteous. He went on to say that he had no complaint to find with the commission, that it was fair and impartial and conducted its proceedings in a way that satisfied the Senator.  But, before the odour of that bouquet had faded away, the Senator was engaged in throwing knives as fast as he could, for one and three-quarter hours, into every part of the Fair Trade Commission's anatomy. Of course, the Senator will realise, <Col N="1900" /> when he reads the report of his speech, that it was one long indictment of the viciousness and wickedness of the Fair Trade Commission.  But, having misrepresented things and distorted things and pulled things out of their context, the Senator asked the House to accept a report completely at variance with the evidence which was tendered to the commission.  The case the Senator asked the House to accept was that these three responsible people&mdash;I did not appoint them and I therefore have not to make a case for them&mdash;so neglected their duty that they distorted the evidence tendered and gave a report completely at variance with the evidence submitted to them.  I think Senator Douglas even hoped that, if he could see the transcript, he would be able to demonstrate that in such a way that Senators would not even question the accuracy of what he said.</P>
    <P>I ask you, do you believe that three responsible people would be guilty of a distortion of evidence and of the presentation to the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Government of a report deliberately biassed, so far as the evidence was concerned?  I think Senator Douglas overpainted his picture.  To use another metaphor, I think he overplayed his hand so far as the accusations he made against the commission are concerned.  We were, of course, asked to accept as evidence by the Senator something which was not evidence at all.  The Senator quoted a number of statements as if they were evidence, or as if they constituted evidence.  But these were the statements of the advocate hired by the Wireless Dealers' Association and I do not think anybody would go so far as to say that statements made by an advocate in making the best case he can for his clients must necessarily represent the fount of exactitude in the matter of the presentation of evidence. The advocate was doing his best, I have no doubt.  I have no doubt he was very skilful and made use of every possible scrap of material that he had on behalf of his clients.  But he was not there for any other purpose except to defend the interests of his clients.</P>
    <P>Apparently, the people who engaged him were pretty vigilant because they <Col N="1901" /> did all they could to get the commission to come to a point of view and, the commission having come to a certain point of view, they have since been pretty active in trying to get people to refuse to accept the point of view at which the commission arrived, having considered all the evidence.  I do not think we should make the mistake of imagining that the statements made by an advocate before the Fair Trade Commission are evidence, as Senator Douglas sought to suggest they are.  They are not evidence.  They were the <i>ex parte</i> statements of an advocate briefed for the purpose of making the best case he could on behalf of the Wireless Dealers' Association.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas said that the wireless dealers were the first of the trade associations to be brought before the public eye.  I do not know whether the Senator still believes that, because it is, of course, not true.  The inquiry into building materials, the report on which has already been circulated to the members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, shows that the public sittings of that inquiry commenced prior to the public sittings in connection with the radio trade; so that, as far as the public is concerned, the examination into building materials preceded the public examination of the operations of the radio trade.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas made some reference suggesting that the commission distorted the evidence in their reference to tariff protection.  He made the point that the large-scale protection now enjoyed by the manufacturers was not introduced until 1946.  Frankly, I could not follow the relevance of that comment by the Senator.  In point of fact, the commission were at pains in appendix D to bring out the fact that the 75 per cent. full and 50 per cent. preferential rate was not introduced until 1946.  There was no effort made to conceal that at all.  It is stated there quite clearly in appendix D.  I notice that it is only to persons entering the trade after 1946 that the new regulations were applied by the federation. That has a significance that might bear much further examination.</P>
    <P>The Senator refers to what he says was a mistake in the introductory part <Col N="1902" /> of the report.  He refers to a statement that all the witnesses were examined on oath and that the Association of Civil Liberties was represented by a solicitor.  I refer to these matters to show how much the Senator overplayed his hand and overused his material.  He went on to say that no witness from the Association of Civil Liberties was examined on oath and that there was no witness from the association before the commission. It is made perfectly clear and beyond all doubt in the list of witnesses furnished by the commission in appendix B.  Nobody said that a witness from that association was examined at all, so what the point of the Senator's argument was I certainly do not know.</P>
    <P>The Senator made a great deal of play on the fact that no member of the public had given evidence.  I hardly think that is a fair comment.  The general complaints in regard to the radio trade were from persons who had not been able to set up in business in that trade.  He condemned the members of the public who did give evidence and whose evidence was described in chapter 2 as a complaint that they could not get into the business.  Is it wrong or immoral that a person should endeavour to get into the radio trade in order to earn a livelihood?  Is it to be said by these people, on whose behalf Senator Douglas has spoken, that these other people have no right to go there and complain that they were kept out of the trade?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that if these were the type of people who sought to get into the trade, I did not think they should be allowed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator treated these people pretty roughly in his comments and he even tried to identify them by giving their correct names, whereas the commission only gave an alphabetical appellation.  I do not think that the fact that they tried to get into the radio trade makes them less reputable citizens.  They were entitled to go there and to avail of the opportunity of telling the commission what their business was and what they <Col N="1903" /> wanted to do.  We here are not called upon to pass judgment on their characters and their morality.  They went there to throw light on a complaint which the commission was definitely set up to deal with.</P>
      <P>I should like to correct a misunderstanding on the part of Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  He said that I had stated at the opening of my speech that the commission had access to documents in the custody of the various Government Departments.  I said no such thing.  What I said was that the commission, as they have stated in their report, did have access to minute books, files and records of trade associations.  These were as much part of the evidence as the evidence taken at the various oral sittings.  A perusal of these minute books was as much a part of the material on which the commission based its report as was the evidence taken orally.  If the House cares to examine the report of the commission on the building materials trade, they will see how valuable was some of the information contained in the minute books of some of the trade associations.  They will see that some of the members of the building trade themselves went on record in these minute books as saying that profits were pitched too high and should be brought down.  They said they were getting away with too much.  No transcript of evidence will give you that statement, but if the Senators will read the report on the building materials inquiry, they will find some very interesting information and some further information of the same kind which I hope to supply to the House when we come to discuss the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is asking us to believe too much when we are asked to believe that trade associations are concerned primarily with the public interest. They are not.  They were set up to defend the interests of those in the association and defending the interests of those in the association is not always compatible with looking after the public interest.  If we are going to have an inquiry into the radio trade, who is going to carry out that inquiry?  If you agree with what Senator Douglas has <Col N="1904" /> said, you would let the radio trade themselves carry out the examination of the practices in their own trade. Does anybody think that such an inquiry would be anything more than an exhibition of public whitewashing? Whoever would carry out that inquiry, it could not be the radio dealers. Somebody else had got to do it and the body appointed to do it was the Fair Trade Commission which was set up by a Bill passed with the approval of this House and with the approval of the Dáil as well.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what is sought to be done in this case.  I do not know whose interests Senator Cogan was looking after to-day, but it seemed to me that he was looking after the interests of the radio dealers.  I want to be fair to the radio dealers, but I am more concerned with being fair to the public, and it is in the public interests that the inquiry was held into this whole matter.  Certainly it was in the interests of the small traders in the business that there should be some regulation of the kind now contemplated. Look at what happens.  Say that a dealer in the radio trade buys ten wireless sets for each of which he pays £10.  He pays the cheque for £100 to the man who produced those radios and then these sets become the property of the small radio man in the city or in the country.  He owns them. His personal ownership of these radios is not in dispute.</P>
    <P>However, a body known as the Wireless Dealers' Association enters into an agreement with the man who made those sets and who sold them, in which they say to the man who now owns the ten sets that he cannot sell a single one of these sets, unless he makes a profit of 50 per cent. on them. Who wants to justify that and in what way can such a principle be justified? Suppose the dealer's own brother comes along to him and says that he wants to buy one of these sets.  The radio dealer, although he paid £10 for the set, may be willing to give it to his brother for £10.  However, if he does that, he is breaking a contract to which the Wireless Dealers' Association says he is a party and insists that the manufacturer is a party.  He will get no more radio sets if he sells one <Col N="1905" /> of these ten sets at 1 per cent. profit less than the 50 per cent. which they require.  I am quite sure there is no public endorsement in this country for the fixing of such high minimum profits on a highly protected article.  I do not think that the public would endorse such action.  I would like to see the public consulted, and to see whether they would endorse a stand such as that.</P>
    <P>The radio trade here is protected in a way that very few other industries are protected.  There is a protective tariff of 75 per cent. on radio sets, with a preference rate of 50 per cent. on British radios.  You cannot buy a radio in any part of the world you like and import it here.  If you buy it in Britain, you have to pay 50 per cent. duty, and if you buy it outside Britain, you have to pay 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>We have given this protection because of our desire to build up a radio trade here and we have built up quite a good radio trade in the country. Having done that for the radio trade, are we to permit them to say that they will insist on every person who gets into the trade, because of the tariff wall which has been built up for their protection, charging a minimum price which will give them a profit of 50 per cent. on the article?  I do not believe that the public will stand for that and I do not believe they will warmly applaud Senators who would encourage the continuance of such an arrangement.</P>
    <P>Apparently Senator Douglas sees nothing wrong with that and considers that it is quite normal trade that, when high tariff walls are built up to protect an industry, the people engaged in that industry should escape entirely any investigation by the Oireachtas, or by any Act of the Oireachtas. That may be all right, but does it give any consideration to what the public might think and what they are thinking?  I do not share Senator Douglas's views.  I think the public have to be protected in matters of this kind and this Bill seeks to protect them.  After all, resale price maintenance is a development of recent years and has entered into a whole lot of industry, but there are quite a number <Col N="1906" /> of industries carrying on without it. The whole textile industry is an example of that.  When there is a defence of the practice of resale price maintenance, that defence takes place not in the interests of the public, but in the interests of the dealers concerned. When there is a conflict in this matter, the public have to be protected, and consequently I think we have to come down on the side of the public interest, and that is what this Bill is doing. That is why I ask this House to give a Second Reading to this Bill.</P>

      <P>If the House is taking the Committee Stage now, can I make a suggestion which might be acceptable to the Seanad as an alternative? Under Standing Orders 73 (2), I do not know whether I would be in order in moving the following motion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Restrictive Trade Practices (Confirmation of Order) Bill, 1955, be referred to a Select Committee of the House so that they can examine the report of the Fair Trade Commission referred to in the Order to be confirmed by the Bill with a view to ascertaining whether any of the sections of the report are in their entirety, or in part, contrary to the evidence, documentary or otherwise, submitted at the inquiry; or are a misrepresentation of the facts covered by such evidence.</P>
      <P>The Special Committee shall be empowered to send for persons, papers and records that they may consider to be of assistance to them in their inquiry, including any transcript of the proceedings of the Fair Trade Commission as may be available through the commission or otherwise, and such documentary evidence and sworn statements as were delivered to the Fair Trade Commission during their inquiry and were omitted from, or abbreviated in, the appendices to the report.</P>
      <P>The Select Committee shall consist of nine Senators, of whom four shall form a quorum, and they shall report back to the Seanad within three months from this date.</P>

      <P>Bill passed through Committee, reported without amendment and received for final consideration.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Some statements were made by several Senators and the Minister, which, I believe, arose from a misinterpretation of the Bill and Order.  The Minister said that one of the things which the Bill proposed to do was to protect the public and I do not think a single member of this House, least of all myself, will quarrel with that opinion; but I do feel very strongly that in this Order which we are confirming now certain sections do not, in fact, confer that protection on the public which was the intention of the 1953 Act and which I feel was the intention of the Minister.</P>
      <P>One of the things that have been overlooked in this House, which I did not mention on the Second Reading, or deal with very fully, is the fact that a wireless set or a television set is a very technical instrument which requires careful servicing and handling. At the present time, the general consuming public has the benefit of a form of warranty issued by the manufacturers, and the manufacturers can only ensure that the public will have the benefit of that warranty, if they can see that one of those sets reaches the public through some person or persons who have the skill and ability to see that it is in full working order before it reaches the public and can, if necessary, attend at the owner's house or repair it on the premises.  When we pass this Bill, that warranty will no longer be available to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well to remember that, in England, there have been a number of cases, fortunately not very many, where unskilled persons, in attempting to repair television sets, have turned them into lethal weapons, and in at least two cases children have lost their <Col N="1909" /> lives through touching those sets improperly repaired.  When we pass this Bill this afternoon we are making it possible for any unskilled person to sell and set out to repair not only wireless sets, which, of course, are less dangerous, but television sets, which are lethal weapons.  I cannot believe that it is in the interests of the public to leave them in that position.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the fact that the wireless trade had received protection.  I did not, unfortunately, take down his exact words, but he endeavoured to suggest that the trade had received protection from the very beginning and ought, therefore, to give additional service to the public.  In my own speech yesterday, I endeavoured to make it perfectly clear.  I believe that the dealers had been giving good service to the public, but I cannot agree with the Minister that originally the wireless trade asked for protection. I have here a sworn statement which I did not read out, but I hoped the Minister might make available to the House.  Apparently it is not possible to do so.  The statement is from the largest radio manufacturer in this country who, I think, commenced business, according to the sworn statement, in 1936.  As far as I remember, without referring to the report, protection, or so-called protection, came in 1926.  In other words, it was imposed as a revenue duty and was not imposed to protect an Irish industry.  The Minister has made great play of the fact that these high duties were imposed to protect the industry, but we have no actual evidence that the manufacturers asked for this protection. Certainly, as I say, there were no manufacturers then, when the protection was first imposed.</P>
    <P>One thing that worries me most of all about this Order&mdash;and I may say that there are, in fact, only two sections of the Order with which I have any quarrel&mdash;is that we are restricting the right of the individual to decide how best the products of his labours can be supplied to the public.  I am satisfied that as long as there can be no collusion between manufacturers of wireless sets, there is ample competition in this country to allow those <Col N="1910" /> individual manufacturers to decide how best the products of their labours should reach the public.  It is on that point that I quarrel mostly with the Minister.  As regards any collusion inside or outside the Wireless Dealers' Association to decide on the prices the manufacturers should charge the public, I would entirely agree with the Minister that we should take every possible step to prevent any such collusion.  But I consider that if we are going to produce, say, a Douglas wireless set, I put great emphasis on doing something better than other manufacturers and I ought to be entitled to take every step possible to see that that article reaches the final consumer in the condition in which I have produced it and sent it from my factory.  The present Order will prevent the public from having that.</P>
    <P>I should like, in conclusion, to refer to one point made by Senator Sheehy Skeffington on the Second Reading.  He objected very strongly to wireless dealers or retailers deciding who should take part in that trade.  I might say that I could equally object to students of French being examined by professors of French when they present themselves.  That, I think, would be completely wrong.  I accept the principle which has been enshrined in our educational methods over the years that persons should be examined by those people most qualified to decide whether they are capable of carrying out repair work, professional services, or whatever it may be.  It would be entirely wrong to accept Senator Sheehy Skeffington's suggestion that in future people should not be examined by people qualified in their own trade or profession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, my point was that they should not be examined by people who have a vested interest in keeping them out of the trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>That might equally apply to those dentists, accountants, solicitors and so on.  We have always accepted the principle that they should examine people who are intent on getting into their occupation.  However, as I said, there are only those two sections <Col N="1911" /> of the Order which I can really find fault with.  The first is the restriction of the individual's right to decide how he can best dispose of the products of his labours; secondly, that the public will no longer have any protection whatsoever as to the wireless set or television set which is going to reach them.  There can be no warranty given by a manufacturer who has no say as to how the set is going to be disposed of, once it reaches the retailer's hands.  That is a point which I think the Minister has overlooked.</P>
      <P>It has always been accepted in the past that there is that guarantee, but it would be quite impossible, as I say, for a manufacturer to give that warranty, other than to say that the set must be returned to the factory for repair. Let us see how that will affect a person living, shall we say, in Clare Island or the more distant parts of the country.  The set will have to go back and forth from the factory to the consumer, and it would add very considerably to the cost both of set and maintenance, as far as the individual is concerned.  It will have the effect that you must fix the ex-factory price, which means that people in the more remote parts will, in consequence, no matter what prices are charged by the retailer, have to bear a greater price than a person in Dublin or close to the factory.</P>
      <P>I wish it were possible, as I suggested on Second Reading, to amend the Order.  I believe that many members of this House would feel much happier if, for instance, Section 14, which the Minister did not deal with, could have been removed from the Order.  I also think that we would have felt a great deal happier if at least one section of the Restrictive Trade Practices Order on the motor trade could have been included in both the radio Order and the building Order, and that is the one which apparently allows a person to advertise the retail price of a new vehicle.  I think that also should have been allowed in the present Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry for detaining the House so long on this Bill both last night and this afternoon, but I do feel that a <Col N="1912" /> certain amount of principle is involved. I agree with the Minister, as I have said already, that the public is entitled to be protected against what I call horizontal price maintenance.  I believe, under our Constitution, the individual is entitled to decide for himself how best to dispose of the products of his own labours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to call Senator Douglas's attention to Article 13 of the Order, which, I think, has been overlooked by the Senator and by the whole radio trade, who apparently cannot be induced to see the value of the Order.  I will read it out for the benefit of the House:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Order, a supplier may apply to the acceptance of orders for goods to which this Order applies such terms and conditions, including conditions as to the size or frequency of such orders or as to the functions of a retailer or the services to be rendered to the public, as are reasonable in the interests of efficiency and economy in production and distribution or are necessary in the legitimate interests of the supplier's business, provided such terms and conditions are applied in an equitable manner to all persons seeking supplies of such goods.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So there is no reason at all why these catastrophic things which Senator Douglas has foreshadowed should take place in the radio trade.</P>
      <P>Article 13 gives the manufacturers powers to be reasonable in the conditions which they attach to orders for their goods.  These conditions can be prescribed by the radio manufacturers. Once prescribed, they must apply to all persons in the trade and the decision as to what is reasonable or otherwise will be determined ultimately by the Fair Trade Commission&mdash;not by the Minister, not by anybody else in the trade, but by the Fair Trade Commission&mdash;and the radio manufacturers will get adequate opportunity of making whatever case they want to make in defence of the conditions attached to orders for their goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, without adequately appreciating the beneficial provisions of <Col N="1913" /> Article 13, or seeing any virtues whatever in it, the radio trade has engaged in a mass attack on this Order.  I am going to make a prophecy now.  If someone intelligently applies Article 13 to the radio trade, a whole lot of the things conjured up here as ogres to frighten people here will simply disappear. If in fact they ever make their appearance here at all, they will be ruled out by intelligent application of Article 13 of this Order.</P>

      <P>I am reluctant to treat the House to a long dissertation on the provisions of this Bill and terms of the report, because of the fact that the Order made in this case and the general character of the report in respect of this trade is pretty well on all fours with the procedure adopted by the Fair Trade Commission in its approach to the problem of the radio trade.  All the information I can give the House is already down in the report, which, I presume, each Senator has read.  My speech, therefore, would consist very largely of paraphrasing what is already in the report, and as no doubt every Senator has already read that report, I will not keep the House for half an hour or 40 minutes in doing so, particularly as we have spent so long discussing the other parts of the report and so long discussing the Fair Trade Commission and the approach adopted in the report of the commission.  I will therefore content myself with speaking to Second Reading of the Bill, but I will be most happy to clarify any points raised by any Senator.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is quite correct in not asking the House to have a full discussion on this measure, in view of what has been said already in relation to the other measure that was before the House this afternoon and this evening; but I submit at the same time that it is a <Col N="1914" /> pity that the discussion that took place could not have been of a more general character and that the House should have been put in the position of having to curb its thought and ideas in connection with this matter, because of one particular case that was brought to our notice.  However, I am in agreement with the Minister that any further discussion on this would be unrealistic now, and in any case I suppose we will have an opportunity of dealing with this matter on another occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to intervene at any great length, but I think it ought to be mentioned that this Order also is one which will very definitely serve the community. I think it is quite obvious that all of us are interested in the prices of building materials and components, and must necessarily be disturbed if there is any suggestion that the prices of such things are being kept artificially high for the purpose of more generously lining the pockets of those who deal in such materials.  I myself was surprised by the things that came out at the Fair Trade Commission examination of some of the witnesses before them, in relation to this particular report.  I remember&mdash;I do not want to mention names&mdash;one body that came before them.  It was revealed in public&mdash;grudgingly, I thought &mdash;that this body had had up to a short time before the setting up of the commission, a little committee one of whose purposes was to fix prices.  Then they held a hasty little meeting and removed that &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; from their sub-committee's reasons for holding such a committee, and it seemed to me that it was apparent that the price fixing would nonetheless go on, although it would not be admitted even in their own terms of reference for their subcommittee. This same little committee had a very prominent secretary before the Fair Trade Commission sat, and then the secretary suddenly resigned from the committee.  The committee continued apparently without a secretary and without much visible purpose. Now on page 9 of the report reference is made in paragraph 5 to the terms and conditions on which builders' <Col N="1915" /> materials were available to builders' merchants and so on.  This says: &ldquo;The weight of evidence was to the effect that up to a short time before the start of the inquiry purchasers had been confronted with a uniformity of prices that indicated collusion between merchants regarding the selling prices of a large range of commodities essential to the building industry.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think that was a very soberly put point, but it is one that must concern us all, that quite clearly, by the weight of evidence, there was collusion on pricing, and this ceased shortly before the beginning of the inquiry.  I think it is equally obvious that were the recommendations of the inquiry not to be implemented by the Minister, as he is doing by the Bill, that sort of collusion and price fixing would start immediately again, and I think it is something of which we should be immediately aware in welcoming this report and this Order.</P>
      <P>Again on page 10, paragraph 6, the sentence about eight lines from the top reads: &ldquo;There is a marked similarity of phrasing in the rules and by-laws of certain of those associations which was particularly evident in the changes made in certain rules after the introduction of the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill, 1952.&rdquo;  Again on page 11, there is a reference to a particular association having &ldquo;a national price list which sets forth minimum retail selling prices and maximum discounts to be allowed to trade purchasers&rdquo;. Again, on page 12 the report says that &ldquo;the organs of the association include a national pricing committee&rdquo;, and, even more startling, perhaps, a sentence half way down on page 12 says: &ldquo;The provisions of the national price list did not extend to sales to the Department of Defence, Dublin Corporation (except for housing schemes).&rdquo;  The price fixing did not extend to the Department of Defence or Dublin Corporation &ldquo;except for housing schemes&rdquo;, which means ultimately that the inhabitants of these housing schemes would be paying for the artificially inflated prices of these basic building materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me it is quite obvious, <Col N="1916" /> when you read that kind of thing, that there has been arranging and enforcing of artificially high prices, which have put up the price of housing and, consequently, the price of rents in this country in past years.  The list at the time of the inquiry, for example, required a profit margin of &ldquo;not less than 50 per cent.&rdquo; on the price to be adopted in the case of wood mantels and so on, according to the example given on page 14.  The whole report is full of that type of example.  It is a most detailed, careful and competent report, and I suggest it is a frightening document because it takes the lid off a section of our business community and shows the conscienceless manner in which they have been arranging to take more than a just profit or to fix artificially high prices for vitally necessary materials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of competition simply did not exist. They &ldquo;arranged&rdquo; prices at a high level.  I do notice that occasionally there is a little breath of competition in it. In the middle of page 15, for instance, it says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The South of Ireland Timber Importers' Association decided in April, 1953, that, in view of the possible competition from Dublin and increasing competition from outside importers, prices will have to be free for a limited period.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Apparently somebody in the South got scared and said: &ldquo;We will have to free prices for a limited period.&rdquo;  I do not want to delay the House, but I do suggest that nobody, having read this document&mdash;this carefully prepared report based on a very full inquiry, with ample evidence and cross-examination &mdash;could fail to approve the implementation of the very sober recommendations of this commission in defence of the community, here on another front, this time concerned with building materials.  In passing, I might say, in regard to the cross-examination at the inquiry, that the answers were revealing; and I might also say that the loss of temper by some of the witnesses was equally revealing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1917" /> The great value of such a tribunal has been twofold; first, in showing up the sort of back-room arrangements that have been going on at our expense &mdash;the public&mdash;and, secondly, in the clear and courageous recommendations given.  I believe the Government is to be heartily congratulated on implementing so promptly the very courageous and clear recommendations of the commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to assure the House that I will be as brief on this Bill as I was long on the first one, and, in fact, I am going to find myself in rather a different position from the other one.  I really want to ask the Minister one or two questions for clarification.  I read the report some time ago and I actually read through most of the transcript of the evidence.  I confess I made no notes on it, except to note that every person who gave evidence at this particular inquiry said he was perfectly satisfied that, as far as the scope of the report of the inquiry was concerned, it did measure up more or less to the evidence which was given before the commission.  To that extent, it seems to be completely different from the radio trade report.  If I remember correctly, it is mentioned in the report of the inquiry that representatives of only six out of some 680 cement handling firms gave evidence, and I believe that in the other House at least one Deputy expressed the opinion that it seemed rather strange to accept the evidence of merely six out of 680 representing the cement distribution trade. There has been a certain amount of misgiving in connection with this report and, in particular, in connection with the supply of cement.  It is on this point I am hoping the Minister will give me clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report suggests that local authorities should be supplied by Cement Limited, and in the report the commission stated that the cost to the local authorities is enhanced because margins are allowed by the company and taken by the distributors who perform no indispensable function.  I agree with the commission that everything possible should be done to ensure that local authority housing can be carried on at the lowest possible cost <Col N="1918" /> to the community.  I think we all share that point of view.  I think, however, that the commission did overlook the fact that the margin allowed to the distributors on present prices works out at about 3.9 per cent. on costs, and out of that the distributor is expected to maintain his staff, pay overhead expenses, rates and so forth.  As well as that, he has in the past given credit to his customers sometimes as far as three or six months ahead.  I gather that&mdash;and again I am speaking subject to correction&mdash;it was made perfectly clear at the inquiry by the six cement handling concerns that cement was handled at a loss, but was carried by most of these firms as a convenience for their customers and not because there was any profit to be made out of it.</P>
    <P>What I want to find out from the Minister is this: I assume that up to the present the local bodies have been getting their cement supplies through cement handling firms and they have been getting possibly three to six months', or longer, credit on those supplies.  If they get it direct from Cement Limited, I assume they will have to pay for that on the terms of Cement Limited, which, I believe, are short credit and very strict credit. Will the local bodies be able to pay their accounts, or will they find themselves in the position of owing money to Cement Limited and thus unable to get further supplies?  If that is the case, will the Minister take steps, either to see that local authorities have sufficient money available to pay those accounts promptly, or to see that there will be no danger at all of any slowing up in the housing programmes of the local authorities?  I do feel that every one of us, no matter on which side of the House he is, is vitally concerned in the housing programme of the Government; and no one, whether he is in the building trade or outside of it, wishes to see any action taken which may in any way affect our housing plans.  That is the only question I wanted to ask the Minister on this Order.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make one or two small observations on this Bill.  The first is that, although we have had this inquiry, I should like to know what advantage it has conferred.  Has it tended to reduce the cost of housing? My view is that this inquiry ought to go very much further than it has.  It restricted itself to the people providing certain types of building materials.  I have suggested on more than one occasion in this House that there should be an investigation of the whole cost of building a house.  Every form of restrictive practice should be investigated.  Every scientific approach and every type of modern machinery and labour-saving device that could be used to produce a good house at reasonable cost ought to be utilised here, because the greatest burden on the working classes and on the middle classes is the cost of building. In fact, the cost of building is one of the greatest deterrents and one of the most retarding factors in the development of our economy.</P>
      <P>Building forms a large part of the overheads of all productive enterprises and it draws from the various groups a large part of their incomes. As well as that, I believe that building has been the least progressive of our industries.  Science has been used to a much lesser extent in building than it has in other walks of life.  I commend the Minister for his efforts in having this inquiry instituted, but I would like him to bring the inquiry to its logical conclusion: I would like him to inquire into the whole question of building, its modernisation and the introduction into it of general efficiency. I think it is very vital in the national interest that this should be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Seanad for the way in which they have facilitated me in their consideration of this Bill, thereby shortening the discussion considerably.  There is one matter I should like to bring to the notice of <Col N="1920" /> the House before I go on to deal with the point made by Senator Douglas. Since this report proper was made, I have received a supplementary report from the commission under Section 10 of the parent Act of 1953.  In that report, the commission say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Further to the commission's report on the inquiry into the supply and distribution of building materials and components and, in particular, to paragraph 48 of Chapter 4 and paragraphs 74, 75 and 76 of Chapter 6, it has recently come to the commission's notice that, after an interval of some three years, Dublin merchants appear to have resumed as from some time in January, 1956, the practice of submitting identical tenders for timber contracts, at least for Government Departments and large public bodies.  Particulars and information which the commission have obtained in this matter are given in the attached schedule.  Firms A to H are all located in Dublin and firm I is a provincial firm.  The commission have not considered it necessary or desirable to make any direct inquiry from the firms concerned in existing circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They go on to say that the recommendation of the commission is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The commission's views on noncompetitive trading are set out in the report, paragraph 48, Chapter 4, and paragraph 80, Chapter 6, in particular. They consider that it is contrary to the public interest.  They feel it is not necessary at this stage to make any recommendations additional to those contained in the report but they consider, nevertheless, that it is desirable to acquaint the Minister with the facts stated in this report.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And then we get an interesting light on competition and on how healthy competition can be.  I will take one case, the Dublin Corporation.  The Dublin Corporation invited tenders on 18th of last January.  Four groups of firms tendered.  In one group, there are firms whose identity is described by the letters A, B, C, D and E.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The firms A, B, C, D and E tendered for the supply of flooring-boards for houses in Dublin at a price of £3,327 3s. 9d. and every one of the five firms quoted the same price.  And that is competitive tendering!  Another firm quoted £3,247 19s. 4d.  Another firm quoted £3,327 3s. 9d.&mdash;the same as the first group of firms; and another quoted £3,134 8s. 5d.  We come on then to another tender, an order for more timber flooring, on 31st January last; firms lettered A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H all tendered at one price, £121 17s. 6d.  Then there is another one for a Government Department in which firms A, B, C, D, E, F and G all tendered at one price, running into thousands of pounds.  Then we come to another Government Department, 15 items for timber; tenders were invited in January last and firms A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H all tendered at a price of over £2,000&mdash;there not being one halfpenny difference in the quotations from all these firms.  We come then to Bord na Móna.  Bord na Móna invited tenders on 6th March and firms A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H all tendered, and the price of all that group of firms was £2,793 5s. 2d., and the odd twopence was shown in every one of the individual tenders.</P>

      <P>This is the justification for the Fair Trade Commission.  This is the kind of practice against which the public must be protected.  When one remembers that these people are not above stifling all competition in relation to houses which are occupied by ordinary working people, who are finding it hard enough to pay the rent, the position is all the more serious. But that does not matter to these people engaged in this conspiracy, who submit one tender and who are not concerned with how that tender impacts on the rent, or how hard it is for the Dublin Corporation to raise loans, or to collect rents and rates to pay bills, which must obviously be inflated <Col N="1922" /> bills because of the stifling of competition in tendering.  And where the tenders are fixed, as they are in these other cases, in respect of Government Departments, it is this House and the Dáil which have to find the money because these gentlemen get together to eliminate any form of competition.</P>

      <P>I do not think that is good enough and I think the public should know what the practice is.  I think it is essential that public opinion should be lined up behind the Fair Trade Commission in its efforts to deal with problems of that kind.  I do not know what Senator Douglas wants elucidated in respect of cement, but I would call his attention to paragraph 172 of Chapter 20, which states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A large amount of cement is at present consumed by local authorities and an increasing quantity is devoted to direct labour schemes.  At present the cost to local authorities is enhanced by the fact that margins are allowed by the company and taken by distributors who, in effect, perform no indispensable function. The credit-worthiness of a local authority could not be in doubt. The authorities at present seek tenders for cement although, in fact, the price is fixed, and at least one authority was stated to rotate the business between distributors in its area.  It seems to the commission that Cement Limited should not necessarily limit themselves to supply only through merchanting channels but that, in the public interest, and subject to the orders being of a suitable magnitude, it should be open to any local authority which desires to do so to obtain the supplies directly from the company.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think that answers the point Senator Douglas has raised but, if there is any other point on which he requires clarification, I shall be glad to have it clarified subsequently.</P>

At the passing of that Act, most Deputies had in mind a picture of very large business interests which had considerable financial resources and had under their control large supplies of materials and were believed to be conspiring together to hold those materials. Members of both Houses were not so much concerned with the smaller people, but with those big commercial interests which have been brought to light in the report submitted to the Minister.  Having regard to the fact that the report submitted under this Bill was signed by the three members of the commission, I would ask the Minister if the report was a unanimous one.</P>

I do not know whether it was a unanimous report, but the <Col N="1924" /> fact that the three members of the commission signed it indicates that they agreed with it.  People of that standing would hardly be coerced into signing a report recommending a course of action with which they did not agree.

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask a number of questions arising out of this Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) Bill.  I notice that Order No. 359 dealing with glucose alters the duty from 15s. 5d. per cwt. to 37½ per cent., with a 25 per cent. preference for the United Kingdom and Canada.  What order of magnitude of difference is that?  It is a change from a sum of money to a percentage, but does that represent a big change?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice in item 3, No. 360, which refers to the duty on tableware, that there is to be a reduction of the duty on certain articles.  I think that is to be welcomed and that every time the Minister does that, his action should be welcomed in this House.  He does not tell us what kind of articles are involved.  I think we might have some kind of interest in knowing what kind of pottery has been reduced in price. I remember a point made by Senator McGuire on the last occasion when some of these Orders were before the House, when he said that he found that the fairly easy entry of competitive articles from elsewhere, far from <Col N="1925" /> taking from the sale of the home-produced product, helped it, by giving to the users a less limited range of choice in what they have to buy.  On those grounds, too, we can heartily welcome the reduction of this duty.</P>
    <P>I am a little puzzled by Order No. 4, which refers to woven and artificial textiles, because, as I read the Order, the exemption of certain cloths from duty is limited to cloths valued over 2/6 per sq. yard.  That means that the exemption would apply to the dearer materials.  I am not quite sure what the basis for that might be.  I do not know what the implications are, and perhaps the Minister would clarify the matter a little.  I should like to know, also, the exact meaning to be attached to the word &ldquo;value&rdquo;.  Is that the import wholesale price or just how is the &ldquo;value&rdquo; to be calculated?</P>
    <P>Again, in Order 362, I notice that there is to be an amending of the Bill, changing it from a sum of money to a percentage.  The duty is to be 75 per cent. on varnishes.  That is a very high duty and I should like to ask if these varnishes are being manufactured here and what were the considerations that led the Minister to consider a duty of 75 per cent. necessary, and also why he found it necessary to extend the scope of the Order to cellulose varnish and to lacquers, etc.</P>
    <P>Item 7, Order No. 364, refers to blockboard and a duty of 37½ per cent. is imposed on blockboard.  I should like to have some clarification of the reasons for that rate.  I should like also to have some kind of comment on that.  I take it the raw materials there are entirely or almost entirely imported and I would be inclined to think that the raw materials used by the British manufacturers of blockboard are probably also largely imported.  I do not imagine that they use British soft woods in this kind of thing.  I should like to know why a 37½ per cent. protective duty is necessary for manufacturers here who are competing perhaps with the British manufacturers who also have to import the raw materials.  It seems to me that they might be able to compete on rather more level terms, and I wonder if such <Col N="1926" /> a high duty was necessary in that particular case?</P>
    <P>Another point is related to item No. 10, Order No. 367 on which I think we could have some more information as to what is meant by &ldquo;certain printed matter&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The last matter I should like to know more about is item No. 12 where I notice that in Order No. 369 a duty which was already 100 per cent. full, and nil in the U.K. and Canada in the case of linen ply yarn, is in future to be the present 100 per cent. full and 40 per cent. in the case of U.K. and Canada.  That appears to be a big jump from nil to 40 per cent., and I should like to know on what considerations the Minister decided that this high percentage was necessary?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington has raised questions on more than half the Orders set out in these Orders, and I will endeavour to supply the information on the points which he has raised.</P>
      <P>On the question of glucose, the lower rate of duty was a revenue duty, purely and simply, but the new rate of duty is a protective duty imposed in order to protect the production of glucose here by Ceimicí Teoranta.  The <i>ad valorem </i>duty of 37½ per cent. is about the same as the present price level. The position is that glucose was being dumped into this country at prices substantially less than the same glucose was being sold in the home market.  Countries producing a surplus of glucose were dumping it here, with the result that Ceimicí, Teoranta, could not sell Irish-produced glucose.  The purpose of the duty was to protect the Irish products against the dumped products coming in from other countries. This duty is purely a protective duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask a question arising out of that?  I understand the Minister to say that the figure of 15/5 originally mentioned would be roughly the same as 37½ per cent.  I do not understand, if there is no real new change, how it is going to give increased protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1927" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is if you want to import glucose now you will have to pay an <i>ad valorem</i> rate of duty of 37½ per cent. on the current price in this country.  I think that 37½ per cent. will be sufficient protection against imported glucose being dumped here in competition with Irish produced glucose.  That is the whole purpose of this duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not make any effective difference on the present price?  I understood the Minister to suggest that on present prices, it would not make any significant difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is clearly a protective duty.  It is true that the duty was a revenue duty, but this is one which has a new protective element in it.  I am quite clear on the protective duty, but probably not so clear on the other type of duty or what effect the revenue duty had.  This is not a revenue duty, but a protective duty and the protection is given in the form of an <i>ad valorem</i> rate of duty on the imported article.</P>
      <P>On the question of blockboard, it was necessary to protect blockboard in order to give Irish industrialists an opportunity to get under way.  An Irish firm has undertaken the manufacture of blockboard in this country and is producing an excellent product. The duty was imposed in order to enable that industry to get on its feet. The Senator will be interested to know that the raw material being used in this blockboard is being secured from Irish sources.</P>
      <P>On the question of tableware, I asked the Industrial Development Authority to investigate the position, with a view to ascertaining what use was being made of available tariffs from the standpoint of efficient production, supplying the home market and getting the optimum measure of employment.  As a result of the investigations which the I.D.A. made, it was decided to reduce the rates from 1/6 full rate to 9d, and from 1/- preferential to 6d. preferential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of artificial textiles, this is a problem which we had to deal <Col N="1928" /> with, arising out of the importations from European and Near and Far Eastern Countries.  I can explain the position this way.  There was an <i>ad valorem</i> rate of duty imposed in January, 1949 and in July, 1955, it was necessary to impose the minimum specialised rates against importations from Japan, Poland and Czechoslovakia, of certain lining materials which were coming in in competition wth the Irish lining industry.  These cheap materials, particularly the Japanese materials, were able to gain an exemption from duty by the incorporation of certain threads which qualified them under the description of specialised cloth.  These types of specialised cloth were being imported as low as 1/7 a yard.  They would not be bought for the purpose for which specialised cloths are usually purchased, but they were being used as linings and were injuring the home manufacturers of lining materials.  We decided to raise the price at which these specialised materials might be exempted to 2/6 per yard.  Cloths designed to sell under that price would no longer be within the exemption limits as specialised cloths.</P>
    <P>In respect of the duty on thread, the thread was being imported as ply yarn, and the amendment which we made here was to prevent the evasion of the duty by importing thread as ply yarn.</P>
    <P>On the question of varnish, there was a duty on varnish away back in 1932.  It was suspended in 1943 on account of the supply position, and this is the restoration of the duty for the purpose of protecting the Irish manufacturers&mdash;there are two&mdash;who are engaged in the manufacture of varnish and who put on the market here a very satisfactory product, but were, of course, up against the difficulty of having to compete with probably much more widely advertised British products.</P>
    <P>On the question of the duty on printed matter, what we did in this case was to re-define, the duty on religious publications to cover books produced here, such as prayer books, missals, hymn-books and small gospels. The duty on printed matter is the duty <Col N="1929" /> imposed for the protection of the printing industry generally.</P>
    <P>I think that covers all the questions raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point, I think that perhaps the Minister confused items 10 and 11. No. 11 is quite clear, but No. 10 just rays: &ldquo;certain printed matter.&rdquo;  I am still not clear what that is.</P>

      <P>That will satisfy me.  It is not a major point. It is just for clarification.  I should like to be certain about a thing that is called &ldquo;certain&rdquo;.  There are just two supplementary questions I should now like to ask.  The Minister is exempting the dearer cloths from the duty and restoring it on the cheaper ones.  Have we his assurance that, in deciding the rate of duty to be imposed on something that would otherwise be sold cheaply, these cloths or the glucose mentioned, he has full regard to the fact that a host of consumers in this country like to be able to buy things Cheaply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure that the importation of these cheap articles would necessarily confer a benefit on the consumer.  What frequently happens in those cases is that some artful and enterprising importer will import some of this cloth, specially designed to get through our customs <Col N="1930" /> duties, and, having got it, will then say: &ldquo;I have got that in through the duty, but it will be sold to those who use it at the same price as if I had paid duty on it, or as if I had bought the cloth in the legitimate market&rdquo;. We have trapped various devices of that kind, and prevented people from making quite substantial sums as the result of little plots they had hatched out to get through our customs and to sell what they imported, perhaps from the Far East, at a price as if they had bought it from Britain and paid duty on it.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann would welcome the alteration of the Department of Education regulations so as to prohibit altogether the use in Irish national schools of corporal punishment for girls.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying when I was last speaking on this motion that I believed all kinds of minor offences are at present treated in national schools as if they were &ldquo;grave transgressions&rdquo; within the meaning of the regulations.  I believe that not only can the Minister not check this abuse of the regulations, but he cannot even detect it.  I do not say that lightly.  I intend at a later stage to prove it.  I was making the point on the last occasion that, in 1946, those regulations dealing with corporal punishment in schools were modified, and I said I welcomed that. I thought it was an excellent thing.  I notice that in the circular which was issued drawing the attention of schools to these modifications, the Minister found it necessary to stress two points in particular.  These constituted a modification of the regulations.  One <Col N="1931" /> was that any corporal punishment to be administered would be on the open hand only, and the second was that it should never in any circumstances be administered for mere failure at lessons.  Those were the two modifications in 1946.  I say, &ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; but I notice, therefore, that, in 1946, the Department felt the need to stress those two points, because, I suggest, the term &ldquo;grave transgression&rdquo; was, in fact, being misinterpreted in many schools, and the Department stressed their desire to have it correctly interpreted by modifying the regulations.</P>
      <P>Now, I am fully aware that very frequently the reason for the administering of corporal punishment in schools arises from conditions quite outside the control of the teachers&mdash; to conditions of overcrowding, to the excessive emphasis upon examination results, and to the fact that our education system makes no allowance for the teacher who has to teach backward children in the same class as bright children, and makes no allowance for the fact that the teacher is frequently harassed by inspectors of various kinds.  The teacher finds himself or herself in classes which come up to as much as 60 in number.</P>
      <P>I noticed a good example of that in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, not so long ago.  They published this photograph which shows you the back of a school room in which little boys and girls are doing their level best to work, although there is not room in the classrooms for ordinary desks.  They have to do their work kneeling on the ground and struggling to work on benches.  I do not want to mention the name of the school&mdash;I do not think there is any point in that&mdash;but I do suggest that the little girls at the back of this school room are not getting a fair chance either to learn or to observe ordinary discipline in the classroom; and it is quite easy to imagine that if you have, as in this case, 90 children in such a room, the conditions are such that you may, however reluctantly, be led to resort to corporal punishments, on occasion, which are not justified or permitted by the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1932" /> I know all that&mdash;I am also convinced that to some extent we are all to blame fur these overcrowding conditions in our schools, because it is our educational system, and in so far as it lies within us to change such conditions, and in so far as we have tolerated them, the fault to some extent is ours.  I am also aware of the fact that the teachers' condition is influenced by the judgment of inspectors&mdash;both inspectors of the Department of Education, and diocesan inspectors, who tend to judge teachers exclusively on the capacity of the class to answer questions quickly.</P>
    <P>When I say we are all to some extent to blame for these conditions, I think we are justified in saying that amongst those of us who are to blame have been successive Ministers for Education.  Remembering all that, I would nevertheless contend that if the Minister places teachers in unbearable conditions for the doing of illpaid work, and allows them to be harried by examination systems and ill-conceived judgments and inspections, I would put the question: why should the unfortunate children suffer more&mdash; because they already suffer from the overcrowding&mdash;suffer more, from his fault, from the grave transgression of successive Ministers in this regard. How often, in our national schools, the sins of the Minister and the sins of the Department are visited on the children and in particular upon the girls.</P>
    <P>Now I am asking the Seanad, in asking it to pass this motion, to put a stop to this at least in the case of little girls.  Let us see if we cannot at least abolish all physical punishment for girls in our schools.  This is 1956.  The regulations were altered in 1946.  Let the 1956 modification have as its aim to do away with the beating of our girls in our schools altogether. I should like to quote the views of a woman teacher, an enlightened educationist, in a most compelling article on discipline in schools, published in the <i>Church of Ireland Gazette</i> on February 17th, 1956, by Kathleen Heard, whom I do not know, but with whose ideas I find myself very much in sympathy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1933" /> She says: &ldquo;A teacher must respect her pupils&rdquo;&mdash;which seems to me to be a point that is often forgotten&mdash;&rdquo;must respect them&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and show them that she does respect them.  She must not first demand respect from them at the point of the bayonet, or with that attitude. When pupils see that she is worthy of respect they will give it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Obedience and good (?) discipline achieved by many rules and punishments will not, generally, last when schooldays are over, and I firmly believe that any corporal punishment, however mildly or reluctantly administered, is an evil thing.  It is degrading to pupil and teacher.  The weaker child will obey through fear and the &lsquo;diehard&rsquo; will always give trouble if forced to outward submission. He will take it out of those weaker than himself, and is all set to be a &lsquo;juvenile delinquent&rsquo; when he leaves.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The &lsquo;bend-over&rsquo; type of discipline, canes, leather strap, rulers and the human fist, are all weapons of war.  The race conquered by such means is naturally resentful.  It is not a fair fight.  The children are not armed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>She says further on, speaking of the schoolroom:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The schoolroom, above all places, should be the abode of harmony and quietness, and there should always be time for the pupil's mind to work.  A child cannot always think as quickly as he is expected to, and, if he disobeys, give him time to think it over.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>She says, again,&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They (that is, the children) must, of course, be trained in self-control&mdash; not temporary control from fear of the teacher.  Temporary submission is not self-control.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The final quotation I would quote from her is this: &ldquo;Children,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;always describe their teachers as being either quiet or cross &mdash;as if they were bulls&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Now it seems to me that the attitude of mind which takes the opposite view <Col N="1934" /> to that expressed in this article, the attitude of those who believe that you can only get good out of a child, and, in particular, out of a small girl, by being prepared to beat discipline into her, is an attitude of mind to be deplored in relation to the education which is got by the majority of Irish children, those attending national schools.</P>
    <P>I am aware, of course, that some people contend not only that the Minister should not change his regulations but that he has not got the right even to make these regulations.  I heard Senator T.J. O'Connell&mdash;I am sorry he is not here, because I want to quote him&mdash;saying as much in this Seanad, denying that the Minister had the right to make any regulations at all governing corporal punishment.  The quotation I wanted to give you is in Volume 45, No. 4, column 313, where he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is questionable whether the Department of Education has the right to make regulations which would limit the right of the teacher to administer reasonable corporal punishment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to say at this juncture, as I see that the Minister has just arrived, that I am sorry the Minister has not found it possible to be present till now, though I realise that it may not be fair to expect him to be in attendance at the Seanad, after a very long day at the Dáil&mdash;I understand he was in the Dáil at 10.30 a.m.&mdash;so that I find myself rather in the position of keeping him in after school.</P>
    <P>I hope he will forgive me for that.  I should like to say that I do appreciate the Minister's coming up here personally when I am sure he must be feeling rather weary after listening to a good deal of talk in the other House.</P>
    <P>The point I am making here is that certain people actually question the Minister's right to make these regulations limiting the right of teachers to administer reasonable corporal punishment.  I should like to know what the Minister says to that?  According to Senator O'Connell, these Department regulations, which I am asking to have modified, are already <i>ultra vires</i>, because Senator O'Connell contends <Col N="1935" /> that, in making this type of regulation, the Department of Education has already overstepped its powers. Senator O'Connell actually went on, later in the same column of the same debate, to imply it was to humiliate the teacher that the British Government introduced this type of regulation, limiting the amount of corporal punishment to be inflicted on Irish children!  It must surely seem rather surprising that he says in the same column that these Department regulations &ldquo;are a modified form of regulations issued over 50 years ago by an authority which was an alien administration in this country.  The fixed policy of that administration... was always to distrust and humiliate the teacher, whenever that could be done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would suggest to Senator O'Connell, if he were here, that it does not humiliate a factory owner or necessarily signify distrust of him, if we lay down certain sanitary regulations which he must abide by in running his factory.  Nor, indeed, is any genuine teacher humiliated by regulations which are sound.  Consequently, I disagree with the contention that the Minister has no right to make such regulations.  I hold that the Minister has a perfect right to make such regulations, and to modify them, as I am now asking, as the occasion arises.</P>
    <P>The present regulations, as we know, allow corporal punishment only for grave transgressions, for boys and girls alike.  It is one of the points upon which between the sexes we have equality in this country.  There are not very many, but, for once, here the girls have an equal right with the boys to be physically chastised in our schools. In fact, the girls&mdash;they are the subject of my motion&mdash;are very much involved in this question of corporal punishment in our schools, although it is true that some people forget entirely, when we are talking about corporal punishment in our schools, that we are talking about girls as well as boys.  Not so long ago, I noted that a lecturer from Roscommon accused certain unnamed people of trying to turn &ldquo;the grievances of schoolboys&rdquo; into a national <Col N="1936" /> issue.  I would affirm that the question of the manner in which corporal punishment is applied in our schools is a national issue, but it does not concern boys alone: it also concerns girls. That is why I put down this motion.</P>
    <P>If, as some people contend, this right to beat small girls is hardly ever used, then I would ask the Minister to make the experiment of stopping it altogether for girls&mdash;that is the purpose of my motion&mdash;and observe the result.  If, in fact, it is hardly ever used, what enormous harm can come from stopping it altogether in relation to girls?  I would ask the Minister to make that experiment.  Does anybody here consider that, if the beating of small girls in our schools were to be abolished altogether by the modification of regulations, the results would be disastrous? That is clearly nonsense.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, as I claim, this right to apply corporal punishment to small girls is, in fact, used far too much for minor offences, then remove from the regulations this &ldquo;grave transgression&rdquo; permission, at least for girls, and abolish corporal punishment for girls altogether.  In either case, I suggest the Minister should accept my motion.</P>
    <P>I am now going to suggest two possible reasons why the Minister and his Department are, as I said on the last occasion, so resolutely and indomitably ill-informed on the matter of the amount of corporal punishment that is, in fact, administered in our schools.</P>
    <P>One reason is that a good deal of the corporal punishment so administered is systematically concealed from Department inspectors.  I remember one child writing to me, having left school for some years, saying that her &ldquo;first lesson in hypocrisy&rdquo; came from the hiding away of straps and canes on the day the inspector was arriving. That is one reason why the Department do not know fully what goes on, because the amount of corporal punishment administered is so concealed from the representatives of the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>The second reason is that many parents, who know perfectly well that <Col N="1937" /> it goes on for all kinds of minor offences in direct contravention of the regulations, have not got the stamina necessary for the successful exposure of a breach of the regulations.  And I can assure you that it takes quite considerable stamina!  I should like to quote a case.  It is a case that will be in the files of the Department.  It started in October, 1953, when a small girl, aged 9½, received 13 slaps with a pointer in class for getting three sums wrong, that is to say, she had corporal punishment administered for mere failure at lessons.  The circumstances were that in the class three slaps were to be given for the first sum wrong and five for each subsequent incorrect answer.  This child only missed three and only got 13 slaps.  This little girl, aged 9½, came home in a bruised and distressed state, having been slapped for &ldquo;mere failure at lessons&rdquo; in direct contravention of the regulations.  What happened?  The incident was corroborated by her elder sister and by two other children in the presence of this girl's mother.  What action did the parents take?  What action did the Department of Education take?  The mother went to the school, as was the correct thing to do.  She saw the principal of the school and she got no satisfaction there.  She was not allowed to see the teacher.  She went to the school manager and the school manager said he &ldquo;would hear no criticism of a school of which he had heard nothing but praise.&rdquo;  It is quite clear, of course, why he heard no criticism when he would listen to nothing but praise.</P>
    <P>Having followed, in fact, the instructions given by the Minister for Education on the last occasion when he addressed the Seanad, and having remonstrated with the school and the manager, the mother wrote to the Department of Education, reported all the facts, and asked what were the rules.  At that time she did not know that the rules actually precluded any such infliction of corporal punishment. In reply, the Department sent her a copy of the regulations and acknowledged her letter.  Subsequently, there was a public denunciation in the school of &ldquo;little Judases who tell their mammies when they are hit.&rdquo;  The <Col N="1938" /> mother, I think rightly, transferred the child to another school in December, 1953.  One day, in the first week during which the same child was in the second school, she saw 16 girls being caned for missing questions.  She was not herself caned because she answered correctly, but she was upset by the spectacle of these 16 girls being beaten.  She was upset&mdash;and she was frightened.  Now, the mother, knowing by this time the rules and regulations, called at the school, saw the principal teacher, produced the Department's regulations and was told that, if it had been known that she would insist on the Department's regulations being applied, her children would not have been accepted in the school.  The mother, again quite rightly, wrote to the Department, and after three months of fruitless endeavour to get some kind of satisfaction from the Minister, she proceeded, only after the lapse of these three months, to write to the <i>Evening Mail.</i></P>

      <P>I am not in the least bit harassed, but I understand that this motion is addressed to the Seanad and is intended to persuade the Seanad that the regulations should be altered so that there would be no corporal <Col N="1939" /> punishment in the case of girls.  I take it that the Senator is proposing by this motion to persuade the Seanad on that subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, I have nut so far heard any very persuasive eloquence from the Senator.  I would, in fact, have very little to say in reply to this motion, not altogether on the grounds upon which it is raised, but because I am not a qualified person to examine into the make-up of girls, mentally or otherwise, and the question of the application of punishment to them.  I am not in a position to distinguish as between punishment for boys and girls, and I would not ask the Senator to do it.</P>
      <P>The Senator says it is a question whether I have authority to make regulations.  I have not made regulations imposing punishment&mdash;it is probably in the direction of reducing rather than anything else&mdash;although the Senator seems to think I have. That question, then, does not arise. What does arise is the fact that I am administering a Department dealing with education generally and in our schools, under our educational system, founded on the experience over years and years of thousands of teachers and hundreds of managers, there is a tradition of discipline and a tradition of correction.  I will not blueprint any change in that.  I have perfect confidence in the tradition that is there and in the following of it.  Where objectionable or excessive punishment occurs, I have adequate machinery to deal with that position.  That machinery operates satisfactorily to bring such matters to the surface, to ensure that they are examined into and that any objectionable practices are restrained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not take part in turning either the Seanad or the Dáil into a district court.  I am prepared to read most carefully any debate which takes place on the subject here in the Seanad; or, if the Seanad is really interested in the matter, perhaps they would set up a sub-committee to examine into the present situation.  But I think that <Col N="1940" /> would be very foolish.  I think they would be proceeding there to do something they are not qualified to do. I, at any rate, would recommend that they should depend upon the tradition of our teachers and our managers and the generally close atmosphere in which the family and educational life is lived in Ireland.  I feel very unwilling to enter into a discussion arising, as it does, out of a campaign which, I think, is epitomised in the last sentence of this report.</P>

I must admit I would welcome the presence of some representative of his Department or of some colleague of his in the Government.  He says he is willing to read the debate.  I must admit I would prefer to have somebody listening to the debate which, I think, may prove to be a fruitful one and one requiring an answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>When the <Col N="1941" /> House adjourned, I had just mentioned the second reason why I thought that the Department and the Minister are misinformed about what is happening in the schools.  I said that that second reason was that few parents had the stamina required for the purpose of drawing the Minister's attention or the Department's attention to the facts of a particular case and getting satisfaction. I was quoting as an example one such case and I had reached the point where the parents found that the Department's regulations were being broken and had been told, at the second school, that their child would not have been accepted, if it had been realised that they were going to insist on the implementation of the regulations.</P>
      <P>The mother then wrote again to the Department and got no satisfactory reply.  Nearly three months after the initial contact with the Department, she wrote to the Press, in this case, the <i>Evening Mail.</i>  Two months after that, after an amount of persistent effort, she and her husband finally obtained an interview with the Department in April, 1954.  Now, as I said, this case was started in October, 1953. By April, 1954, the parents got an interview, not with the Minister, but with the Department officials.  They received a courteous hearing, were assured that the matter would be looked into, and one week later, on the 28th April, they received a letter which I have seen.</P>
      <P>That letter said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;With reference to your letters of the 15th and 17th November last in regard to the treatment of your children in.......... school and the interview you had in this Department on the 22nd instant, I am directed to inform you that the matters referred to have been examined by the Department's inspectors. Their reports have been carefully considered by the Department and appropriate action is being taken in the case.  I am to express regret for the delay in issuing an official reply to you in the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You will notice that on 28th April a reply was made to the letters of the 15th and 17th November!  Now, this <Col N="1942" /> letter I have quoted referred only to the complaints in regard to the first school and made no reference at all to the second school where the regulations were being misconstrued or were not being applied.</P>
    <P>Not unnaturally, the parents regarded this as unsatisfactory, and wanted to know what investigations had, in fact, been made about the other school. They were told that all such information was &ldquo;confidential.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When, as is sometimes suggested, children deceive their parents and mislead them into thinking that there is bad treatment in schools, it is very difficult for the parents, in a situation like this, to discover whether in fact the child has been lying or telling the truth, when the Department says that these matters are &ldquo;confidential.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>By this time the parents had been forced to remove the child to a third school where the Department's regulations were scrupulously applied.  What interests me and what interested them is what kind of an investigation was made by the Department and who was investigated?  Who were the people interrogated?  Certainly it was not the child, because the child was not present.  What was discovered and what was done about it?  The answer given to all these questions is that these are &ldquo;strictly confidential&rdquo; matters.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I do not find it surprising that the Minister himself does not know what goes on in the schools.  We hear a good deal about family rights and the rights of parents to make decisions about the education of their children, but, as far as I can see, very frequently the parents' right is reduced to the right of touching his forelock, as in the case of the child, and saying, &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;  Most parents become discouraged and cannot keep up the effort for the six months necessary to get even such an empty official reply from the Department.</P>
    <P>Arising out of this case, the parents wrote a letter to the <i>Evening Mail</i> which was published on 21st May, 1954, from which I propose to quote:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When we bear in mind that after three months my first letter appeared in the <i>Mail</i> (which would never have <Col N="1943" /> been written if the matter had been attended to by somebody), and it was five and a half months before the Department contacted me, it should be obvious that something is wrong somewhere.  If my statements were untrue, why all the hesitancy to prove me untruthful?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These parents in this case were persistent. I hope that is not the reason why the Minister mistakenly assumed that they must be foreigners, as he stated in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that parents grow tired, dispirited, discouraged, in their relationship with the Department of Education and the Minister?  Is it any wonder that the Minister does not know half of what is going on in the schools, and consequently is led to make inaccurate statements even about the number of complaints received by his own Department?</P>
    <P>I propose to quote an example to show that the Minister does not even know the facts about his own Department. On June 30th, the Minister told the Seanad, Volume 45, No. 1, column 113:&mdash;&ldquo;The complaints that have reached me do not amount to one a month.&rdquo;  That may have been said in the heat of the moment, but a week later, in the Dáil, when there had been ample time to check the facts, he said in Volume 152, No. 4, column 472:&mdash;&ldquo;If complaints come to the Department of Education, and they have come from time to time, but certainly not more than one a month.&rdquo;  The Minister reiterated his contention in that statement that he never got more than one complaint a month.  I propose to show that on occasion there certainly are more than one a month.  I asked the Minister what he had discovered with regard to a number of cases already before him as I had been told and I said in column 104 of the same Seanad debate:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I understand that 33 of these 70 cases were, in fact, reported to his Department and I should like to know what action he found it necessary to take, what kind of investigation, and with what result?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister told me that he could not <Col N="1944" /> identify the cases and he asked me to help him.  A week later in the Dáil, on 7th July, he very impatiently accused me of &ldquo;running away when challenged to produce the facts&rdquo; in these cases.</P>
    <P>When I found from the Minister's speech, as reported in the Dáil, that he really wanted me to help him, I contacted the School Childrens' Protection Organisation, got the details, and prepared a Table which I sent to the Minister on July 18th, 11 days afterwards.  I had said 33 out of 70 cases.  There were in fact 32 cases, because one had been reported twice. These 32 cases were reported to him between the 5th May, 1954, and the 3rd May, 1955, that is within the period of 12 months immediately preceding the month of June in which he made his first statement that he never got more than one complaint a month.</P>
    <P>In this Table which I sent to him giving him the details of these cases I broke it up into four columns.  I gave the date of the departmental acknowledgment of the complaint, the signature of his officer, the nature of the complaint, and any additional comment that was necessary.  I was able to provide the details for which I was asked regarding date, signature of official acknowledgment, etc. in 24 out of 32 cases, and I actually produced written documentary evidence that 24 of these cases were in fact before the Minister's Department within a period of 12 months.  In the other cases I was able to quote the date on which the complaint was lodged.  Even if we considered only the 24 cases for which I could give these particulars the Seanad will see for itself that in fact more than twice the number admitted by the Minister had been submitted to the Minister's Department&mdash;and these were only the cases I happened to know about.</P>
    <P>I gave no names on this Table, but it seemed that it would be obvious from the dates that the persons concerned could be identified; and the Minister did make it perfectly clear, not immediately, but slightly reluctantly, that he had in fact identified them from my Table, as I propose to show.  Arising out of these cases, I asked the following <Col N="1945" /> specific questions, since my queries in relation to them had been side-stepped in the Seanad, though each of these cases had been already with the Department when I made my previous speech on the matter.  The questions I asked were in relation to each case: (1) What kind of an investigation was held?  To that I was never given any answer.  (2) Was a sworn inquiry held or contemplated?  I got no answer to that question.  (3) Was the teacher in question questioned in the presence of the parent and child and vice versa? No answer.  (4) Was the complaining parent personally contacted by the person making the investigation?  No answer.  (5) What were the findings of whatever kind of investigation was made?  No answer.  (6) What, if any, action was decided upon, and taken, arising out of these findings?  No answer.  (7) What final reply was made to the parents who brought the matter to your attention?  No answer.  (8) How many of these 32 parents received any communication at all from your Department at the conclusion of your investigations?  No answer.</P>
    <P>The Department could, not even tell me that!  They believed that it would not be apparently in the public interest even to reveal how many of these parents ever got any final reply at all from the Department!  To this list of questions based on this Table, I got no reply at all from the Department beyond a formal acknowledgment between July 18 and the end of September. You will remember that in early July the Minister was accusing me of &ldquo;running away when challenged to produce the facts,&rdquo; but by the end of September I still had not received from him a reply to my letter and inquiries of July 18th, when I produced the facts he asked for.  So I wrote on September 27th, again reminding the Minister that he had accused me of running away when challenged to produce the facts, and that I had challenged the Minister to produce the facts.  I got a formal acknowledgment, but no reply at all to my questions, merely a fresh acknowledgment. And these were all cases which had been already on the Department's file, some of them since May, 1954!</P>
    <P>Then on November the 1st, the day <Col N="1946" /> before the Seanad reassembled, I got a reply from the Minister which I propose to read:</P>
    <P Just="Right">&ldquo;1st November, 1955.</P>
    <P>Dear Senator,</P>
    <P>With reference to your letter of 18th July last, with which you forwarded a list of 32 cases in which you stated that complaints as to ill treatment of pupils by teachers of national schools had been made to my Department, I desire to inform you that the relevant files show that which the exception of case No. 6, which could not be identified from the information supplied by you, suitable steps to investigate the complaints were taken in every case. Where the completion of these investigations showed that the provisions of the rules governing corporal punishment had been infringed appropriate official action was taken regarding the teachers concerned.</P>
    <P>In the interest of the schools generally it is not the practice to disclose the result of inquiries into complaints against teachers or the nature of any disciplinary action that may be taken in their regard to any person other than the manager of the school in question.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Richard Mulcahy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems to me surprising that it should take four full months for the Minister to write and tell me that suitable investigation was made and appropriate action taken, and that then, after four months, he could not tell me, out of 32 cases, how many parents got any final reply to their complaints at all! That is apparently secret confidential material which must not be revealed in the public interest.  My fears and concern on the whole matter are very far from having been even partially allayed by the way in which the Minister has failed to answer these queries put to him by me.  I would like the Seanad to note that the Minister had in fact identified the cases from my dates, and therefore it is clear that in the 12 months from May, 1954, to May, 1955, he had not got only the 12 cases he claimed as a maximum, but, <Col N="1947" /> at the very least, 31 cases duly reported to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information could the Senator tell us the number of children attending the schools in that period, the schools under the jurisdiction of the Minister?  It would be interesting to know that in relation to the 31 cases about which he said there were complaints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with the numbers and schools in the course of my remarks, but I prefer to develop my speech in my own way. The Minister had got certainly 31 cases of which I know, and I do not know how many others he had got also, yet he said that he &ldquo;never&rdquo; got &ldquo;more than one a month.&rdquo;  I feel justified therefore in concluding that he does not fully know what goes on in his own Department, much less in the schools. That is one of the reasons for my disquietude on the whole matter.  I would like the Seanad to know that it took him nearly four months to reply to my letter, and to say that &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; investigations and &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; disciplinary action had been taken.  I submit that those are phrases which could have been used immediately, and it should not take four months of research to discover them.</P>
      <P>It is consequently little wonder that parents with legitimate complaints despair of getting any redress at all from the Department.  Is it any wonder either that the Minister is so widely out of touch with the schools, when he does not know what is going on in his own Department?  Now of these 32 cases which I set out on the Table, more than half dealt with beating or physical ill-treatment of little girls.  Seventeen out of the 32 cases dealt with girls, that is, more than half.  I should like to quote from this Table; Case No. 1, which deals with the case of a little girl who was beaten with a stick by a male teacher because she had given evidence against him in a case which he had lost in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was alleged that the girl had given evidence against the same teacher in a court case which he lost.  Case No. 3: a girl caught by the throat and beaten by a teacher.  Case No. 5: a <Col N="1948" /> girl of nine beaten with a strap because papers were on the floor. Teacher &ldquo;sent message to take child away as she did not like children who told their mammies and daddies.&rdquo; Approached by mother, teacher claimed inspector had given her permission to use strap.  This was denied by the inspector who was also approached.  Case No. 6: girl slapped for being late at school, afraid to go back to school.  Case No. 8: a girl beaten, her legs blackened and her head struck.  Case No. 9: a girl of nine beaten by a male teacher.  Query put to the Department about the necessity for a six and a half year old sister to attend singing classes with the same teacher.  The parent complained to the teacher.  Query to the Department about these singing classes remained still unanswered by the Department for six months, despite several reminders, on January 24th, 1955 and May 1st, 1955.  The parent writes on May 25th, 1955: &ldquo;I am still waiting for the Minister's ruling on the question I asked last October.&rdquo; Case No. 10: a girl slapped for lateness. Another sent home for missing a question.  Case No. 12: a girl of seven beaten with a flat board for failure at poetry and placed on a high window ledge as a punishment.  The case was reported to the Civic Guards. The mother in her letter says: &ldquo;This teacher, when I went out on the road to speak to her about it would not get off her bicycle, only passed me like a dog&rdquo;.  Case No. 16: a girl of 13 slapped because she failed to bring money for elocution classes.  Query put to Department: is the elocution class compulsory?  Another girl slapped because she had no money for Irish books.  Teacher remonstrated with, said that she would slap the child every day until the money was brought. In that case details given to the Minister that the father was supporting a wife, an invalid mother and eight children, and affirmed that sometimes he was genuinely short of money. Case No. 17: a girl of nine and a half, a case which I did mention, given 13 slaps for failure at sums.  Case No. 18: a girl of eight struck on the face and neck.  Parent remonstrated with teacher.  Parent states &ldquo;I got nothing <Col N="1949" /> but abuse for daring to complain&rdquo; Case No. 23: a girl beaten, her hand blackened many times despite protests, and so on.  Case 26: a girl of seven &ldquo;beaten black&rdquo; for leaning on playground railing.  Nine-year-old sister received a weal on the wrist.  Children in that school regularly slapped in the face.  Remonstrated with the Manager, who in the words of parent &ldquo;almost bit my head off&rdquo;.  Parent reluctant further to upset the Manager who was in indifferent health.  Case No. 27: girl of eight caned for missing lessons. Child given additional punishment because of parent's complaints, and the teacher evaded the inspector when he called.  Case No. 28&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, could the Senator tell us what document he is quoting from?  Has he any definite evidence of this, or it is just hearsay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped that I had made it clear that this is the Table which I submitted to the Minister on July 18th, which I am prepared to put on the Table of the House, and I asked the Minister as far back as June what had been his findings in these cases, and still have not been able to find out.  Perhaps the Senator might be more fortunate in obtaining that information.  Case No. 28, a girl who had been operated on for squint was struck in the face with a book for missing sums.  Parent remonstrated with the teacher and was told to remove the child from the school.  Case No. 32, girl beaten for blotting copy book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to place that Table on the Table of the House, and it seems to me that in these cases the Minister ought to be concerned.  I could quote other such cases.  I could quote the case reported fully in the <i>Evening Mail</i> on the 23rd April, 1954, under the heading &ldquo;Saw Teacher Bend Girl Across Desk&rdquo;.  The evidence was given in court of a male teacher, teaching a mixed class, catch a girl of 13 by the throat and bending her backwards against the desk at such and such a school on February 17th. Teacher in fact admitted that he pulled her hair and that he placed his hand <Col N="1950" /> underneath her chin.  The court decided that the evidence showed that this in fact had been done, and the teacher was fined.</P>
    <P>As this type of extreme case relates to what Senator Douglas asked me earlier I should like to quote my letter of July 18th to the Minister.  I said then:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I should like to conclude by making it perfectly clear, as I did in the Seanad, that my interest in these 32 previously reported cases, and the action taken by your Department upon them, derives primarily, not so much from the special features of each case, as from the general common background of regular beating and slapping for minor offences, in direct contravention of your regulations, which every such extreme case inevitably implies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My mention of these cases is for the purpose of showing that they might well have been cases which might have disturbed the Minister, and that they are the cases about which the Minister issued a challenge to me and about which he was unable to give me any information, and about which he was not able even to say how many of the parents got any final reply at all, and it took him four months to discover even whether or not any &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; investigation was made.</P>
    <P>Those are extreme cases.  I have never suggested that this type of case is the rule.  But I am satisfied that the extreme cases show a background, a general pattern, of beating for minor offences, that is to say, not grave transgressions, and I suggest that that goes on to the certain knowledge of most of the parents of the country in far too many schools, and that it applies to girls as well as to boys.</P>
    <P>My purpose, then, in proposing this motion was to draw attention to the necessity for changing the regulations, because within the ambit of the regulations which theoretically permit beating of girls only for grave transgressions, so many offences are treated as if they were grave transgressions which are in fact mere minor offences. The regulations must be changed if we are to stop this quantity of corporal <Col N="1951" /> punishment administered on small girls for minor offences in our schools. I beg, therefore, to propose this motion and, in concluding my opening speech, I should like to regret that the Minister did not find it possible to send somebody for the purpose of listening and, perhaps, replying.  I realise that nobody in his Department could reply in the Seanad, but some of his colleagues might, I think, have shown sufficient interest in the topic to have come here and listen to the case made and see whether there might be a possibility that they are open to persuasion. The Minister was not open to persuasion, he told us, but I thought that perhaps they might be.  I hope to see this motion welcoming a modification of the rules passed in the Seanad My hope is to see at least this step forward being taken towards improving the lot of little girls in our national schools.  For that purpose I beg to propose the motion.</P>

      <P>In the circumstances, I accept your ruling, and I should like to answer the point made by the Minister that he was not open to persuasion because he considered that the traditions of teaching and education in our country were such down the ages that he was not a person who was going to change them. The point I should like to make in answer to that is that in my submission, the traditions in this country relating to education were affected, I hope, by Patrick Pearse.  I was very pleased and honoured, I may tell the Seanad, to be told by Senator Miss Pearse that she was going to support me if she was available when my motion came up.  Now, in my contention, Patrick Pearse, who was one of the greatest educationists we have had in this country, would most emphatically have voted against corporal punishment for girls.  I believe he would have voted against corporal punishment for boys also, and I would like to appeal personally to the Minister to accept, as being within the tradition of Irish education, the name and the example and the teaching of Patrick Pearse.  I hope in conclusion that on this motion the Whips will not be put on, and that we can have a free vote upon this motion which I should like to see passed.</P>
