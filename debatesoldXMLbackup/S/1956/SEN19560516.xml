    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask a question which betrays some ignorance.  Is it common form in a Bill of this kind to give the Minister such absolute powers, such absolute discretion, without leaving any appeal to the <Col N="3" /> applicant?  I think the Seanad ought to consider this section very carefully. It shows, in a sense, the dying away of the powers of the Legislature and the immense growth of the powers of Ministers.  This is not a matter of any particular Minister or of any particular country, but I find it disturbing.  It seems to me that, under this section, suppose we had an unjust or even a temporarily unjust Minister, an applicant could be refused a licence quite arbitrarily and, as far as I can see, have no appeal.</P>
      <P>I want to ask two questions.  Is what I say true and, secondly, is this common form in Bills of this kind?  If the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to both questions, I must again deplore the way in which the Legislature is tending to give more and more absolute powers to the Minister. He will understand there is no personal reflection of any kind in this; it is purely a matter of legislation.</P>

      <P>What the Senator says is true, but even that does not necessarily make it alarming.  The whole purpose of this Bill is to continue the present arrangement for a period of two years.  Within that period, we hope to be able to work out a new scheme for the purchase of tea.  I explained all that on the Second Stage of the Bill.  The idea in this section is that all the importation of tea, except for small gift parcels, should be done by Tea Importers, Limited, because that is at present the sole importing organisation.  This is merely an arrangement to continue the present situation, virtually without any change whatever, in order that we can have these powers, pending the enactment of subsequent legislation which will change the pattern of our tea trade, whilst, at the same time, preserving what it is desirable to preserve. namely, concentrating purchases in the country of origin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we must acquiesce in it, but I would urge that, when the wider Bill comes forward, as presumably it will, in two years' time, such absolute powers as these should be very carefully guarded against.  As a matter of general principle, I deplore the tendency to give such wide powers to the Minister without any qualifications whatever by the legislature.  That seems to be the case in this clause.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Stanford. I would ask the Minister to bring in the legislation which he suggests here as soon as possible.  The world is moving much more towards a free economy than has been the case for some years.  We are getting out of this wartime economy.  Britain has shed practically all the controls and all the State buying.  We shall feel the effects of it in relation to the things we have to sell.  I believe that if businessmen were allowed to purchase tea, they would probably be able to purchase parcels of tea far cheaper than they can be bought by Tea Importers, Limited.  Even if the Minister left Tea Importers, Limited, in existence, there is no reason why traders should not be allowed to purchase, as well as Tea Importers, Limited.  It would have the beneficial effect of putting Tea Importers.  Limited, on their toes. I believe that if people were selling in competition against Tea Importers, Limited, it would result in better business for the State and particularly for the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this is the place to discuss the future pattern of our tea trade.  I want to leave this thought with Senators who are interested.  Those who advocate the unrestricted right of every single citizen to import tea from wherever he likes have the obligation of proving that it is all for the good of the <Col N="5" /> national interest.  If you let people buy tea anywhere they like, with possibly only fragmentary credit facilities at their disposal, they will not really do as well as a single organisation with the resources of the State behind it. Because of the quantities involved, it could possibly buy tea at a lesser price and sell at a lesser price than the small individual tea merchant could.  The House will have an opportunity of discussing the merits of the small man buying where he likes or a larger body to which the small man will have access being able to use its collective strength to buy in the market.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
      <P>Government amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To insert &lsquo;and&rsquo; at the end of line 26, and to add the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(iii) in the case of a body corporate, all the shares are in the beneficial ownership of Irish citizens, and</P>
      <P>(iv) the business will be effectively managed and controlled by an Irish citizen or citizens each of whom normally resides in the State.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is moved for the purpose of meeting a point made by Deputy Lemass when the Bill was under discussion in the Dáil.  It was then mentioned that he feared it would not be possible to restrict the issue of tea licences to persons, <Col N="6" /> even where it was not established that the business was in Irish ownership and control.  This amendment, therefore, represents a further examination of the problem, with a view to strengthening the section, so as to ensure that the provisions of the section are complied with in the case of persons who seek a tea wholesaler's licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this is a wise amendment.  I do not think it is a necessary amendment. I think we all approve in this House of an enlightened spirit of nationalism, but I am afraid that sometimes our nationalism is not quite as enlightened as it might be.  It is a mistake and, perhaps, a mistake for which we may have to pay, if we are going too narrowly to insist that business of this kind be confined entirely to Irish nationals.</P>
      <P>Certain concessions are made in Britain, for instance, to Irish citizens in various forms of employment, and we recognise that fact in another Bill which will come before us this afternoon&mdash;at any rate it is on the Order Paper.  There are many business posts, official offices held in Britain&mdash;Lords Mayors and mayors of councils and so forth, held by Irishmen and women.  I could imagine quite an outcry in this country, if they were to be put out of office or business simply because they were Irish.</P>
      <P>I feel that we are introducing a rather grudging spirit here by saying, without any kind of reservation, that we are going to restrict this entirely to Irish citizens.  I do not believe it is necessary in practice.  I do not think it enshrines a very generous principle, in view of the fact that Irish nationals are better treated than this in Britain, the Commonwealth and some other countries.  Therefore, I am opposed to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment because I think it is in line with what the majority of us would wish to have in an important trade such as the tea trade is to the community in general, particularly having regard to what happened over the past number of years.  Therefore, I entirely disagree <Col N="7" /> with the point of view put forward by the previous speaker.</P>
      <P>There is, however, one question I should like to ask the Minister, having regard to his anxiety in putting down this amendment.  The Bill, as presented to the House by the Minister, provides that the present position will operate for at least a period of two years, and that, before there will be any change in the purchase of tea for consumption in this country, a comprehensive Bill will be presented to the House.  When we examine this Bill, we have very grave doubts as to whether that was the real intention of the Minister.  I should like to get an assurance from the Minister that no agreements of any kind will be entered into, whether with the present importers of tea or with others who may be anxious to enter into the trade in future, and that we shall not be presented either here or in the other House with a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>
      <P>The Minister asked us to pass this amendment.  That we are prepared to do, but, before any agreements are entered into, the Oireachtas should be consulted, so that it will be in a position either to give its approval or register its disapproval.  If that is the case, I fully appreciate the Minister's difficulties in this matter and I have no hesitation in supporting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that two points should be considered with regard to this amendment.  The first is that there may be people who are already engaged in this trade who are not Irish citizens and who have been engaged in the trade for a long time. The effect of the amendment would seem to me to put them out of business straight away.  I do not know if there are any such people, but there may be, and, if there are, it does seem to me to be wrong that a Bill should be passed which would eliminate them from their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second point occurs to me that, under the amendment, as drafted, if the ownership of any share ceases to be in the hands of a citizen, a State company might be disqualified immediately. <Col N="8" /> Things like that could happen, without any intention on the part of the directors or the main body of shareholders. Beneficial ownership can pass under the terms of the section, or in many ways.  In the Control of Manufactures Acts, there is provision made in such a case, giving a period during which matters may be put right.  I appreciate that in this case the Minister might possibly not revoke the licence, but it will be within his power to do so, and, if there is to be a provision that, on the change of ownership of shares, a company might cease to hold the status it originally held, there should be some provision giving a time during which that matter might be put right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained on the Second Reading of this Bill and again to-day that this is really a stop-gap Bill, tying the situation which we have had in the past to that status for the next two years.  The provision in this Bill to which Senator Sheehy Skeffington objects is the same kind of provision, in fact, as has been in our legislation since 1947, when Tea Importers, Limited, was set up.  The whole idea is, and then was, to confine the grant of import licences to Tea Importers, Limited, and the licences were granted to concerns which were conducting all the operations of a <i>bona fide</i> wholesale business in this country.</P>
      <P>I think the Senator has got to watch this situation, that we do not create a position in which some external tea company can manage to set up a distributing office here and finance that entirely by outside capital, ensuring that all the work of the office is done elsewhere than here, that the stocks of tea are not held here and that the employment which would follow from their being held here is provided outside the country I do not think anybody wants to create a situation of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, therefore, desirable that we should not provide a loophole to enable that kind of activity, which is not nationally advantageous, to be created by an excessively liberal attitude in a matter of that kind.  I suggest, therefore, that, whatever <Col N="9" /> views the Senator may have on the nationalistic aspect of this amendment, he ought to balance them with the realisation of the advantages which flow from endeavouring to concentrate the tea trade in the hands of people who function here and who are financed here.</P>
    <P>I just want to say in reply to Senator Cox that, if he looks at Section 7 (6), he will see that provision is made there that a licence granted or deemed to be granted under Article 13 of the Tea Order, 1950, and in force at the passing of this Act shall continue in force and be deemed to have been issued under this section. That covers the case of people who are at present in the trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, it does not cover the position with regard to possible changes in the constitution of a company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  A person who gets a licence has to be a qualified person, under Section 6, and he has got to remain a qualified person.  If the conditions under which the licence was granted are not continued, the Minister may revoke the licence.  It is at the discretion of the Minister whether that revocation shall take place or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister one question on this. Does this embody a change in the existing legislation or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite convinced that the Minister has realised the full import of his amendment, because he has argued that the purpose of this amendment is to prevent a company which is entirely owned outside from setting up an office here, and so on.  The amendment, in fact, prevents any single share in any company being held by anybody outside. It, consequently, goes quite a lot further than the purpose which the Minister has just stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Where does the Senator get that interpretation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>A little bit of confusion has arisen in my mind from the short discussion that has taken place here. I understood, when the Second Reading of the Bill was in progress here, that no change would be made for two years, until such time as a new organisation would be set up here for the purchase of tea from outside.  The question arises, and I think it is the over-all consideration: does the Minister contemplate giving licences to people other than Tea Importers, Limited, for the purchase of tea for the people of this country for the next two years, be they nationals or non-nationals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator look at the control of imports section&mdash; Section 3?  He will see that it is intended under that section to confine the import of tea to Tea Importers, Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what it is proposed to do under this Bill.  That is the present position.  The section we are dealing with now deals with the position of a wholesaler's licence. These licences have been granted in the past under the Tea Order of 1950.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>May I have a reply to my question, whether this does or does not alter the existing legislation? In other words, does this strengthen the powers that may be used against firms or does it leave the powers as they were?  I think that is an important question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; to that question.  Let me put it this way: under the Tea Order of 1950, I have absolute discretion to grant or revoke licences.  To the extent that this section is, therefore, specific, I have got to comply with the section and have no power which would amount to a power outside the section.  To that extent, therefore, this is more specific and I have less discretion than I would have, if this section were not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I find that satisfactory, but may I ask one more question?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>With due deference, this arises from the Minister's last answer.  I want to know whether, under this section, if we pass it, certain persons who are now able to trade in tea will be deprived of that right or not, or will the practical situation remain unchanged?  It seems to me a question that ought to be answered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put the point that, if we pass this amendment, which demands that, before the Minister grants a wholesaler's licence, he must be satisfied in relation to a body corporate incorporated in the State that all the shares of that body corporate shall be in the beneficial ownership of Irish citizens, and if the Minister then discovers that one share in one company of these <Col N="12" /> wholesalers&mdash;I am not talking about importers&mdash;is in the hands of somebody normally resident here, but who is not an Irish citizen, I suggest that he will be precluded from granting them a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Senator wants to deal with the theory or the actualities of the situation. If you look at Section 7, you will see that a licence granted or deemed to be granted under Article 13 of the Tea Order, 1950, and in force at the passing of this Act shall continue in force and be deemed to have been issued under this section.  That means that anybody now dealing in tea, from the standpoint of having a wholesaler's licence, will get a licence when this Bill is passed and that it will be issued automatically.</P>
      <P>If the Senator will look at the section, as well, he will see that there is no power of revocation in this section in respect of licences issued under Section 6.</P>

      <P>It becomes evident, in that case, that we may have new companies applying for wholesale licences and being precluded from getting a licence, although they may, in fact, be just as well qualified as existing companies who already have the licence before the passing of this Act.  We are introducing a new principle here which would have excluded certain companies, had this been the law when they applied.  It seems to me that this is a dangerous principle and that it is unnecessary.  I appeal to the Minister to withdraw at least portion of this amendment&mdash;the one under the heading (iii) which demands that every share of every wholesale company shall be in the beneficial ownership of Irish citizens.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, may I suggest that a licence which has been granted under the 1950 Order is deemed to have been issued under this section.  Therefore, the power of revocation under sub-section (5) would apply.  That is to say that, <Col N="13" /> if the Minister were satisfied that one no longer applied under Section 6, then he could revoke.  If a person holds a licence at present under the 1950 Order and if he is not an Irish citizen, or if it be a company, all the shares of which are not held by Irish citizens, then the Minister could revoke it under sub-section (5) of Section 7. Whether or not the Minister would revoke it is another question, but undoubtedly, on paper, he would be entitled to revoke it.</P>

      <P>Is there some special legal meaning attaching to the expression &ldquo;beneficial ownership of Irish citizens&rdquo;?  To my mind, it would be far simpler to say &ldquo;the shares are held by Irish citizens&rdquo;.  Why the curious terminology?  Is it normal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It means simply that sometimes some people hold shares for somebody else; in other words, nominated shareholders instead of beneficial shareholders.  A shareholder who gets no benefit from holding the shares is a different kind of person from one in the beneficial ownership of shares, because he gets something from the ownership.</P>

I think we are somewhat mixed up in our interpretation of the Bill as to &ldquo;importers&rdquo; and &ldquo;wholesalers&rdquo;.  I would ask the Minister whether the same conditions will apply to persons engaged in the importation of tea, after Tea Importers, Limited, have been abolished, as we are now providing for in this section in relation to wholesalers.</P>

      <P>I cannot say that at this stage.  To answer that question now would involve taking a decision at this stage as to the character of the Bill.  The examination has not proceeded that far.  All this Bill does, in the main, is to continue the present arrangement whereby Tea Importers Limited are the sole importing authority and will remain so until such time as the new pattern of tea purchases is evolved.  In that case, the House, before this legislation expires, will have an opportunity of seeing the new legislation and contrasting the new with the old.</P>

      <P>It may well be true that there is a new situation.  Tea Importers, Limited, are being financed by guarantees provided by the <Col N="15" /> Exchequer.  In other words, they are being financed by guarantees provided by the Irish people.  I do not think it was ever the intention of the Legislature to provide the same kind of facilities for every company established in any place in the world.  If we are providing these financial guarantees, we ought to endeavour to provide them for our own people in a special way, rather than give our own people only the same facilities as are extended to people anywhere else.</P>

      <P>On this stage, may I just express the hope that, while one welcomes this Bill, as it maintains the <i>status quo</i> for another period of two years, during that period very minute and far-reaching consultations with everybody concerned in the tea trade in this country will be taken by the Minister before a final decision is presented in the form of a Bill to the Oireachtas?  Our tea trade is a very valuable trade.  It is an essential part of our way of life.  In actual fact, our annual consumption of tea amounts to something in the neighbourhood of 25,000,000 lbs. per year.  It is not an item of our economy that ought lightly to be handed over to any one organisation. It is perhaps too much to expect, under modern conditions, that we would ever be in a position to revert to complete liberalisation of the trade, whereby any licensed individual in this country was free to enter into the trade and go out into the world markets to buy when and how he could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there are also, on the other <Col N="16" /> side of the picture, certain dangers that are always coincident with what has come to be known as bulk buying and I hope, before a final decision is made, that everyone in all sections of this trade will be given an opportunity of being heard, because there are two distinct views on the tea trade.  There is the view of the large financier who is concerned only with finance and profits.  From the point of view of the Irish consumer there is the much more valuable point of view that must be listened to, that is, the view of the experts on tea who are in this country, and there are very many of them, indeed&mdash;men who know tea from A to Z and who have been born and brought up in the trade.  They are recognised experts on the London and eastern markets and they are capable of judging tea and grading tea.  I trust that between now and final legislation on this matter these will be heard and will be consulted.</P>

      <P>There is much of what Senator Crosbie said with which I should like to be associated, but, at the same time, I think we should not allow this occasion to pass, particularly having regard to this very important measure, without expressing our appreciation of what has been accomplished by Tea Importers, Limited, over a number of very difficult years. We should also avail of this occasion to express our regret at the mishandling of this whole position during the past one and a half years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill proposes to extend for another period of two years the present arrangements.  The Bill is necessitated by the decisions made by the Government in the form of a camouflage subsidy of tea over the past 12 months.  Until Tea Importers, Limited, have rid themselves of the expense of paying back to the banks the interest and moneys to provide the people of this country with cheap tea, as the people were led to believe over a very short period of years, we cannot get rid of Tea Importers, Limited, no matter how many Ministers of the <Col N="17" /> present Government would like to do so.</P>
      <P>Finally, I should like to have a very definite assurance from the Minister that nothing will be done in regard to setting up a new organisation of tea importers, whether from the trade itself or otherwise, until the Oireachtas has an opportunity of giving its opinion on whatever measures might be put before it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Hawkins in paying a tribute to the work of Tea Importers, Limited.  I do not think it is sufficiently recognised that, from the outset, these men, as Senator Crosbie said, who are experts in the trade have been prepared to pool their knowledge and skill in Tea Importers, Limited, and to do that for the sake of the community.  I think recognition of that fact is important.</P>
      <P>It follows&mdash;and here I differ from Senator Crosbie&mdash;that it would be for the continued benefit of the community if we could prevail upon these experts to continue to pool their knowledge and work as a team for the sake of Ireland, when they are abroad buying in these markets, rather than lapse back into a situation in which individual Irish importers would be pitting their skill, one against another, for the benefit of one or other individual and highly skilled importer, but not, I would suggest, for the general good of the community.  The perfect analogy is the man who sends his wife to an auction to bid against himself, in the hope that thereby he will get better value for his family, when, quite obviously, he will not.  I should like to see in future organisations a continuance of this principle of bulk buying in which we pool the undoubted skill of these importers and use it for the sake of the whole community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Government on giving the overdraft in connection with tea. They were very wise to do that.  Tea is coming down in price and that shows that the Government were justified in the decision they took.  I find myself at variance with what the Minister said with regard to Tea Importers, Limited, <Col N="18" /> that it was better to have a State-sponsored body purchasing the tea, unless it could be proved that the job could be done better by private traders.  I believe it would be better to have the private traders buying it, until it could be proved that it would be done better by a State-sponsored body.  We should encourage the small individual, rather than make the State or the corporation stronger.</P>
      <P>There is another principle in this Bill to which I am opposed, that is, the guaranteeing of a monopoly in regard to tea trading.  Recently, one Department of State appointed agents in Britain to handle some of our goods. They appointed a foreign firm operating in Britain to sell our goods, and the people of Irish extraction in Britain, who would be interested in promoting the sale of Irish goods, were not appointed.</P>

      <P>The Bill does not deal with it, but I would suggest that we should have a certain amount of consistency in regard to these things.  I would impress upon the Minister the desirability of bringing in this legislation as soon as possible.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to the husband and wife going to the auction, but I should like to point out to the Senator that there are a great many more people than husbands and wives buying tea.</P>
      <P>In the principal towns of this country, the large traders are experts at testing tea.  They receive samples and are able to value these samples and determine the type of tea which their clients want.  They bought tea in competition with the whole world, and not merely in competition with husbands and wives.  What Senator Sheehy Skeffington proposes is to have the whole tea trade controlled by highly advertised brands.  Rather should our approach be to encourage the craft of tea buying by traders in the cities and towns of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to follow this discussion to the limits of its logic as a result of the matter raised on the <Col N="19" /> Fifth Stage of the Bill.  It is not necessarily a virtue to do in 1956 or 1958 something that we did in 1908, if the only recommendation for continuing the policy is to say: &ldquo;Well, that was always the old pattern.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I know there are people who prefer that they should be allowed to buy from London tea merchants&mdash;to use the London merchant to store their tea, to get credit from the London merchant, to let the London merchant pack the tea, to let him insure it, to let him ship it and generally to act as the warehousing authority for the wholesale or the retail merchant here; but is this consideration not worthy of some notice: If we buy tea in the country of origin&mdash;and I know of no reason why tea should be sold cheaper in a country which is not the country of origin, than it can be sold in the country which produces it&mdash;is there not an obvious advantage, where you can organise your collective purchasing strength, &mdash;how you would do it is another matter and I will come to that in a second, is there not an obvious advantage where you organise your collective purchasing strength, transport the tea and warehouse it in your own country, providing in your own country all the employment in warehousing that you would otherwise provide, if you are satisfied to do your dealings with the London merchant who will do all the thinking on tea for you and where you can make sure that the insurance on the transport of 24,000,000 or 25,000,000 lbs. of tea can be undertaken by Irish companies, that all the packing can be done as a matter of policy in Ireland, and where you can envisage the possibility that you can provide the ships to transport the goods back here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can, if we like, say: &ldquo;Let the London merchants do the tea buying for us; they are the wiseacres in this matter&mdash;let them buy the tea, and insure it, pack it and transport it for us.&rdquo;  Of course, the Irish consumer will pay all those charges.  It is not the London merchant who will pay them.  All these charges will go on the price of tea and the Irish consumer will have the privilege of paying <Col N="20" /> for these additional charges.  If he is going to pay warehousing, freight and insurance charges, why should he not, as a matter of intelligent national planning, provide these benefits for Irish organisations here who are engaged in that trade?  In my view, the more buying, warehousing, insuring and packaging we do ourselves and the more transport we do ourselves, the more it is all calculated to inure in the long run to the benefit of the Irish people.  In so far as we employ agents in London or anywhere else to do this kind of work for us, we lose to that extent a national advantage.</P>
    <P>I do not contemplate a State sponsored body continuing to purchase Irish tea requirements elsewhere.  Tea Importers, Limited, came into existence in a very special way and for very special reasons.  There is no question that you have not to love Tea Importers, Limited, to admit this fact, that bulk buying of tea by Tea Importers, Limited, did enable them to buy tea cheaper than the individual wholesaler could have bought that tea in the circumstances operating during those particularly difficult years.  I have not yet decided the form of organisation we should have for the purposes of buying tea, but I think it ought to be possible, while permitting the manufacturer to select the kind of teas he wants and to buy them in whatever countries produce these teas, to get wholesalers together into some kind of co-operative organisation&mdash;not a State-sponsored or State-controlled body, but a co-operative organisation where their collective buying would be organised to the advantage of the tea trade and of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The control of that kind of body, if I contemplated establishing it, would be in the hands of those who know the tea trade in this country&mdash;not in the hands of a Government Department, but in the hands of those who know the trade.  That organisation would represent the buying organisation for the tea trade in this country, giving the individuals who are members of the co-operative organisation the opportunity of ordering whatever classes of tea they wanted.  I think something of that kind, as a substitute for Tea <Col N="21" /> Importers, Limited, and as a means of avoiding the rigidity which goes with the establishment of a State-sponsored body for a particular trade such as this, has a good deal to commend it. However, it is quite clear that tea can always produce a good discussion in our Parliamentary Assemblies here, and I have no doubt that, when the new Bill is introduced in both Houses, there will be many views to express. In this whole business, our main objective ought to be to try to work out whatever is nationally the most beneficial. I have no particular axe to grind in this matter at all; I am only concerned with doing whatever is best for the common good, not merely of those engaged in the tea trade, but utilising such a very substantial trade in such a manner as will enable it to react beneficially on the whole Irish economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Crotty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main object of this Bill is to enable effect to be given to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954.  The Bill also repeals and reenacts in amended form the Oil in Navigable Waters Act, 1926.</P>
      <P>During recent years, the pollution of the sea by oil has reached grave proportions for many countries.  We in Ireland have fortunately not been as seriously affected as some other countries but there have been numerous instances of serious pollution of our coasts and coastal waters. The amenities at many of our seaside resorts have been affected and there has been destruction and injury of sea birds.  Oil pollution is also a potential danger to fish life and the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal sources of the serious <Col N="22" /> oil pollution in recent years are oil tankers and oil burning ships.  Large quantities of oils are discharged into the sea by tankers when washing their tanks and disposing of oily ballast water.  Dry cargo ships which use their fuel tanks for ballast water also discharge oily ballast water into the sea.  Much of the oil which is so discharged, including crude oil, fuel oil, heavy, diesel oil and lubricating oil, persist in the sea for very long periods and can be carried for considerable distances by currents and winds.</P>
    <P>Our existing legislation, the Oil in Navigable Waters Act, 1926, deals with pollution of our territorial seas and harbours but up to now it has not been possible to take effective steps to prevent the far more serious pollution which occurs on the high seas and which is carried to our shores by winds and currents.  The only hope of dealing with this problem lies in concerted international action.  The League of Nations gave some attention to the proposal before the war but no effective international agreement was reached. The shipowners of a number of countries, including Ireland, have for many years past, however, voluntarily recognised a limit of 50 miles from any coast within which oil would not be discharged.</P>
    <P>Renewed consideration was given to the problem after the war, particularly by Britain, which has suffered heavily from oil pollution.  With the approval of the United Nations, the British Government convened a conference in London in April, 1954, which was attended by representatives of 42 countries, including Ireland, and which represented between them about 95 per cent. of the world's shipping.  The conference approved of a convention entitled The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, together with eight resolutions. The convention has already been presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas and has been published by the Stationery Office.</P>
    <P>One of the resolutions adapted by the conference recognised that the only entirely effective method known of preventing oil pollution is complete <Col N="23" /> avoidance of the discharge of persistent oils into the sea.  The conference was unable to reach agreement on such a total prohibition, but recommended that a further conference be held to review the matter within three years and resolved that in the meantime Governments and other bodies concerned should endeavour to create the conditions in which such a complete prohibition of discharge could be brought about.  The measures which were agreed by the conference, and embodied in the convention, do represent, however, a substantial advance towards eradicating oil pollution.</P>
    <P>The discharge of persistent oils into the sea by tankers and dry cargo vessels of over 500 tons within certain prescribed zones will be prohibited under the convention.  These zones extend generally for 50 miles from any country but certain larger zones are also prescribed.  These larger zones include the areas from which persistent oils discharged from vessels are most likely to reach the shore; the Atlantic zone with which we are principally concerned extends about 700 miles westward from this country for tankers and 100 miles westward for dry cargo vessels.  The convention also provides for the fitting of equipment to ships for preventing the discharge of oil into the sea and for the provision in main ports of adequate reception facilities for oily residue from vessels other than tankers. Reception facilities for oily residues from tankers would normally fall to be provided at the loading ports.  The convention lays down forms of records relating to oil operations which must be kept on board all ships covered by the convention and will be open to inspection by the competent authorities of contracting parties.</P>
    <P>The convention was signed by 20 countries, including Ireland, subject to acceptance.  The convention will not come into operation internationally until 12 months after 10 countries have accepted it, of whom five must be countries with not less than 500,000 tons gross of tanker tonnage.  The enactment of this Bill will enable the Government to accept the convention on behalf of Ireland.  I understand <Col N="24" /> that Britain has enacted legislation to enable effect to be given to the convention and that Canada, West Germany, Norway, Sweden, France, Denmark and the Netherlands are also taking action to implement the convention.  I might mention that Britain, France, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands have each more than 500,000 tons gross of tanker tonnage.</P>
    <P>The shipping industry in this country has always given the fullest co-operation in any steps necessary to combat oil pollution.  They have for a number of years voluntarily observed a 50-mile limit from any coast within which oil is not discharged from their ships. Subsequent to the drawing up of the London Convention in 1954, Irish ship-owners agreed to give immediate effect on a voluntary basis to its provisions providing for the prohibition of oily discharge in prohibited zones and to the keeping of records of oil operations on board ship.  All Irish deep sea vessels are already fitted with oily water separators and all but a few of our home trade vessels are fitted either with separators or with oil fuel bilges which enable them to avoid or reduce oil discharges into the sea.</P>
    <P>The convention places an obligation on each convention country to secure that adequate reception facilities will be provided at main ports.  It is, however, left to each contracting country to determine which are its main ports for this purpose.  The conference at which the convention was drawn up felt that only ports dealing with a very substantial shipping tonnage need be regarded as main ports.  It seems probable that Dublin is the only port with which we are likely to be concerned at least for some time to come. Certain reception facilities are already provided by the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  There have been discussions between the Department and the board and no difficulty is foreseen in meeting the requirements of the convention.</P>
    <P>I should point out that the port authorities are being empowered in the Bill to make reasonable charges for providing reception facilities and the service should, therefore, be largely, if not wholly, self-supporting.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="25" /> It will be seen, therefore, that while Ireland suffers comparatively severely from oil pollution, we are ourselves not responsible for causing pollution. Furthermore, compliance with the provisions of the convention will involve no great difficulty for our ship-owners. It is, therefore, clearly in our interests that this convention and any subsequent convention which may approach even nearer to the ideal of prohibiting all discharges of oil into the sea should be brought into effect at an early date with the widest possible degree of international co-operation.</P>
    <P>The convention is limited to vessels over 500 gross tons.  A resolution adopted by the London Conference, however, urged Governments to apply the provisions of the convention so far as may be reasonable and practicable, to all classes of sea-going ships registered in their territories including vessels under 500 tons.  For this reason it is considered desirable that the Bill should be applicable to vessels under 500 tons also.  Provision is made in the Bill, however, for the exemption of any vessel or class of vessels from any of its provisions.  The classes of vessels which may be exempted either permanently or for the time being from any of the provisions of the Bill will be determined in consultation with the interests concerned and it may be taken that no owner, particularly of small vessels, will be asked to comply with any unreasonable requirement.</P>
    <P>The convention may not come into operation internationally for some years, but it is proposed to bring a number of the provisions in the Bill into operation as soon as may be practicable. Thus the initial zones which are provided for in the Schedule to the Bill and which are those protecting the Irish coast will be brought into operation as soon as possible.  Irish ship-owners may not, however, be asked to observe the additional zones provided for in the Schedule to this Bill until the convention comes into operation internationally or at least until the other countries affected by such zones have accepted the convention.  It would not be reasonable to interfere with the freedom of action of Irish vessels in the sole interest of other parties unless they were prepared to reciprocate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="26" /> Those provisions of the Bill prohibiting the discharge of oil in prohibited zones, requiring the fitting of certain equipment and prescribing the keeping of records will apply in the ordinary course only to Irish vessels.  It will be for other countries accepting the convention to apply similiar provisions to their vessels.  The Bill does provide, however, that the Government may apply the provisions for the keeping of records and the fitting of equipment to non-Irish vessels also while they are within Irish territorial waters.  These powers might be used in agreement with the other parties to the convention after it came into operation generally so as to impose compliance with its provisions within their territorial waters on the vessels of States which had not accepted the convention. The provisions of the Bill regarding the prevention of pollution within our territorial waters apply, of course, to all vessels of whatever nationality.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that there are fairly wide powers in the Bill in regard to the making of rules and regulations. The Bill is, primarily, an enabling Bill. This is unavoidable because the requirements are mainly of a technical nature, which may require amendment from time to time in the light of experience, and it would be impracticable to deal with them in detail in the Bill. Furthermore, it is the intention to introduce the provisions of the Bill into operation gradually and the House would not, I am sure, wish to deal with the problem in a piecemeal fashion. Every Order, rule or regulation will, however, be laid before each House and a resolution may be passed annulling it.  Shipping interests may rest assured that before any rules are made, whether they relate to requirements which go beyond the convention or not, there will be fullest consultation with them.</P>
    <P>Enactment of this Bill will enable the Government to accept the 1954 convention and, therefore, help to bring it into operation at an early date.  The Bill will place no undue burden on shipowners, harbour authorities, or the Exchequer and I have every confidence that the measure will meet with the general approval of the House.</P>

      <P>Níl mórán le rá agam ar an mBille seo ach fáilte do chur roimis, agus tá súil agam go gcólíonfar na rudaí atá ráite ag an Rúnaí Pairliminte chun ola thrualliú na fairrge do chosaint.  Rud 'seadh é atá ag déanamh díoghbhála, agus an-chuid díoghbhála, le roinnt blianta anuas.</P>
      <P>I have not very much to say on this Bill, except to welcome it.  I sincerely hope that the objects that are set out in this convention will be achieved, because everybody knows that any amount of damage has been done, and is being done, around our coast by the practice of pollution of the seas.  It has been causing danger to our bathing facilities, to the fishing industry, and so on.</P>
      <P>There are just one or two questions that I should like to ask in connection with the Bill.  I wonder if those nations who signed the convention gave consideration to the question of what could be done with the oil that is being thrown into the sea&mdash;whether it could not be conserved and utilised for any industrial purpose.  I do not know whether or not the Parliamentary Secretary would be in a position to answer that question offhand.</P>
      <P>Another question I should like to ask is: Could one find out what method will be adopted to ensure that the obligations of the nations who have contributed to this convention will be carried out?  What kind of policing will be carried out on the high seas to ensure that the objects set forth will be fulfilled?</P>
      <P>Lastly, I do not remember at the moment how many nations signed this convention.  Could the Parliamentary Secretary tell us how many nations have subscribed to this policy of the prevention of pollution of the sea around the coasts of the various countries and have subscribed to the convention?</P>

      <P>The statement of the Parliamentary Secretary commends itself to everyone of us, for many reasons.  This is an international matter affecting Ireland as well as any other country in the world.  It is a matter of very serious gravity to this country and one in which we are particularly <Col N="28" /> interested at the moment. Coming, as I do, from one of the premier seaside resorts in the south, I should like to express approval of this matter and the sooner it becomes international law&mdash;as it is an international matter&mdash;the better.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has covered the ground, or perhaps I should say that he has covered the sea, very well.  He put before us the very great necessity for implementing the findings of this convention.  As times change, the methods of driving steamers and liners change, too. Twenty-five or 30 years ago, oceangoing liners were driven by coal.  Colliers going to various places like Cork, Youghal, Dublin and elsewhere, were also driven by coal&mdash;steam.  Within the past ten or 15 years, a switchover to oil has taken place and the dumping of that oil in the sea has caused very serious trouble and worry to many people whose livelihood depends on their earnings at various seaside resorts throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Something must have been done to combat this matter last summer, but two years ago the whole of the southern coast of Ireland from West Kerry to Wexford was one mass of congealed adhesive tar.  I have had an unhappy experience myself in that regard.  If, on your half-day on a Wednesday afternoon, you went from my town to Ardmore or Ballycotton for a swim, and a sunbathe afterwards, you found chunks of tar clinging to your clothes.  It is a very serious matter. Many people have wondered how it could be solved.</P>
      <P>On numerous occasions, I have had the distressing experience of seeing the wings of sea birds stuck together, so that they were unable to move.  To those of us who are lovers of nature, that is a horrifying spectacle.  I have seen seagulls and various other birds at the coast and they could do absolutely nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This international action is not confined to the shores of Ireland and I am glad of that.  What I want to find out from the Parliamentary Secretary is whether or not it is possible at this early stage to state the remedy for <Col N="29" /> getting rid of this oil dumped from ocean-going liners and various other vessels that traverse our seas.  I live along one of the main Atlantic routes. Liners from Liverpool pass Youghal on their way to stop at Cobh, before continuing to America.  The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that it is punishable to dump this material overboard within 50 miles of any coast.  I do not think that 50 miles is enough. We all know that a strong south-westerly gale travels at least 50 or 60 miles per hour.  If this material is dumped 50 miles off the south coast of Ireland and a south-westerly gale springs up, then, within an hour or two hours at the utmost, that congealed oil will be tossed up on your shore.</P>
    <P>In my view, dumping this material in the sea will never get rid of it.  If you dump it 1,000 miles out in midAtlantic, it is bound to find its way to some shore, whether it be that of Ireland, England, Scotland, France, the Spanish coast or the coast of Morocco.  It is bound to get there some time.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill on which we need not delay.  It is a very important Bill and the sooner this international convention starts working and finds some remedy, the better.  I wonder if it would be possible to burn that substance and have it blown overboard.  I cannot see what can be done otherwise. People in the South and West of Ireland who make their living along our coast welcome this Bill.  At the risk of repeating myself, may I say that two years ago, in my home town of Youghal, the whole beach could be seen to be marked with this substance after every tide.  When it comes to spring tide and then when the water is going down to ebb again, you can see a crust of oil marking the whole shore for miles.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the sooner this Bill becomes effective, the better for us all. I heartily welcome the Bill.  Oil pollution has done a lot of damage.  It also hinders considerably a very important industry, the fishing industry along the south coast of Ireland.  I know, of course, that the same thing applies to the west, north and east.  The sooner <Col N="30" /> the measure becomes effective and rids not only Ireland but the world of this horrible nuisance, the better.  We will have done a good day's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like to support this Bill.  I merely want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if there is any scientific research going on, either in this country or internationally, on the question of the treatment of this oil waste on board vessels &mdash;something such as the application of chemicals or some very strong detergent that would dissolve the waste, or leave it in such a condition that it would be discharged in a harmless manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is, of course, an excellent example of international co-operation which began a great number of years ago in the League of Nations and which, as the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, has come to a very happy conclusion by the agreement of a great many States to certain steps which cannot be taken nationally but must be taken internationally to accomplish any improvement in the situation such as Senator O'Gorman described.</P>
      <P>My particular interest in the matter, apart from general interest, is in connection with bird life.  The oil discharged has done a considerable amount of harm to wild birds on the Irish coast.  People interested in the protection of birds are naturally very pleased with this Bill and would like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a British Act passed to ratify the convention, just as we are passing this Bill here.  There are a few points of difference which I put to the Parliamentary Secretary from the point of view of information.  Naturally, of course, the British problem is a greater problem than ours, from the point of view of the immense difference between their tonnage in shipping and ours, but the penalty provided in their Act is much greater than the penalty provided in Section 23 of this Bill. That may be accounted for by this difference in tonnage.  Neither is there in this Bill any provision for an annual report.  There is provision in the <Col N="31" /> British Act for an annual report.  It might be interesting, but I presume it would add to the expense to have an annual report of what is happening.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Bill provides for certain types of apparatus to get rid of the oil, but I would like merely some information before the Committee Stage upon these matters.  I should like to say again to the people interested in bird life, which is very important to us and which, owing to our situation, is varied and rich, that as far as we are concerned the danger for birds will be very much lessened when the provisions of this Bill have been operated and the international convention has been generally adopted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a word or two on this Bill.  I think we should welcome it for two reasons &mdash;first, for what is in it and, secondly, because it is another example of a Bill being first introduced in the Seanad. I think, if I am not wrong, it is the first of the kind in this session and I hope there will be others.  I think it encourages the Seanad to make a special effort to deal with a Bill, that we have it before it goes to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>This is very much a Committee Bill and if I may say so, it seems to be a very well drafted Bill.  It deals with a very serious threat to the amenities and the life of the seacoast.  I can add to what Senator O'Gorman said, my own personal testimony from my experience in County Waterford.  In some years, the deposit of oil has been very serious indeed, even though it has not been as bad as in some other countries.</P>
      <P>There are one or two questions I should like to ask on the Bill&mdash;questions of a general nature.  Section 4 states that the Bill does not apply to a vessel of the Irish naval service.  Might I ask just what is the reason for that? I am sure there is a good reason, but I think we ought to know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other question is on Section 21. Here it is very rightly said that an inspector may not unnecessarily delay or detain a ship from proceeding on her voyage, but who is to judge whether the ship is unnecessarily delayed or <Col N="32" /> detained?  I should like to know if there is provision for any appeal on the part of a shipowner for compensation if he feels he has been unjustifiably detained, and if there is likely to be any redress?  A ship could suffer a great deal through unreasonable detention of this kind.  I should like to know if anything could be done to meet that point, if it is a valid point.</P>
    <P>Another general question I should like to ask is this: Have we at the moment any legislation against the discharge of ship's waste other than oil and such substances as are mentioned in this Bill?  I ask this question because of a personal experience I had a month ago.  A large ship on which I was travelling stopped at the harbour of a small Greek Island. There was beautiful clear water when we went in; but two hours later I was appalled at the state of that little harbour.  The water covered with refuse of every kind.  It seems appalling that a ship should be able to do that.  I hasten to add that it was not an Irish ship, and it was not in Irish waters.  But I should hate that kind of thing to happen in our Irish harbours. I should like to ask if there is legislation to prevent it, and, if there is not legislation to prevent it, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary seriously to consider drafting legislation of that kind.  I do not think any amendment could be introduced on this Bill, but I do think that something is needed to stop it, if there is a risk of it in this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat the question raised by Senator O'Gorman in regard to what happens to the oil when it is discharged 200 miles from the coast of Ireland.  I want scientific information on it.  Will it dissipate itself so as to be harmless, or will it simply float in a large block to the nearest port?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is going to float <i>en masse</i>, this will only mean that the spread of this oil will be slightly more generous than if it were discharged nearer port.  Is any scientific research being undertaken to deal with this problem of oil discharge, to find if <Col N="33" /> there is any chemical means of dissipating it?  I welcome the Bill.  I hope we will do justice to it.  It seems to be a particularly well drafted Bill and it certainly deals with a very undesirable state of affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that all sides in the Seanad have welcomed this Bill and I will just reply to some questions asked by different Senators. Senator Kissane inquired if there is any use being made of this oil waste, or any attempt by scientists to make use of this waste oil.  There have been efforts&mdash;efforts made by scientists for some years past, and by British scientists especially, to make use of this waste oil in harbours, but so far they have not achieved any success.  Of course, it would be a great thing if something of that kind could be got, as it would save harbour authorities much expense where they have sometimes to bury this sludge.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes it has to be buried, where it is unloaded in harbours, but it would be a great advantage, if some use could be made of it, if it could be treated so as to be brought back into use again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a scientific problem which I am not able to deal with, but I am sure it will be dealt with by various countries which adhere to this convention, and which will be trying in the coming years to find that solution. As regards enforcement, the prescribed records will show if discharges have been made within the prohibited limits, and inspection will take place to see if oil separators have been fitted to various ships which come into our harbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be inspected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh yes; they will be inspected in the harbours.  Twenty countries have so far accepted the convention, but very few of them have ratified it by enacting the necessary legislation, as we are doing now.  As <Col N="34" /> regards Senator Gorman's question, it is not proposed to dump the oil in the sea.  The Bill proposes that ships should have separators fitted and harbour authorities should provide recep tion facilities for the waste oil.  Senator Miss Davidson mentioned much the same matter and I can say that the scientific treatment of oil waste has been examined by many countries.  I understand that the delegate from Israel, a woman scientist, at the Oil Commission Conference was very keen on it, but so far no solution has been made known.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator Hayes's inquiry on annual reports, it was thought there would be scarcely enough activity here to justify annual reports, but there will be another conference held in London within the next year or two to consider the progress made internationally and the matter may be raised then.  The limits within which oil may not be discharged were settled after prolonged discussion between all the interests at international level. Measurements were taken of the movement of oil in various areas and the distances it would be expected to travel.  I may point out that the zone from Ireland on the westward side is 700 miles for oil tankers, and oil from tankers causes the greatest danger to coasts, so the limit for discharge of oil in their case is 700 miles.  For dry cargo ships, the limit is 100 miles, but they are not the vessels which cause most damage, but, for tankers, the limit is over 700 miles, because, when this oil is discharged, it can be caught in currents and brought to our shores. That is the idea of the limit of 700 miles&mdash;so that it will dissipate itself over the high seas.  There is one question here.</P>
      <P>Senator Stanford asked why naval vessels were not included in the Bill. Under the convention, naval vessels of any country are not included but the Minister for Defence here has agreed that the Irish naval service will comply voluntarily with the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would the Parliamentary Secretary answer this question: suppose a shipowner or captain holds that his ship has been unnecessarily <Col N="35" /> delayed, is there any means of dealing with that and providing for redress?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no particular provision for dealing with that, but I take it any inspector we will have will deal reasonably with shipowners.  He will not delay the ship in port unnecessarily, which of course would be very costly to any shipowner, but at present there is no provision in the convention to cover this matter. Changes can be made, of course, and any amendments which may appear necessary can be brought up in future at international conferences, to provide against unnecessary delays.</P>

If this stuff could be changed into powder through some process or others and exuded on to the sea, it would be better.  It would be terrifically costly to bring it to the ports of the world and dump it there. Whether anything in the way of fertilisers can be got from it, I do not know, but, of course, this business is only in its infancy, in its embryo stage.  The Parliamentary Secretary could possibly bring to the notice of the international conference the benefits of our little experience here.  We want to be rid of this filthy nuisance which harms our seaside resorts, harms our harbours, and harms our birds.</P>

I want to be quite clear. Will the Minister tell us if there is no redress for the captain or the owner of a ship who holds very firmly that he has been unnecessarily delayed.  If there is no such redress, why not? There are unreasonable inspectors in all walks of life occasionally.  And if the answer to this question is what I think it will be, would he consider putting into the Bill on the Government side some provision giving the sea captain and sea owner some means of appealing against unnecessary delay.  I do think it is unjust: a shipowner may lose hundreds of pounds and have no redress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. P. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable county councils to adopt schemes by which credit may be provided for the purchase of seeds and fertilisers by small cultivators.  Schemes of this nature were operated by county councils and were validated by temporary Acts at intermittent periods from as far back at 1880 up to the year 1933 when they were allowed to lapse.  There was no enabling legislation from 1933 until the war period when temporary Acts were passed in 1940 and 1941 validating schemes adopted in the years 1939 to 1941.  The Seeds and Fertilisers Supply Act, 1942, the last comprehensive Act dealing with these schemes, applied to the period from 1st August, 1941, to 31st July, 1942, and short continuing Acts extended the period of its application to 31st July of last year.  The present Bill proposes to place the legislation dealing with the schemes on a permanent basis.  The Bill is framed on the lines of the 1942 Act but contains one important provision not included in the earlier legislation, and that is one which makes the adoption of a scheme a reserved function of a county council for the purposes of the County Management Acts, 1940 to 1955.</P>
      <P>The Bill is an enabling Bill only, permitting county councils to adopt schemes if they wish to do so.  The Bill allows of two types of scheme.  The type of scheme usually operated is where the county council pays a merchant the cost of the goods supplied to an applicant and recovers the cost from the applicant.  Alternatively, the council may adopt a scheme by which they guarantee the due payment to a merchant of the cost of seeds and fertilisers supplied on credit by him to an approved applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision is made, subject to certain conditions, for recoupment by the State of half the losses incurred by county councils on the schemes.  County councils' losses under previous schemes <Col N="38" /> have been insignificant and the State has not been called upon to make any recoupment.</P>
    <P>Last year, 19 out of the 27 county councils adopted schemes.  The total number of loans was 1,828 and the total cost £35,619, the average loan thus being about £19 10s.</P>
    <P>There is really nothing new in this Bill.  The Seanad has on many occasions in the past approved of Bills applying for short periods the provisions embodied in the present Bill.  I am confident, therefore, that the Bill will be accepted by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As this Bill confers some benefit on a relatively small section of the agricultural community, nobody will object to it.  When the Seeds and Fertilisers Supply Act was introduced during the emergency, it was regarded as beneficial, in view of the urgent need for intensive food production. The period of application of that Act has been continued since, as the Minister pointed out, in short continuing Acts.  While the measure is beneficial to a small section, it is a very insignificant measure as far as agricultural credit is concerned and its scope is extremely limited.</P>
      <P>While there is no doubt that the Minister should continue this measure, it is desirable that something more far-reaching should be considered.  The fact that so small a number of people, taking the country as a whole, have availed of it shows that it has not been as effective as was anticipated.  There is no limit to the valuation of the holding for the purpose of this scheme, but in practice it has been availed of by only the smaller farmers and for small amounts, which is obvious from the amount of the average loan&mdash;£19. Nineteen pounds at the present time will purchase only a very small quantity of seeds or manures.  That is why I say the scheme is rather insignificant and that something much better could be devised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I doubt if there is any body in the State less qualified to cope with the question of agricultural credit than a county council.  A county council, through its staff, has very little to do with agriculture.  The functions of local <Col N="39" /> authorities in regard to agriculture are, in the main, delegated to a county committee of agriculture.  One would imagine that, if it was intended to make this measure to any degree effective, the operation of the scheme would be transferred to the county committee of agriculture.</P>
    <P>County committees of agriculture have staffs of instructors who move amongst the farming community and whose duty it is to make themselves acquainted with every farmer in their areas.  In recent years the number of instructors has been increased sufficiently, in a number of counties at any rate, to ensure that there is one instructor for less than 1,000 farmers. In this way the instructor is put in a position to know the farmers and their circumstances.  One would imagine, therefore, that a credit scheme for any agricultural purpose should be operated by the county committee of agriculture, assisted by the district instructors.</P>
    <P>One can easily see the additional benefit that could be derived from such a scheme.  The instructor could advise the farmer to sow a better type of seed and could tell the farmer, if he was not in a financial position to purchase the better seed, that there is a scheme which will help him.  The instructor could advise the farmer to use more fertiliser and indicate to him that there is a scheme in operation and could assist him in taking advantage of that scheme.  In that way, the position of the instructors in advising the farmers would be greatly strengthened.</P>
    <P>I believe that, if this function of providing credit for the farmers is continued in the hands of the county council, it will be operated by a body of officials who have very little active contact with the farmers.  We all know that the office staffs of the county councils have increased enormously in recent years and county council offices in fact have become similar in many respects to the State Departments in the city.  The farmer seeking credit and calling into one of these large and extensive offices would find himself almost bewildered and equally bewildered <Col N="40" /> would be the officials who might be called upon to advise him.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, as indeed in previous legislation, the power to provide credit for agriculture is put into the hands of officials whose functions are to a very considerable extent far removed from agriculture.  I do not think that is desirable.  The Minister, I think, mentioned that the operation of this Bill by the county councils will be a reserved function; that is to say, it will be the function of the elected representatives who will decide whether a scheme is to be introduced or not under the Bill, but the administration, as in all other matters, will rest in the hands of the county manager and his staff.  That is why I say that this is not by any means the best type of scheme for the provision of credit for agriculture.  I should like, therefore, the Minister to consider the alternative of having this power transferred to the county committees of agriculture, thus strengthening these committees in the important work they are doing to improve agricultural production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are, but their administration is absolutely separate. They have separate offices and staffs, and under this Act the credit will be provided, and the scheme will be operated by the staffs of the county councils, and not by the staffs of the county committees of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that one of the disadvantages in this form of credit is that many farmers feel rather reluctant about having their business, especially their financial business, put before the local representatives.  I think, however, that that does not operate to any great extent, because it is the staffs of the county councils who actually deal with each individual application and it is only in cases of default that the cases might receive very much publicity.  One of the reasons, I think, that this scheme might not be availed of to a great extent is that applicants would feel that their cases would come before the county council and be discussed in public.  That is something which farmers might not wish to see <Col N="41" /> happening.  It is an extraordinary thing in regard to credit generally that, while business people boast about the amount of money they can borrow and the size of their overdraft, farmers and smallholders generally feel that that is something that they would like to keep absolutely secret.</P>
    <P>That is perhaps the main reason why I am asking to have the powers contained in this Bill transferred to the officials of the county committees of agriculture.  These officials go around to farmers and discuss their problems confidentially with the individual farmers and they could easily discuss with them the provision of credit facilities.  I am making that suggestion now in view of the fact that we are introducing permanent legislation. While I appreciate that any legislation can be amended, I think we should take advantage on this matter of the suggestion I have made.  The staffs of the county councils are not the best qualified people to deal with agricultural questions.</P>
    <P>There is another point that arises in regard to this Bill.  I understand that the existing legislation terminated last year and I am wondering how the county councils are operating during the present year under the provisions of this Bill.  As far as we are concerned in my county council, we have received very few applications for loans under this scheme, and therefore the matter has not been brought before us.  I am just wondering, therefore, whether the scheme is being operated this year or not.  It would certainly be rather late to begin operating it at this time of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to understand the point made by Senator Cogan.  As members of the county councils, we have to provide these moneys.  We cannot give to the county committees of agriculture the power that would entitle them to give unlimited credit to the people.  The county council has a responsibility to the ratepayers.  It is the sort of responsibility that it would be impossible for us to delegate to another body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the best service that could <Col N="42" /> be done to this piece of legislation would be to get the national and local papers to give it full publicity.  We hear year in and year out lectures and talks on the desirability of providing credit facilities for the farmers.  This Bill makes that credit available to all farmers, large and small.  They can get their fertilisers, seeds or anything else they want for their crops, and, when they have been paid for the crops, they can pay the county councils.  I am, therefore, at a loss to know why this scheme has not been adopted in a much more widespread way.  One would think, listening to Senator Cogan, that, when a farmer applies for credit under this legislation the matter is brought before the local county councillors, but such is not the case.  The whole matter is treated in the same confidence as would be a transaction between a client and a manager of a bank, or the manager of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Minister on bringing in this piece of permanent legislation.  I am wondering if Senator Cogan is objecting to it because it was allowed to lapse in 1933.  I am surprised to hear a man who is so interested in agriculture criticise this piece of legislation, which he must know is really beneficial.  We had hoped that Senators such as Senator Cogan would tell the farmers of the benefits of this seeds and fertilisers supply scheme.  There is no necessity to gild the lily.  This is an excellent scheme.  The public press would do a good national service by making this scheme known in every farmstead in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that Senators complain that advantage has not been taken of this Act in the past. I think one of the reasons is that the seed merchants in this country know their customers.  If a farmer wants credit, he generally gets it from his seed merchant.  He does not bother going to the local county council or to the bank to procure the money.  It is a common practice in rural Ireland for seed merchants to advance the seeds and to be paid when the harvest is reaped later in the year.</P>
      <P>I am making one change in this Bill, which I think will be for the benefit of all concerned.  Under previous Acts, the formulation of a scheme was an executive function of the county manager.  It is true that possibly a number of local councillors were not aware of the powers conferred on the county manager under previous Acts. Under this Bill, I am making it a reserved function and it will be a matter for county councillors to formulate the scheme themselves.  If a number of representatives come together, meet in the council chamber and formulate this scheme, after a time they will go to their own areas and notify the farmers there of the advantages that may be gained under the scheme.  To make it a reserved function, and not an executive function, should go a long way to popularise the scheme and to make it more widely known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cogan said he thought it would be better to have the scheme administered by the county committees of agriculture.  This is an administrative scheme.  It is really a social service.  County committees of agriculture are merely acting in an educational and an advisory capacity.  They have no administrative functions, as such.  It is much better that those who pay the piper should call the tune.  The <Col N="44" /> county council have to provide the money, and I think they should administer the scheme.  We have been told that the scheme has not been taken advantage of in the past.  That is simply because it was left to each manager to formulate the scheme. Now, when this Bill becomes an Act, it will be possible for local councillors to formulate the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely none. I think Senator Cogan was worried about the fact that the Act in relation to applications for loans terminated last year.  So it did.  If the Senator will look at Section 7 of the Bill, he will see that that section gives authority to validate any action taken during the current year by local authorities.  That will protect them. Loans may go on, as they have gone on in the past.  Senator Cogan also said he never heard of the scheme being operated in Wicklow.  That is not so.  They have such a scheme in Wicklow.</P>

It is a very generous scheme, formulated for the purpose of helping the farmer, particularly the small farmer, and the persons who will draw up the terms of the scheme will be the members of the local council who are generally representative of the farmers of rural <Col N="45" /> Ireland and who know the conditions of their neighbours.</P>

      <P>In the case of a default on the part of a borrower, or in the case of loss to a county council, the Government shall recoup the county council to the extent of 50 per cent.  In connection with that, I should like to ask the Minister, before the Bill becomes law, are any conditions laid down on the county council in respect of the schemes which they may draft for the granting of loans?  It is easy to see that this is an important matter, because, as I see it, one of the reasons why this Act was not availed of to any great extent in the past was that the conditions laid down by the county managers invariably were very rigid.</P>
      <P>It may be that the county council may decide to modify those conditions to a very considerable extent.  They may not ask for sureties, in addition to the guarantee given by the borrowers. I should like to ask if the county councils will have power to draft their schemes as they think fit, or will the Department of Local Government step in to restrict the power of a county council in this matter?  I think it is here that the danger lies.  If, as I say, conditions are too lenient, or if the scheme is too loosely drafted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. P. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators are aware, the present method of distributing the agricultural grant has been in operation since the year 1953.  The Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1953 which applied to the financial years 1953-54, 1954-55 and 1955-56 provided for the making by county councils of the following allowances by way of abatement of rates to occupiers of agricultural holdings in rural areas:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="49" />&ldquo;(a)  a primary allowance of three-fifths of the general rate in the £ on the land valuation up to £20.</P>
    <P>(b)  an employment allowance of £17 for each adult workman at work on the holding during the whole of the preceding calendar year, subject to the limitation that the total of the employment allowance shall not exceed the general rate in the £ on the valuation over £20.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The object of this Bill is to continue this method of distribution of the grant for a further period of three years commencing on the 1st April, 1956.</P>
    <P>While the agricultural grant has now been in operation for almost 60 years it was not until the year 1946-47 that the system was introduced whereby the amount of the grant paid to county councils varies with fluctuations in the rates struck by the councils.  The Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1946, provided that the grant would be the sum needed to give relief on the following basis:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  A primary allowance at the rate of three-fifths of the general rate in the £ on the land valuation up to £20;</P>
    <P>(2)  A supplementary allowance of one-fifth of the general rate in the £ on the land valuation over £20;</P>
    <P>(3)  An employment allowance calculated at the rate of 10/- in the £ on the land valuation over £20, subject to the limitation that the allowance should not exceed £6 10s., for each adult workman at work on the holding during the whole of the preceding calendar year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This method of distribution continued to operate until the passing of the 1953 Act which abolished the supplementary allowance, increased the employment allowance but left the primary allowance unchanged.</P>
    <P>The amount of the agricultural grant increased from £4,938,555 in the year 1953-54 to £5,178,454 in the year 1954-55, and to £5,265,430 in the year 1955-56.  The amount of the grant for the coming year is estimated at <Col N="50" /> £5,600,000.  The total payable in 1955-56 was divided as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The employment allowance may be claimed only in respect of a man at work during the whole of the calendar year preceding the relevant financial year.  The 1953 Act, which applied to the financial years 1953-54, 1954-55 and 1955-56 did not become law until 23rd December, 1953.  Hence the Act could not have affected the number of employees until, at the earliest, the calendar year 1954, and claims in respect of those employees did not arise until 1955-56.  The numbers in respect of whom employment allowances were claimed in the period covered by the 1953 Act were:&mdash;</P>

    <P>It cannot be claimed that the allowances under the 1953 Act have had the effect of increasing continuous whole-time employment in 1954 but it is too soon yet to form any definite conclusions as to the long-term effect of the Act on agricultural employment.</P>
    <P>However, before the period to which the present Bill applies has expired it should be possible to decide from the figures then available, whether the present system has justified itself.  I think that this system should get a fair trial and, therefore, in this Bill it is proposed to continue for the current financial year and the two following years the method of distribution provided for in the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1953.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be glad if the Minister could give an estimate of the number he visualises will be employed in the current year.  He states that the number employed for the previous year was 90,826, but in the figure of £5,600,000 which he has given as an estimate of the total expenditure by the Central Authority, I take it he <Col N="51" /> must have calculated the approximate number who will be employed for the present year, because last year the amount of the employment allowance was £1,369,920.  The number employed in 1953-54 was 92,504, and, in 1954-55, it was 92,969.</P>
      <P>It would be of some assistance to this House if the figure of the estimate for the current year could be given, because it is particularly important for the economy of this country that as many as possible of the people should be employed on our land, if we are to increase production.  We all know that it is essential that production from the land should be increased, if we are to realise our ambitions and if we are to export more agricultural produce in order to rectify the present serious adverse trade balance.</P>
      <P>Reference has already been made to the fact that it is necessary to have employment for the full 12 months of the year before the farmer can qualify, and I would even at this stage ask the Minister to consider whether it would not be more reasonable to permit the qualification to apply on, say, an 11months basis.  As the Minister is aware, a great deal of the land which is tilled in this country is held on the conacre letting system, which is an 11 months basis.  We can all realise that, when a worker leaves during the course of the year, two or three weeks may elapse before the farmer can make arrangements to obtain another employee.  I understand that in parts of the southern counties, it is a usual practice for the workmen to leave around Christmas and not to return to their employment until well on in the new year.</P>
      <P>At column 1053 of the Official Debates of 22nd March last, Deputy Smith asked:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Therefore as a result of the Act which we are now proposing to have re-enacted, the State is being saved £100,000?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the one year for which we have figures.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State, therefore, has benefited in <Col N="52" /> consequence of the amendment of legislation which was passed when this Act was adopted in 1953.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that there is such a continuous rise in the wages of the agricultural worker&mdash;I understand that there will be an increase of 6/- in the next two or three weeks&mdash;it seems to me that the figure of £17 per employee is not a fair figure to which to tie it down for three years, when real values are depreciating.  It would be much more reasonable if the Minister asked that the Bill should be brought in only for one year.  It would look, on the face of it, that, each year, as wages increase, the State will benefit more and more.</P>
    <P>It seems to me also that the person over 16 should qualify rather than that he should have to be 17 years.  The Minister knows that an employee over 16 must have his insurance cards stamped and if those young people are not encouraged to remain on the land, and instead are encouraged to work on the roads or to emigrate, it is not a good day's work for the country.  In view of the fact that farmers are now finding it very difficult to make ends meet, on account of the increase in the cost of fertilisers and animal feeding stuffs, the increase in the rates, and increases in agricultural wages, and the fact that agricultural prices are not advancing accordingly, and that some commodities are not economic to produce, such as eggs, and that cattle prices have gone down a good deal since last year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister must agree that farm prices have depreciated considerably in the past eight or nine months.  It would be no harm also to remember that the farmer contributes £2,250,000 in the rent element of land annuities, which is a tax collected by the Exchequer, and according to the <i>Statistical Survey</i> of 1954, page 47, national income in 1954 was £448,000,000, and, of this, the agricultural community's share was £135,000,000, and the rest's, £313,000,000.  In that survey, agriculture includes fishing.  If we consider, <Col N="53" /> therefore, that the agricultural community got less than one-third of the national income, and that those engaged in agriculture are approximately half of the male workers in the country, it is obvious that those people in rural Ireland are not getting a fair share of the pool.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer the Minister to the statement which was made last night by General Costello in connection with the rise in agricultural wages.  He said that the increase in the farmers' wage bill which will take effect in the next month should be met by adopting labour saving and other cost-saving methods recommended to the farmers, and the co-operation of the Beet Growers' Association was asked for, in an effort to persuade the farmers to avail themselves of those opportunities of reducing production costs.  Surely that means that in this year the numbers of employees engaged on the land will become less&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I cannot see why it is not.  Wages are going up, and they are advised to adopt labour-saving devices by hiring or purchasing machinery to cut out the labour content.  For those reasons, I suggest that a three-year period is, in those circumstances, too long, and that one year would be much more reasonable, because of the fact, as the Minister has already stated, that it was only for experimental purposes that the Bill was extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to refer to the fact that in the social study conference summer school in Dundalk in August, 1954, Mr. Louis Smith, assistant lecturer in University College, Dublin, stated that industry employed less people than agriculture, both directly and indirectly, and that, furthermore, 1,154 of their 1,400 factories were protected. With the exception of certain established concerns, very few of those industries covered the cost of their total imports by their exports.  Even the dairy industry exported £6,000,000 worth of chocolate crumb on the open market.  For those reasons, as agriculture is therefore obviously the one industry in which there is hope of expanding, <Col N="54" /> everything possible should be done to enable the farmers to retain more men on the land.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill, knowing from experience that the concessions it gives to the farming community are very much appreciated in my own county. Unfortunately, because of the fact that by far the greater number of the holdings in County Mayo are uneconomic, they can only enjoy the primary allowance of three-fifths of the rates, and a very small number of them can come in for the supplementary allowance of one-fifth of the general rate in the £ on land valuations over £20.  My only regret is that the towns cannot come in for some concessions, because never were they more necessary than at the present time.  I welcome the Bill because it is appreciated by the vast majority of the people in the county I come from and helps them in every way to meet their commitments.  As a result, they are able to discharge their responsibilities.</P>

      <P>The decision of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1953 to change the system of allocation of the agricultural grant was very strongly criticised at the time it was introduced. Nevertheless, I think the principle embodied in that reform was sound. Where, as the Minister pointed out, in 1946, the agricultural grant was distributed on a flat rate, that is to say, whatever amount was distributed, each farmer got the same benefit according to his valuation, in 1953, the principle of a primary and a supplementary employment allowance was introduced.  The then Government decided to abandon the supplementary allowance of one-fifth of the rate and to substitute instead an increase in the employment allowance from £6 10s. to £17, in respect of each person employed.  The reason for so doing was to give some recognition and encouragement to the farmer who was endeavouring to employ labour on his farm.  For that reason, the principle was sound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Walsh has referred to the advice which is being given to farmers to dispense with labour, in view of the <Col N="55" /> higher wages.  That advice is being generally given, and I was rather surprised to note that it is being given sometimes by agricultural advisers evidently working on economics.  They say: &ldquo;Well, if wages are high and if it is difficult to meet the rising wages, the only way to achieve it is by increased mechanisation and by reducing the number of workers.&rdquo; Farmers do feel that there is a certain amount of truth in that, and they do tend to take that line of action; but it is the duty of the State, in the national interest, to encourage every owner of land as far as possible to give the maximum amount of labour as a social duty, because, as we know, social considerations are at least as important as, and in my opinion more important than, economic considerations.  The farmer who has to live out of a piece of land must be concerned mainly with economic considerations, if he is to remain in business.  The original Act, which this Bill seeks to prolong, recognised that principle and gave increased benefit to the person who was employing labour.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there has not been, since the original Act was introduced, any substantial increase in the volume of labour on the land and questioned, therefore, whether the Act has justified itself or not.  I think the Act could not be judged entirely by that standard.  The forces operating to reduce the number of workers on the land are strong economic forces and it would be difficult to expect that an allowance of £17 would induce a farmer to keep an additional employee, whose wage bill would probably be in the region of £250 a year, if it was not otherwise economic for him to keep him.</P>
    <P>What the original Act sought to do was to give some recognition in the matter of relief of rates to the man who employed labour, to give him some little benefit&mdash;it was undoubtedly small &mdash;over and above the person who gave the minimum amount of labour.</P>
    <P>The supplementary allowance which was provided in the 1946 Act applied to all valuations over £20, irrespective of whether there was employment given <Col N="56" /> on the land or not.  The farmer whose valuation was over £20 got an abatement of one-fifth of his rates on every £1 of his valuation over £20, irrespective of whether he gave employment or not.  That concession was withdrawn under the 1953 Act and, on the whole, that legislation was a reform in the matter of the distribution of the agricultural grant.</P>
    <P>It will be recognised that the 1953 Act had only a short duration&mdash;I think three years.  That was deliberately done to ensure that the new system would be given a trial and, if certain anomalies or injustices were found in the system, it could be revised.  That has been made clear.  The Act of 1953 provided that the benefits which farmers as a body would get under that Act would be equal to what they would have got under the previous legislation. That position operated for the whole period.  In the last year, it has become clear that, with the rapid rise in rates, the farming community are not getting now as much benefits as they would have got under the 1946 Act.  Therefore, at the end of the three-year period, the provisions should be revised and should be made more generous.</P>
    <P>Certain suggestions have been submitted to the Minister&mdash;in my opinion, constructive suggestions&mdash;as to how the Act might be amended in a small way for the benefit of the farmers. First of all, there is the position that relief in respect of the employment of a worker will not be operative unless the worker is in constant employment for a full year.  Every Senator will recognise that it is, again, socially desirable that employment should be continuous and that, therefore, the worker should be in constant employment for the full year, if possible; but everyone knows that, in practice, it is very difficult to ensure that that will be the case.</P>
    <P>A farmer may have a worker in constant employment, but the worker may decide to leave, or he may become ill, or may die.  In that case, it may not be possible for the employer to replace him immediately.  Some little time must elapse before another permanent employee can be secured, and, <Col N="57" /> as a result, the farmer would lose the benefit of the allowance under the Act. That is just one example of how the Act has operated unfairly to the employer. It would not be unreasonable to ask the Minister to introduce an amendment, providing that any farmer who gives constant employment to a worker for a period of at least 11 months would be qualified to receive the employment allowance.</P>
    <P>There is another matter also in this connection, that is, that a worker must be over 17 years of age in order that his employer may qualify for this allowance.  That is unfair, because, in the majority of cases, workers take up employment on the land at 16 years of age or earlier.  It is, again, socially desirable that a boy living in the country and intending to work on the land should enter constant employment at the age of 16, if he is to become a trained agricultural worker.</P>
    <P>It is provided in the Health Act that a worker must be insured at 16 years of age.  The age of 16 is recognised as a desirable age for entry to employment. I do not see any reason why the allowance should not be given at 16 years of age, or why a worker over the age of 16, who is in constant employment, is not recognised as an employee under the Act.</P>
    <P>If those two concessions were made to employers, it would bring the measure into line with what was intended, that is, that the employer who is making a decent effort to give reasonable employment should get reasonable benefit under the agricultural grant.  It will be remembered that in the report of the Commission on Emigration, Most Rev. Dr. Lucey, Bishop of Cork, referred to this matter and suggested that an effort should be made by the adjustment of taxation&mdash; and he made particular reference to rates&mdash;to ensure that the maximum amount of employment will be given on the land.</P>
    <P>That is what is sought, and the Minister would be doing a good service if he were to amend the Act under the two headings I have mentioned.  There is a common view, and I think it was mentioned briefly by Senator Ruane here to-day, that people under £20 valuation do not get any benefit.  That <Col N="58" /> is not true, of course.  This Bill applies to any person under £20 valuation and to the first £20 of all valuations, which means three-fifths of the rates, and it is a substantial benefit.  Therefore, Senator Ruane was not quite correct when he suggested that people under £20 valuation would not benefit by the Act.  They do undoubtedly benefit and I think it is only right that they should.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, before this Bill passes through the Seanad, will see his way to revise the measure by the introduction of suitable amendments.  I am rather inclined to think that Senators could not introduce such amendments to this Bill because, I suppose, they would be adding to the cost of the measure.  I am not sure on that point.  I think that the Minister should consider it.  A reasonable case has been made for the two concessions which have been suggested.  A case has certainly been made for the one suggested by Senator Walsh that the period of employment for 11 months should be reckoned as employment for 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to speak generally on the Bill, of which I approve.  I have just one or two observations to make in relation to the general body of taxation in the country.  The rates which the farmers pay are their contribution to the direct taxation system which has grown up in a very anomalous manner.  The whole taxation system is one for the whole community and not for any special section of the population.  I am not saying whether the farmers have to pay too much or too little.  I do suggest, however, that this whole system of relief of rates on agricultural land has grown up in a very haphazard manner, and I hope that, when the income-tax code is being inquired into by the commission promised by the Minister for Finance, this whole matter of the rates on agricultural land will also be subject of examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we all know, the rates are the main taxes paid by the farmers in this country, and for the relief of rates considerable grants are made and these are raised by taxation from every section of the community, and partly from the farmers in another form. Therefore, I suggest that the time has <Col N="59" /> come when this whole system needs to be reviewed and needs to be brought into the general framework of the taxation code in this country, both urban and rural.</P>
    <P>The system of relief of rates on agricultural land has grown up in a haphazard and illogical manner.  It started with the Local Government Act, 1899, when the first agricultural grant was given in order to relieve landlords of their share of local rates.  When the lands passed from the landlords to the tenants, that relief accrued to the tenants who then became the owners.  At the time of the Treaty the agricultural grant for the Twenty Six counties now forming the Republic was £599,000.  At that time, income-tax was reduced to 3/- in the £, and as farmers did not pay much income-tax, their representatives in the Dáil suggested that they should get some equivalent relief, and it was in order to give them that equivalent relief for the reduction in income-tax which they did not pay, that the agricultural grant was doubled.</P>
    <P>I have not noticed in recent times that, when income-tax went up, any similar motion or representations were made in the Dáil or Seanad, that, because income-tax had gone up, the amount of the agricultural grant should be reduced.  The progressive system whereby the small farmer got more benefit than the large farmer was introduced later.  It is obviously right in a system of direct taxation which should be progressive.</P>
    <P>The system by which the relief is based on a principle which, I think, should clearly be investigated in the light of the facts of the situation. Obviously, the case is made that the farmer who gives employment is saving somebdy from emigrating, or helping to keep him on the land, and that is the case made in connection with this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, however, and Major General Costello, have stated that, to get the maximum production, <Col N="60" /> there should be more mechanisation in order that we can get as much as possible from the land with the minimum of labour.  It is in that way that we can get increased production, or a surplus of production which is needed for export.  It does seem contradictory that we have the Minister for Local Government advocating a system of derating, based on employment content on the land, and, at the same time, the Minister for Agriculture and others telling the farmers that they should produce more, so that we can have a surplus for export, while using less labour.  It does seem to me that these are two opposing views, and there are certain inconsistencies between them.</P>
    <P>The Government should make up its mind whether they want more or less people employed on the land.  You cannot have both at the one time. Therefore, I suggest that this principle of giving relief for additional labour employed is inconsistent with the declared Government policy of getting increased production, or productivity; that is to say, an increase in output, with a smaller number of workers employed. That seems a rational policy for agriculture to produce as much as possible with the minimum labour content.  That may possibly produce a certain amount of unemployment, but eventually it would lead to a greater agricultural output, with an export potential which in the long run will help to increase employment in the country.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I urge the Minister to apply his mind to the principles involved and to see, in so far as it is consistent with Government agricultural policy, that this matter of rates relief is considered in connection with the whole income-tax code, which I am glad to see is going to be examined by the commission which the Minister for Finance has promised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanHartney" hpid="Mr. Hartney Mr. Hartney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to state that the principles on which this Bill is founded are definitely sound.  The aim is to <Col N="61" /> encourage employment and more employment on the land, with the result of more and more production.  It is only natural to expect that, if that is to be successful, we must concentrate on the main industry, agriculture.  If this Bill is to be a reality and is to bring to the people the assistance it is intended to give, there are a few points that I want to stress in a special way.</P>
      <P>Take for instance, the issue of the whole year.  It must be borne in mind that the conditions of employment in agriculture are not uniform all over the country.  I speak now for Munster which has to be regarded as the dairying area.  The position that obtains down there is that what you might term &ldquo;the working year&rdquo; is approximately from 1st February to the following Christmas Eve.  Those men are hired.  They usually stay in the house.  They work with their employer. Instead of putting down &ldquo;the whole year&rdquo;, I suggest &ldquo;the working year&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is not the first occasion on which a departure of this kind has been found possible.  Over 40 years ago, when national health legislation came into existence, any employee with 48 stamps on his card was given credit as having worked a full year.  Later on, in our own time, in the Superannuation Act of 1947 or 1948, a certain number of days&mdash;I think 200 days&mdash;is prescribed as qualifying a person to be treated by the local authority as an employee entitled to be put on the list for superannuation purposes.  The main point is that a certain number of days is specified and that there is no such thing as the whole year in it.  If the whole year is insisted on, the people engaged in dairying will be deprived of the benefits which they are entitled to have conferred on them under this Bill when it becomes an Act.  If the Minister makes an inquiry as far as Munster is concerned, he will find that what I am saying is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The man who works on a weekly basis may work the 52 weeks of the year, live in his own house, go out to work every morning and return home every evening, but the majority of the <Col N="62" /> employees in Munster are known as &ldquo;servant boys&rdquo; whose year is approximately from 1st February to the following Christmas Eve.  Those people never have the month of January from the point of view of work.  With later legislation, it is much more attractive to take off the month of January, because, after going home on Christmas Eve, all those boys are entitled to claim and draw benefits on the stamps they accumulated in the previous year.  That makes it all the easier for them to have the month of January at home.</P>
    <P>That must be borne in mind while the man is drawing any benefits of that kind.  It is illegal for him to put up stamps as it is illegal for anybody else to put them up for him.  I would appeal to the Minister to look at the matter from a realistic point of view. It is only a matter of five or six weeks and there is nothing very big involved. It is a far fairer approach to give the benefit of the doubt.  Accordingly, I ask the Minister to look at the matter in its true perspective.</P>
    <P>There is a very big principle involved in regard to the ages prescribed. Quite a number of young fellows are definitely available for work at 16 years of age, and, if there is a choice, one will naturally select a person of 17 years, if this means a reduction in one's rates.  That is ordinary common sense.  Young fellows are entitled to leave the national school at 14 years of age.  They can go to the technical school after that for two years, so that, when they reach 16 years of age, they have a very good education.  They have a full primary education with two years in a vocational school.  That being the case, they will command a market, because they are trained.  They are of more value to the man working on the land because they are very well catered for by way of instruction in agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is another point worth considering in this connection.  If a young fellow goes on the land at 16 years of age, he may stay there, but, if he is left floating about at the age of 16, he has a greater temptation to emigrate, or at least go into the towns.  As I said, there is a big principle involved here and the Minister should introduce <Col N="63" /> an amendment reducing the age from 17 years to 16 years.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which has been so often discussed that it is hardly necessary to drive it home again.  I refer to the necessity of giving every assistance possible to the dairying industry.  The dairying industry is one branch of agriculture that gives the greatest volume of employment.  The tillage man merely requires a certain amount of help at seasonal periods and then he is finished, but it is the whole year round with the dairying farmer.  He works for the full 365 days of the year.  Everybody in the House has heard that often enough to realise it is a fact.  It the Bill goes through the House in its present form, it will deprive that branch of the farming community of the benefits they are intended to reap from it.  The Minister should consider the matter and introduce the necessary amendments to allow the full benefits intended to be given to go to the farmer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one observation on this Bill in relation to the length of time necessary to qualify for the employment allowance.  This is a matter upon which I have spoken every year this Bill came up.  Great hardships can accrue to a farmer who is a permanent employer of labour.  If one of his employees leaves his employment or dies during the year, the farmer loses his grant.  What the Minister ought to do is to ensure that, where a farmer employs a man for a longer period than 12 months, he will become eligible for the grant for the next 12 months period, and if it took a month for the farmer to procure a suitable agricultural labourer, one-twelfth of the allowance should be disallowed in respect of that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmer who continuously employs men and loses them through no fault of his own has a justifiable grievance.  I know people in my part of the country who have had men working for them 30 and 40 years.  If one of these people dies and the farmer takes any length of time to replace him, he loses the allowance.  I ask the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to genuine cases such as this.  I <Col N="64" /> would not be prepared to plead for the man who says: &ldquo;I want to employ a man only for 12 months,&rdquo; but I do plead for it in the case of replacements.</P>

      <P>Before we conclude this debate, I think it would be right to refer to the remarks made by Senator O'Brien.  Senator O'Brien thought fit to suggest that, because the farmers were not in the income-tax category, we were in this Bill making some further provisions on their behalf.  That is not so.  I should like it to go forth from this House, to the country and to the farmers in general, that the terms of this Bill are based on the rates then prevailing.  If there is an increase in the agricultural grant this year, next year, or the year after, it will be due to the fact that the rate has been increased.</P>
      <P>That is something to which the members of this House should direct their particular attention.  I do not propose to hold up discussion on this Bill in order to enumerate all the legislation that passed through this House, but if I were inclined to do so, I am sure the Minister would agree with me that 99 per cent. of it has passed on to the local authorities the obligation of increasing their demands in relation to the rates, as is the case in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two questions which it is natural that we should ask in connection with this Bill.  What is the purpose of the Bill?  Why was it first introduced and has it of itself achieved the objectives which the originators of the Bill thought it would achieve.  The Minister in presenting this measure here to-night has been very vague.  He has introduced it to us in such a manner that if we took his introductory remarks very seriously, we should reject its provisions.  He has given us figures over a number of years of the number of people employed in agricultural production.  He has given to us the number of people who are beneficiaries under this Bill and he has suggested, in all seriousness, that it should be accepted, regardless of the fact that at one time he and his Party were totally opposed to such a measure and saw fit to object to it, as any Opposition, I will admit, will justify themselves in seeing fit to object to <Col N="65" /> the provisions of such a Bill being passed through Dáil Éireann at a particular time.</P>
    <P>What has changed the circumstances in relation to the agricultural community that should have changed the Minister's mind and convinced him that the Bill he is now presenting to us should be passed, having regard to the statements that he and his Party made just one year ago?  We have probably this change of circumstances. It is probably one which the Minister, if he wanted to ensure that this Bill would get a speedy passage through this House, might put forward, that the agricultural community will have given to them from the Central Fund something between £500 and £650 increased benefits.  That probably is the only case the Minister might make and it is the only basis on which he could make a case.</P>
    <P>When we come to examine that case, we find that, as a result of much of the legislation which has been enacted by the Oireachtas, many of the obligations that should have been provided for from the Central Fund are passed on to the local authorities.  Having regard to that fact and to the fact that the demand made on every valuation in the country has been increased over the past 12 months and that every rated agricultural occupier has to pay much more in his rate bill this year than last year, a very big question is resurrected.  It resurrects the question as to whether it is a good policy to continue on the lines that, over the period of the next three years, we will be subsidising the farmers for the number of people they employ on their holdings.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is our main industry.  It is the one thing we look to to bring us out of the very difficult position in which we now find ourselves.  Is it not time that we should decide amongst ourselves in a national Parliament that those who are engaged in agricultural production will obtain a remunerative market, something that will compensate themselves and their employees, rather than adopt the methods suggested in this Bill, which will not achieve the objectives sought by the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for <Col N="66" /> Finance or any of those other people who are concerned about the difficult position in which we now find ourselves? I think it is on these lines we should direct our approach to this problem.</P>
    <P>After that, we come down to an examination of what we are doing in this Bill.  I believe that the people with the £20 valuations should get some compensation for the position in which they will find themselves.  What do we find when we come to the problem of compensating employers of labour?  We find that the Bill hamstrings, if I may use the word, those people who might be inclined to employ labour.  The Minister, as well as every other member of the House who has had any association with rural Ireland, knows that such difficulties will arise.  You may have a very good man employed, a man who is as trustworthy as yourself, to run your farm. That man may have died on the 30th December, 1955.  It is very sad for himself and his wife and for his family, but is equally sad for the employer who was so anxious to get somebody to look after his farm.</P>
    <P>Weeks may pass before the employer will be able to employ a man of similar capabilities and of similar trustworthiness, and, because of his inability to get an immediate successor to his deceased employee, the farmer will be victimised by law, whether he be the owner of a 25 acre farm or a 150 acre farm.  He may have given employment for 364 days of the year and because he did not give employment on the 365th day, he is victimised.  The Minister would need to be realistic, if he wants this measure to act as an incentive to employers to employ more people on the land over a period of months.  The Minister should see to it that the employment period would be considered in relation to the months or weeks that a person has been employed, instead of in relation to the whole year.  It is all right for the members of the Labour Party to joke about this question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to be brief in anything I have got to say on this measure.  I have often wondered why the vulgar fraction &ldquo;three-fifths&rdquo; was first decided upon and why it has been maintained so religiously.  I suppose there can be an argument for its reduction in some cases and for its being raised in other cases, but my view is that it should remain at three-fifths, if the rate does not exceed 30/- in the £ in the different counties.  However, where the rate does exceed 30/- in the £ this fraction should be increased so as to provide a greater measure of help to the local authorities concerned.</P>
      <P>Such an arrangement would help the counties in the congested districts where the taxable capacity is low and from which you have the greatest volume of emigration.  It would help such counties as Kerry, Clare, Donegal, Sligo, Galway and Leitrim, as well as a few other counties.  I think the Minister should examine that fraction, with a view to having it modified in some direction.  If it were modified, I think the money being disbursed by the Minister to aid local authorities could be more equitably distributed.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear the Minister on the point as to whether or not it would be possible to amend the Bill now or later, with a view to giving a more generous allowance in counties where the rate exceeds 30/- in the £. If that figure did not suit, perhaps 35/- in the £ would be appropriate, because it is obvious that some councils have to raise their rates to a degree where it is not a rate in the £ any more but a rate on the £2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hartney spoke about the question of the employment allowance. So did Senator Burke.  I think the difference between their viewpoints was so little that it hardly befitted Senator Burke to criticise what Senator Hartney said.  Both appeared to want to achieve the same object, but there was a slight difference as to how far one <Col N="68" /> would go in comparison with the other.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;whole year&rdquo; is rather ambiguous.  It might be argued by a clever lawyer that it would include Sunday work.  It might result in a situation where a farmer whose employee was absent for two or three days, although he was not sick, could not claim relief, although the man might have been employed for the rest of the calendar year.  It might be argued that because an employee did not work on a Sunday or on Christmas Day, his employer was not entitled to benefit.  There are several border line cases of that kind which need proper definition.  Although a farmer might have a perfectly moral right to claim benefit, he might be debarred by law from doing so.  I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to the suggestion that the fraction three-fifths should be modified in the hope of giving a greater measure of relief to counties that have to levy the highest rates in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution to the debate will be very short, but, as I come from rural Ireland, I am interested in certain aspects of this Bill.  I would ask the Minister to examine carefully suggestions made by some Senators on the far side of the House to bring down the age from 17 to 16. I think a good case could be made for this change, but, at the same time, I believe a good case could be made against it.  When one considers the school-leaving age at the present time, and the fact that they have spent a period at the vocational school, it is reasonable to find a lot of young people on the land at the present time starting at the age of 16.  I would ask the Minister in his generosity to examine a particular case where a labourer works for ten or 11 months, and then through circumstances over which the employer has no control, he loses that employee and also his benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a peculiar case in North Tipperary some time ago&mdash;in fact, a lot of these cases came before the court&mdash; and one of them was a farmer who employed one constant man all the year round and then had to employ casuals. Senator Hartney made a case of a somewhat different kind.  In a tillage area like that of North Tipperary, <Col N="69" /> where you have beet, wheat, hay and potatoes and so on, the work has to be carried out.  You can have two men for the whole year, and at harvest time you might need one or two others.</P>
    <P>In the case to which I am referring in North Tipperary, we had a farmer who employed one man constantly and that man went to England some time in August.  The farmer was a lady and she employed two extra men after that, but she kept on this man's name whom she had insured, although he had left. The Justice gave a decree against her. The country people in filling in forms, it should be remembered, are not very conversant with the situation, as can be seen from the fact that they frequently have men employed for whom they do not actually claim.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins seemed to be drawing attention to the Labour Party and suggested that the Labour Party had no connection with rural Ireland; but I am a countryman, and I would say that the bulk of our Deputies and Senators come from rural Ireland.  We have good contacts with the people and I hope we always will have.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine those points carefully; I agree that there is a lot for and quite a lot against them. Listening to Senator Hawkins, I got the impression that this was a new Bill the Minister was bringing in. Coming, as I said, from rural Ireland, I am interested in agricultural relief and I know the Bills and Acts which have been before the House during the previous Government's time, but I never saw in any debate that Senator Hawkins made any contribution either for himself or for his Party in regard to the very matters he criticised here this afternoon.  I ask the Minister to examine the points that have been mentioned and to give them sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the suggestions that various Senators have expressed here, but I deplore the introduction, by Senator Hawkins, of politics into this matter.  He wants to know what is my attitude or why should the attitude of my colleagues and myself change by reference to the Act <Col N="70" /> of 1953.  There has been no change on our part.  The Act of 1953 went through both Houses without a division.  There has been no change, and any criticism levelled at the Bill before the House was levelled not so much at what the Bill contained as at what preceded it.  Let us look back for a few moments and let us see what preceded it.</P>
      <P>In May, 1953, the then Minister sent out a circular to all local authorities informing them that the allowance would be £13 per person.  In the meantime, we had two by-elections, one in Wicklow and one in East Cork, and it was as a result of those by-elections and in an effort to hold on to a number of votes and to retain them that the then Minister saw fit to raise the allowance from £13 to £17 when introducing the Bill.</P>
      <P>I deplore the introduction of politics into this matter.  This is not my Bill. It was introduced by my predecessor and became an Act.  I do not say I agree with it, in its entirety, but I think it deserves a fair trial, and I say it has not got a fair trial.  I think we should give it three years more and see if the Act of my predecessor is one to which we should cling as he suggested. I do not say that the Bill is ideal, but let us at least do the last Government the justice of finding out if their legislation is what they promised it would be.  That is all I am asking the House to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering this matter, we must first of all realise in connection with Bills such as this that we have to go back at least half a century to the time when farmers employed farm labourers for six or eight months each year at a time when there was no employment assistance or benefit and very little outdoor relief, and when those unfortunate farm workers were thrown out for three or four months in the year. The Government then decided they would endeavour to encourage farmers to keep their employees in full-time employment during the entire 12 months and it was for that purpose that these Bills, the Land Relief Bills, were introduced originally.  The aim of the legislation was to ensure that farm workers would not be thrown on to <Col N="71" /> the roadside when the harvest was in, and in the period between the harvest and the spring.  The aim was not to give farmers relief from their rates, but to encourage the farmers to retain the farm workers in full-time employment.</P>
    <P>A plea has been made to me, first of all, by my colleague, Senator Walsh, who says that the conacre farmer takes land for 11 months of the year and employs labour for 11 months, but obtains no relief under this measure.  Of course, he does not.  The taker of conacre never paid rates in his life and never paid&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>He pays it through the rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not the rated occupier.  The ratepayer is the owner of the land and it is the owner of the land who pays the rates and who is, therefore, entitled to repayment. I have very little sympathy indeed with the person who takes land on conacre, because far too much land is in conacre in this country.  He is not the man who is entitled to any relief under this legislation and we have to rule him out.  Senator Walsh knows that as well as I do.</P>
      <P>I do not really know what Senator Walsh was getting at when he said that three years was too long a time for which to ask the Oireachtas to sanction this measure.  We are not, I am sure, trying to encourage graziers by this Bill.  We are trying to encourage the farmer who cultivates his land and the dairy farmer who employs labourers to milk his cattle.  We are endeavouring to encourage them to retain in full employment their farm labourers for 12 months of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with what Senator Hartney said, that in his part of the country the farm labourer finishes on Christmas Eve and is not re-employed until 1st February.  I did tender certain advice in the Dáil on the Second Reading of this Bill.  I do not propose to tender it again.  It was quoted afterwards by my colleague, Deputy Corry.  If there is a contract of service for 12 months, there is no <Col N="72" /> necessity for the labourers to remain in full employment for the 12 months; he may have a month's leave.  So long as there is a retainer and so long as he is retained by the farmer for the 12 months, that is sufficient, and I am not concerned with the amount of the retainer and I am quite certain the local authority is not concerned.</P>
    <P>Remember, the local authorities have certain discretions under this Bill and under the previous Act, and I am satisfied, from what the Deputy from Cork and the Senators to-day have said, that these men who are in employment for 11 months are employed for 12 months and that they are merely let off or permitted to go home, or given a holiday, or however you wish to describe it, for that annual period from Christmas Eve to 1st February, that is, provided they are not going to take up employment elsewhere.  I think that should cover the point which was made by several Senators and I do not wish to refer to them all.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is fair to ask a Minister to construe the Act, but I will give the Senator gratuitously that advice&mdash;that is quite all right.  A number of Senators, including Senator Hartney and Senator Burke, asked me to reduce the age from 17 years to 16 years.  It is a most peculiar thing that down through the years for the past 20 years, when these Acts were first introduced, 17 years has been the age.  There was then no compulsory school attendance and there were no vocational schools in the country.  I remember the time when farm labourers were employed in my part of the country from the age of ten years up.  They went to the hiring fairs of Strabane and other areas in that locality and were hired out from ten years of age up.  Thank God, that day is gone.  I think 17 years is sufficiently young for a boy to take up <Col N="73" /> employment, especially when he has to attend school until 15 years of age and when we have vocational schools in practically every parish in the country.  If you put them out at 16 years of age, you are looking for cheap labour, nothing else.  It is something that should not be encouraged.  God knows, we have enough unemployed in this country over 17 years of age.</P>

      <P>I really do not know if there is much more that I can say.  The House will recollect that, under the Superannuation Act of 1956, I endeavoured to help employees of local authorities by substituting 200 service days for 200 working days and will remember the plea made here to reduce it to 150.  It is the same thing with this Bill.  The farmer must employ the labourer for 12 months of the year.  Some people suggest 11 months. Others suggest that in the period between harvest and spring, there is not very much to be done on the farm. I do not wish to labour that, but I think the House will appreciate that, no matter what period we state in the Bill, there will be people who will find that it may be rather difficult and severe on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="74" /> I think I have replied to most of the points which have been raised, bearing in mind all the time that the purpose of the Bill is not to give relief to the farmer but to encourage the farmer to give wholetime employment to his farm labourer, and if there be snags such as the Seanad has pointed out, there are methods of getting over them, and I only hope that any advice I have given may be of some benefit to the people of Cork and Limerick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (General MacEoin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now <Col N="75" /> read a Second Time.  The Bill represents a second step in bringing the national legislation into accord with the provisions of the 1949 Geneva Conventions relative to:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the treatment of prisoners of war, known as the Prisoners of War Convention; and</P>
      <P>(b)  the protection of civilian persons in time of war, known as the Civilians Convention,</P>
      <P>preparatory to the ratification of those conventions.  The first step in that direction was taken when the Red Cross Act, 1954, relating principally to Red Cross matters, was enacted.  A third measure remains to be introduced. This, which will be sponsored by the Minister for Justice, will deal with the domestic law in relation to those articles of the conventions aimed at the punishment of grave breaches of the conventions.</P>
      <P>Beginning in 1864, when the first Geneva Convention was signed with the object of improving the fate of wounded belonging to armed forces in active service, efforts, translated into a number of conventions, have been made down through the years to better the conditions of members of armed forces who fall into the power of the enemy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1949 Prisoners of War Convention gives expression to the present-day desire of nations to apply the highest possible humanitarian principles in their relations with prisoners of war.  The convention introduces many new and important features. Prior to the 1949 Convention only members of the &ldquo;armed forces&rdquo; were regarded as prisoners of war and treated as such.  The 1949 Convention defines the expression &ldquo;Prisoners of War&rdquo; in a much wider sense to include, in addition to armed forces who have fallen into the power of the enemy, members of militias and other volunteer corps and organised resistance movements, fulfilling certain conditions; persons accompanying the armed forces without actually being members thereof such as civilian members of military aircraft crews, <Col N="76" /> war correspondents, supply contractors, etc., provided they have received authorisation from the armed forces which they accompany; members of crews of the merchant marine and of civil aircraft of the parties to the conflict who do not benefit by more favourable treatment under any other provisions of international law and the inhabitants of a non-occupied territory who take up arms to resist an invader, provided they carry arms openly and obey the laws and customs of war.</P>
    <P>The convention also provides that persons belonging to any of the categories of persons defined as prisoners of war who have been received by neutral or non-belligerent powers on their territory and whom these powers are required to intern under international law shall be treated as prisoners of war without prejudice to any more favourable treatment which may be accorded.  This provision is important from the standpoint of neutral countries and will help them in overcoming problems in their dealings with belligerent forces.</P>
    <P>Other new features of the convention provide for the issue to persons entitled to be treated as prisoners of war of identity cards by their own Governments and for the issue of pay to noncommissioned officers and men as well as to officers, as formerly.  The necessary financial adjustment will be effected at the end of hostilities.  There is a further new provision laying down minimum rates of working pay and the conditions of work generally are closely related to those governing similarly employed civilian workers in the same locality.  A great advance has been made in the matter of repatriation. This must now take place without delay after the cessation of active hostilities instead of, as formerly, as soon as possible after the conclusion of peace.</P>
    <P>The Civilians Convention is an entirely new convention aimed at protecting the fundamental rights of the civilian population.  It does not apply to aliens interned in neutral countries in time of war.  The convention defines the categories of persons which it protects and regulates the treatment <Col N="77" /> which must be accorded such persons. Protected persons who are a danger to the security of the State, for example, spies, are not entitled to claim such rights and privileges under the convention as would, if exercised in their favour, be prejudicial to the security of the State.  Such persons must, however, be treated humanely until it is found possible to restore their full rights.  Where a party to the conflict finds it necessary to deny protected persons an opportunity of supporting themselves that party must ensure their support as well as that of their dependents.  Protected persons who may desire to leave the territory of a party to the conflict are entitled to do so unless their departure is contrary to the national interests of the State.  If permission to leave the territory is refused, the refusal must be open to periodical review by an appropriate court or administrative board.  If it is necessary to intern protected persons or assign them to a fixed residence their position must likewise be reviewed periodically.</P>
    <P>Conditions of internment for protected persons are laid down in detail in the convention.  These conditions are on the lines of those prescribed in the Prisoners of War Convention for prisoners of war.</P>
    <P>The Bill I am now presenting to the Seanad contains several references to particular articles or portions of the conventions with which the measure is concerned.  Copies of the conventions have been presented to the House by the Minister for External Affairs and Senators will, no doubt, have read them.  A brief description of the nature of the principal provisions of the portions concerned of the conventions, particularly of those portions which will be dealt with by regulations, has, however, been given in the explanatory memorandum which was circulated with the text of the Bill. Senators will see from Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill that power is sought to deal with a miscellaneous number of matters by regulations.  There is no other way by which the mass of detail contained in the particular portions concerned of the conventions could be satisfactorily dealt with.  Senators <Col N="78" /> will, however, have an opportunity of examining the regulations as they will be laid before the House.</P>
    <P>If the House wishes, I will go into a general discussion of the Bill, but I do not suppose there is any necessity to do so.  The whole object of the Bill is to enable us to ratify the conventions. We are one of a number of nations who have not yet done so: it has been ratified by a great number. We are in the wrong queue and we should like to get into the other queue as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to speak at length on this Bill, because I realise it is designed to ensure ratification of the convention to which the Minister referred.  It is well to know that a great advance has been made in connection with the treatment of prisoners of war and that humanitarian principles are more or less being brought to bear on such people. It is only right and proper, therefore, that we&mdash;even though we are only a small nation&mdash;should subscribe to the principle enshrined in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I gather from what the Minister has said that certain other nations are standing aloof from this international agreement.  That is very much to be regretted.  No doubt, they have reasons of their own for standing aloof from this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Senator Kissane in welcoming this step which is being taken by the Government to ratify the convention in relation to prisoners of war and enemy aliens.  There are one or two points, however, that do not seem entirely satisfactory and that are not quite clear.  In Section 2(3), I notice that, in order that such a person <Col N="79" /> may be interned during war time, the Minister has to be satisfied that the internment of the enemy alien in question is &ldquo;absolutely necessary for the security of the State&rdquo;.  That seems to me to be a very strong phrase, and, if it were to be quite literally interpreted, it might well prevent the Minister from interning quite a large number of aliens about whom it could not reasonably be said that their internment was &ldquo;absolutely necessary for the security of the State&rdquo;.  I should like to hear what the Minister has to say about this necessity to satisfy himself in such absolute terms.</P>
      <P>In sub-section (7) of the same Section 2, there are two points which I would like to mention.  The first is a matter of wording.  It would seem to me that, instead of talking about &ldquo;any person as respects whom he has reasonable grounds for believing that such person is a person...&rdquo; it would be simpler to say &ldquo;any person whom he has reasonable grounds for believing to be a person...&rdquo;  I am objecting there to the cumbersome and, I think, unsatisfactory wording, which occurs again in a later clause to which I shall also refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is more serious than a merely linguistic one, because this sub-section gives a member of the Garda Síochána a right to arrest a person without a warrant whom he believes to be a person &ldquo;directed to be interned.&rdquo;  There is no mention here or elsewhere in the Bill of any obligation on the Garda to take any further action in relation to such a person.  In other words, this sub-section gives power to arrest, but does not give any defence to the person so arrested.  There is no obligation on the Garda to show that his presumption or suspicion was in fact founded. There is no apparatus or machinery which must be brought into play in order to show that the individual Garda was right in his belief that this person was a person who had been &ldquo;directed&rdquo; to be interned.  That seems to me to be a loose end which should be tied up.  There should be some obligation placed on the Garda <Col N="80" /> arresting a person without warrant, simply on suspicion, to convince some superior that he has acted rightly.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to ask is a question in relation to Section 5.  I am sure this arises out of the internationally agreed convention, but it has a slightly surprising ring to me. It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If sentence of death is pronounced on a prisoner of war, the sentence shall not be executed before the expiration of the period of six months referred to in Article 101 of the Prisoners of War Convention.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain just precisely what is the implication of this 6 months' delay between conviction and execution in this case.  It is a rather startling clause and we might have some explanation of it.</P>
    <P>I see that Senator Crosbie is not quite happy, perhaps because he notices there is a motion down, to which I have put my name, for the abolition of capital punishment.  I am not to be taken at all as urging that the man be executed quickly.  I am asking the question for the purpose of finding out what lies behind this clause.  It would be nice if one could change the period of six months to 100 years.  It would be a pleasant amendment to put in, and it would be in accordance with my own views.  At all events, I want to know how it arises and what is the necessity for it.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is the next section about which I should like to ask a question. The Minister, in introducing this Bill, suggested that this is for the purpose of ratifying international conventions, but Section 7 permits the trying by a military tribunal of an interned enemy alien charged with any offence.  I notice in Section 8 of the memorandum that accompanies this Bill that we are told:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Civilians Convention does not specifically provide for trial of enemy aliens by military courts. Neither, however, does it preclude such action and as it is obviously desirable that there should be power in certain circumstances to bring enemy aliens before military courts, <Col N="81" /> provision accordingly is made in Section 7 of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think that it is quite so &ldquo;obviously desirable,&rdquo; in the first place, and I am afraid that we are inserting something here under the impression that we are merely ratifying an international convention, which, in fact, by the admission of this memorandum, does not appear in the international convention.  I consider it slightly odd to find it said here that we may introduce this military tribunal here because these conventions do not preclude it!  The only argument for it is the statement that it is &ldquo;obviously desirable.&rdquo;  I do not think the &ldquo;obviousness&rdquo; of that desirability has been put before us.  I personally should like to see it justified, before I would vote for this proposal to try by military tribunal interned enemy aliens charged with an offence.  I am not convinced that that would be necessary.</P>
    <P>The last section I want to refer to is Section 8.  Section 8 refers to what can be done to a person who is not an interned enemy alien but who assists one to escape.  I would suggest that if this section was not in the Bill, which relates to prisoners of war and enemy aliens, and if some Senator were to put it down and ask that it be inserted as an amendment, I suggest that he would be told that it was irrelevant because it gives power to deal in a certain way with Irish citizens and not with enemy aliens or prisoners of war.</P>
    <P>Here we have in this Bill, which purports to deal with prisoners of war and enemy aliens, a clause which allows for certain penal action to be taken against Irish citizens!  I would suggest that this Bill is not the place for such a provision.</P>
    <P>I have two other objections to this section.  One is in respect of the wording of sub-section (3), which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A member of the Garda Síochána or of the Defence Forces may arrest without warrant any person as respects whom he has reasonable grounds for believing that such person has contravened...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As respects whom&rdquo;&mdash;I feel that that could be more happily worded.  I would <Col N="82" /> ask the Minister to put down an amendment wording it more simply and speaking of &ldquo;any person whom he has reasonable grounds for believing to be a person who has contravened...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make in relation to this section and the Bill is that this section permits the arrest by a member of the Garda Síochána or Defence Forces&mdash;any ordinary Garda or any private soldier&mdash;permits the arrest of an Irish citizen without a warrant and without any indication as to what procedure must immediately follow upon this arrest on suspicion. Again I feel that in this clause power is given for arrest without warrant and on suspicion, without the necessary defence being given for the person involved.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious, of course, that a Garda or private soldier might suspect a person and yet be wrong.  He might suspect him in good faith, and yet be wrong, but this clause gives him the right to arrest this Irish citizen, not an enemy alien, a prisoner of war or an internee, without asking for any safeguard to be included, compelling, for instance, the arresting Garda or soldier to convince some tribunal or superior officer, preferably a judicial tribunal, that his suspicion was in fact founded.  Unless some such change were made I should be unhappy about that sub-section as, indeed, I should be unhappy about the entire Section 8 which deals not with prisoners of war or enemy aliens but with Irish citizens.</P>

      <P>This Bill is drafted in accordance with the conventions and is designed to enable us to ratify them.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to various sections. With regard to Section 2, part of that gives authority for internment to be governed by regulation afterwards.  One would have a field day, I admit, on the regulations, but practically every section in this Bill is closely related to the conventions themselves.  Perhaps what I should have done was to go through each section and say to what division of the convention it is related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of arrest, <Col N="83" /> I want the Senator to realise that this will be war time.  Somebody must have power to arrest.  You cannot have a tailor, a blacksmith or anybody like that to effect the arrest.  The only person entitled to do so is a Civic Guard or a member of the Defence Forces.  The arrested person must then be brought in the proper process of law to justice, when he has the right to defend himself and do all the things that ought to be done for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The provision that the person is not to be shot for six months is to give the country to which he belongs an opportunity of saying something to prevent him being shot.  It is part of the convention that no prisoner of war is to be shot after sentence of death has been imposed, for at least six months. I think it is a very desirable thing, instead of giving authority to shoot a prisoner out of hand.</P>

      <P>It is part of the convention to see that he gets a fair chance in war conditions.  I know you can argue that the death penalty should be abolished but you must remember that war is a killing match and it is not made to-day by the old orthodox methods.  It is a new phase altogether and the intention in this measure is to try to lessen the impact.</P>
      <P>As regards the trial of enemy aliens by military courts, we must remember that in a time of war the civilian courts may be out of action.  This is an enabling Bill to empower trial by court-martial.  It is reasonable enough that under these circumstances the trial would be by court-martial. Generally speaking, courts-martial are fair enough, if they are given a chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording of some of the sections may be difficult but they are designed by the parliamentary draftsman to give effect to the convention.  Whether he has succeeded in that, I am not in a position to say, but the legal advisers <Col N="84" /> to the Government say so and my officials assure me that these sections are in accordance with and not contrary to any of the conventions.  Therefore, we think they meet all the requirements.</P>

      <P>When this Bill was introduced last December, a memorandum was circulated with it explaining its provisions in some detail.  On the Second Reading in the Dáil, I gave a general outline of the reasons for its promotion and why particular principles were being followed&mdash;some of which were at variance with the principles followed in framing the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1935.  There was general acceptance, on all sides of the other House, of the proposals in the Bill and only a couple of suggestions were made for its amendment in minor respects.  I do not think that this House expects me to make a long Second Reading speech to-day as, owing to the fact that the Bill has passed virtually unchanged through the Dáil, the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill and the Second Reading speech recorded in the official records of 29th February (Volume 154, No. 7, columns 996 to 1005) explain the position fully.</P>
      <P>I feel that I should mention that there is a constitutional necessity to enact legislation to deal with the acquisition and loss of Irish nationality and citizenship.  Article 9.1.2º of the Constitution reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the future acquisition and loss of Irish nationality and citizenship shall be determined in accordance with law&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task of framing legislation to give effect to this provision of the Constitution of 1937 has been delayed somewhat owing to the war and all the problems of its aftermath.  However, <Col N="85" /> the long period, in between, has given the various Government Departments concerned an opportunity of studying the changes which have come about in recent times in the nationality laws of many countries.  In consequence, I can say that the proposals in the Bill before you are the result of prolonged, deliberate consideration both by the official experts and by Government itself.</P>

      <P>My remarks on this measure will be brief, because I realise it is essentially a Committee Stage Bill, dealing with the law of nationality and citizenship. We are discussing this measure this evening as one of the results of the passing of the Consititution of 1937, under an Article of which there is power to deal with the nationality and citizenship law of this country as circumstances may demand.  It was only right and proper, of course, to leave that Article of the Constitution in that way, so as to meet the contingencies of the years as they arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few changes in this Bill, and, even though they could not be described as fundamental, still they are welcome.  As I have read the Bill, one change is to ensure that people who are born here and who have left to take up their abode in other countries will not lose their Irish citizenship, even though they become citizens of the country of their adoption. That is my interpretation of it, and, if that is so, I welcome it as a step in the right direction.  It will, of course, in some cases, result in what I might describe as dual citizenship and it could result in multiple citizenship. No matter what takes place in other countries, as far as Irish people are concerned, it is right they should <Col N="86" /> not be deprived of their Irish citizenship because of that.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with that is of importance in certain ways.  One is the case of people who were born in this country and went abroad to earn money.  If they come back and if they want to purchase property here, they will now be entitled to the discrimination, I would call it, which we have in the financial legislation in this country in connection with the payment of stamp duty.  That is only right because many of us on former occasions found fault with the existing position.  It was our belief that if a person went abroad, with the intention of coming back at some time to purchase property here, he should be entitled to get the same privileges as the people living at home who had never left home.</P>
    <P>There is one thing that agitates my mind in connection with this Bill, and that is the wording of Section 7.  The section deals with people living in the Six Counties and the purpose of it is to confer citizenship on the people there.</P>

      <P>To confer the right of citizenship, provided they make application for it.  I wonder is it right to make use of the words &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo; in a measure of this kind?  I do not regard the Six North-Eastern Counties as Northern Ireland and I think we should get rid of this phraseology. It is a phraseology being made use of by the people up there and also by the British, and I do not see why we should fall into line with them in this matter.  Instead of the words &ldquo;Northern Ireland,&rdquo; we should have &ldquo;the six occupied counties&rdquo;.  I have not very much more to say on the measure.  As I stated at the outset, it is a Committee measure.  It is rather involved, but I think it is very well drafted.  I was glad that we got the explanatory memorandum in connection with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, as a lawyer, to welcome the Bill.  I think it clarifies and simplifies the position very considerably.  I welcome it particularly in that it removes the extraordinary <Col N="87" /> anomaly that existed previously under the Control of Manufactures Act, under which a person who was an Irish citizen had not the rights of people who are called qualified persons or Irish nationals.  I think the general conception that anyone who is a citizen is to have all the rights of any person living in the country is a very proper approach to that.</P>
      <P>I also welcome it very much for Section 7, which, I think, states the national position very much more clearly in respect of the people who are resident in the Six Counties.  I think the Minister and the Government are to be congratulated on having brought it in.  As Senator Kissane said, there are probably a good many points in the Bill which could much better be dealt with on Committee Stage and most of the points that occur to me are Committee Stage points.  However, I should like to say it does seem to me that one ought to say at this stage that Section 6, which defines who are citizens, seems to me to be far more involved and complicated than is necessary. Obviously, the intention is to say that people born in Ireland are Irish citizens.  Then the section deals with the difficult point of people who may not have been born here, but one of whose parents was and who would have been, if this Act had been passed, an Irish citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is really a point for Committee Stage.  The wording of Section 6 would appear to raise considerable complications as to how far back it operates. It is clear under it that a person who would not otherwise be an Irish citizen is qualified, if either of his parents was an Irish citizen.  The parents would be deemed to be Irish citizens if they were born in Ireland or if one of them was born in Ireland.  Section 6 would seem to open up a vista of complicated legal argument as it stands.  Sub-section (2) of Section 7 provides that neither sub-section (2) nor (4) of Section 6 shall confer Irish citizenship on a person born outside Ireland, if the father or mother through whom he derives citizenship was also born outside Ireland.  Section 6 has said that if either the father or mother was born in Ireland, it would confer citizenship and I am not at all <Col N="88" /> sure that sub-section (2) of Section 7 is not a contradiction of that.  I think that is a point on the interpretation of the Bill which should be considered. There are a number of other points I should like to raise, but they are clearly matters for Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, the draft legislation contained in this Bill is desirable, as it extends the number of our Irish stock who will be, or who may become, citizens of the country. Ireland is indeed a mother country and her sons and daughters have peopled many lands.  They brought the Faith to many races and have assisted in building up and have contributed to the development and administration of many countries throughout the world.</P>
      <P>Although a big percentage of our people emigrate or require to emigrate, due to economic reasons, I believe that one day most of them hope to return to end their days in their own country, to be buried beneath the green sod, to be mourned by those near and dear to them in their native land.  Sometimes, however, it is their children who come back, and it is right, therefore, that there should be adequate provision to permit our emigrants, or their descendants, to return to Ireland as their country even though they may have become naturalised citizens of another country.</P>
      <P>As Senators already remarked, it is particularly important, because of the discrimination in favour of Irish citizens contained in the Finance Act of 1947, the Control of Manufactures Act and the Moneylenders Act that some concession has been made under the recent Finance Bill, whereby non-nationals may come under a lower rate of stamp duty, if they are buying a private dwellinghouse or a site for industry, but a great number of people who come back come back to buy dwellinghouses with land attached, and apparently those people, if they are not Irish citizens, will still have to pay the 25 per cent. duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 21 of the Bill permits persons to renounce citizenship if resident outside the State by lodging with the Minister a declaration of alienage, and is it not possible that it may be a condition precedent to confirming naturalisation <Col N="89" /> in some countries that such a declaration of alienage be made, or that the Irish citizenship of origin be forfeited?  I assume, for instance, that does not happen in the United States, but if that was the position, and if the law was such in some countries, has the Minister made any provision whereby that person may again acquire Irish citizenship other than by naturalisation in the ordinary way, or would the Minister consider that he had such power under Section 16? Does the Minister also consider that the last two words of Section 7 which sets out &ldquo;public service&rdquo; are sufficient, or would it be desirable to add &ldquo;of Ireland&rdquo;?  That same remark would apply to Section 16.  There was considerable discussion in the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">

      <P>Public service is defined in the definition section.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;other House in connection with the words &ldquo;Irish association&rdquo;, and it was suggested that these words are too vague and indefinable, and the Minister on the Report Stage promised he would have the matter reconsidered.  It seems to me that the draftsman is giving tremendous power to a Minister to permit him to give a certificate of naturalisation to a person, if he has Irish associations.  One could even imagine an Asiatic, playing, say, in an Irish band in New York, being regarded as sufficiently qualified under that definition.</P>
      <P>Senator Kissane has already referred to the words &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo; which are contained in Section 7, and I, too, feel that the term &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo; is most inapt.  I am sure many of the members of this House are aware of the fact that Malin Head is described as being &ldquo;that part of Southern Ireland which is north of Northern Ireland&rdquo;.  If that is the case, then the words &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo; are not particularly suitable.</P>

      <P>Or North-East Ireland. As a neighbour of the people of the north-eastern counties, I am pleased <Col N="90" /> that the Minister has provided under this Bill that people born in the north-east counties have equal status with those born in the Twenty-Six Counties, where either of their parents is Irish, and that is the position without any formality of registration.  It is only right and consistent with Article 2 of the Constitution passed in 1937 which sets out that the national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and territorial seas.</P>
      <P>Recently, however, the Minister, when piloting the Gaming and Lotteries Act through this House, prevented, under Section 8, an Irish citizen who is ordinarily resident in the Six Counties from promoting or assisting, or even providing facilities for, gaming at carnivals, bazaars or sports meetings, even though under Section 7 the promoter may not derive any personal profit from the event or game. I think it is inconsistent for the Minister to give all these privileges of being Irish citizens and then, on the other hand, to take away the privileges he has conferred under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I agree with the other Senators who complimented the drafters of this Bill.  I think it is quite right, as Senator Cox has said, that it clears up a number of points that have been insufficiently clear up to now, but that does not mean that it is beyond reproach.  I should like to speak mainly about Section 7 which has already been referred to.  I would agree with those Senators who would prefer to see the area in the North referred to as the Six Counties rather than Northern Ireland, though I think to suggest that we should use the term the &ldquo;Six Occupied Counties&rdquo; would be to use a misnomer in respect of four of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter how much we may deplore it, I think it is quite clear at present that so far we have failed to persuade the people in four of those Six Counties to vote in a majority for coming in with us.  Consequently, those four counties cannot be said to be occupied against their will.  However that may be, using the phrase &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo; here is unfortunate, and I think perhaps the <Col N="91" /> Minister might consider changing it to the inoffensive term of &ldquo;Six Counties&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I also notice the date&mdash;people &ldquo;born in the Six Counties on or after the 6th December, 1922&rdquo;.  I am not quite sure that that is the best date here.  I am not sure that the best date might not be 1925 because it was, I think, in December, 1925, that the Dáil ratified the agreement which made permanent, up to now at any rate, the present boundary around the Six Counties, and the ratification of that boundary definition stems rather from the 1925 agreement than from the Treaty.  It was not until 1925 that we as a Parliament approved of that, admittedly with a good deal of dissent, nevertheless by a substantial majority.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which they said was &ldquo;negotiated in friendship.&rdquo; I am only quoting their words. I do not know what evidence Senator Hayes has to the effect that they did not mean them, but I think, in justice to the men concerned, that they did mean them.</P>
      <P>In relation to citizens born in this area, I should like to ask the Minister in regard to the records which are referred to in Section 27, of people who claim Irish citizenship, and who are outside the jurisdiction for the moment, whether it is the intention to keep separate records of those who make that claim, arising out of the fact that they were born in the Six Counties?  In other words, will it be possible from the record to see how many people in the Six Counties take the step of claiming Irish citizenship? I cannot help wondering whether this particular section does not in fact allow the North to opt out of Ireland, allow a large number of people in the Six Counties to decide quite clearly and prove it on paper that they do not regard themselves and do not want to regard themselves as citizens of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, even among the strongly nationalist people in the Six Counties, there might be many for whom it might be awkward, for one reason or another, to declare themselves now as Irish citizens.  I am not sure whether full consideration has been given to the fact that we may be placing many people who are in sympathy with the Republic in an awkward position in demanding that they should publicly declare themselves as citizens of Ireland without, in fact, there being as yet a uniting of the two parts of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Unless they make the declaration &ldquo;in the prescribed <Col N="93" /> manner,&rdquo; they shall no longer be considered as Irish citizens&mdash;that is the purport of Section 7.  I am just asking the question: is this wise?</P>
      <P>In relation to that, I should also like to ask the Minister whether there is any time limit for this declaration?  We are going to allow the people in the Six Counties to declare themselves as Irish and to become Irish citizens by a simple declaration, but there is no reference to a time limit.  We do not say &ldquo;you must do it within a year or two years or ten years of the passing of this Act,&rdquo; so that it would be possible for a person to be considered by us as an alien, or as a British subject, and perhaps 25 years later for him suddenly to make this application and declare himself Irish.  I just wonder whether the Minister has considered the question of a time limit and of a date and whether he has considered just what the full implications of the seventh section are, and whether the clauses do not in fact allow a lot of potential Irish citizens, as it were, to opt out.</P>
      <P>That is the main point I want to make, but there are two or three other sections to which I want to make at least passing reference.  One is Section 15, paragraph (d).  I notice that a person applying for naturalisation has to have one year's continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of his application, and to have been a total of four years here in the eight years preceding that.  I cannot help wondering whether the period of one year's continuous residence as a basic requirement is not just a little short.  A person can qualify to become Irish by having just one year's continuous residence.  Admittedly, he will have had to spend four years off and on in the preceding eight years in the State, but I still wonder whether the one year is not, perhaps, in this case over-generous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point I want to make is in relation to Section 19.  Section 19 allows the Minister to revoke a certificate of naturalisation for various reasons, if he thinks it has been fraudulently acquired for instance, and I do not think anybody could object to revocation in that case, but, also, if <Col N="94" /> the person &ldquo;by any overt act has showed himself to have failed in his duty of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.&rdquo;  I cannot help wondering whether that phrase, although it sounds all right when you read it there, might not be capable of, shall we say, ungenerous interpretation in certain political contexts, to deprive a person, who quite justifiably had got Irish naturalisation, of his citizenship. In other words, is it not rather a weapon, a club, held over the heads of the naturalised citizen, which might prevent him in fact even from adhering to certain political parties in the country, if a narrow view was to be taken of what is his &ldquo;duty of fidelity to the nation&rdquo;?  In other words, are we not, by such a section as this, instituting something that looks like second-class citizenship, because I think I am right in saying that it would take rather more in the case of an Irish citizen, Irish by birth, to have him deprived of his citizenship rights than simply to say that he had shown himself to have failed in his duty of fidelity to the nation!</P>
    <P>There are many young men about whom that might be stated, and has been stated, by different political parties and yet I think one would hesitate to say that they deserve to be deprived of their Irish citizenship.  In the case of naturalised citizenship this, apparently, is going to take place, and I suggest that the implication of this section is to institute a second-class citizenship and not, in fact, to give full citizenship to those who have fulfilled the requirements for naturalisation.  I would deplore that attitude.  I have no objection to the qualifications for naturalisation being made fairly difficult, but I do feel that, once they have been fulfilled, the naturalised person, except in the case of his having fraudulently acquired that certificate, should have full citizenship rights of which he cannot be deprived any more than any other citizen.</P>
    <P>I notice that in sub-section (5) of Section 19 there is the right to revoke a certificate of naturalisation, and so on, and the person concerned &ldquo;shall cease to be an Irish citizen&rdquo;.  I should like to ask two questions in relation to <Col N="95" /> that.  Does such a naturalised citizen who loses his citizenship in this way become a Stateless person?  Has the Minister considered just what is the status, the international status, of a person who loses Irish citizenship through losing this certificate of naturalisation?  I would presume, by that certificate of naturalisation, that he already has forfeited the citizenship of the country from which he came. What happens when he loses our citizenship?  Does he become a Stateless person?</P>
    <P>We have noticed elsewhere in the Bill that the children of a naturalised person become naturalised also in certain circumstances.  What happens to them when such a naturalised person loses his certificate?  Do they remain Irish, and do they remain Irish even if he has acquired his certificate fraudulently? These are matters on which I am not quite clear and on which I would appreciate hearing the Minister's views.</P>
    <P>Section 26 provides that where the Government are satisfied that,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;under the law of another country Irish citizens enjoy in that country some or all of the rights and privileges of a citizen of that country the Government may by Order declare that citizens of that country shall enjoy in the State similar citizenship rights and privileges to those enjoyed by Irish citizens in that country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What exactly has the Minister in mind there?  Earlier to-day we were dealing with a situation in which we were being pretty ruthlessly nationalistic in demanding that when a tea wholesale company wanted to get a licence, not merely did they have to have the majority of the owners Irish but every single share in the company had to be &ldquo;in the beneficial ownership of Irish citizens.&rdquo;  Had the Minister in mind to make concessions to British subjects, or American citizens, or the citizens of any other State, and, if so, along what lines?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other Senators in welcoming this Bill.  I think it does, to a very great extent, <Col N="96" /> clarify the position of citizenship. Listening to the other speeches, I have been wondering whether we may possibly be opening the door a little too wide.</P>
      <P>I think it was Senator Walsh who mentioned, in connection with Section 7, that you might have the improbable case of a person employed, say, in an Irish band in New York claiming to have rights to Irish citizenship although his parents might be of African or Asiatic descent.</P>
      <P>With regard to Section 6, we could quite easily have children of parents of, shall we say, Nigerian or Korean citizenship, who are over here studying. It could happen that a child would be born to them here and that that child would have a right to be an Irish citizen.  That also appears to be the position under Section 13.  I am not necessarily objecting to a child of Nigerian or Korean parents becoming an Irish citizen, but I am wondering whether that was really the desire or intention of the Government, when drafting this Bill.</P>
      <P>On Section 19, Senator Sheehy Skeffington mentioned&mdash;incidentally, I agree very much with what he said on that section&mdash;that if we deprive a person of citizenship, we might create a Stateless person.  He asked the Minister what would happen to the wife or children of such Stateless persons.</P>
      <P>Section 13 might create possibly an improbable problem, but nevertheless under Section 13 (2) it is provided that a person who is born the child of aliens in a foreign ship or in a foreign aircraft, while the ship or aircraft is within Ireland or its territorial seas, is deemed not to be born in Ireland if at the birth the child acquired the citizenship of another country.  We might find that one of these Stateless persons in a foreign-owned ship in Irish seas would produce an infant that could claim Irish descent and it might create considerable difficulties for the Department of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 6, 7 and 13 provide methods of acquiring Irish citizenship for persons or for children of persons who are citizens of foreign countries.  I feel <Col N="97" /> that, in an Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill, we should have some clause which would prevent a child born in Dublin or in the Twenty-Six Counties of two foreign parents from automatically acquiring Irish nationality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just three short points which I should like to raise on this Bill which seems a very desirable Bill.  I agree with Senator Sheehy Skeffington that some legal complications may result from Section 7.  It seems to me that if an unscrupulous person from the Six Counties found it advantageous to change his nationality overnight&mdash;as he could under this Bill&mdash;he might exploit it to his advantage and to the disadvantage of honest people.  I think it is advisable, and I should like the Minister to consider it, that some time limit should be included here, as otherwise there is the risk of some knavery of that kind.</P>
      <P>As regards Section 19 (1) (b), I agree with Senator Sheehy Skeffington that there may be some risk in the future in a phrase like &ldquo;...failed in his duty of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State,...&rdquo; Can I take it from the Minister that such a person would have an appeal to the courts in a matter of that kind?  If such a person deemed he was unjustly being deprived of citizenship under this clause, could he take the matter to the courts?  If he could, it seems a reasonable enough protection.</P>
      <P>Finally, as regards Section 26 (4), I am not quite clear what is intended. Would the Minister be good enough to give us an example of &ldquo;any right or privilege reserved by law to any class or group of persons, howsoever defined&rdquo;?  It may be sheer stupidity on my part, but I should like some clarification of that sub-section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill implements the statement I made in November last that the <Col N="100" /> Government intended setting up a Ministry to deal with matters affecting the Gaeltacht.  The principal purpose of this Bill is to strengthen, economically, educationally and otherwise, the people living in those districts where Irish is still the natural language of the people.</P>
    <P>In 1926, an examination was made in connection with the Gaeltacht. Recommendations were made and the area of the Gaeltacht was delineated in certain ways.  It was divided into the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and the Breac-Ghaeltacht. Very considerable changes have taken place since, but there are substantial areas in Donegal, Galway, Mayo and parts of Munster where Irish is the natural language of the people.  It is of immense importance &mdash;I think this view is subscribed to by all classes of people throughout the country&mdash;that our national language should be helped to maintain itself and remain the natural language of the people, and strengthen itself further particularly in those districts where it still exists among a fair section of the people, and to extend it gradually as a fairly common language for the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to maintain Irish as the spoken language, and for that purpose to assist the people both economically and educationally. The Ministry is more or less a coordinating framework at the moment. We know there are considerable areas of the country that could be described very definitely by Order forthwith as Gaeltacht areas for the purposes of this Bill, but then there is a thinning out in what was called the Breac-Ghaeltacht, where you might not, without more experience of the work of this Ministry, wish to extend the area unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>It so happens that, when the census was held in the beginning of April, it was possible for us to arrange that over what was described in the 1926 Commission as the Gaeltacht and Breac-Ghaeltacht an enumeration would be carried out which would give us, within the next few weeks, information according to district electoral divisions and subsequently, according to townlands, as to the number of <Col N="101" /> households where Irish is the language of the household, or English only, or a mixture of both, the number of people over three years of age who speak only Irish, only English, or who speak both Irish and English; so that with the information we have with regard to the Irish speaking districts in a general way, strengthened by the position over a particular area where all the schools are treated as Irish speaking schools and most of the post offices are treated as Irish speaking post offices, we will have a census enumeration that will fill in the mapped picture for us as to where the strength of Irish speakers lies over that area which was marked Gaeltacht and Breac-Ghaeltacht in the 1926 census.  It will be possible then, before very long, to have the Order contained under Section 2 of the Bill made out.  When that is done, no doubt many areas will claim they are left out and that they ought to be in; but there is one way of coming under the Order and that is to be an Irish speaking district up to the standard which I think we will be able to define fairly clearly.</P>
    <P>As far as the operation of the Bill is concerned, Senators will see that power is taken to transfer, if necessary, part of the work of any Ministry to the Gaeltacht Ministry, and there is the natural power to set up new services that are considered to be required under this Ministry.  But the main function of the Ministry is that in regard to the economic, educational and other interests of the people involved, the Minister and the officials of this Department will deal with each separate Department connected in any way with the people of these districts, so that the various officials concerned will be able to afford to the fullest extent and in the most timely way the different types of State help that are generally available, on the one hand, or on the other hand that are available for special areas.  It will be possible also to see that the administrative work of this Department and whatever official contact there has to be with the people of those areas in the carrying out of that administrative will be done through the medium of Irish.  In that way, these districts will feel that they have a Department of State <Col N="102" /> ministering to them in their own language, thereby strengthening both their will to maintain the language and making it easier for them to do it, too.</P>
    <P>A number of services exist at the present time especially nominated for the Gaeltacht.  It had been proposed that some of these will be taken over forthwith, but, after full consideration of the matter, it was decided that any change can most systematically and most effectively take place when the machinery of the Ministry has been set up.  However, these matters will be reviewed in the very early days of the setting up of the Ministry and such of these schemes as ought to be transferred to be directly administered by the Gaeltacht Ministry can be transferred.</P>
    <P>When we last discussed this matter here, the question at issue was whether there should be a board or a Ministry.  But I think that everybody will be satisfied that, to have the affairs of the Gaeltacht put under a Minister and to have the position that at Cabinet meetings of the Government there will be a Minister responsible for affairs in those Gaeltacht areas, will be a position of power and of importance that could not be replaced by any kind of body.</P>
    <P>I would hope that, with the passage of this Bill within the next couple of weeks, the Ministry would be set up straight away, that it would not be very long before the first Order could be made defining the Gaeltacht, in its initial position, at any rate, for the purposes of this Act, and that we would have the summer months to get close down to the problem and to get the Ministry well under way.</P>

      <P>Ina theanta sin bhíos in amhras ar cheart cúramaí na Gaeltachta agus an chaiteachais a ghabhfadh leo a bheith mar dhualgas ar aon dream daoine, dá fheabhas agus dá dhílseacht iad, ach ar dhuine a bheadh freagarthach don Rialtas agus don Dáil, ba chuma an Aire nó Rúnaí Parlaiminte an duine sin. Admháim, áfach, go mbeadh buntáistí ag Aire seachas Rúnaí Párlaiminte. An chéad bhuntáiste do bheadh níos mó údaráis aige chun dul ar aghaidh le pé scéimeanna a bheadh ar aigne aige, an dara buntáiste bheadh sé i láthair ag cruinnithe an Rialtais agus d'fhéadfadh sé cúrsaí na Gaeltachta a phlé le baill eile an Rialtais.</P>
      <P>Anois sé mo thuairim gur cóir go mbeadh sé mar chuspóir ag an duine a bhéas mar Aire i bhfeighil obair na Gaeltachta, ní hamháin an saol geilleagrach d'fheabhsú ach féachaint chuige go mbeidh an saol sóisialach ar aon-dul nach mór le saol sóisialach na ndaoine a chónaíonn sa Ghalltacht.  Sé an fáth a luaim an méid sin ná gur dóigh liom gurb é ceann de na nithe is cúis leis an imirce ón nGaeltacht chomh maith leis an saol bocht eacnamaíochta atá gan saol ceart sóisialach a bheith acu ag baile agus go dtéann siad go dtí na háiteanna inar dóigh leo go mbeadh a leithéid acu.  Go deimhin is deacair é sin a thógaint ar aos óg na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <Col N="104" /> Ní maith le héinne an t-uaigneas ná an t-easba chomluadair, is fearr an t-aighneas ná an t-uaigneas, adeirtear. I dteanta tionscail oiriúnacha a chur ar bun sa Ghaeltacht ní mór an saol do ghealadh dóibh agus déarfainn gurbh é sin ceann de na cúramaí a chaithfidh an tAire nua, pé hé féin, a thógaint air féin.  B'fhéidir nár mhiste a bheith ag súil le cabhair ó na hoidí scoile sa Ghaeltacht chuige sin agus ón gcléir chomh maith.  Nuair a bhíos ag caint cheana ar an gceist seo sa Seanad dheineas tagairt don rud so.  Do luas scéim aibhléisiú na tuatha, á rá gur chóir an scéim seo do chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ins gach áit ar saor-luach agus a thabhairt dóibh gan ró-mhoill.  Ní fhéadfaimis bheith ag súil go bhféadfaidís na táillí céanna d'íoc is a íocann muintir na Gaeltachta. Ghealfadh sé sin an saol dóibh go deimhin.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir go gceisteofaí mé i dtaobh conas a cuirfí aibhléis ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ar tháillí ísle, níos ísle ná d'fhéadfadh an Bord Aibhléise é do sholáthar dóibh.  D'fhéadfaí é dhéanamh le cabhair ó chiste an Stáit. Is ionann san is a rá go gcaithfidh muintir na tíre ar fad bheith ullamh agus sásta teacht i gcabhair ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus sé mo thuairim nuair a míneofar an scéal do mhuintir na hÉireann uilig ná beidh aon chur ina choinnibh sin acu.  Is fiú lucht na Gaeltachta níos mó ná san.  Is mór is fiú an oidhreacht ársa atá acu, an teanga agus an cultúr a ghabhann léi. Mar adúras, ní dóigh liom go mbeidh aon doicheall ag lucht tuisceanach na tíre roimh scéim den tsaghas san.  Tar éis an tsaoil ní bheadh á dhéanamh ach ag cur muintir na Gaeltachta ar aon-dul leis na daoine sa Ghaeltacht maidir le cuid de bhuntáistí an tsaoil agus ní mór linn dóibh é.  Caitfidh muintir na tíre ar fad íbirt a dhéanamh fé nithe den tsórt sin ar son na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Scéim eile a mholas nuair a bhíomar ag gabháil don cheist seo cheana bhain sé le tionscal na hiascaireachta. Tá an iascaireacht fite le saol na Gaeltachta, bíodh is nár cuireadh riamh fó-roinn na hiascaireachta agus fó-roinn na Gaeltachta le chéile.  Mholas go gcuirfí báid iascaigh ar fáil d'iascairí na Gaeltachta ar saor-luach chomh <Col N="105" /> maith, ach talamh slán a dhéanamh de gurb í an Ghaeilge gnáth-theanga theaghlaigh agus gnótha ag foirne na mbád.  Is mór an cur as d'iascairí bochta fé láthair an t-airgead síos a héilítear orthu i dtosach.  Más foirne le Gaeilge atá i gceist anois ní ceart aon airgead síos d'éileamh orthu.  Sé sin más í an Ghaeilge a ngnáththeanga. Bhí áthas arm a fháil amach ó ráiteas a heisíodh cúpla lá ó shoin go bhfuil glactha leis an scéim sin, agus is ró-chuma an de bharr mo mholta-sa nó de bharr molta duine éigin eile a glacadh leis an scéim is céim ar aghaidh é gan aon agó agus tá súil agam go leathnófar an scéim ar fuaid na Gaeltachta uilig.  Ní hé amháin go mbeidh an tslí bheatha is dual ag na Gaeilgeoirí dúchais ach beidh iasc le cur ar an margadh in áiteanna ar imeall na Gaeltachta ná faightear breac fé láthair.</P>
    <P>Maidir le fo-roinn na hiascaireachta níl fhios againn conas a bheidh an scéal feasta.  An gcuirfear an fhó-roinn sin fé Aireacht na Gaeltachta feasta? Ba cheart go gcuirfí iascaireacht na mara go háirithe, mar is ar an iascaireacht sin is mó atá muintir na Gaeltachta ag brath, agus tionscal dúchasach acu é.  Is tionscal é a thug saibhreas dóibh sna laetheanta atá imithe.  Ba chóir go mbeadh sé mar bheartas ag an Aire nua an iascaireacht mhara a chur ar a bonnaibh i gceart arís sa Ghaeltacht agus chuige sin sé mo thuairim gur cheart an tionscal san a dheighilt ón Roinn Talmhaíochta agus a cheangal le hAireacht na Gaeltachta.  Ní ag fáil lochta ar an Roinn Talmhaíochta atáim, ach amháin gur dóigh liom go bhfuil cúramaí a ndóthain ar an Roinn Talmhaíochta. Tá aon deacracht amháin sa scéal go bhfuil Rúnaí Párlaiminte i mbun fó-roinn na hiascaireachta i láthair na huaire fén Aire Talmhaíochta, ach ní mór le rá an deacracht san.  Ar aon chuma, ba mhaith liom tuairim an Aire d'fháil ina thaobh san.</P>
    <P>Dar ndóigh, tá ranna eile stáit ann go mbaineann ceist seo na Gaeltachta leo a bheag nó a mhór.  An Roinn Oideachais, an Roinn Tailte agus Foraoiseachta, srl.  Níl fhios agam conas a bheidh an scéal feasta tar éis an Aireacht nua seo a chur ar bun. <Col N="106" /> An leanfar den nós a bhí ann cheana, coiste idir-ranna a bheith ann ar a mbeidh oifigigh as na Ranna Rialtais go léir go mbaineann an cheist leo? Dob í an Rúnaí Parlaiminte a bhí i mbun Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta a bhíodh mar chathaoirleach ar an gCoiste sin nuair a thagaidís le chéile. Má leantar an nós sin an é an tAire nua a bheidh mar Chathaoirleach ar an gCoiste idir-rannach san?</P>
    <P>Ní fheicim fós conas d'fhéadfadh an tAire nua seo dul ar aghaidh le forbairt agus le tarrtháil na Gaeltachta gan cabhair d'fháil ó na ranna eile Rialtais. Foraoiseacht, cuir i gcás.  Tuigtear gur maith an scéim í sin san nGaeltacht, más é cuspóir an Aire nua gan bheith i dtaobh leis an Roinn Tailte chun crainn a chur ag fás sa Ghaeltacht, cá bhfaighfear na teicneoirí?  Ní mór teicneoirí a bheith ar an láthair nuair a beifear ag cur na gcrann agus an féidir teicneoirí le Gaeilge d'fháil a raghaidh i mbun na hoibre sa Ghaeltacht?  Muran féidir, ná beadh sé i gceist gur mó díobháil ná maitheas a déanfaí dá mba theicneoirí gan Gaeilge a cuirfí isteach sa Ghaeltacht? Níl ansan ach sampla den iliomad deacrachtaí atá fite fuaite le bunúdh na hAireachta nua so.</P>
    <P>Is dócha go bhfuil machnamh déanta ag an Aire ar na deacrachtaí seo ó céad-ceapadh an beartas nua so, is do raghainn i ndánaíocht a rá, dá mhéid é a mhachnamh, ná féadfadh sé a insint dúinn i láthair na huaire conas is féidir cuid de na deacrachtaí a bhaineann leis an gceist seo do shárú. Go deimhin ní á thógaint san ar an Aire atáim ná aon ní dá shórt.  Rud eile, an té a chaillfeadh misneach mar gheall ar dheacrachtaí níorbh fhiú mórán é.  Ba cheart dúinn gan bheith ag cur síos ar dheacrachtaí ró-mhór maidir le nithe den tsórt so.  Is fearr dul ceann ar aghaidh leis an mbeartas agus tabhairt fé na fadhbanna san do réir mar a éireoid.</P>
    <P>Ag cur an Bhille seo faoi bhráid na Dála do dhein an tAire tagairt don mheath a bhí tagaithe ar an nGaeltacht ó bhliain go bliain in ainneoin na n-iarrachtaí a deineadh leis na blianta chun teacht i gcabhair ar an nGaeltacht agus an oidhreacht uasal arsa atá inti a chaomhnadh.  Más fíor go bhfuil an <Col N="107" /> meath chomh mór is adeireann sé, agus is é mo thuairim ná fuil sé i bhfad ón gceart, is ábhar buartha é. Má tá líon na gcainteoirí Gaeilge sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht, fíor-thobar na teangan, ag dul i laghad do réir míle duine sa bhliain, ní ro-fhada go mbeidh deireadh léi mar Fhíor-Ghaeltacht.  Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh linn leis an iarracht atá á dhéanamh anois againn stop a chur leis an meath sin.  Mura n-éiríonn, caillfimid an oidhreacht is mó atá againn, an Ghaeilge agus an cultúr a ghabhann léi, na rudaí a thuig na Sasanaigh go maith a bhí mar chomharthaí sóirt againn, comharthaí náisiúnachais.</P>
    <P>Ag cur an Bhille seo i bhfeidhm nuair a bheidh sé ina Acht, is é mo thuairim gur ceart comhairlí paróiste a bhunú ins gach Gaeltacht d'fhonn go mbeidh liaison ceart idir an Roinn nua agus muintir na Gaeltachta.  Tá daoine ann den tuairim gur sa Ghaeltacht féin ba cheart Aireacht na Gaeltachta a bheith. Is ar éigin a bheadh an rath air sin mar scéim mar caithfidh an tAire a bheidh i bhfeighil na Gaeltachta a bheith i gcomhairle go minic leis na hAirí eile agus, ina theannta sin, ba dheacair lóistín d'fháil in aon chuid den Ghaeltacht do na Stáit-Sheirbhísígh a bheidh ag obair faoin Aire.  Ba léir, is dóigh liom, go mbeadh an tAire i gcomhairle leis an lucht ceannais ar na paróistí sa Ghaeltacht i dtaobh na scéimeanna a bheadh beartuithe acu ar leas na ndaoine.  Cloisimid a lán cainte i dtaobh comhairlí paróiste a ceaptar a bheadh oiriúnach sa tír amuich faoi choistí talmhaíochta.  Níl a fhios agam an mbeadh a leithéidí ag teastáil i ngnáth-shaol na ndaoine sa Ghalldacht ach bheidis tairbheach don nGaeltacht mar d'fhéadfadh baill na gcoistí a méar a chur ar na nithe a bheadh ag déanamh buartha do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus eolas a thabhairt d'Aire na Gaeltachta ina dtaobh.  Is mar sin, díreach, a bheadh ar chumas an Aire a fháil amach cad a bheadh ag titim amach sa Ghaeltacht ó lá go lá.</P>
    <P>I dteanta an mhéid áta ráite agam tá ceist feabhsuithe talún na Gaeltachta. Na daoine sin go bhfuil gabháltaisí beaga acu ba cheart, is dóigh liom, scéim éigin a bheith ann chun aol agus <Col N="108" /> leasú a thabhairt dóibh ar phraghsanna ísle agus chuige sin déarfainn gur mhaith an rud é dá mbeadh stór comhluchta nó rud éigin mar sin in aice na Gaeltachta nó ina lár chun go mbeadh na hearraí sin le fáil acu chomh maith le húirlisí na feirme agus mar sin de. Ní ceart ná ní cóir go mbeadh ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta, na Fíor-Ghaeltachta go mór-mhór, dul isteach sa bhaile mhór agus iad féin a chur i ngreim siopadóra éigin a fhéadfadh an phinginn dheireanach a bhaint díobh.  Rud tábhachtach is ea é sin, im thuairim agus iarraim ar an Aire machnamh a dhéanamh air.</P>
    <P>Anois cad faoi oideachas sa Ghaeltacht: mholfainn go dtógfaí gairm-scoileanna sa bhFíor-Ghaeltacht agus d'fhéadfaí buachaillí agus cailíní ón bhFíor-Ghaeltacht féin d'oiliúint chun bheith 'na dteagascóirí sna scoileanna sin.  Bheadh na scoileanna sin ina n-ionaid chun cultúr na Gaeltachta do chaomhnadh agus do scaipeadh.  D'fhéadfaí drámaíocht agus mar sin do chur ar siúl agus, i dteannta cultúr na Gaeltachta do chaomhnadh go hiomlán, ba mhaith an tarrac a bheadh sna cúrsaí sin do chuairteoirí a raghadh go dtí an Fhíor-Ghaeltacht chun feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge. Go deimhin, bheadh costas mór ag baint leis an mbeartas sin, mar do caithfí gairm-scoile do thógaint ins gach Gaeltacht acu i dtosach agus níos mó ná ceann i gcuid de na Gaeltachtaí ina dhiaidh sin, ach ní mór dúinn bheith ullamh, sásta airgead a chaitheamh má theastaíonn uainn aon bheartas gur fiú trácht air a chur chun críche sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá an-chuid rudaí den tsórt sin ba mhaith liom a chur faoi bhráid an tSeanaid, ach b'fhéidir nach é seo an t-am chun é sin a dhéanamh go mion. Nuair atá an Bille seo á achtú againn nílimid, mar adéarfá, ach ag tógaint an tí.  Nuair a bheidh an tigh tógtha againn féadfaimid a bheith ag cuimhneamh ina dhiaidh sin ar cad é an troscán a chuirfimid isteach ann, troscán a bheidh oiriúnach don tigh.</P>
    <P>Tá súil le Dia agam go mbeidh dea-thoradh ar ár saothar.  Tá deabhadh leis an saothar chun stop a chur leis an meath sa Ghaeltacht&mdash;stop a chur leis an imirce, an rud is mó a chuireann <Col N="109" /> buairt is brón ar éinne go bhfuil suim aige sa cheist mhór thábhachtach seo. Le linn don Teachta Ó Loingsigh bheith 'na Rúnaí Párlaiminte i bhfeighil na Gaeltachta dhein sé obair mhaith. Do bhí mar chuspóir aige dul timpeall go dtí na háiteanna sa Ghaeltacht inar dhóigh leis a gheobhadh sé eolas i dtaobh cad a bhí ag déanamh buartha don mhuintir iontu.  Níor tugadh aimsear a dhóthain dó chun na bearta crua do réiteach.  Dhein sé taighde an-mhór agus bhí scéimeanna áirithe aige ach ní raibh caoi aige ar iad a chur chun críche sar a dtáinig an t-athrú Rialtais.  Bhí beartaithe aige stáisiúin chun min éisc do dhéanamh rud a raghadh chun tairbhe na n-iascairí sa Ghaeltacht.  Bhí ar aigne aige feabhas a chur ar na calaithe sa Ghaeltacht ar mhaithe leis na hiascairí. Tá súil agam go leanfar den nós san agus go raghfar chun cainte leis na daoine sa Ghaeltacht ionus go bhfaghfar amach cad iad na fadhbanna is túisce is ceart tabhairt fúthu.  Is minic a gheobhfaí eolas air ó na daoine féin ná beadh le fáil ag an nduine a bheadh i bhfad uathu.  Ar aon chuma, tá a fhios ag an Aire go bhfuil na páirtithe go léir sa Dáil agus sa tSeanad taobh thiar de ins an iarracht atá á dhéanamh anois aige agus guibhimíd go léir rath Dé ar an obair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá bróon orm, ach níl mórán Gaeilge agam. Bhíos cuíosach mhaith ag an nGaeilge fadó, ach ós rud é nach mbíonn aon taithí agam anois, is deachair dom mé féin a chur in iúl go líofa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid the time is gone when I could seize upon most of what was said in a speech in Irish, and far less make very much of a coherent speech myself in Irish.  In my experience of this Seanad, I can think of three Senators who speak Irish by choice, and fluently.  I may be forgetting one or two perhaps, but three, or even five, out of 60 seems to me to represent a true picture of the view of our parliamentarians towards the language. I do not know what the proportion in the Dáil would be&mdash;I am prepared to hear from the Minister that it would be higher&mdash;but I cannot help feeling <Col N="110" /> that many of our politicians to-day feel that Irish is a good language to encourage other people to speak.</P>
    <P>It is with such thoughts in mind that I come to consider this setting up of a Department of the Gaeltacht for the laudable purpose of promoting &ldquo;the cultural, social and economic welfare&rdquo; of the Gaeltacht.  There is only one point in the text which I would criticise, and that, curiously enough, is in the Title.  I think we have far too many Acts of the Oireachtas, the Titles of which are not self-explanatory. I feel if we were to take this Title out of the blue and say: What do you think this deals with: &ldquo;Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill, 1956?&rdquo; it would be difficult to get an accurate guess.  I should like to see this called the &ldquo;Ministers and Secretaries Amendment, Department of the Gaeltacht Bill, 1956,&rdquo; in order that at least on the Statute Book we should see clearly just what it is that is involved.</P>
    <P>I speak on this subject with rather a divided mind because I have no doubt of the goodwill on the part of some, the good intentions which lie behind the framing of this measure and the ultimate implementation of it, but I cannot help feeling that this type of sectional legislation, legislation for a section of our country, may not be a good thing in itself, may not be defensible.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying there is no other Department of State whose work applies only to one part of the Republic.  I think you could make a case for a Ministry for Slum Clearance. I think it is one of the vital problems which beset our people in this capital city in particular.  It is felt, nevertheless, that this problem can be dealt with by the Minister for Local Government aided by the various corporations and so on.  It is also true to say that a great number of Departments already deal with the Gaeltacht; it is obvious that the Department of Education does so in many ways, both directly and indirectly, by subsidies, scholarships, various courses and so on.  I am not quite sure&mdash;and I do not think the Minister has made it clear to us&mdash;whether these subsidiary functions, <Col N="111" /> as it were, of the Department of Education are to be transferred to the Ministry for the Gaeltacht in the future, or whether all of the work of the Ministry for the Gaeltacht is to be new, initiating work.  I should like, perhaps, the Minister for Education, who is well situated to comment upon that, to tell us whether he intends any of the functions of the Department of Education in relation to the Irish language to be transferred, either immediately or ultimately, to the new Department.</P>
    <P>Other Departments&mdash;the Department of Lands, Fisheries, Industry and Commerce, the Land Commission and so on&mdash;all in one way or another have dealings with the Gaeltacht already.  I do not know whether these will all be co-ordinated, or only some of them, and, if so, which, under the new Ministry.  In other words, I have a doubt in my mind as to whether this is a sound way of tackling the problem, granted the goodwill and the good intention.</P>
    <P>I feel, and here I know I am speaking about things controversial, that Irish &ldquo;as a vernacular language&rdquo;, to use the phrase in sub-section (2) of Section 3, is fast disappearing by dilution.  The quality of the Irish spoken is being diluted by an unsatisfactory ersatz substitute.  I believe that Irish as a cultural heritage has been done harm, with the best intentions in the world, by the hope that it could ever again become a vernacular language for the whole country. Personally, I do not believe it can.  I believe, furthermore, that as a cultural heritage it could be best preserved by encouraging those who really love the language, not by endeavouring to goad into a half-hearted learning of it and half-hearted observance of it, those who are not led to it by any inner enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>I would say, furtherfore&mdash;perhaps the Minister agrees with me there, and I hope he does&mdash;that, if you really want to set about saving the language in the Gaeltacht, the basis must be economic. As long as for the poverty-stricken people of the Irish-speaking districts the key to increased money, increased <Col N="112" /> economic security, is the English language, as long as they cannot get a decent living in their own homes, in their own area, it will be folly to imagine that you can save the language or save them for Ireland.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that it is from these very districts that emigration to-day is greatest, and that there are areas on the western seaboard where, not merely is Irish disappearing, but the people themselves are disappearing.  That is the problem before us.  Now, the word &ldquo;economic&rdquo; is contained in sub-section (2) of Section 3.  It is part, at least, of the ministerial intention, but I believe that, unless that is tackled in a very firm and vigorous, well-planned way, any other attempt to save the language in the Gaeltacht is doomed, because it will fall before the economic forces.  The drive in the Gaeltacht towards English, and towards countries where English is spoken, is primarily economic.</P>
    <P>I do not want to strike too discouraging a note.  I speak of what I believe to be true.  It is quite obvious that a number of people will disagree with me, and do, but, if there is really an active intention on the part of the Government to do something to achieve something positive and good and well-organised by this new Gaeltacht Ministry, I would not feel inclined to oppose it.  I resist any temptation to feel that this may turn out to be, for all the good intentions, merely a piece of window-dressing, a sort of loud way of proclaiming that we intend to do something, when, in fact, very little positive, tangible result may become evident.</P>
    <P>I am inclined, therefore, to say that we ought at least to give this Bill a chance and to see what it is capable of producing.  Nevertheless, some doubts, I think, must be expressed.  I think I am right in saying that the Minister, shall I say, resisted, in the Dáil, any suggestion that the centre for the Ministry could be in the Gaeltacht.  I find it hard to believe that a Ministry for the Gaeltacht is best centred in Dublin.  I may be misinterpreting the Minister there.  It may be his intention, or the intention of the Government, <Col N="113" /> eventually to move the Department to Galway, or some such convenient place, but if that is not their intention, I am afraid I find it very hard to believe that a Department for the Gaeltacht could be best run from Dublin.  It is all very well to define the area of the Gaeltacht, but I suggest that, unless a real, active step is taken by transferring this Ministry, at least, to the Gaeltacht, the definitions on paper will not add up to very much.  It is all very well to say that the Department will be able to deal with the people of the Gaeltacht in Irish, to speak to them, to receive them and to write to them in Irish, and so on, but I fear that, if that writing and speaking is done from Dublin, the effect upon those people will be, not unnaturally, to arouse a certain amount of suspicion in their minds.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister for the Gaeltacht, in order really to do something for the Gaeltacht, must be prepared to go to the Gaeltacht, to remain there, to live there, to have his centre there, to have his Department there, and really actively to be concerned with the day-to-day problems as they arise.</P>
    <P>The next thing I want to say, I say without any intention of wounding the present Minister.  I did put a query to the Minister for Finance in another connection as to whether, in relation to this particular Ministry, it was intended to appoint a young and active Minister to the post.  I now understand the present Minister for Education intends temporarily to assume the double task of running the Department of Education and also the Department for the Gaeltacht.  The Minister did not tell us to-night about his intentions in that regard, or how long he intended to be a &ldquo;caretaker&rdquo;, as it were, for this new Ministry, but, when I say that I feel that a new and young Ministry deserves a younger Minister, I say it in no desire to cast a reflection on the present Minister, who, obviously, is still a very active man, and proves himself, from my own experience, to be at least an excellent stonewaller; but I think that he himself would be the first to recognise that the initiating stage of a new Ministry <Col N="114" /> would best be placed, other things being equal, in the hands of a younger man.  I say that without any intention of being personally offensive.</P>
    <P>I would say this&mdash;the present Minister for Education, as an example of the sort of thing I mean, is an excellent and fluent speaker of Irish; he speaks it a lot; he speaks it well; he lets very few occasions go by without taking the opportunity of speaking Irish, and yet, as Minister for Education, he has found it impossible to insist that, in the two big examinations conducted by the Department of Education, the Intermediate Certificate and the Leaving Certificate, there will be an oral examination in Irish.  I cite that as an example of the failure&mdash; I do not think that is too harsh a term &mdash;of a man who is an enthusiast, the failure of such a man to organise a new, rather obviously necessary thing, an oral test in a living language.</P>
    <P>Now that seems to me to be a symbol of much of the betrayal of the ideals of the language: to treat ministerially, in the Department of Education, the Irish language precisely like a dead language.  I do not believe you can encourage students to speak Irish if you are not prepared to examine them in their capacity to speak it.  If this Gaeltacht Ministry is really to do something new, it will have to be a little bolder than that.  It will have to show more imagination.  There will have to be a really fresh start, with real drive, and I believe that that can be done mainly for the genuine enthusiasts.  I do not believe you can do very much for those who are reluctant to adopt or maintain Irish as their daily language.</P>
    <P>I shall end, consequently, on a slightly pessimistic note.  I fear that not very much new will, in fact, be done by this Ministry.  My fear is that not a little money will be handed out, and that in five, ten or even 20 years' time there will not be, in fact, very much to show for it.</P>

      <P>Tá mé buíoch don tSeanadóir Éamonn Ó Cíosáin as ucht na fáilte a thug sé don mBille seo.  Chuir sé ceist orm i dtaobh <Col N="115" /> iascaireacht agus i dtaobh na rudaí go mbféidir a aistriú chun na Roinne seo. Más rud é go bhfuil aon tuairimí agam fé láthair faoi na rudaí sin b'fhearr liom gan iad a nochtadh go fóill mar támuid ag cur córas ar bun chun na ceisteanna sin go léir do scrudú agus chun moladh a dhéanamh fúthu don Rialtas.  Bíodh agus go mba mhaith liom roinnt áirithe rudaí do dhéanamh, b'fhearr liom cabhair d'fháil.  B'fhearr liom go mbéadh Rúnaí na Roinne ann chomb maith le daoine a bheadh ag obair i nDún na nGall, i nGaillimh agus i gCúige Mumhan mar, gan aon agó, beidh roinnt feidhmeannach i ngach ceann de na ceantair sin chun an obair do stiúriú agus do riaradh.  Ní bheidh an fhoireann an-mhór ach beidh daoine ann go bhfuil údarás agus tuiscint agus taithí acu ins na ceantair sin.  Is fearr iad san a thabhairt le chéile ar dtús sar a ndeintear aon rud chun aon chuid d'aon Roinn eile nó aon scéim eile do thabhairt isteach faoin Aireacht nua.  Bíodh sin mar atá, beidh siad ag tabhairt faoin obair sin chomh luath agus a raghaidh an Bille seo tríd an Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Senator Skeffington raised a number of questions.  I do not think it is necessary to go into them now.  There is an Irish saying: &ldquo;Ná tuig gach a gcloistear duit mar is mó bréag a ndéan gach toisg.&rdquo;  In English, it means: Do not understand everything you hear because it is many a lie that one deduction would make.  I would expand that to: Do not understand half the things you see, either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not care to think it was reasonable to suggest there was a complete failure with regard to the proper handling of, say, a language through the schools system, because, in an examination such as the Intermediate Certificate or the Leaving Certificate, there was not an oral examination in Irish.  I should like the Senator some time, when he feels in a light, kindergarten humour, and has a few boxes of matches in his pocket, to set out a scheme by which the number of children, boys and girls, going through the Intermediate Certificate and Leaving Certificate examinations would be orally examined in Irish&mdash;in an <Col N="116" /> examination which, so far as the Intermediate Certificate is concerned, at any rate, is, to some extent, a competitive examination so far as certain results from that examination are concerned. However, it is a very nice and interesting question.  Do not judge our ability to tackle jobs of any kind by the view that here is a Minister who failed to introduce an oral test in Irish in these examinations and what can you expect from him in any other line of life.</P>

      <P>May I just point to the French system, which I think is good, and which in their Baccalaureat, the rough equivalent of our Leaving Certificate, they have an oral examination for every living language, including French?  It involves hundreds of thousands of students.  If they can do it, we can.  Proportionately, the problem is the same.</P>

      <P>If the Senator could understand the extent to which the Department of Education in this country is put to the pin of its collar to provide examiners for the Intermediate and Leaving Certificates, as these examinations stand, he would understand that there might be a little additional difficulty and that if we had to undertake an oral examination it might be the last straw that would break the camel's back.  It has been very substantially and very carefully considered, with a very considerable amount of seeking for advice.  While I suffer from the fears of a breakdown of the examination system for the Intermediate and Leaving Certificates, under the strain to which it is subject at present, I am not going to consider in any kind of a practical way&mdash;it has already been considered in a very practical way&mdash;an oral examination in Irish in these two examinations.  However, that is a bit of a digression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I say with regard to not making deductions would apply, I think, to some other parts of Senator Sheehy Skeffington's remarks.  I feel there is a very considerable appreciation on the part of a lot of people who do not make any attempt to speak Irish of what Irish means to the country and there are very many things <Col N="117" /> affecting people's lives to-day under the present strains and stresses that make it very easy for them to turn away from keeping their Irish polished up.  On the other hand, there is throughout the country, from one end to the other, a very considerable knowledge of the language that is like a banked-up turf fire that just requires a gentle wind to blow it to a flame and to have a very healthy warmth.</P>
    <P>The Senator suggests that the economic approach to the Gaeltacht is the thing that will save the language.  I hope there will be a profitable and helpful economic approach to the work of these districts, but it will want more than that.  A lot more than that will be done in calling back the people of districts that have gone through very distressing and very poor times to the great heritage that is theirs.  They speak a language that has been the language of the literature of their race from the very earliest of times and they carry in their minds and hearts a very substantial portion of a traditionally handed-on literature.  The economic side will be dealt with in the best way we can, but our hopes are high enough in relation to the well-being of the people in these districts, their capacity to hold on to and develop a <Col N="118" /> free and happy life there and to maintain their language.  Thus, our hope in that matter is sufficiently strong to be able to bear quite readily a little challenge and a little expression of want of faith in what we may or may not do.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Senator that there is no window dressing in this.  What people may say in regard to the language expresses what it means to them.  There is very little window dressing.  There may be an odd bit of buailim sciath, but, when people speak of the language, they speak of something they sincerely believe in.  I think that if, like this Bill, the people who talk about the language were given the charity of the chance which the Senator speaks about, we would all find the influence of our national culture on the general life of all classes of the people and their freedoms very much increased and mellowed throughout the country as a whole.</P>
