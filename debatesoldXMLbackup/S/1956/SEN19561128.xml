    <Title>Pensions (Increase) Bill, 1956&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>The pension increases which I announced in this year's Budget are given statutory force and effect by this Bill, which contains the detailed legislative provisions to regulate the grant and payment of the increases.</P>
      <P>The pensions to be increased under the Bill, namely, civil pensions payable from the Exchequer or from other public funds, including the funds of local authorities, are described in the Schedule to the Bill.  Parts I and II of the Schedule contain pensions payable from the Exchequer and from certain statutory funds to retired civil servants, teachers, etc., to members of the judiciary and to the widows and children of former Ministers and holders of parliamentary offices.  Parts III and IV of the Schedule specify the pensions payable to former employees of local authorities and harbour authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These pensions will be increased under the provisions of Section 2 of the Bill by sums ranging from 15 per cent. on pensions under £100 a year to 6 per cent. on pensions over £450 a year.  With a few exceptions, to which I shall refer presently, the increases are payable only where the service in respect of which the pension was granted ended before the effective date of the 1952 pay increases.  These pay increases were granted to most classes with effect from 1st November, 1952; where this is not the case, the appropriate date in 1952-53 is prescribed or can be determined under <Col N="1159" /> the Bill.  This alternative date will in no case be later than the 6th April, 1953.  In referring to the 1st November, 1952, therefore, I should like to be understood as referring equally to the alternative date prescribed or determined under the Bill for a particular class or classes.</P>
    <P>An exception to this rule is made for pensions payable at fixed rates which were not altered or affected by the 1952 pay increases.  Most of the pensions to widows and children which are listed in Part II of the Schedule to the Bill are of this type.  In such cases the appropriate increase under the Bill will be added to all pensions, including pensions to be granted in future, thus operating as a general revision of the existing rates of pensions which were fixed prior to 1952.  A second exception is made for cases where, although retirement took place after the 1st November, 1952, the pension was calculated on average salary over a three-year period which began before the 1st November, 1952, and was, therefore, derived partly from receipts at the lower salary rates in force prior to that date.  Under Section 7 of the Bill a modified increase proportionate to that part of the three years which fell before the 1st November, 1952, is allowed in such cases.  Parts III and IV of the Schedule to the Bill will permit of a similar concession to local authority and harbour authority pensioners.</P>
    <P>As no pension calculated wholly on the increased rates of salary introduced on 1st November, 1952, may be increased under the Bill, so no pension may be increased beyond the amount which would be payable to a colleague of identical rank and service who retired on the 1st November, 1952, and whose pension was calculated wholly by reference to the higher salary rates introduced on that date.  Provision for this overriding maximum has accordingly been made in Sections 3, 4 and 7 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1951, the remuneration of the higher posts in the Civil Service, and of some higher posts elsewhere, was affected by a restriction known as <Col N="1160" /> the super-cut, which originated in 1921 as a reduction in the cost-of-living bonus on the higher Civil Service salaries.  The effects of the super-cut persisted in the consolidated salary rates which replaced the former system of basic salary and bonus from 1946 onwards until it was removed partially in 1948 and completely in January, 1951.</P>
    <P>Officers who retired while the super-cut was in force are, however, still in receipt of pensions based on the lower salaries.  When this Bill was in course of preparation, it was found that a revision of these pensions to remove the effects of the supercut would not cost appreciably more than the grant of the appropriate percentage increases under the Bill.  I decided, therefore, in view of the representations which had been made from time to time by and on behalf of these pensioners, to allow them to take their pension increase either in the form of a remission of the supercut reduction, or the appropriate percentage increase, whichever is more favourable.  Provision has been made accordingly in sub-section (4) of Section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Other sections of the Bill provide for the treatment of double pensions and for the application to the pension as increased of any statutory provisions applicable to the original pension.  Sub-section (5) of Section 10 provides that any increase under the Bill shall not be assessed as means for the purpose of an old age pension or a widow's non-contributory pension.  Section 8 provides that the increases shall be payable on and from the 1st August, 1956, or from the date on which the pension itself commenced if this is later.  Payment of the increases to Exchequer pensioners has already commenced under the authority of a Supplementary Estimate passed by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 empower local authorities and harbour authorities to increase the pensions payable by them subject to ministerial approval.  The increases allowed will be similar in amount and will be generally subject to the conditions and limitations governing increases in Exchequer pensions. The total cost of the Bill to the <Col N="1161" /> Exchequer is estimated at £140,000 in a full year.  Increases in Army pensions and Army retired pay, for which separate legislation is being prepared, will bring the total cost to the Exchequer of pension increases up to the Budget provision of £180,000 a year.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House for its approval.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo mar is iarracht é chun scéal na Stát-phinsinéirí agus pinsinéirí údarás áitiúla a leigheas. Bíodh go bhfuil iarracht á dhéanamh chun na téarmaí a leigheas do na daoine sin, is dócha go mbeidh daoine fós ann go mbeidh cúis ghearáin acu mar tá fhios againn go léir nach furas na daoine go léir a shásamh i gcúrsaí den tsórt seo.  Níl fhios agam conas a thuit sé amach, i gcás pinsin a mhéadú ó am go ham, go ndéantar é do chuid do na daoine anois agus ansin go ndéantar é do chuid eile acu tar éis tamaill, agus mar sin de.  Bheadh sé i bhfad níos fearr na Stát-phinsinéirí agus na pinsinéirí údarás áitiúla go léir a thógaint le chéile i dtreo go mbeadh an peictíúr ar fad romhainn.  Ní furas comparáid a dhéanamh eatarthu nuair ná bíonn an pictiúr go léir romhainn in aon iarracht amháin.</P>
      <P>I welcome these provisions because they are a genuine attempt to improve the lot of State and local authority pensioners.  That, indeed, is to be expected, so as to offset, to some extent, the steep increase that has occurred in the cost of living during the past few years.  We all know that the provisions of this Bill will not by any means compensate these people for the said increase in the cost of living, particularly for the increase that has taken place over a period of, say, 15 or 16 years but more especially the increase that has taken place over the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I briefly mentioned in my opening remarks in Irish, it would be far better, when considering this question of pension increases for those people who are in receipt of pensions from the State and from local authorities, if they were all brought up together whenever a scheme for increases is being considered by the Government. <Col N="1162" /> For instance, reference was made in the Dáil to the case of the Old I.R.A. I do not propose to enlarge on what was said in that House.  I think we should go down on record in the Seanad as saying, however, that we are rather surprised that the Old I.R.A. who are in receipt of military service pensions and those members of the Old I.R.A. who are in receipt of disability pensions are not included in the provisions of this measure.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister's reply to that point in the Dáil was that these people got some increase in their pensions a few years ago.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us if the increase which the members of the Old I.R.A. got is on all-fours with the increases being given now to State and local authority pensioners who are covered by this measure.  I hold that, when a comparison is drawn between the pensioners belonging to the Old I.R.A. Association and the people covered by this Bill, the scales are weighted against the members of the Old I.R.A. who are recipients of pensions from the State.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give that matter further consideration, because if there is any section of the community that deserves every consideration and sympathy from the members of this House, and of the Dáil, it is those people who gave their services so that the freedom of this country could be realised, as it has been realised.  The Minister referred to what he called the super-cut remission. This is a rather involved matter and I do not propose to deal with it at any length, but from what I can gather, while the Minister has gone some way towards meeting the claims of civil servants, there is still a grievance left as far as some civil servants are concerned.</P>
    <P>The super-cut was devised and introduced by the British Treasury in 1921, whereby the cost-of-living bonus was reduced for higher grade civil servants. As the Minister for Finance said on the 14th instant, its effects persisted in the salary structure until it was completely removed for serving officers by our own Government in 1951. Officers who retired while the super-cut <Col N="1163" /> was in force are still in receipt of pensions based on the lower salaries. Section 3, sub-section (4), removes this grievance and those who will benefit are very grateful to the Minister, no doubt, but his method of granting the concession as an alternative, means that more than one half of the people concerned will receive no benefit from the super-cut remission.  I should like to hear the Minister on that point again when he is replying.</P>
    <P>All of these pensioners retired prior to 1951 and some of them retired in the early 1940s.  Up to this, they have received no compensation for the substantial devaluation of money that has since taken place.  Everybody knows that there has been a substantial devaluation of money since then.  Logically, they are entitled to the 6 per cent. increase in addition to the super-cut being removed which only put their basic pensions right.  I understand there are only 150 people concerned in this and the amount of money involved would not be very great.  It would be far better if the Minister would give further consideration to that point in order to remove whatever grievance there is.</P>
    <P>This is not a Bill which lends itself to a long Second Reading discussion. It is more of a Committee Bill and I am wondering if it is possible to submit amendments to it.</P>

      <P>I want simply to follow Senator Kissane on one point and to bear out what he says about the adjustment effected by Section 3, sub-section (4), regarding the super-cut. These civil servants do not amount to many in number and most of them are rather elderly.  It seems to me that, when the Minister is making general adjustments, it would be a pity if there should be any small grievance left amongst a very worthy class of people. If these people had a grievance under the super-cut which was imposed in the early 20's, that has been removed to some extent by the raising of their <Col N="1164" /> salaries.  It seems to me that they have a right to some compensation for the change which has taken place since the super-cut was abolished.  They had one grievance which was removed by the Government, but now they have another grievance in its place.  Their number is small and the amount of money involved is not very great.  I would ask the Minister to consider if it would be possible to give to this very small class of people the restoration of the super-cut, plus the appropriate increase in pension based on the salary with the super-cut restored.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody in either House will oppose the Government when they set about making adjustments in certain pensions of public servants as a result of the increased cost of living.  It is regrettable, however, that pensions of retired civil servants, or employees of the State, have to be adjusted in this way as a result of the increased cost of living.  Firstly in making these adjustments, there is quite a considerable time lag between the time when the people living on the pensions feel the effect of the increased cost of living and the time when appropriate legislation comes into effect and increases their pensions.  Secondly, the Minister for Finance, like any other Minister in his position in these days, has to be governed in the adjustments he makes in the pensions by the amount of money he has available rather than by the cost-of-living index. It should be possible to relate pensions to the cost of living so that when the cost of living increases an automatic adjustment of pensions will take place, as is the practice in other countries.  I think that when the Minister for Finance is framing his Budget, or preparing whatever legislation he may have during the year, that vitally affects the economic position of the country, he should be in a position not only to consider wages and salaries, but to consider pensions at the same time.  It is most undignified that some groups of people should be obliged to wait for a different series of Bills to be brought before these Houses and to be passed before they can have the adjustment in their <Col N="1165" /> pensions to which they are perfectly entitled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a word on this topic of the super-cut. I should like to congratulate the Minister very heartily on facing this problem and meeting it.  I know from my own experience that there has been a strong sense of grievance on this matter and I think it was the duty of the State to meet these people for one very good reason.  The people who were suffering from the effects of the super-cut were the oldest generation of civil servants in this State.  They were the people who came in here in 1922 to help the Irish Government to run the new State.  Some of them were Irish people who came from good appointments in the English Civil Service to take up appointments in the new independent Irish State.  They gave very good service.  I think everyone would agree that a great deal of the good work done in the early years of the Free State was due to the experience and wisdom of those civil servants.</P>
      <P>It was a very bitter thing to them that they particularly should be at a disadvantage owing to the action of the super-cut.  It was particularly bitter to them when they remembered that this super-cut was an injudicious attempt at economy by the Lloyd George Government in England.  Its history is a complicated one, but it is generally agreed now that that measure was put through rashly and in its effect was bad.  The result was that this group of men, all nearly 70, were suffering under Irish law in a way in which the later generations of civil servants in this country did not suffer. I do very heartily congratulate the Minister on tackling this problem.  I know it has been an irritation to Ministers for Finance for a long time.  I hope it will no longer be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to have reassurance from the Minister on one point: does this provision in Section 3 (4) leave any of those older civil servants suffering under a grievance?  He, I am sure, knows their position; he has gone into it.  Is what Senator Kissane has suggested true, that some of them will still be suffering from a disability in <Col N="1166" /> comparison with more recent civil servants in the State?  If it is true, it is most regrettable.  I repeat that we in this Parliament to-day owe a very great deal to that senior body of civil servants who rallied around the Free State in the 1920s; and if they are in any way at a disadvantage in comparison with the civil servants of the 1930s and 1940s, it is our bounden duty to see that that disadvantage is removed.  I hope the Minister will be able to reassure us on that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the great welcome this Bill is receiving here, I wonder would it be right or proper, or, should I say, courageous if some Senator were to give his opinion on pensions in general and what the people outside the gates of Leinster House think about the amount of money that is distributed every year not alone by this Government but by its predecessor and every other Government.  While it may be said that officials after long years of service in the Civil Service or other Government employment are entitled to certain pension rights, they have one advantage over people who are not employed by the State.  The person who is employed by the State has security.  He has a steady weekly or monthly income, whereas the person outside Government employment, whatever occupation he follows, must, if you like, chance his arm from one week and from one month to another.  Everything cannot be guaranteed for him from one year to another.  Therefore, when we come to examine the question of the pensions being paid to civil servants generally and compare their position with that of people who have to make a living in their own way, we often wonder, as the people outside wonder, are the Government over the past number of years showering too many bouquets on the people who are employed by the State and by the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a sum of something like £140,000 involved here.  I will admit that when civil servants who retired after 1953 received increased pensions, those who retired before that are also entitled to increases.  That is all very fine, but with the position the country is in at the present day, with all the <Col N="1167" /> shouting for increased production, increased economy, and so on, and with the mounting volume of unemployment and emigration, those people, whether they retired before or after 1953, could afford to tighten their belts.  There would not be one bit more harm done if they had to tighten their belts than will be done to the 15,000 or 16,000 who have to tighten their belts to ease the hunger they must endure, having nothing at all but the meagre dole or unemployment assistance to get.  If this £140,000 were used next Christmas for the purpose of giving even one week's work to some of those necessitous people in and around this city, it would give 14,000 people £10 a week to enable them to have a good Christmas dinner for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>Of all the members of the Dáil and Seanad, I suppose I will be the only person to criticise this measure.  It does not cost me a thought whether I offend the Minister or anybody else because I am speaking as I hear people talking.  We can judge the amount of concern the people outside have for this House and Dáil Éireann from the fact that in a recent byelection only 38 per cent. of them cast their votes.  It is very little use to the unemployed person to read in tomorrow's newspaper that a district justice or a highly paid civil servant has got a 6 per cent. or a 15 per cent. increase in his pension.  All he has to look forward to is drawing £2 or £3 unemployment assistance.  He cannot get any increase and he cannot get work, even though he is anxious for it.</P>
    <P>The same position exists down the country where there is a scarcity of employment as has always been the case.  I wonder what will be the reaction among the people of Mayo when a proposal comes before the Mayo County Council for increased pensions for retiring officials, some of whom to my own knowledge were wealthy enough to buy out half the people in their parish.  Even though the contribution for these increased pensions will amount perhaps to only one-tenth of a penny, the people will be questioning the granting of such an <Col N="1168" /> increase.  These are the things people will talk about and the things people will wish me to refer to, no matter how unpopular they may be.</P>
    <P>As regards the increased cost of living, as far as the agricultural community is concerned, they cannot be blamed for the increase.  Take live stock or beef.  It has dropped from £9 a cwt. to £4 5s. and £4 10s. over the past 18 months, a 50 per cent. decrease in the most essential part of the cost of living.  The same thing applies to bacon.  It has dropped in the past week by 18/- to 20/- a cwt.</P>
    <P>When we turn to that commodity which is always looked forward to at Christmas time, the turkey for the Christmas dinner, in any market throughout the country, you can pick and choose from a thousand turkeys at a price from 9d. to 1/9 per lb.  I should like somebody to explain to me what is the cause of the increase in the cost of living.  Is it being paraded too much by a certain group of people to get concessions from the Government? In Dublin, very few commodities have increased at all.  The ordinary articles of clothing can be bought as cheaply as ten years ago, but somehow the cost of living seems to be increasing continuously and to offset that the Government is granting money to people who have been in secure employment all the time, people who when they go out on pension are being made extra secure in their pensions.  I may be unpopular for saying this and I may bring down the wrath of everybody in this House on my head, but that does not cause me a great deal of worry.  I can assure the Minister that when this matter comes before the Mayo County Council and when we have to approve of any little increase for people entitled to pensions, I will oppose it and bring every single influence I can to bear against it, with local councillors because I do not believe it is right and proper that continued increases in pensions and allowances should be given to anybody, particularly when there are 70,000 to 80,000 unemployed and emigration is now at a rate unprecedented since the time of the Famine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like <Col N="1169" /> to join with those Senators who have welcomed the Bill.  I think it is a Bill that serves as a basis and a framework within which we can do justice to people who all too often are forgotten, the pensioners, those who are no longer at work, those who no longer have within their grasp anything resembling the strike weapon.  One distinction between the worker at present employed and the worker unemployed, either active unemployed or retired, is that the worker in employment can at least resort to the withdrawal of his labour in order to get justice for his demands, and to have justice done to satisfy the demands that living conditions make upon him; whereas the pensioner, of course, has no such weapon and can only appeal, plead and try to persuade.  I think it is an excellent thing and one should not cavil too much, though I am afraid I am going to proceed to do it, to see a Minister recognising the existence of this body of people, recognising their hard lot, and being prepared to bear the brunt of the wrath of Senator Commons and others when he ventures to propose that these pensions should be increased.  I might say now that I think Senator Commons is under a misapprehension, for two reasons.  The obvious misapprehension is that he apparently thinks the cost of living is dropping.  He says that in his part of the world, the people on his county council generally agree with that.  I could not help wondering is his part of the world full up, because it would be a pleasant part of the world to move to and live in, while all round us in every part of Ireland the cost of living is visibly increasing and has steadily increased for the past 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">

      <P>Will the Senator admit that the cost of food is dropping?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of some foods is dropping, but many of them are luxury foods in the homes of pensioners.  It might be a normal thing for people to have beef and bacon, but some of these pensioners living on pensions of less than £100 a year do not see quite so much of this &ldquo;cheap food,&rdquo; such as beef, as we should like them to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1170" /> The other misapprehension under which Senator Commons laboured is that he seems to think these people are pretty well off, but there is a whole category of these pensioners getting less than £100 a year pension, some even only £70 and £80 a year, or 30/- a week.  If they have pensions at that rate.  I do not think he can hold that such a measure as this is over-generous to them.</P>
    <P>Other Senators have spoken, and I would identify myself with them in asking the Minister for more generous terms.  In the Seanad, we stand up and ask for more generosity, but we have no power to demand it.  We can vote for recommendations in regard to this Bill, providing they do not put an increased charge on the Exchequer, and therefore in practice our power here is pretty well reduced on Money Bills to that of the pensioner&mdash;we can but plead and attempt to persuade.  We cannot pass a recommendation that would increase State expenditure. Therefore I should like to associate myself with those Senators who are appealing to the Minister, under the terms of this Bill, to be a little more generous.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I differ in our attitude towards pensions.  I would hope that some Senators at least would agree with me when I hold that a pension is part of the salary, and is a right.  It is frequently contributed to by the worker, and is not in any sense a charitable donation given to the worker by the employer.  It is part of the salary, if you like, set aside, surrendered and given up during working years for the comfort of the years after work.</P>
    <P>Senator Kissane mentioned the rising cost of living, and he referred to the past 15 or 16 years and to the more immediate past.  It is a fact, of course, that, between 1934 and 1947, the cost-of-living index figure more than doubled.  In 1934, it was 152, and in 1947, it was 319, both of these figures calculated on the basis of 100 in 1914, so that between 1934 and 1947, the cost of living more than doubled.  In 1947 it was felt that we had better get a new base on which to calculate, and we started off again with the base <Col N="1171" /> 100 in 1947.  We find that that was maintained for a year or two, but, by 1953, it was up again to 125 and the latest figure is something in the neighbourhood of 134.  You have the rise from 100 in 1947, which in itself represented a rise since 1934 of more than 100 per cent., and you have the rise since 1947 of more than 34 per cent. again.</P>
    <P>It is against that background that we should ask ourselves is this Bill sufficient, or are its terms sufficiently generous to cope with the situation in which, since 1947, not so very long ago, there has been a rise in the cost-of-living index figure&mdash;which I would suggest is a conservative figure of some 34 per cent?  It used to be considered sufficient to pay a member of our Parliament, a T.D., £360 a year.  It was felt then that this was enough, but I would suggest that to meet the rising cost of living since those days, it would not be considered enough to add 6 per cent. to that £360, or even 15 per cent., or perhaps even 30 per cent.  I think the same would apply to the salaries paid to Senators, and I should feel happier if we were able to grant to pensioners something more related to what is felt to be necessary for workers and even parliamentary representatives in order that they may cope with the rise in the cost of living in the past 15 to 20 years.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that the total estimated amount to be paid out from the Exchequer funds for this Bill will be £140,000 per year.  Senator Commons said that it would be much better to give a week's employment to our 70,000 unemployed with this money and let them have a good Christmas dinner, but you will note he considers it necessary to pay them £10 per week.  He automatically thought of the figure of £10 per week as being necessary to maintain life for the unemployed man, but some of these pensioners are getting only 30/- a week.  Therefore, I would reject the suggestion that the money would be better paid even to the unemployed, for whom I regret to say we are not doing what we might.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister <Col N="1172" /> has a figure, or whether he could give an approximate estimate of how many pensioners will benefit by this Bill.  He has told us there will be a supplementary Bill or measure of some kind brought in, which will cost another £40,000, dealing with Army and other pensions, but in relation to this Bill, I should be glad if the Minister could give us an approximate figure as to how many beneficiaries under the Bill there are likely to be.  If I were forced to guess how many people would benefit by this, I should be inclined to say something like 7,000 people or possibly a little more&mdash;perhaps 10,000 people or something like that.</P>

      <P>I am afraid my figure was a lucky guess.  It does not derive from any special knowledge, but you can see that, on the figures, these people must get an average of about £20 each, which, divided into £140,000, gives 7,000.  My guess that the amount of benefit to be got by each pensioner, an average of £20 each, appears to be an accurate one. What difference does the Seanad think this increase is going to make to some of these people?  I noticed that the people for whom there has been some concern expressed already, in the upper group, those getting a pension of £450 or more, are to be allowed 6 <Col N="1173" /> per cent. which is about £25 per annum of an increase.  They will get an increase of 9/8 a week!</P>
      <P>It does not, I am sorry to say, seem to me to be an enormous advantage to grant them that, but it is something. It is a gift horse and perhaps the people to whom it is being presented might not like to look at its teeth.  It is not being presented to me, however, or to us in the Seanad.  I think, therefore, that we are entitled to look this particular gift horse in the teeth, and judge whether it is as good a nag as it is held out to be, as it is praised, by its sponsors.  Are we entitled to accept the phrases used by Senator Commons that we are &ldquo;showering bouquets&rdquo; upon people when we give them an extra 9/8 a week, or give an increase of a pension of £15 per year to those with 30/- a week?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>The fellow with £400 a year getting an extra 9/8 a week is not exactly being weighed down with additional riches.  You may argue, of course, that £400 a year is too much for anybody to get, in which case I would assume that a measure would be brought in fairly soon by Senators to reduce their own salaries, and, since, as members of the Seanad, we have the benefit of getting not only £400 a year but getting it tax free, I think we should go a little bit more gently when we talk of the colossally rich people who get £400 a year or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, my view is that this Bill provides a good basis.  We must salute the initiative of the Government and the Minister for introducing such a Bill and their recognition of the need to do something more for these people, but I think we must express a strong regret that it has not been found possible to do more for these 6,800 people than to give them 15/- extra, or 9/8 a week in the case of the upper income group.  I would strongly urge the Minister, consequently, to consider whether or not it is possible, even within the terms of the present Budget, to do just a bit more for <Col N="1174" /> people whose need is a crying one, in view of the rising cost of living which has been rising consistently over the past 20 or 30 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been welcomed by sections on both sides of the House and I should like to join in expressing appreciation of it.  The Bill provides for increases in certain pensions of former State servants, and I think it includes former members of the Garda Síochána and their widows. It is in connection with the latter category that I should like to put one or two questions to the Minister, to see whether one or two injustices which have existed for some time could possibly be remedied in this Bill by means of an amendment.</P>
      <P>Garda widows are divided into two categories&mdash;the widows of members of the Garda Síochána and former members of the D.M.P.  The second category embraces widows of former members of the D.M.P. retired under Article 10 of the 1921 Treaty.  The grant of a pension to these latter widows was subject to a means test, with the result that some of these widows were awarded reduced pensions as compared with the widows of the ordinary members of the Garda Síochána.  There are a few others who have not been awarded any pension at all.</P>
      <P>In these few cases, it happened that the policemen on retirement had established a little business.  By the process of thrift and economy, they had sufficient money to enable them to purchase a house.  This thrift and economy has now operated to their disadvantage and has disentitled their widows to pension rights.  Had these members of the old D.M.P. dissipated their savings, the case would have been quite otherwise. There are only very few of those left and the saving to the Exchequer effected by this type of retrenchment cannot at most be more than a few hundred pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister review these cases, in particular the cases of the widows who receive no pensions, and see whether some form of pension could be granted to them, either by amendment of the present Bill or by <Col N="1175" /> some provisions in the Bill which is to be introduced in the future?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister explained the adjustment in the salaries paid to the higher grades of the Civil Service in 1921 and the cut imposed at that time by the British Ministry.  The Government recognised the injustice of that super-cut and, in 1951, removed the anomaly.  I should like to point out that clearly there must have been an appreciable number of civil servants retired while that super-cut was in force.  I believe that the position in regard to their pensions up to now has been that their pension is still based on the lower level, prior to the removal of the anomaly to which I referred in 1951.  The Minister has now explained that Section 3 removes this grievance. Like other Senators, I welcome his support of this Bill and its introduction, but I understand that the concession now provided for in the Bill is being granted only by way of an alternative&mdash;the alternative being the difference between 6 per cent. and the amount of the cost-of-living adjustment, whichever is the greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It strikes me that obviously we have two categories of people here.  I would point out that if it is just to remove an anomaly for those pensioners who have retired since 1951, it is equally just to remove the anomaly for those officers who retired prior to that date and who still suffer by a lower level of pension based on the then lower level of salaries.  I understand that the number of such people is very small, about 150 and I submit that in their cases justice ought now be done by permitting them the benefit, not of an alternative but of the two adjustments, so to speak, while this measure is going through.  I believe we have already recognised and admitted that these people have a just claim.  Their case calls for some further consideration by the Minister before the Bill leaves this House.  Consequently, I appeal to him to have a further look at that aspect of the matter on behalf of that small section of the community. The cost would be only a very small proportion of the £140,000.  We ought <Col N="1176" /> to do the job properly and sweep the floor clean.</P>

      <P>As Senator Kissane has intimated, we on this side of the House approve of this Bill.  However, along with most Deputies who spoke on this measure in the Dáil and with most Senators who have spoken on it here, I am disappointed that no provision has been made for at least the lower pensions of Old I.R.A. men.</P>
      <P>An appeal was made to the Minister in the Dáil to include, if at all possible, Sections B and D of the Service Pensions Act.  No indication is given in the Minister's statement to-day that any of them will be included.  However, the Minister did say that legislation is being prepared with regard to an increase in Army pensions.  I should like him to let us know if that legislation will include Old I.R.A. service and disability pensions under the heading of Army pensions.  I join with other Senators in making this appeal.  Even though those people did get a slight increase in their pensions in 1953, a lot has happened since then which necessitates further consideration for them now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of us, not merely in the Dáil but also in this House, are anxious, when a Bill of this nature comes before us, to stress the pleasant side of the picture&mdash;the paying out of the additional funds involved. It does not, however, only mean that there is that side to be considered. One must consider in addition, the other side of the measure&mdash; the necessity to collect the funds that have to be paid out.  No matter how much I should like to answer any appeal that might be made to me on this Bill, I am afraid it is my duty to make it absolutely clear that under no circumstances whatsoever can I exceed in any way the provision I set aside in the Budget for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators no doubt saw references I made, when speaking on Saturday night last, to the manner in which international events had affected revenue.  It would be manifestly impossible for me adequately to perform my duty as custodian of the public purse, in the circumstances to which I referred then, to accept any further <Col N="1177" /> burden on the Exchequer than the burden of payment that I indicated would be available when I introduced the Budget.  I am afraid, therefore, I must regretfully refrain from acting on any of the advice tendered to me by members of the House to ease the position as they saw it in one or other respects.</P>
    <P>I do not quite understand Senator Kissane's point when he said that local authority and State pensions should all be dealt with together.  I do not imagine the Senator would feel that the Government, as such, should issue directions to local authorities.  I imagine the Senator would agree with me that, in so far as local authorities conduct their own affairs and conduct them satisfactorily, they should be allowed to do so, and the question of whether variations are made in pensions of persons formerly employed by local authorities is, therefore, a matter for the local authority.  The State may come into it from the point of view that it may, in consequence of an increase, have to pay an increased grant contribution in respect of one or other of the grants that are paid from Central Funds to the funds of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Most of the discussion turned round the super-cut.  In relation to that and, indeed, in relation to all pensions, I think one must appreciate that it has always been the pattern here that the rate of pension paid to any person&mdash; not merely in the State service but outside, as well&mdash;is directly related to the salary which the person concerned receives on the last day of his working career.  That has always been the principle and that is the principle in the State Superannuation Acts.  Acts or Bills such as this Bill are, in fact, going beyond the liability when one bears that principle in mind because of the special circumstances that may exist when the value of money has fallen.  However, the principle remains the principle of our whole superannuation code and, as far as anyone can see, must remain the principle for the future.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that less than half those who were affected by the super-cut will receive the benefit under <Col N="1178" /> this Bill under Section 3, sub-section 4. My information is to the contrary, that many more than half will find that the optional provisions given there can be taken to their advantage by asking that the super-cut removal be carried through.  I made it clear when I was introducing the Bill that the Bill is framed on the basis that those people are entitled to take whichever of the two alternatives they wish and in that way they will be enabled to take a greater sum than they would take, if they were restricted purely to the pension, to the increase provided for civil servants who retired from the service after the super-cut was abolished in January, 1951.</P>
    <P>Senator Kissane asked me a specific question as to whether this body of people or any other body thought that they still had a grievance in relation to pensions.  I am afraid I have yet to meet the people who have no grievance about anything.  Certainly it would be a pleasant task for a Minister for Finance or any Minister if there were people who felt that they had no grievance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just about to go into that.  It is an undoubted fact that claims for more than is provided for in this Bill were put forward, but it is equally undoubted, and must be accepted, that the provisions in the Bill are a fair compromise between those claims that were put forward and the availability of resurces and the difficulties of those people who have to contribute accordingly in that way. Senator Commons, I think, painted an exaggerated picture in certain respects. I do not think, however, that on this Bill I would be justified in speaking at any length either on the question of employment or the question of the cost of living.  I do not propose, therefore, to go into the matters he has raised on either of those subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I understand Senator Douglas, his complaint is that the widows of the D.M.P. who retired under Article 10 of the Treaty did not get a pension, except by being subjected to a means test.  I am afraid that on that subject I must say something that is, perhaps, <Col N="1179" /> a little harsh, but I think it has to be said.  People who retired under Article 10 of the Treaty elected as they were entitled to do, to leave the service of the State.  They decided they would take the compensation offered to them under that Article and I think that, when they did so, when they made their own option, so to speak, and elected not to serve the State, there is not the same obligation on the State to deal with them as there would be with those who decided that they would continue to work for the State subsequent to 1922.  It is quite true, as the Senator says, that there are cases where a widow of a Dublin Metropolitan policeman, who retired under Article 10, would not get any pension because of a means test, but I am afraid I would not be justified, having regard to the manner in which their husbands took all that they could get and left the force to better themselves, in introducing any additional provision on this question.  Many of the points that were made&mdash;and I can understand it&mdash;suggested that there might be a greater Exchequer contribution but there cannot be particularly in present circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can perhaps best approach explaining the need for this Bill by giving some brief historical material regarding the creation of the Irish Civil Service. Following the transfer of functions the new State found itself in possession of a Civil Service consisting of persons taken over from the old Dáil service and of civil servants transferred from the British Civil Service. Shortly afterwards a statutory basis for the Irish Civil Service was provided by the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.</P>
      <P>To a considerable extent the departmental rules, practice and procedure, especially those affecting control and discipline, which had obtained in British Government Departments were carried into their Irish counterparts and, with minor adjustments to meet changing circumstances, these rules have been continued in force up to the present time.</P>
      <P>Another statute which has a bearing on Civil Service control is the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1924, which was passed shortly before the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  Whilst the Civil Service Regulation Act deals almost entirely with recruitment to the Civil Service there is, somewhat strangely, provided in it a single section enabling the Minister for Finance to make regulations for controlling the Civil Service and providing for the classification, remuneration and other conditions of service of all persons employed in the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might digress at this stage to say <Col N="1181" /> that the Civil Service Commissioners Bill, 1956, which is complementary to the present measure and with which I will be dealing later, is designed to replace the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1924, and the amending Act of 1926.  We think it desirable that the statute dealing solely with recruitment should not impinge on the question of control and the Civil Service Commissioners Bill is drafted on that basis.</P>
    <P>The power given by the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1924, to make control regulations has, in fact, been used to a limited extent only and, by and large, the rules relating to control and discipline taken over with the transfer of functions have continued to be the major factor in Civil Service control.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House is designed to set out in statutory form the system of regulation and control of the Civil Service and to give definite statutory backing to that system.  The introduction of such statutory provisions will meet a long felt need.</P>
    <P>I do not think that at this stage it would be fruitful for me to give a detailed description of the various sections at this stage.  These can be better considered at the Committee Stage.  I can assure the House, however, that the Bill makes no radical departures and that such changes as are made are of a minor character designed to facilitate administration. The primary purpose of the Bill is to affirm long standing practice and to give an Irish statutory basis for such practice.  I accordingly recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>There is not very much that can be said on this Bill.  It contains no revolutionary provisions.  There is to be no fundamental change in the regulations and conditions governing civil servants.  It is more or less an amending Bill which, as the Minister has said, puts on an Irish basis the control and regulation of the Civil Service.  There are, however, a few things in it and a few things not in it to which I should like to refer.</P>
      <P>When reading through the measure, I just thought of certain members of the Civil Service who had been members of the old Dáil.  I think it would be termed the Second Dáil that existed prior to July, 1921.  These gave service to the country during that critical time and it can be said that, were it not for the work they carried out and the enthusiasm with which they grappled with the affairs of the time, it would have been difficult to have achieved the freedom of this country.  A good many of them got recognition later on and they were taken into the Civil Service. While it must be admitted that on the whole they got equitable treatment, still their position is not as happy as that of other established civil servants, from the point of view of superannuation based on the length of their service.  Normally, civil servants will have served 45 years or more when they have reached the age of 65 and such service would entitle them to the maximum pension, on their retiral, of forty-eightieths of their salary, and also to their maximum gratuity, but, in the case of these people to whom I have referred&mdash;those people who served in the old Dáil&mdash;some of them could never reach the maximum pension because of the length of service they have had.  I think that the Minister would be justified in making provision in this measure to meet these cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a question solely of superannuation.  It is a question of regulating the terms under which civil servants, established or otherwise, will give service to the State and I hold that the length of service, that the determination of the length of service, is a question of regulation to be considered by the Minister. What I am advocating here is that the service of these people who served under the old Dáil and who were taken into the Civil Service later on, be adjusted so that the possibility would be there of their realising the maximum pension, side by side with their colleagues in the Civil Service.  I think that is a matter that comes, or should come, within the framework of this Bill and I would like the Minister to consider it and give us his view on it when he is replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1184" /> I must admit that the Legislature has met the case of these people to a certain extent.  In the Superannuation and Pensions Act of 1923, Section 1, sub-section (1), provision is made for the addition of a certain number of years of service, not exceeding five years, for certain classes of civil servants transferred from the service of the Second Dáil to the new Irish Government.  These are the people I am referring to and it is a question of the regulation of their length of service.  I understand this concession was granted in very few cases and only to those who were in the middle-age category.  In some cases I understand as much as three years were added and, in a few cases, five years.  I understand also that those in the under 30 years or so class, or even older, got no concession and some few of those remain in the service still and will not qualify for the normal retiring pension, that is, half their salary, because they will fall short of the length of service which is required.</P>
    <P>That is the position of those people which I am putting before the Minister and I think it is a matter which should be considered in connection with this measure.  I do not want to detain the House too long at this point, but, at the same time, I consider it a very important point and one that deserves the earnest consideration of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I notice that in Section 5 we have &ldquo;every established civil servant shall hold office at the will and pleasure of the Government&rdquo;.  I suppose that goes without saying, but at the same time there is an implication in it that the Government can get rid of a civil servant without stating any cause. That is the position as it is and it is apparently the position that will exist. In cases of other servants of the State, it is a rule that they may not have their services dispensed with, except for stated reasons, but there are no stated reasons under Section 5.  In other words, any member of the Civil Service, established or not established, can be got rid of by a Government by a stroke of the pen and they need not give any explanation for it.  That is the position and we are enacting that here through this measure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> I notice the Minister was congratulated in the other House on having been able to disentangle this measure from the other one which follows and I must confess, when I saw the two of them, and read the two of them, I was under the impression that the provisions of the two of them could be enacted together in one Bill, but of course I may be wrong.  I have not the experience of these things that the draftsmen have, so that I have to bow to their superior wisdom and experience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The points I wish to raise on this Bill are mainly points which can more properly be discussed on Committee Stage, but, as some of them are of a general nature and affect a class of people who are to a large extent not sufficiently vocal to make representations themselves, I think I am entitled to draw attention to them in a general way on Second Reading.</P>
      <P>In Section 3 of the Bill, there are provisions made for the suspension of persons from duty and I want the Minister to consider if that suspension should not be limited in some way. This section gives to subordinates too much power over people.  I suggest there should be a limitation on the number of days for which a person could be suspended under that section.</P>
      <P>Section 7 (a) is one which particularly affects university graduates and that is my reason for referring to the matter at this stage.  It provides that a person who is not satisfactory after a probationary period may be dispensed with by the Minister.  The reason why I say that it particularly affects university graduates is that there is an exception in the case of a civil servant already holding an established post.  Therefore, the great majority of the people who would come under this would be university graduates in the Civil Service on probation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed&mdash;I speak subject to correction&mdash;that at the present time the dispensing with the services of such people is a matter for the Government. This Bill substitutes for that the right of a single Minister to suspend.  If that is so, I suggest it is a retrograde step. It is giving to a single person power <Col N="1186" /> over the lives of others which in the past was at Government level and should be retained at Government level still.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with widows coming back into the service.  It raises controversial points which I will not discuss at this stage of the Bill.  I simply want to let the Minister know that there is a very widespread feeling that this section may involve hardship for widows returning to the service, if it is not administered in a very lenient and understanding way.  Without going to the extent of moving amendments to the section on Committee Stage, I think that a great many people would be satisfied if the Minister could give an assurance that the powers under this section would be used, as I said, in a lenient and tolerant fashion.  He might give an assurance that widows in general would be appointed to their former grade and that it would not be made the rule but rather the exception that a widow applicant for reinstatement would be required to serve a trial period.</P>
    <P>Section 11 (d) (II) introduces a new principle which is, I suggest, a bad one, that is, that a Minister in reinstating a window now has the power to put her in a grade lower than her original position.  I am informed that this is an innovation.  At present the only power the Minister has is to put a widow in the grade in which she was before she left the service, or in an equivalent grade.  This section apparently extends the Minister's powers to place her in a lower grade, which seems to be calculated to injure certain people in certain circumstances.  Here, again, I think the people affected would be satisfied with an assurance from the Minister that this practice would be reduced to the absolute minimum and that widows would, as far as possible, be restored to their former grade.  He might also give us an assurance that, when a widow is restored to a lower grade, she should get priority for promotion for appointment to the grade to which she belonged during her previous service.</P>
    <P>Section 12 also seems harsh.  I am informed that it involves a new principle, namely, that persons recalled for <Col N="1187" /> service should be asked to go through a period of trial.  People who would be recalled for service are mainly elderly people who have already been tried in the Civil Service.  It seems hard upon them that, before being appointed, they should have to go through any probationary period.  If they are the sort of people considered proper to be recalled, the Minister should not go through the farce of recalling them and putting them through a probationary period.  If they are good enough to be recalled, the trial period should be dispensed with.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to call attention to is the disciplinary powers in Section 15.  Here, again, the matters are mainly matters for Committee Stage, but civil servants are not able to put their views ordinarily in the same way as people employed in other walks of life.  I think it is a peculiar function of the Legislature to see that public servants get all the care and protection they can.  Therefore, I make no excuse for raising this point on Second Reading.  Briefly, the grievance that has been put to me by civil servants is that the civil servant is expected to state his case in writing under the section.  It is not always easy to make a case in writing and a large number of the lower grades in the Civil Service are not skilled with the pen.  This really confines them to one method of making representations when other methods might be far more efficacious.</P>
    <P>I suggest that civil servants who wish to appeal from a disciplinary decision should have the right to an interview, either with the Minister or with some other officer.  I can speak with considerable experience on this matter, being an examiner in University College for very many years and having sat for many years on selection boards.  It is my experience that greater justice is done at an interview or oral examination than by a mere written examination or written test.  If that is true of the highly educated university graduate it is at least equally true in regard to people with average education and less experience in writing.  I suggest to the <Col N="1188" /> Minister that stating the case in writing possibly confines the person to a medium to which he may not be accustomed and in which he may not be very skilled.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister also to consider the possibility of making some arrangements for civil servants to be represented by their own professional organisation.  When a man employed in other types of business gets into trouble with his employers, he is frequently represented by his trade union.  The civil servants have an admirable organisation which could possibly put the case of the servant better than he could himself.  There are many cases where diplomatic negotiations between people skilled in this type of work, between the heads of the Department and the Civil Service organisation, could possibly unravel the difficulties of a situation and effect a compromise which would be quite impossible if the negotiations were confined to an action at long term range conducted by letters on each side.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service staff organisation, I suggest, would not be concerned to oppose or make things difficult for the Minister.  It would be concerned in smoothing over difficulties and its co-operation should be sought by the Minister.  In industry to-day there is more and more co-operation between employer and employee.  The individual employee is represented to an ever-increasing extent by his professional or trade organisation.  There is no reason why that should not apply to the Civil Service as well.  The Civil Service staff organisations could be of the greatest value to the Minister. Their co-operation in the maintenance of discipline would certainly be of greater value to the community than their hostility or indifference, resulting from their being excluded and kept outside the door.</P>
    <P>Finally&mdash;it may be a bee in my bonnet, as Chairman of the Statutory Orders Committee of this House&mdash;I suggest that the arrangements made under Section 17 should be laid on the Table of the House.  These arrangements&mdash;the word is &ldquo;arrangements&rdquo;&mdash; are presumably to be in writing and <Col N="1189" /> they affect the livelihood, remuneration and conditions of a large number of people.  I suggest that, before they become operative, they should be laid on the Table of the House.  Of course, they will come before the Statutory Orders Committee in any case, whether or not they are laid on the Table of the House.  However, I suggest that documents of such importance should be laid on the Table of the House before they become operative.</P>
    <P>I apologise for taking up the time of the Seanad on the Second Reading with Committee points, but they affect a large number of people and I think I am entitled to some latitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>In a Bill of this kind, it may be permissible briefly to touch on a disability which affects civil servants in general.  I refer to the regulation or convention by which civil servants are not allowed to play an active part in politics.  If anybody wants to know the relevance of this to the Bill, I suggest it comes under Section 13&mdash;the suspension of civil servants from duty, and so on.  The attention of the House might be drawn to this topic for a moment or two.</P>
      <P>Sooner or later, I think the Government should make up its mind again, perhaps, on the matter, and sooner or later I think the Parliament should consider it.  It is, I think, the English convention that civil servants should not take an active part in politics.  It is not the convention in other countries. I understand that in France there is no such convention and that there is a good deal of going and coming into the Civil Service, and out of the Civil Service into the Parliament, and into the Ministries, perhaps, and back again.  It seems an open question in a country like this where the pool of intelligent political thinkers is small whether we are not losing a great deal of sensible political thought and action by preventing civil servants from taking part actively in politics.  Allowing for the fact that political education is still rather backward in this country, I think we are losing too much by it.  It is a fact that a good many of the younger civil servants hold this view and that it is a matter which deserves to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> One could speak at considerable length on this matter: but I simply lay the topic before the Minister and the House.  If the Minister would be good enough to give his own view on it at this stage, it would be very illuminating. Perhaps it would be the best if the House so desires, eventually to put down a motion on this topic.  I suggest the public mind should be aware of the harm which possibly is being done to politics in this country by a regulation (or convention) of this kind.  It would be interesting to know, if the Minister could tell me, whether there is a definite regulation, or if it is merely a convention. I myself find it hard to make a final decision as to whether or not we would be better for a change but on the whole I think we would.  A great deal of political thought and action is being lost in this country by the regulation or convention which prevents civil servants from taking an active part in politics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">

      <P>Section 7 gives power to delegate certain powers to the appropriate authority in certain cases.  I should like to mention the question of civil servants employed in the courts. In former times, they were under the authority of the judges.  In our State, that has been rather changed and that authority has been taken away from the judges.  I suggest that the Minister might perhaps consider in Section 10, which deals with delegation in certain matters of that kind, whether there should not be a power to delegate to the judges the power, which in past times they undoubtedly had, over the court officials.  It seems to me that it is a vital thing that the judicial power of the courts should be wholly independent and that, to some extent possibly, that may be affected by the fact that the officials who serve the courts are directly under a Minister and not&mdash;as in ancient times they used be and as I understand they still are in England&mdash;under the control of the judges who would seem to be the appropriate authority in the case of officials employed in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this is a very important measure.  We in the Seanad have a special responsibility <Col N="1191" /> in dealing with a measure which lays down or makes arrangements for the discipline, retirement and re-employment of civil servants. We are, I suggest, the special guardians to see that proper machinery is laid down and that no bias is placed with the State in such machinery.</P>
      <P>The most important aspect of the Bill, from my point of view, relates to discipline.  I would ask Senators to consider for a moment what would be a desirable machinery for the maintenance of discipline in the Civil Service.  I think they would all agree that a proper disciplinary machinery would be a good thing both for the State and for the employees of the State.  What should be provided, to my mind, is a certain procedure.  I think the first step in any disciplinary machinery should be that the person who gets into trouble should be informed in writing of the nature of his offence and, secondly, that he should be given an opportunity to reply in writing or personally in an oral interview at which he may be accompanied by a colleague or a representative of his organisation.  I think that is very important.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Brien made some reference to arriving at a compromise.  That might not be quite the correct term. I think it is important, in considering disciplinary machinery, that it is not a matter for negotiation between the management and the organisation representing the staff.  It is not like the terms and conditions of service as such.  It is not a matter of going in there and negotiating a settlement on this dispute with the management which in this case is the State.  It is not anything like that.  The person in trouble should be allowed to have the assistance of a skilled advocate, representative of his organisation, who could help him out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have experience of disciplinary machinery and it is often a fact that the person in trouble is not the best able to put forward his own defence. In some cases, he is probably ashamed; <Col N="1192" /> he does not like giving details of his personal difficulties, his family background, which, if they were known to the person at the other side of the table, would be regarded as a mitigation. That is the second step I suggest should be included in any proper machinery for the maintenance of discipline.</P>
    <P>The third step, then, is that, following upon the consideration of the reply made by the person charged, he should again be notified in writing of the decision and the proposed punishment. Again, another step, and the important step, is provision for an appeal. When a man has been informed of the proposed punishment, he should have an opportunity of appealing to somebody higher, and again he should be allowed to do so in writing or do so personally and be accompanied by somebody of his own choice, a fellow worker or a representative of his organisation.</P>
    <P>I think Senators will agree that such an arrangement would be eminently reasonable and I must press that we have an especial responsibility to see that there should be reasonable machinery for discipline within the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Another important part of the maintenance of discipline is the power to suspend.  I suggest that should be exercisable only for grave offences, that it should be exercised for the protection of the State and not as a punishment.  Punishment is something different altogether.  Even where a person is suspended because of the grave nature of the offence, the ordinary disciplinary machinery which I have suggested should be gone through, namely, he should be notified in writing of his offence and given the opportunity of appearing and of appealing eventually.  Suspension is necessary, I suggest, but it should be exercised very cautiously and only in exceptional circumstances.  Unless this is clearly understood and provided for, there is a danger that suspension would be used as a punishment.  When somebody is guilty of some offence, the immediate reaction is to punish by suspension.  I suggest that is quite wrong and it should not be allowed or provided for in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1193" /> The Bill also deals with matters other than discipline.  One of these is the question of people who have been appointed on probation to particular posts.  I was rather surprised to find that if a civil servant is not regarded as satisfactory in a higher post, instead of being reverted to his previous grade, he might indeed be reverted to a grade lower than his previous grade.  That seems to me to be quite extraordinary.  You can quite well appreciate that when somebody is taking promotion, to get promotion he would have to be regarded as a competent and satisfactory person in his existing grade.  However, in some cases you find that a person taking that promotion is unable to bear up to the added responsibility and, in effect, is unsatisfactory and should be reverted.  Surely it is only reasonable that he should be reverted to his former grade and not that he should be punished for being unable to take the higher responsibility and be demoted to a grade lower than his previous grade.  I think such an arrangement is quite unreasonable.</P>
    <P>The Bill also makes provision for the re-employment of widows, women who have been previously employed as civil servants, who have retired on marriage and who, because of widowhood, are looking for re-employment.  Such a provision has been in existence in the Civil Service for quite a long time and I think it is a very good provision indeed.  It is to be welcomed now, but here we would need to be a little careful also.  Senator O'Brien made reference to the fact that these widows coming back into the Civil Service would be employed for a trial period and employment for that trial period might be in a grade lower than that which they previously occupied.  I understand there is a tendency to reemploy these people at the lowest possible grade, that they are employed as temporary clerical assistants in many cases.</P>
    <P>There are two very obvious objections to that.  First of all, of course, the pay of a temporary clerical assistant is so low that it would not enable any widow to provide for herself and what might be a young family.  There <Col N="1194" /> is also the objection that that widow, when she was originally employed in the Civil Service, might have been occupying a fairly responsible post.  A person who has occupied a responsible post might make a very poor temporary clerical assistant.  As the employment would be for a trial period and as she might be unsatisfactory as a temporary clerical assistant, that lady might have to go out, even though she might indeed be quite a good executive officer.</P>
    <P>A provision which rather puzzles me is that contained in Section 17.  I understand the present position is that changes in the wages and salaries of civil servants have to come before the House, that they have to be laid on the Tables of the two Houses.  Here, however, provision is being made that the Minister can change them, apparently without having to bring the changes before the Oireachtas.  I do not know if my understanding of the position is correct here, but that is certainly what I have read into Section 17.  I am not supposing that the Minister&mdash;once he gets this Bill through&mdash; will run away and start increasing the salaries of civil servants all round the place.  I think Senator Commons can be reassured on that point.  However, it might be undesirable that for the future a Minister could make arrangements in regard to decreases as well as increases, without laying the changes before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford has raised a very interesting point on this measure and I think it is only Senator Stanford would see this point which many of us should have seen on a Bill like this. He has suggested that there is a pool of experience and political thought in the Civil Service and that that should be available also to the community.  I may say that, apart from political experience or political thought, it has always seemed a bad set-up to me that in this country the best brains produced each year from the schools seem automatically to go into the Civil Service. That must be a great loss not alone to politics but to trade and commerce in the country.</P>
    <P>I have no experience of the French system to which Senator Stanford has <Col N="1195" /> drawn attention, but I do not think it would be really desirable or welcome in this country that civil servants as a whole should be able to take an active part in politics, but the present arrangement is quite unreasonable. Surely there should be no difficulty in allowing civil servants up to the medium grade to take an active part in politics.  They are citizens of this country; they are allowed to vote, as we know; but it is a loss to the political thought that civil servants as a whole should be debarred from taking their part in politics.  To that extent, I would certainly support what Senator Stanford has said.  The Minister said in the Dáil that this is a Bill which is really a Committee Bill and I agree with him, but again&mdash;I think for the third time&mdash;I want to suggest to Senators that we have a special responsibility to examine this measure very carefully to see that we do not have an arrangement which provides an undue bias to the employers&mdash;in this case, the State&mdash;or the employees, the civil servants of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of matters to which I wish to refer.  One is the retiring age of civil servants. This Bill provides that, in the main, a civil servant shall retire at the age of 65.  I do not think that that is completely desirable.  The age limit of 65 may have been decided upon when the expectation of life was shorter than it is to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think on the whole it is generally agreed that the expectation of life has lengthened.  I do not know if that applies to civil servants or not, but, in general, it has lengthened. I would regard 65 as being just like the teenage&mdash;as being an awkward age.  It is certainly an awkward age at which to start a new career.  A man at that age is a little bit too old for launching out on an entirely new career and a little bit too young to settle down in an easy chair with nothing to look forward to.  I think, <Col N="1196" /> therefore, that while civil servants might have the option of retiring at 65, if they so desire, there should be no compulsion whatever in regard to it if a man feels himself that he is capable of continuing in office for a longer period.</P>
      <P>I know that the training and tradition of a civil servant make it difficult for him to undertake anything like business, commerce, agriculture or anything of that kind.  He has lived a sheltered life and it is not easy for him to go out into the world and rough it.  I say that, notwithstanding the fact that a civil servant is protected by a pension.  What I feel about a pension is that, to a great extent, it tends to induce a man to retire into complete idleness.  That would be bad not only for the individual himself, but for the community as a whole.  In this State, so many people leave the country during their most productive years, so many emigrate and such a large section of our people are in the older age group, that it is desirable that everybody should be contributing their maximum.  It is, as I say, difficult for the average civil servant to do that outside of the profession in which he has been trained.</P>
      <P>Another matter to which I would like to refer, although I cannot find it mentioned in the Bill, is in regard to promotions in the Civil Service.  I may be less well informed than other Senators, but I am not clear as to what is the basis on which promotions are made in the Civil Service or who is the promoting authority.  I am not going to dwell upon what has been so ably said in regard to discipline and disciplinary action, but an injustice could occur to an officer if he were to be passed over in regard to promotion and it could be as great an injustice as demotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to disciplinary action, I think a civil servant should have the right to have representations made on his behalf by a representative body, or by some authority within the Civil Service skilled in making a case, if there is an obvious injustice in matters of that kind.  Since promotion must be on the basis of merit, it is not always <Col N="1197" /> easy to define what is an injustice, but there should be skilled advocates in that respect within the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear it mentioned here that civil servants are not permitted to take part in politics.  I believe they have the right to canvass for votes, which is a very important political activity in election times, the most important political activity that could be undertaken by an individual. I believe there is nothing to prevent a civil servant from canvassing votes for a particular individual.</P>

      <P>I would be surprised to hear it.  It would be rather difficult to prevent if it were done in a discreet way.  In addition, we know that a number of State servants are permitted to be elected as members of local authorities and as members of the Oireachtas, that is to say, school teachers, and officials of local authorities, and there probably are others permitted by law to contest parliamentary and local elections.  If that is so, there does not seem to be valid grounds for excluding the general body of civil servants. At the same time, I think it would be highly undesirable if our civil servants were to be divided into two or three groups of rabid politicians who would pursue political discussion and debate and whose administrative acts might be always suspect, by reason of their political affiliations.</P>

      <P>The terms in which the Minister put forward this Bill were that this is an effort&mdash;and I think a laudable one&mdash;to give as it were an Irish legislative basis to regulations governing the Civil Service.  The debate we have had so far shows an appreciation by the Seanad of the value of introducing such legislation and the opportunity it affords us of making suggestions, many of them valuable ones, with regard to the improvement of the general arrangements governing the relationship of the employer to the employed within the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point I should like to mention is one that has been mentioned by Senator Kissane already, <Col N="1198" /> and it struck me, too, that Section 5 demands some clarification or amplification. Section 5 says: &ldquo;Every established civil servant shall hold office at the will and pleasure of the Government.&rdquo; It may be, as Senator Kissane presumed, that that is a regulation attitude, that the civil servant is only there at the will and pleasure of the Government, but it savours to me of something a little bit too authoritarian, too autocratic and it seems to me that this Bill, in that section, gives a little too much power, unmitigated by any proviso or right of appeal.  It seems to imply that the established civil servant is only there at the will of the Government, and can only remain there at the pleasure of the Government.  There are in other sections certain modifications of that, but that bold statement ought to be qualified by some such phrase as &ldquo;save in so far as he holds the office under certain other sections and certain provisions referred to therein.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One might relate to that what Senator O'Brien said about Section 7, the question of security of tenure and the obligation on the employer&mdash;the Government, frequently under this Bill &mdash;to say why it is no longer their &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; that an established civil servant shall continue to &ldquo;hold office.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford mentioned the question that has been mentioned too by others&mdash;in fact I think I raised it myself on a previous occasion&mdash;of permission to civil servants to engage in politics.  If I remember correctly the Minister previously answered that question with a great deal of emphasis, saying we did not want the sort of thing that happened in certain other unnamed countries in which you have a reshuffle of the whole Civil Service with a change of Government.  He is obviously on sound ground there.  We do not want that kind of thing happening, but I am not quite convinced that a larger measure of permission to most of the junior grades of civil servants to engage in politics would bring about the kind of chaotic situation the Minister envisaged.  You could have a bar above a certain level to engaging in politics but that would leave most of the minor civil servants much greater latitude for engaging, as they ought to, in the politics, both municipal and national, of the country.  Therefore, I <Col N="1199" /> would support Senator Stanford and Senator Murphy on that point.</P>
    <P>The question of the retirement age was mentioned by Senator Cogan.  I should like to hear from the Minister why it is we have these three or four different retirement ages.  Civil servants to whom the 1919 Act applies are retired at 60; others retire at 65; and some can be kept on in certain circumstances until they are 70; and the unestablished civil servants can be kept on until they are 75.  Others&mdash;and there is a whole group of them referred to in sub-section (5) of Section 8&mdash;do not have these provisions applied to them at all.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister how it is there are so many different attitudes towards the retirement age.  Senator Cogan implied somewhat jocosely that life in the Civil Service made you unfit for anything else afterwards, and that it was not fair to ask you at 65 to take up a new life.  That is true, I am afraid, of all professions.  Once you are in them for a time, you find it hard to change.  I would agree with Senator Cogan that the retiring age of 65 is rather young, for another reason, that is that you have a large amount of talent, experience and skill in the person and in the minds of the men of 65, who are being compulsorily retired now.  It would be of great benefit to the country if those qualities were to be retained.</P>
    <P>I have no patience with the attitude that those senior men &ldquo;ought to get out&rdquo; in order to make way for younger men.  I should be inclined to judge it more on whether or not they are giving efficient service to the community, and I think in the big majority of cases men of 65 in senior positions or in any position in the Civil Service are giving perhaps their maximum service to the country in those years; and I believe consequently that we are setting the retiral age a little too young.  Senator Cogan suggested something good when he suggested that civil servants might be given the option of retiring at 65 but should not be compulsorily retired.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister why it is that in sub-section (4) of Section 8, paragraph (c), it is stated <Col N="1200" /> that the retiring age for non-established civil servants may be raised as high as 75.  I am not quite sure why it is thought that the unestablished civil servant is efficient at his job at 75 but the established civil servant is burned out at the age of 70. I wonder what is behind that?  Is it that the salary of the unestablished man is so niggardly that he is kept on because of the pension that implies, or is there some other reason why the unestablished civil servant is a better man at 70 than the established civil servant?  I do not quite see how that is arrived at.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (5) of that same section gives you the list of people to whom sub-sections (1), (2), (3) and (4) do not apply.  I am sure there is a good reason for that.  Probably other legislation governs those people, but I note that all these people, to whom these sub-sections do not apply, are connected with the legal profession.  They are all lawyers: Master of the High Court, Taxing Master, County Registrar, and so on.  I should like to have some clarification from the Minister as to why it is that they are excepted.  I am prepared to be told that the conditions for them are in fact similar under other legislation but if so I think we should be told that.  My curiosity has been aroused by sub-section (6) which refers to other legislation, to the Act of 1859, and we are told that it does not apply.  We can, of course, look that up for ourselves but I would be curious to know what the relevance of that is.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to make, and in my opinion the most important one, is in relation to Section 10 which in the first sub-section says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Women holding positions in the Civil Service, other than positions which are declared excepted positions under sub-section (2) of this section are required to retire on marriage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am aware that in many Acts we include that principle, and I think it is a bad one.  I have said so before in this Seanad, and I wish now to say so again.  In this Bill we have a section demanding that women retire on marriage. <Col N="1201" /> That seems to me to be a primitive and obscurantist view of the role that a married woman can play in society, and I even go so far as to say that it seems to me to be repugnant to the Constitution, which in Article 40, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is true that, in other parts of the Constitution, there is a reference to the special position of women, but it does not seem to me that there is any legitimate Article in the Constitution which permits the Legislature to act in this way against married women.</P>
    <P>Article 41 says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In particular the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is all perfectly true but it does not give power to the Legislature to insist that married women shall play their part in the State exclusively in the home.  Article 41 also states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The State shall therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here it refers to &ldquo;mothers&rdquo;, not to married women.  There are childless married women, but it points out, not that mothers must be kept in the home but shall not be &ldquo;obliged by economic necessity&rdquo; to leave the home in order to earn a living.  Again, in Article 45 sub-section 4, paragraph 3, it is stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The State shall endeavour to ensure that the strength and health of workers, men and women, and the tender age of children shall not be abused and that citizens shall not be forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their sex, age or strength.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The emphasis is on the refusal of the State to allow men or women to be forced &ldquo;by economic necessity&rdquo; to do certain things, and I suggest that this section of the Bill forces women, whether they like it or not, to leave particular types of work when they <Col N="1202" /> marry.  I regard that as deeply retrogressive and I believe that married women who are born equal and free citizens of this country should not be forced to leave their posts in the Civil Service or elsewhere on marriage. I agree that it is a good thing to ensure, where we can, that women should not be forced through economic necessity to work, but, if they so desire, I believe they should be free to do so, and should not be forced to retire on marriage.  I think the country suffers a continuing loss by reason of the fact that women teachers, doctors, dentists, health officers, lawyers, civil servants and so on are deprived of their rights of continuing to serve in their positions if they want to, by such a section as Section 10.  This is a free democratic country, and indeed an attempt is now being made to guarantee equal status for every citizen and we have a Bill coming before the Seanad soon, a Bill to get equality of status for married women and here we have a Bill which is refusing equality of status with men to married women, refusing the equal right of free choice in their way of life after they are married.</P>
    <P>I would go further and say I sympathise with what Professor O'Brien said about the question of the readmission of widows to the Civil Service, but I should like to see women not compulsorily retired on marriage, but married women who had voluntarily retired given an equal chance with widows to re-enter the State service, if they so desired.  A woman could leave the Service on marriage, bring up a family of children, and then desire to re-enter the Service at a later stage in her married life, no matter what her position in the Civil Service was.  I should welcome a change in those provisions which would make for a more equal status for married women in the Service and a better utilisation of the married woman's skill, competence, knowledge, and training for the service of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the remarks of Senator Stanford, and while I will not go as far as saying that I followed them the whole way, at the same time, the remarks <Col N="1203" /> he made on that very interesting aspect of the Civil Service have brought to my mind yet another instance where successive Irish Governments have slavishly followed the British practice.</P>
      <P>The instance I would like to direct the attention of the House and the Minister to is the refusal to allow or permit direct contact between civil servants in their capacity as experts and parliamentarians.  It so happens from time to time that parliamentary committee of one kind or another put forward certain administrative or legislative schemes and these proposals go to the Minister who, in turn, refers them to what is loosely termed a committee of experts&mdash;in other words, civil servants who are experts in these particular matters.  At a later stage, these experts report to the Minister and finally their report may fall into the hands of the parliamentary committee, but the whole interchange of ideas, so to speak, between the parliamentarians, on the one hand, and the experts, on the other, is done by correspondence with the Minister acting as a kind of glorified post-box.</P>
      <P>This is a British system.  It is a system that exists in no other country in the world, except in the United Kingdom.  The United Kingdom uses as an excuse for adopting this system that it is part of their constitution.  I am informed on reliable legal authority that that is a pure fiction.  There is no constitutional difficulty about it there.  There are certainly no constitutional difficulties about it in this country, but when one has inquired on a couple of occasions where an instance of this nature came to my knowledge and where I have had to sit on a joint committee of parliamentarians and governmental experts and there has been no governmental experts present from the Irish Republic, I have been given the answer that we have adopted the British system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see no excuse for it.  I think a great deal is to be learned by direct contact on matters of a legal nature between governmental experts and parliamentarians.  We parliamentarians do not claim to be experts.  We are not <Col N="1204" /> necessarily experts.  Our professions as parliamentarians make us perhaps a little bit of Jacks-of-all trades and some of us may be experts in a particular field, but that field is necessarily limited and we do lose, I think, through not being able from time to time to have direct contact with governmental experts.  It is only for that reason that I rise to draw the attention of the House and the Minister to this aspect in regard to which there is no legal or constitutional difficulties. The system has merely been adapted from the British.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJOKeefe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of certain groups of civil servants engaged in the prison service.  There may be others in different categories throughout the country whom I do not know.  These men served in the Defence Forces during the emergency and, consequently, on entering the Civil Service afterwards, they had exceeded the maximum age that would entitle them to qualify for a full pension on reaching the retiring age.  I would respectfully ask the Minister to insert a clause in this Bill to enable those persons to be given credit for the years they served in the Defence Forces when their pensions are being assessed.  In other words, if that servant had 4 or 5 years in the Defence Forces, such service would be added on to the years he served in the Civil Service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 is a section the wording of which ought to be changed.  The implication is that any civil servant can enjoy his position at the will and pleasure of the Government. I think the Minister should arrange to have a tribunal or some other body besides the Government to decide whether the civil servant shall continue to be a civil servant or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is the other question of civil servants being allowed to take part in politics or in local affairs.  I know a number of civil servants who would be ideal men on certain public boards, but they are not allowed to show themselves.  I cannot agree with Senator Cogan that these civil servants are entitled to go out and canvass.  I have seen the opposite taking place. I want to draw a distinction between executive officers and ordinary civil <Col N="1205" /> servants.  There are a number of well educated young men holding Civil Service jobs in public authorities and it is rather hard that they are not permitted to utilise their talents in the interests of the community.  We will have to have some amendment of these sections on Committee Stage.  I think that Section 5 is obnoxious so far as the wording of it is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated, when introducing the Bill, this is largely a Committee Bill and it will fall to the lot of the House on Committee Stage to discuss in more detail many of the points raised.  I think I would be only lengthening unduly and wearying the Seanad were I to refer to them to-day, since it will perhaps be necessary to refer to them again on Committee Stage.  Therefore, I propose only to deal with a few general matters.</P>
      <P>Senator Hickey, the last speaker, referred to a matter mentioned by other Senators earlier&mdash;the question of politics in the Civil Service.  I made it quite clear before that so far as I was concerned I was against politics in the Civil Service.  I thought the inevitable result of introducing political civil servants would be eventually to tend towards the American system. Even if it was introduced for the lower grades, it would lead towards the spoils system.  Sooner or later that would be bound to happen.</P>
      <P>All political organisations in the country boast, and rightly so, that people in every walk of life can be elected to their executives.  If we were to permit civil servants to take an active part in politics, it would be open to them to sit on the political executives of the various political Parties. They would not be restrained and it would be wrong to restrain them if one permitted them to take an active part in politics.  I cannot see my own Party, Fine Gael, the Fianna Fáil Party, the Labour Party, the Clann na Talmhan Party or any other Party being satisfled to have serving under them, even in a junior post, a person on the executive of the opposing political Party of the day, a person who would be able to see the confidential files passing to and fro between the Minister and his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" /> If we allowed civil servants to take a part in politics, there would come at a later stage a claim that if they were going to take part in politics, they could be changed with Government of the and whatever the Government of the day, it would have round it civil servants of a type it would know were loyal to its policy.  I think the choice is whether we are going to have a permanent Civil Service or a political Civil Service.  I personally will always plump for the permanent Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Senator Hickey also raised the question of the tenure of office of established civil servants.  I hope the Senator will not be offended if I say that he is living in a balloon since we all know that the feeling outside is that civil servants have far greater security of tenure than people in any other employment. We all know that is the general impression.  It is right that nothing must fetter the responsibility and discretion of a Government. Under the Constitution, the Government must be supreme.  We all know that the practice is such that we need not have any worry about the exact wording of Section 5.</P>
    <P>Senator Kissane in opening the discussion and Senator O'Keeffe later from another angle, referred to the desirability of providing additional added years for pension purposes under this Bill.  That would not be appropriate to this Bill.  The Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, and the Superannuation Act, 1936, are the Acts which would deal with such a problem and which, in fact, dealt with it in the manner there indicated.  I must, therefore, reiterate what I said to Senator Kissane across the House that the questions he raised on that issue are not relevant to the terms of this Bill and would not come within the scope of its Long Title.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien raised the point in relation to the readmission of widows. He also objected to the probation period.  There may be cases in which there might be considerable doubt as to whether a widow, because of the length of time that had elapsed since she was previously working, would be qualified to take up the job again.  I think it is far better for her that she <Col N="1207" /> should have the opportunity of coming in on probation than that she should be excluded.  If there were not the safeguard of probation, the tendency would be and the danger might be that she would not be taken back at all because of the length of time that had elapsed since she retired on marriage.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I cannot agree with Senator Murphy that a charge should always be put in writing.  Senator O'Brien made the case that it was not always feasible for the civil servant concerned to deal with his representations in writing.  Take, for example, a job going on out in the middle of a bog.  You could not possibly expect a ganger to sit down there and then and write out the charge if, for example, he had seen one of the people in that gang hit another fellow in the gang with a shovel.  He would obviously tell him to get out, without putting it down.  But, in all the cases that are dealt with in the ordinary way in headquarters&mdash;and, as the Senator knows, a written charge is made&mdash;you must base what occurred and what might unfortunately occur on reasonableness. In this Bill, there is a provision by virtue of which the suspending authority is nominated in a way that was not there before and which will undoubtedly require the Minister concerned to make a most specific decision as to who and what class of persons are qualified to be nominating authorities.</P>
    <P>I should be wrong if I allowed Senator O'Brien to remain under the impression that the arrangements visualised in Section 17 will be Tabled. They will not come before either House of the Oireachtas.  They are the confidential instruments that must obviously pass between the Department of Finance, on the one hand, and the outside Departments, on the other hand.  I should be wrong if I allowed him to think otherwise.  The section has been most specifically framed in that way so as to make it clear that confidential circulars passing from the Department of Finance to other Departments are involved.</P>
    <P>Many of the persons named as being excluded from the terms of this Bill in relation to age limits, and so on, are <Col N="1208" /> named in specific statutes.  We can deal with the exact details more easily on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Cogan stated that the expectation of life had grown and that therefore the age limit should be extended. Senator Sheehy Skeffington inquired why there was a different age limit for established and unestablished civil servants.  I do not think we should change the age limit of 65 in relation to established civil servants.  The reason why we have the higher age limit of 75 for unestablished civil servants is that unestablished civil servants do not qualify for pensions and accordingly, particularly in cases of national service, it is desirable to retain them for a longer period in order to make up for the fact that they do not qualify for a pension.</P>
    <P>Senator Cogan also referred to the question of promotion and asked on what basis it is made.  There are most specific arrangements in relation to it. Promotion must be of the person best qualified and most suitable for the position, and nothing else can supervene or should supervene.  The appropriate authority&mdash;the Minister&mdash;must make his selection on that basis and, where there is any delegation of authority from the Department of Finance, it must be certified by the outside Department that the person concerned has been selected on that basis.</P>
    <P>I do not think there are any other general matters to which I should refer now.  As I said, many detailed matters were raised with which we shall deal on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>May I just say a few words in relation to the question of suspension of civil servants from duty?  There is the gravest danger to civil servants that, if you so restrict the power of suspension by providing suspension only for the very gravest offences, you may, in fact, as a result, force us to deal very seriously with a civil servant when we do not want to do so at all.</P>
    <P>Consider a simple example, coming near Christmas.  Christmas is a time at which it has happened that people have taken slightly more than was good for them.  It is reprehensible, but, at the time of Christmas, it is <Col N="1209" /> understandable.  A person comes into a post office in that condition. Obviously, he cannot be retained to do the work there in that post office, and he has to be sent home for the day.  Somebody else has to be employed to do his work for him, whether by way of overtime or otherwise. The power there is in this section enables the postmaster to deal with that situation on the spot and enables the appropriate authority, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, in accordance with the arrangements, to deal with the suspension in a charitable way, shall I call it, having regard to the period of the year.</P>
    <P>If, however, the power of suspension were restricted solely to the gravest cases, then the only way in which one could get a person in that condition out of the post office for the day in question would be to dismiss him and obviously nobody wants to do that. The way in which it has been done in Section 15 enables a charitable view, shall I say, to be taken of a lapse on an occasion like that.  It is a view which all of us would wish should be taken, even though it may be somewhat reprehensible that at any time, Christmas or not, it should happen. We must accept facts as they are and accept the fact that such a thing will sometimes happen.  We hope it will not happen too often.  There is always the danger that if you try to restrict the control of every situation too much, the restriction of that power of control will produce exactly the opposite result to the results everyone spirit that the section has been framed.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Aire na Gaeltachta (Pádraig Mac Loingsigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister for Finance <Col N="1210" /> is engaged in Dáil Eireann, I am instructed by him to take the Second Reading of this Bill.  It is the measure complementary to the Civil Service Regulation Bill, 1956, to which the Minister for Finance referred when dealing with the latter Bill earlier to-day.</P>
      <P>Recruitment to the Civil Service is at present dealt with in the Civil Service Regulation Acts, 1924 and 1926. Certain amendments to these Acts are made necessary by the Civil Service Regulation Bill, 1956&mdash;for example, the Section in the 1924 Act dealing with the making of regulations for the controlling of the Civil Service about which the Minister for Finance spoke on the other Bill has to go.  It has been decided to avail of the opportunity thus presented to carry out a general overhaul of the 1924 and 1926 Acts so as to overcome certain defects which the actual working of the Acts has brought to light and to introduce some improvements in procedure.  The Civil Service Commissioners Bill, 1956, will, accordingly, replace and supersede the Civil Service Regulations Acts, 1924 and 1926.</P>
      <P>Whilst the Civil Service Commissioners Bill is a fairly long and detailed measure, it does not seek to change in any way the principles governing recruitment to the Civil Service.  The general framework of the 1924 and 1926 Acts is retained.  Recruitment will be in the hands of independent Civil Service Commissioners appointed by the Government.  The principle of compensation is reaffirmed and the Commissioners are given a regulation-making power which will enable them to determine the precise form of competition.</P>
      <P>The power to make appointments in the public interest which was provided for in the 1924 and 1926 Acts is retained.  It has been thought well, however, to provide that, instead of requiring a person approved for established appointment in the public interest to undergo the process of obtaining a certificate of qualification from the Civil Service Commissioners, he should be deemed, on appointment, to possess such a certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also contains some new <Col N="1211" /> material about appointments in the unestablished groups.  This, however, is really a rounding-off of the provisions of the existing Acts about corresponding established appointments and is intended to fill certain lacunae in the 1924 and 1926 Acts.</P>
    <P>As in the case of the Civil Service Regulation Bill, I do not think an account of this Bill's various sections is called for at this stage and such detailed information as is required can more conveniently be given on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I might, however, say a few words about Section 27 (3), which is new.  It provides that a Special Commissioner of Income Tax appointed under the Income Tax Act, 1918, will be appointed to an unestablished position in the Civil Service unless the Minister for Finance determines that such appointment should be to an established position.</P>
    <P>Appointed Special Commissioners of Income Tax, that is, as distinct from the Revenue Commissioners, who are ex-officio Special Commissioners, have very important duties, which are semi-judicial in nature&mdash;they act as an appellate tribunal for hearing appeals against income-tax, surtax and corporation profits tax assessments. Special Commissioners have been appointed from within the Civil Service and from outside it, but it has never been quite clear that persons appointed from outside the service could be taken as appointed to Civil Service positions.  Section 27 (3) removes this doubt.</P>
    <P>Where non-civil servants are appointed to carry out the important duties of Special Commissioners, they must be barristers or solicitors of standing.  It is important from the point of view of recruiting Special Commissioners that the Minister for Finance should be able to offer a pensionable appointment&mdash;if he thinks this necessary.  Section 27 (3) enables this to be done.</P>
    <P>The remaining changes in the Bill are of a minor order and are designed to overcome administrative difficulties revealed by experience and to clarify <Col N="1212" /> the functions of the Civil Service Commissioners in certain respects.</P>

    <P>Having said those few words in Irish, I do not think there is any great need for me to say much in English. I have referred briefly to the duties and responsibilities of the Civil Service Commissioners.  No doubt in this State they will always be men of integrity. They have proved to be such down through the years and while there may be people in the country who imagine that pressure can be brought to bear on these, I am certain that no such thing can happen and that entrance to the Civil Service will always be conducted through open competition. As Senators know, there is also an oral test.  I do not know if I am quite in order in referring to this, but I think that as far as possible these oral tests should be conducted through the medium of Irish.  That is the way to spread the use of the Irish language among young civil servants.  I do not <Col N="1214" /> know if it could be possible to have some arrangements by which the speaking of Irish within the Civil Service could be encouraged in after years.</P>
    <P>I am also sure that these Civil Service Commissioners will always be people interested in the advancement of the Irish language and that they will give every opportunity to intending civil servants to make use of the Irish language.  There is really no new principle in this Bill for, as I said, the principle of open competition is being preserved.  In regard to this proposed amendment in connection with people appointed from time to time in the public interest, I think the amendment, if I could call it an amendment, is a welcome one, because now it will be necessary under this Bill for these people who are to be appointed in the public interests to get a certificate of qualification from the Civil Service Commissioners.  Am I to take it that this is the case?</P>

      <P>There is just one matter I should like to raise.  The Bill provides <Col N="1215" /> for the establishment of the Civil Service Commissioners and I think it would be absolutely desirable, and even essential, that any persons appointed to that tribunal should undertake, and should be prepared to undertake, that they have never been and are not members of any secret society, such as the society of Freemasons or the Kinghts of St. Columbanus, or any other organisation of that kind which would be concerned with appointments and the membership of which might to some extent influence their discretion and impartiality.  That should be a rule absolutely binding and inflexible. Not only should persons who are appointed not be members of either of these societies or any similar society, but they should be persons who have never been members of such societies.  That is essential for the protection of impartiality in the making of appointments, in the selection of candidates and the making of rules governing appointments.</P>

      <P>One brief word arising out of the remarks of Senator Kissane where he suggested that the oral interviews for admission to the Civil Service should be conducted through the medium of Irish.  I am prepared to support Senator Kissane in that suggestion to this extent, that there should be two oral examinations taking place at such an interview, one to ensure that the would-be civil servant is capable of speaking Irish and the second one to make certain that he is also capable of speaking English and speaking it correctly.  We must remember that the work which civil servants have to conduct in their capacity as civil servants with the general public is by and large conducted through the medium of the English language.  That may be regrettable, but we must face facts.  It is absolutely essential that our civil servants, in addition to having a knowledge of Irish, should have a perfect knowledge of English, be able to speak it well and write it well and correctly.</P>

I hope the Minister and anyone else who will hear what this House has to say will bear in mind the fact that one of the things which is doing most damage to our nation at the moment is the existence of these conflicting secret societies and I do hope the Minister and other Minister will do all in their power to prevent their gaining any control of the national economy, or of the politics of the country.  If not, the most just thing to do would be for the Minister to appoint one member of each of the two conflicting secret societies if he does not see his way to excluding both.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make only two points on this Bill.  One is in relation to Section 15.  I notice that in sub-section (3) of Section 15, there is reference to the various types of tests and examinations which may be conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners.  Senator Kissane has already urged the necessity for an oral examination in Irish.  I would not go the whole hog with him there, but I would agree with what is the uniform practice of the Civil Service Commissioners, that, when the test includes a test in a living language, the Civil Service Commissioners treat the living language as a living language, and always conduct an oral test in it.  That seems to me to be an excellent thing.  They treat not merely French, German, Spanish and Italian but Irish as a living language.  I should <Col N="1217" /> like to feel that that spirit might soon be taken up and imitated by the Department of Education, which, as you know, from the point of view of examinations, treats Irish exclusively as a dead language.</P>
      <P>The second point I want to make is in relation to Section 16.  I will not delay the Seanad because I have already made the same point on the previous Bill.  It relates to the question of excluding women from certain posts.  Under sub-section (2) of Section 16, paragraph (b) permission is given to the commissioners to confine the competition to &ldquo;a specified class&rdquo; of persons, and so on, allowing them in fact to exclude women, and paragraph (c) which follows, that allows them to exclude a female candidate from the competition, if she be married. Both of these paragraphs, which provide that women candidates shall be unmarried or a widow, seem to infringe upon the ordinary citizenship rights of women and ought to be removed.  It is high time we grew up in this country in our attitude to women, and gave them the equality of status which is frequently talked about, but which, in practice, is too frequently denied them, as it is in the terms of the two paragraphs to which I have referred.</P>

I myself did not quite realise until the last moment that we were going to discuss this in Committee right now.  I am a little disappointed that we cannot have included with the Minister for Agriculture, sanitary authority or dairyman, the name just &ldquo;consumer&rdquo;.

      <P>I think, on reflection, the Senator may realise that the appropriate remedy for a consumer, if he suspects that there is something amiss, <Col N="1222" /> would be to go to the medical officer of the district, to a member of the local authority or somebody of that kind who would move the authority.  An analysis of each sample must be carefully done and it is a reasonably costly business, and if everybody could send in samples frivolously, maliciously or otherwise the whole procedure might become disreputable, whereas if a responsible person or any other citizen approaches the medical officer, a member of the local authority or an officer of the local authority, it is wellnigh impossible that we would be unable to get the responsible party to insist on the analysis being made.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann considers that, in the light of the Report of the Inquiry into the proposal to terminate the three Common Services provided by the Great Northern Railway Board, these lines should not be closed.&rdquo;&mdash;(Senator Murphy).</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the purpose of moving this motion was to enable the House to express its views on the situation which has been created by the proposal of the Six-County Government to close three branch lines which are regarded as <Col N="1224" /> cross-Border services or services common to both Administrations. When the Minister for Commerce in Belfast approached me, with a view to securing my assent to the closing of these three lines, I told him that, I was opposed to the closing of the lines and that I felt instead that the G.N.R. Board should be given an opportunity of trying out light diesel cars on these lines, in the belief that in that way the lines could be made economic and that in any case the contributive value of these lines to the main railway line would be enhanced.  I put to Lord Glentoran at that time the consideration that the closing of the lines would cause considerable dislocation in the areas concerned, that it would deny the G.N.R Company the benefit of the income which came from these lines to the company proper and that when one considered the alternatives of providing road services, with the capital cost involved, the cost of maintaining roads to take the traffic which would be diverted from the railways, the consequent increased expenditure on the roads, the situation which would thus arise, was in my view, likely to be one in which very little real saving would be effected by closing the lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasised, too, that the closing of the lines might mean very considerable redundancy for workers employed not only on the lines concerned but for people who were maintained as employees of the railway company because these lines operated.  In other words, the cutting-off of some of these cross-Border services may well have repercussions of a serious character far removed from the area of operation of these branch lines.  For example, the workers at Dundalk might seriously be affected in consequence of the closing of a branch line 40, 50 or 80 miles from Dundalk.  I urged these considerations but the view of the Six-County Government was that they had made up their minds to close these branch lines.  I said I could not consent to that proposal.  I suggested that the machinery of the 1953 Act should be availed of to have the matter referred to the joint chairmen of the Transport Boards in the Six Counties and here.  The chairmen ment.  They examined the whole matter.  They invited evidence.  Having <Col N="1225" /> considered the matter at considerable length, the chairman of the Six-County Tribunal reported in favour of closing the lines.  The chairman of the Twenty-Six County Tribunal reported against closing the lines.</P>
    <P>The situation has now been reached in which the Minister for Commerce in Belfast has said that his Government proposes to go ahead with closing these three branch lines.  That is a very vital matter so far as the people employed on the railway lines are concerned.  It is a very vital matter from the point of view of those who transport their goods over the three lines.  It may well be for the local ratepayers a matter of considerable importance if they have to pay the cost of making the roads adequate to take the traffic which must now be diverted to the roads if the railway lines are closed.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will appreciate that the issues involved in the decision of the Six-County Government are very important so far as the Government here is concerned.  If the Six-County Government say they will close these three branch lines, that means that they are not going to pay their share of the cost of operating these three lines.  In other words, although the lines serve their people and serve the rate-paying and taxpaying community in the Six-County area concerned, the Six-County Government proposes it will pay no subsidy whatever for the continuance of these railways.  If the railways are continued, therefore, they can be continued only if the Twenty-Six County Government decides it will pay the entire subsidy necessary to keep the branch lines going.</P>
    <P>The position put to the Government here is that if the Six-County Government will not pay its share of keeping these three cross-Border lines going we here must pay the entire cost of doing so.  That would mean not merely subsidising the transport there in so far as it is used by our own citizens but subsidising as well the transport in the Six-County area on behalf of citizens from whom we get no rates and no taxes.  That is bad enough in respect of these three lines but there have been statements that <Col N="1226" /> the Six-County Government will close one of the lines to Derry.  Whether or not it is the coast line that goes from Belfast to Derry or the line from Portadown, via Omagh and Strabane to Derry is something of which I know nothing officially; it may be either of these two lines.  One of the lines going to Derry via the coast is travelling entirely in Six-County territory but the other line is used very largely by our own people for getting to Donegal.</P>
    <P>If the Six-County Government take a decision, for example, to close that line then the question is whether we should provide the subsidy necessary to operate a railway line from Portadown to Derry.  It is a common service between Omagh and Derry but only because a small portion of that line runs into our territory in County Donegal.  But, whatever you do now, presumably you may have to do the same if you are faced with the problem of financing the continuance of that line.</P>
    <P>There again, you are being asked to finance a section of a transport undertaking in the Six Counties although many of those who travel on the line there will be residents of the Six Counties and will not be rate-paying or tax-paying citizens so far as we are concerned.  What is involved in that I could not say because, so far, we have got no notice of intention to close the line though there have been what seemed to me to be ominous rumblings. That is a matter that might have to be considered by the chairman of the Transport, Tribunal in both territories. It may well be that it will be some time before we are faced with that problem.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when you have to consider the situation created by the decision of the Six-County Government to close these three branch lines you cannot consider that in a vacuum. You must consider it in the light of possible future developments.  I am sure it is only necessary to mention these considerations to the Seanad in order that members will realise the importance of the issues involved.  The Government is giving the matter its most careful consideration, especially in the light not merely of what they are being asked to commit themselves <Col N="1227" /> to now but of what they may be asked to commit themselves to in future if they take a decision in a particular way now.  The most I can say to the House is that I will undertake to ensure that the views expressed by Senators on this motion will be brought to the attention of the Government when this matter comes before it for a final decision.  When that will be, it is not possible to say.</P>
    <P>Since these reports were made by the two Chairmen of the Tribunals, there has been a change in the world situation.  Events at Suez have had their repercussions here in the form of a curtailment of the importation of petroleum products.  How severe that will be or how long the restrictions will continue it is not possible to gauge precisely at the present time but, in my view, there has been a change in the general background and in the climate in which the closing of these three lines was considered by the chairmen of the Transport Tribunals.  I believe that that change is sufficient justification to raise now the wisdom of closing these three lines &mdash;going, as we are, into a future which it is not possible accurately to chart.</P>
    <P>Therefore, within the past few days, I have addressed a letter to Lord Glentoran, the Minister for Commerce in Belfast, saying that no doubt he shares my concern at the deterioration in the petroleum products supply position and the serious effects which these shortages have on our respective economies and on our transport services, in particular.  I suggested to Lord Glentoran that, in the light of the critical position that had been reached and in the general uncertainty as to future supplies, I felt that, without prejudice to our respective positions, he might now agree to leave in abeyance, say, until the end of 1957, the proposals&mdash;that is, his own proposals&mdash;for the closing of the three cross-Border lines.  I suggested that, at the end of next year, when we hoped the Suez crisis would have passed and conditions of Irish transport would have resumed their normal complexion, we could look at the whole matter again, and no doubt in the interval we <Col N="1228" /> could consider the question as to whether, having regard to the experience over Suez and the possibility that there might be a Suez from time to time in the foreseeable future, we could look at the problem against a background such as that.</P>
    <P>I hope Lord Glentoran and the Six-County Government will see their way to accept that proposal which I have made, namely, to leave in abeyance until the end of next year the question of closing these three cross-border railways.  If he and his Government can see their way to accept that proposal the immediate difficulties will have been abated for at least 12 months, and in the meantime a new approach to the problem of resuscitating the railways might enable those branch lines to be continued indefinitely in the future.  I have not yet had a reply from Lord Glentoran, but I hope&mdash;and permit myself to believe&mdash;that the suggestion which is being made to him will be very carefully, and I hope, sympathetically, considered by Lord Glentoran and by the Six-County Government.</P>
    <P>Whatever the result, however, of that approach which is being made now to the Six-County Government, I should like to assure the Seanad that the views which have been expressed by Senators on this motion will be brought to the notice of the Government when a final decision as to our line of policy is being taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that, as there has been no opposition whatever, but rather support from all sides of the House for the motion, it is adopted unanimously.  There are just two points I should like to make in reply to the debate and they arise out of the Minister's speech here to-night. The point was made that if we undertake to meet the losses on these three secondary lines, we are, in effect, subsidising the travel of Six-County citizens who pay no rates or taxes to this part of the country.  That, of course, is quite correct, but I want to reiterate the point I made when moving the motion, that we should approach the matter from our own <Col N="1229" /> viewpoint and that is: &ldquo;Are these lines necessary to us?&rdquo;  Is it necessary for the republic to have a rail connection from the rest of the 25 counties to County Donegal and, in doing that, is it cheaper for us in the long run to maintain all these three secondary lines rather than close down all the rail services in three of the nine counties in Ulster?  Is it also better for us that we should maintain the line through Omagh into Portadown in order to provide transport facilities for the big number of cattle that move from the West to the Scottish and main North of England markets?  If, in doing that, we are providing transport facilities also for Six-County citizens, I think we should not have any regrets in that respect.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said, if I understood him aright, that whatever we do now, we would also have to do if the line to Derry were to close.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not &ldquo;have to do?&rdquo; That is just the point.  If you decide at this stage to allow the three secondary lines to close and say: &ldquo;we still have the rail connection via Portadown, Omagh and Strabane to Derry&rdquo;, you will lean on a very weak reed altogether, because if in fact the Northern Ireland Government then propose to close that line to Derry&mdash;on which I am quite satisfied, unfortunately&mdash;the Government here will not have the right to maintain those services.  The line from Portadown to Omagh is not scheduled as a &ldquo;common service&rdquo;.  The Minister will not have the right to say: &ldquo;I want this line kept open and I undertake to meet any losses arising therefrom&rdquo;.  He has not that right.  On the other hand, the Northern Ireland Government if they so wish may allow him to do so; but he has not the right under the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can well imagine that the Northern Ireland Government will not go ahead with the closure immediately, because of the oil situation.  That is to be understood and I am glad that the Minister has taken up the matter as he has done with Lord Glentoran in Northern Ireland.  I wish to say how grateful I am for the Minister's contribution <Col N="1230" /> to this debate and his attitude throughout all this crisis on the G.N.R.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to thankt the Senators who have spoken and who have supported the motion.  There has been no opposition whatever.  I would not have expected opposition really, but it is good that there was such unanimity on all sides of the House on this rather difficult and complicated problem.</P>

    <Title>Waterford Gas Order&mdash;Motion of Approval (Resumed).</Title>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Crotty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Gas regulation Act, 1920, enables the Minister for Industry and Commerce to extend the powers of statutory gas undertakings by a Special Order, which, before it is made must be laid in draft before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas may, by Resolution, approve the draft Order in the form submitted or may approve it with modifications or additions.  Under the Gas Regulation (Special Orders) Rules, 1940, a gas undertaking desiring to obtain fresh powers is required to give public notice of its intention to apply for the making of the Order.  If there are any objections to the making of the Order the Minister may direct the holding of an inquiry, in the light of which he may modify, or refuse to make, the draft Order.</P>
      <P>The City of Waterford Gas Company have applied to the Minister for a Special Order altering certain provisions of the City of Waterford Gas Acts and Orders, 1858 to 1949.</P>
      <P>The following are the principal objects of the proposed Special Order:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  To increase the authorised capital of the company from £80,400 to £250,000.  The additional capital of £169,600, which may be raised by way of Ordinary stock or Preference stock, is required for the renewal and extension of the company's plant, the extension of supply mains to new housing areas in Waterford and the repayment of a bank overdraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1231" /> (ii)  To increase the borrowing powers of the company to an amount not exceeding the aggregate amount of the paid-up capital of the company. The additional borrowing powers may be exercised by the issue of debentures or debenture stock.  A development programme commensurate with such a considerable increase in its borrowing powers is not immediately contemplated by the company.  They wish, however, to obviate the necessity for seeking increased borrowing powers from time to time and are bringing these powers into line with common commercial practice by relating the permitted borrowing to the amount of paid-up share capital of the concern.</P>
    <P>(iii)  To increase from £3,000 to £12,500 the maximum amount which can be set aside out of the net profits of the company in any year towards a redemption fund, to be applied in redeeming any loans, mortgages or debentures raised by the company.</P>
    <P>(iv)  To authorise the continuing directors to act notwithstanding any vacancy in their number, provided that, if the number of directors holding office is less than three, they shall not act except for the purpose of filling a vacancy.  The City of Waterford Gas Act, 1858, fixes the number of directors of the company at not less than three and not more than five.</P>
    <P>(v)  To authorise the company to capitalise undistributed profits, by making an issue of ordinary stock to be distributed by way of bonus to the holders of the consolidated stock of the company.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the statutory requirements, notice of their intention to apply for the Order was given by the City of Waterford Gas Company. Notice was given (a) by publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in a local paper and (b) by sending copies to Waterford Corporation, Waterford County Council, the E.S.B., and certain Government Departments.  No objection to the making of the Order has been received.</P>
    <P>The draft Order is in a form acceptable to the City of Waterford Gas Company, and I now move that the <Col N="1232" /> House formally gives its approval to it by passing the resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for this explanation which answers some of the questions I had in mind and which arose from my reading of this Order.  I notice that the Parliamentary Secretary said at the beginning that it was a draft Order which we have the right to alter, if we see fit.  The section of the 1920 Act under which the Minister is making this Order states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Before any special Order under this Act is made, it shall be laid in draft before both Houses of Parliament, and such Order shall not be made unless both Houses, by resolution, approve the draft, either without modification or addition or with modifications or additions to which both Houses agree.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary has made it clear that it is within our competence to modify this draft Order, or to add to it.  I notice, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, on page 3, that there is a decision to limit the dividend rate&mdash;I am referring now to Section 5 sub-section (1)&mdash;to 7 per cent. That seems to me to be too high.  I am in favour of the principle of limiting the dividend for such a public utility as this, but I would contend that 5 per cent. is quite sufficient in a public utility concern of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be in order for me to argue here that this kind of service should be in municipal hands, but I think I can contend that a 5 per cent. dividend maximum is quite sufficient, from a public utility, where the price of the commodity, gas in this case, is very closely related to the public welfare.  It is a fact that in Dublin at one time there was an agreed sliding scale, and a practice&mdash;which I am afraid no longer operates&mdash;whereby, if the company wished to increase the dividend above a certain amount, they had to decrease the price of gas per therm by, I think, one-fifth of a penny for every ? per cent. increase in dividend. I think that is a good principle, if we say to a gas company: &ldquo;You want to increase your dividend and we <Col N="1233" /> should like to see that linked with a reduction in the price.&rdquo;  That gives them an incentive to reduce the price. That is quite an agreed principle in relation to gas price regulation, and if it is found possible by the gas company to reduce the price then I think the public will readily agree to the raising of the dividend rate.  The rate of dividend being paid in Dublin now is something like 7 per cent. with the price somewhere less than 2/- a therm. I think it is 1/10½ a therm.  The maximum dividend allowed in Cork, I think, is 8 per cent. which I would feel is high, although I think the dividend they pay in practice is 7 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to grant that the price of the shares, if they drop very considerably, might make it a service to the shareholders, if the municipal authority said: &ldquo;You have carried this heavy burden too long, and we will relieve you of it from now on.&rdquo;  I would suggest then that the dividend which is proposed in this draft Order is too high.  We have been told by the Parliamentary Secretary that the reason for the issue of the new stock is the proposed extension of the company's service to new housing estates and possibly for increased industrial use, and &ldquo;to pay off the bank overdraft.&rdquo; The total sum involved, the total stock, if we adopt this Order is going to be £250,000.  In other words there is a very considerable increase of new stock amounting to £169,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he could give us some indication&mdash;I think the suggestion is that the company is not in too good a state at present&mdash;as to what way <Col N="1234" /> the net profit has been over the last few years, just to let us see whether there has been an increase, or a decrease and whether the company is really in a bad way or not.</P>
    <P>I notice that it is implicit in this sub-section that I have just quoted, that the rate of dividend declared must not exceed 7 per cent.  I think it is a good thing that the rate of profit in such a concern should be controlled, but I also notice that on the page 6 of this draft Order there is a method of distributing more profit by a concealed means.  The dividend is &ldquo;controlled&rdquo;, but in Section 15 the company &ldquo;may in general meeting from time to time by resolution capitalise the undistributed profits of the company by making an issue of ordinary stock to be distributed by way of bonus to the holders....&rdquo;  That is a way, in Section 15, of getting around what has been carefully &ldquo;precluded&rdquo; in the earlier sections.  You say: &ldquo;You must not give a bigger dividend than 7 per cent.,&rdquo; so they pile up some &ldquo;undistributed profits&rdquo;, and then the company can distribute those profits, not as a dividend, because that would be against the terms of the Order, but as a &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; to the holders of stock, by &ldquo;capitalising the undistributed profits&rdquo;!</P>
    <P>My contention is that such reserves of &ldquo;undistributed profits&rdquo; would be a sign that the price of gas has been too high because if after the payment of the maximum dividend of 7 per cent. the company has been piling up reserves of undistributed profits you are indicating that the company has been running in such a way as to pile up profits at the expense of the consumers. They have been charging too much.  I would be all in favour of the distribution of these undistributed profits, in the form of bonuses by price reduction, to the people whose money went to make those undistributed profits, that is to say, the gas consumers. That is why I should like to see the variation of the dividends rate up and down linked with the price of gas, so that we shall not be able by a devious route to get around what is apparently a dividend level control, but through which a coach and four can be driven <Col N="1235" /> at &ldquo;a general meeting of the company from time to time&rdquo; under Section 15.</P>
    <P>It was contended at an inquiry into a similar situation in Dublin in June, 1955, that to make a dividend maximum of 7½ per cent. for the Dublin Gas Company would cause &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; to the shareholders.  I am afraid I do not share that view.  We hear a lot of talk about austerity.  We must &ldquo;tighten our belts&rdquo; and we must &ldquo;save money&rdquo;.  We must &ldquo;be content with less&rdquo; than may be needed by us to meet the rising cost of living, and so on.  If all that is sincere, I should like to feel that it applies equally to shareholders, equally to those who are seeking their profits from invested money and I feel that any indignation at such a suggestion on my part&mdash;that dividend rates be controlled&mdash;is out of place in the conditions in Ireland to-day.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask two questions in relation, first of all, to page 2.  I notice that Section 3 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The several words and expressions to which meanings are assigned by the Acts wholly or partially incorporated... have the same respective meanings, unless there be something in the subject or context repugnant to such construction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That seems to me to say precisely nothing.  These words shall have the same meaning as they used to have before, unless they have a different meaning!  I should like to hear an example, making it clear what is meant.  If we are to pass the Order in this form, we ought to be told something more about what we are passing. The &ldquo;meaning of the words&rdquo; is to be the same as it always was, except that occasionally it may be different!  I am prepared to admit that there may be some simple explanation for that, but in such a case it ought to be given to us.</P>
    <P>I personally should like to propose changes in this Order.  I should like to propose modifications, but I am in your hands, Sir, as to the form in which I can make such proposals.  The two proposals I have specially in mind <Col N="1236" /> are the proposal that 7 per cent is too high and that it should be 5 per cent.  I should like to propose also that the dividend rate be linked, by means of a sliding scale, to the price of gas. Where the dividend goes up, the price of gas must come down.  I should like also to propose a third modification, the elimination of this clause 15, which allows &ldquo;undistributed profits&rdquo; to accumulate and then to be distributed in the form of what are really concealed dividends, namely, bonuses to shareholders.</P>

      <P>On a point of order.  I understood both from Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, and from the opening words of the Parliamentary Secretary, that we have the right either to modify it or to add to it.  Section 10 provides:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...such Order shall not be made unless both Houses, by resolution, approve the draft, either without modification or addition or with modifications or additions to which both Houses agree...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would respectfully submit that we have, therefore, the right to &ldquo;modify&rdquo;.  It is implied right at the head of this Order under which the Minister exercises the power conferred on him by Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920.  I would suggest we have the power to modify or to add to the draft.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to propose that the House adopts this motion.  I do not intend to follow Dr. Sheehy Skeffington over all the paths through which he took us just now.  I know Senator Sheehy Skeffington is a very idealistic person and we all give him full marks for his beliefs.  However, every suggestion he made in connection with this motion was both unpractical and unrealistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole point is that this is a company looking for money, for people's savings.  There is only one way in which you can get people to invest their savings, that is, by giving <Col N="1237" /> them a reasonable reward for the money they invest and the moneys they have saved.  It is quite unrealistic to talk about getting money at 5 per cent. in the present state of affairs.  I believe that 7 per cent. is the very least that could be offered in present day circumstances in an undertaking which has a high element of risk.  We all know that the gilt-edge securities at the moment are offering far more than 5 per cent, and, as well as that, people having invested their money even in gilt-edge securities find that, after a short time their capital has very heavily depreciated.  Therefore, how much more risk does one undertake in putting one's savings into a purely commercial undertaking?</P>
    <P>There is only one way the money could be got under the terms which Senator Sheehy Skeffington proposes and that is by force, but in a free, private enterprise economy, or a fairly free economy such as we have here at present, the terms proposed in this Order are reasonable and they have taken due cognisance of the consumer. In fact, the consumer will get nothing from an organisation, unless it is run on sound financial and business lines. The first thing that would happen if Senator Sheehy Skeffington's proposal were accepted would be that no money at all would be got put and the company would not be able to expand or carry on its business.  Therefore, I support this motion and I would like the House to support it also and to reject the proposal of Senator Sheehy Skeffington.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer Senator ffrench O'Carroll, I do not know the amount which is required for repayment of the present overdraft by the company.  The company has expanded its business considerably, and I suppose it has raised an overdraft to cover that expansion in recent years, and it requires this new capital to continue the expansion and to pay off the <Col N="1238" /> bank overdraft which has financed that expansion to the present time.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington made a point about limiting the rate of dividend to 5 per cent.  The present shares of the Waterford Gas Company have a limit of 7 per cent. and I do not think you could bring down the new stock to a lesser rate than is given at present.</P>
      <P>The Alliance and Dublin Gas Company pay a 7 per cent. dividend and still their shares at the present time in the Dublin Stock Exchange stand somewhere about 15/- per £1 share.  I feel that in those circumstances it will be very hard for the Waterford Gas Company to raise money on the open market at the ordinary rate.  They will not have a very easy job doing it.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington commented on the wording of Article 3. The wording referred to has been approved by the Parliamentary draftsman. It is in the form which appears frequently in Orders of that sort.  It is intended to have the same meaning as in gas legislation generally, unless it is intended that it have some other meaning than in the context.</P>
      <P>There was a question raised about item 15, that the company could capitalise undistributed profits.  This company is subject to profit control and its accounts are examined in the Control of Profits Section of the Department of Industry and Commerce and I can guarantee to the Seanad that they will not be allowed to build up reserves of that kind, to capitalise them afterwards.</P>

      <P>For the present time and for some years to come there will not be such profits, but times may change in years to come and that provision is made there in case there should be undistributed profits at some future date.</P>

      <P>The Dublin dividend is linked with the relatively low price of gas, and I should not be surprised if the Waterford price were more.  It was 6 per cent. in Dublin some time ago, but when they got the right to increase the dividend they brought down the price of gas slightly. I should like to propose three modifications of this Order.  I should like to propose the deletion of Section 15&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Senator will have to get the approval of the House to move these modifications. Notice should be given of any intention to amend the motion.  The House may give that permission on short notice.  It is a matter for the House.</P>

      <P>But we have not had any other stage.  The Parliamentary <Col N="1240" /> Secretary has made it clear that power is given to each House to modify this Order.  It is only a draft Order.  I would plead with the House to give me the right to propose these modifications, and I think it would be wrong to say that I should not be in order in doing so.</P>

      <P>I would not agree with Senator Sheehy Skeffington's view of the various matters he mentioned, but I would strongly uphold his right to put down amendments.  It is deplorable that we should not give Senators the right to propose an amendment. The Order came into our hands only yesterday and what notice a Senator could possibly give, I do not know.  We had no explanation until we got it now from the Parliamentary Secretary and it seems it is only at that stage that the Senator could make up his mind as to whether he wanted to move an amendment or not.  It is not right to say that we pass these Orders without making amendments or modifications. There is legislation providing for that and any Senator should get the opportunity of moving such amendments.</P>
