      <P>That can be done after the order of business.  It is intended to take business as on the Order Paper, except that No. 3&mdash;Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill, 1955 &mdash;will not be taken to-day.  Since No. 5 will, I think, in accordance with practice, be referred to a Special Committee, No. 6, the motion, will certainly be reached to-day.  On the Adjournment to-day, I think we will have to adjourn <i>sine die.</i>  The next business will be the Finance Bill and it will not be ready for some weeks.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;I wish to give notice of my intention to raise the following matter <Col N="120" /> on the adjournment of to-day's sitting:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To call the attention of the Minister for Local Government to a recent report in the public Press to the effect that he had stated publicly that universities were the curse of the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My ruling on that is that the Minister for Local Government has no function whatever in regard to universities and, so, I do not propose to permit the matter to be raised.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, may I inquire whether, if Senator McHugh's notice to raise the matter on the Adjournment was put down with regard to the Minister for Education, it would have been in order?  It seems to be a statement which certainly should be brought before the Oireachtas and I should simply like to know would it be in order, if it were put before the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section, may I repeat a question I addressed to the Parliamentary Secretary on the Second Reading?  We have here reference to inspectors of ships.  I asked him whether there are any powers under other legislation to prevent ships from discharging general rubbish in port.  I drew the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to a flagrant abuse of that function in a foreign port which I saw recently.  I should very much dislike our Irish ports to be polluted by general rubbish in the way in which that Greek port was polluted.  It is not directly bearing on this Bill, but I would ask if these inspectors have rights under other legislation to prevent such general pollution of our ports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Crotty)</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a matter for the harbour authorities to make by-laws to prevent pollution by the throwing of refuse into the ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary consider whether it might be well to have general legislation to cover that abuse?  When there is an Act of Parliament condemning an abuse, it makes the harbour master's position very much stronger than if he has to depend on local bylaws. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into that matter, with a view, possibly, to introducing legislation along those lines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (7), line 35, to delete &ldquo;as respects&rdquo;, and, in line 36, to delete &ldquo;that such person is&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;to be&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is simply to remove a clumsy phrase in the wording of the Bill and to substitute for it wording which seems to me to be simpler.  As the clause stands at present, it reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A member of the Garda Síochána or of the Defence Forces may arrest without warrant any person as respects whom he has reasonable grounds for believing that such person is a person directed to be interned...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It seems to me it would be simpler to say &ldquo;...may arrest without warrant any person whom he has reasonable grounds for believing to be a person directed to be interned...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Apart from the obvious improvement in clarity, I would also submit that &ldquo;as respects whom&rdquo; is not a legitimate phrase to be used at all.  I think we might say &ldquo;with respect to whom&rdquo; but &ldquo;as respects whom&rdquo;, I find hard to accept in any circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="Minister for Defence (General MacEoin) Seán (Major-General) Mac Eoin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (General MacEoin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on the Second Reading, this is the Parliamentary Draftsman's method of expressing what is desired.  It is very difficult for me to decide between two experts upon the use of the language in which this is now put.  I am informed it is in accordance with usual legal practice to phrase it in that way.  I am also told that, when it is translated into <Col N="123" /> Irish, it will have the meaning which it is desired it shall have.  I have no strong views on the matter, except to say that the Parliamentary Draftsman submits it in this way.  He is the expert on that type of language.  I feel I should accept what the expert says is the correct way to do it.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, if the Seanad feel that Senator Sheehy Skeffington's phraseology is more direct, as I think it is myself, I have no kick against it one way or the other.  I do not think there is any great need to change the wording when the Parliamentary Draftsman says that this is the correct way.  I am advised that the words are in accord with the language used in statutes and is precise and accurate. That is the advice which I have been given.  It would not be fair to ask me to adjudicate between the Parliamentary Draftsman, on the one hand and Senator Sheehy Skeffington, on the other, as to who is right.  I will leave it to the House, but I would ask the House to accept the Parliamentary Draftsman's decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I would support this amendment.  I think it is an improvement in English and in clarity. In 99.9 cases of out 100, the Parliamentary Draftsmen are right, but occasionally I think they happen to be wrong.  Occasionally, I think they happen to be tied too much by tradition. If we pass this now, it will go on to the next Act of Parliament and so <i>ad infinitum.</i> If we improve it now, I think we would be doing a good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I would strongly support the amendment.  As the wording stands, it is certainly not English.  I do not know what language it is.  I think the words are quite meaningless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the meaning of sub-section (7) is that a member of the Garda Síochána may arrest a person who is a person directed to be interned but who has not been successfully interned at the moment.  It is intended to catch two classes of persons&mdash;(1) a person directed to be interned who is in fact not interned, or has never been interned, and (2) a person who has been interned but <Col N="124" /> escaped.  If that is so, it seems to me that the wording in the amendment is absolutely sound for accomplishing that purpose.</P>
      <P>I am not saying I have read every Bill that has ever appeared before the Dáil, but I have read a great many Bills.  I have no recollection of ever seeing this rather curious phrase &ldquo;as respects whom&rdquo; combined with the cumbersome expression &ldquo;that such person is a person&rdquo;.  The Minister made an allusion to translation into Irish.  Before translating it into Irish, they would probably put it into the English of the amendment and then translate it into Irish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this section for the reasons I put before the Seanad on the Second Stage. The Minister, in originally introducing this to us, told us that this was, in the main, a Bill for the purpose of implementing certain international conventions and bringing us into line with the practice in other countries where such conventions had been ratified, but in Section 8 of the memorandum accompanying this Bill, it is said that the Civilians Convention on which this Bill is based does not specifically provide for trial of enemy aliens by military courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the section we are asked to include in the Bill is to allow enemy aliens, charged with an offence and already interned, to be tried, not by the ordinary courts, but by a military tribunal.  The memorandum accompanying this Bill admits that this portion of the Bill is not for the purpose of implementing the international convention, but that there is something <Col N="125" /> added to it by this Bill.  The memorandum pleads the case that, since the convention which we are trying to implement does not specifically preclude military tribunal, &ldquo;it is obviously desirable that there should be power in certain circumstances to bring enemy aliens before military courts.&rdquo;  This is a measure which is brought in by the back door, so to speak.</P>
    <P>We are told that the justification for the Bill is that the international convention agreed to do certain things. Then we find a section which has nothing to do with the international convention, and the most the Minister can say in extenuation of it is that at least the international convention does not prohibit it.  There are a lot of things which it does not prohibt and yet does not recommend.  The memorandum says: &ldquo;It is obviously desirable&rdquo;.  I do not see it as being &ldquo;obviously desirable.&rdquo;  If an enemy alien has been interned, I do not see any reason, if he commits an offence, why he should not be tried by the ordinary processes of law.</P>
    <P>I would be very suspicious of granting this power to any Minister to deal with such a man by military tribunal. Furthermore, I do not think that such a Bill as this is the place to introduce a principle of this kind.  Therefore, I am opposed to the whole section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Sheehy Skeffington, not so much on the principle that aliens might not be tried by military court, if an emergency arose, but because I think that this is a matter which, if it is done, should be done under emergency legislation when the emergency occurs.  I think it is undesirable that, in a Bill forming part of the ordinary law of the country, there should be provision that such cases should be referred to any court other than the ordinary courts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be remembered that when this provision takes effect there will be a state of war in existence and that the persons likely to be charged before a military court may already be in a military <Col N="126" /> camp.  Therefore, it is only reasonable to provide that, if the Minister so directs, any offence committed shall be tried by a military court.  The Constitution lays down in Article 38, that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Military tribunals may be established for the trial of offences against military law alleged to have been committed by persons while subject to military law and also to deal with a state of war or armed rebellion.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That Article of the Constitution authorises the setting up of military tribunals generally.  It is very difficult to see how a civil court could automatically handle the situation having regard to the state of war then existing and also as the person concerned may be in a military internment camp.  I feel it may not always be possible to have recourse to a civil court in the ordinary way.  If you delete this provision, you are creating difficulties for everyone concerned and in the circumstances I think it is only reasonable that a military court should, if necessary, have power to deal with these offences because a state of war exists.  You cannot have internment camps unless the state of war exists.  Having had some experience of military courts myself, both from the point of view of appearing before them and on them, they are excellent. I do not think there is any danger of anything going wrong with them.  I think the Seanad should give us the power.  There will be no difficulty about the matter.  If you take it away, you are taking something that we will then have to bring in again when the war is on and it might not be as easy as it looks to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel the point made by Senator Cox is an adequate answer to the last point made by the Minister, that, should the necessity arise during war time, it is quite easy to get emergency legislation and to provide for this contingency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>You would all object to it then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister points out, this deals only with an alleged crime committed by a person <Col N="127" /> already in a camp.  The suggestion that it would not be possible in time of war to have emergency legislation covering this point seems to me to be unreal.  It would be perfectly possible. I agree with Senator Cox that peacetime is not the time to introduce a law giving the Minister power to have an enemy alien, who is interned and accused of an offence, tried by military tribunal, if he thinks fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister so directs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a false principle to admit in peacetime. The Minister himself has already pointed out that such a person would already be under military law. I understand that in this country in the past the chief justification for a military tribunal used to be that the intimidation as was the civil court. That would clearly not apply to the case of an interned enemy alien.  I should like the Seanad to imagine the case in which a serious crime was alleged against such an enemy alien already in captivity and already under the entire control of the military authority.  Supposing he was accused of murdering an officer in the camp, is it not obvious that the whole feeling of the military authorities in control of that prisoner would be strongly prejudiced against a prisoner accused of such a crime?  In fact, such feelings of resentment in such circumstances might even lead them to assume guilt, when it was not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be against the principles of justice to allow the Minister to decide that such accused persons would be tried by a court of people likely to be influenced in such a sense rather than be tried by civilians in a more judicial way.  The Minister pays a great tribute to military tribunals.  I am not prepared to say they are always bad, but I myself would prefer to be tried by a civil court, with all its defects, than by a military tribunal.  If the crime has been committed while the prisoner has been under military control, then I think it is more likely the prisoner will get a fairer trial by <Col N="128" /> a non-military court.  I would persist with my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill can only come into action when a state of war exists.  If I accepted the Senator's view, then we would bring in emergency legislation to set up the military court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>When the state of war exists, it will be done, but the civil courts are not cut out.  Such prisoners can be brought before the civil courts.  This Bill cannot come into operation, unless and until a state of war exists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Or an emergency. At that stage then, if we took the Senator's view, what we would have to do when this difficulty arose would be to bring in emergency legislation. Everybody considers that a very bad thing.  We would then be legislating in a hurry.  We think this is the right time to bring in such legislation so that it will be there, ready, when and if the occasion arises.  I think that is a sensible viewpoint.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Because they may not tell us what exactly we should do in our domestic legislation.  We are setting up the machinery here and having it in readiness for use, should the occasion arise.  The Minister for Justice will bring in another Bill and then we can ratify the whole convention. This is a domestic law, the very same as the Red Cross Act was.  There are several things in the Red Cross Act which were not specifically laid down in the conventions.  The conventions may not take from Parliaments the right to decide their own domestic methods of dealing with these problems.  This Bill is our way of <Col N="129" /> dealing with them and we had to keep the Constitution in mind to make sure that one was in accordance with the other.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry to be in the position of apparently monopolising the committee time, but I feel here, as I said on the Second Stage, that it would not be right to give a member of the Garda Síochána and of the Defence Forces the right under the Bill &ldquo;to arrest without warrant any person as respects whom he has reasonable grounds for believing that such person has contravened sub-section (1) of this section.&rdquo; That is what is provided for under sub-section (3) of Section 8.  This applies not to prisoners of war, not to enemy aliens, but to Irish citizens.  It gives the right to any Civic Guard or to any private soldier the right to arrest an Irish national on suspicion.  I do not like that provision.  I do not think it <Col N="130" /> is wise.  I think Section 8 would be much better without this sub-section. Therefore, I should like to see it deleted.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (3) reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A member of the Garda Síochána or of the Defence Forces may arrest without warrant any person as respects whom he has reasonable grounds for believing that such person has contravened sub-section (1) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The person referred to is one suspected of assisting the escape of an interned prisoner of war or enemy alien&mdash;that is what sub-section (1) of the section says.  The escape of a prisoner of war or of an enemy alien could have very serious results for the whole country and even though the Civic Guard has reasonable grounds to believe that a person has helped in such escape, he is not, according to this amendment, to do anything about it.  When you consider that a pawnbroker has the right to arrest a person who goes in to pawn a watch should he suspect that the watch was stolen it does not seem unreasonable to give a Civic Guard the right to arrest a person who, he suspects, is guilty of the offence set out in sub-section (1).</P>

      <P>I am not concerned with the grim nature of the crime or the appalling consequence of having a prisoner of war released, because I think that is irrelevant.  I do not really care of what crime the Civic Guard or the private soldier suspects the person.  I would like to see him not given the power to arrest on suspicion an Irish national without at least the ordinary civil necessity to show cause and to get a warrant for his arrest.  Furthermore&mdash;and I do not think the Minister dealt with this&mdash; he is asking for power, under a Bill that he is seeking to have called the Prisoners of War and Enemy Aliens Act, to arrest Irish nationals and to arrest them on suspicion and to grant that power of arrest, not to senior officers or even junior officers, but to any private member of the Defence Forces.  I still feel that that is a dangerous sub-section and an unnecessary one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the whole point forgotten in this discussion is that this Bill refers to a state of war and this particular power given to a member of the Garda Síochána or to a private soldier of the Defence Forces is exercisable only in a state of war and only in the kind of circumstances which occur during a war. All this theory about the rights of citizens and about bringing people before courts within certain periods, and so on, may be all very well.  I actually saw, during the last war, an ordinary policeman arresting a person whom he suspected of having done this very thing and it was a very mixed up situation.  It would be quite absurd if he had to send for a senior officer or for an officer of the Defence Forces.  In fact, the Defence Forces arrived too late to capture the prisoner on the particular occasion that I am thinking of.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington cannot be convinced because he is theorising about this whole matter, not relating it to the hard and rather cruel facts.  He used the word &ldquo;grim&rdquo; in a derisive sense. The trouble is that war is a grim thing and it is just too bad but this power is exercisable against Irish citizens during a war only and it does not mean, of course, that the man is <Col N="132" /> dragged away and never comes back. He is arrested and held, but he must be brought to trial, presumably.</P>

I think the power is quite reasonable.</P>

      <P>We hope not indeed, but it might.  The country, we will say, is in a state of war. Any private soldier in Dalkey can come up to my house and say that he suspects me of helping the escape of an enemy alien and lead me away to prison there and then and I have, apparently, little or no redress.  I do think that that would be an outrageous state of affairs.  Even if I have a good solicitor and can get out in perhaps six or seven hours, I can see that it could be misused and I would like to see some safeguards.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that in critical times of that nature, we must take drastic steps.  But this is a matter of degree.  I think the clause goes far in degree.  I would ask the Minister to consider some kind of safeguard that, at least, a high officer of the Civic Guards should have to give some kind of consent, and that at least some ranking officer of the National Army should have to give consent.  I can see that if Private X of Dalkey has a grouse against me&mdash;I do not know of anyone that has, but it is not impossible&mdash;he may deliberately come up and cause trouble against me and anyone else he does not like.</P>

I would ask the Seanad to give this clause careful attention.  I say it is a matter of degree.  I say this goes too far.  I would ask the Minister to see if he could restrict it somehow by the Report Stage just so that, at least, a senior officer of some kind would have some say in the matter.  People lose their sense of proportion in wartime. A private soldier or a Civic Guard may get queer ideas in wartime.  We must safeguard ourselves against that.  I think Senator Sheehy Skeffington's is a reasonable objection, and I hope the Minister might consider some modification of these very drastic powers.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the section as it stands.  There seems to be some confusion between the act of arrest, on the one hand and the trial of the person arrested, on the other.  There are a great many cases in which police officers can arrest without having to get a warrant and I think the kind of events that are envisaged in this section are the same kind of events which would possibly not give time to get a warrant. Furthermore, I do not think that providing that there should be a warrant really helps very much, because it is perfectly obvious that, if there were time for the policeman or the soldier to go to some superior person and say that he suspects so and so and asks to have a warrant issued, he would get it as a matter of course. I think the section is a reasonable one and I think the objections that are raised against it are really met by the fact that anyone who is arrested in this way would have to be brought up immediately before a court and dealt with in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>To carry out what Senator Sheehy Skeffington and Senator Stanford suggest, I would have to make every Civic Guard and every soldier an officer.  Is it imagined that the person who was suspected would wait while the Civic Guard or the soldier ran away to somebody to get the warrant to arrest him? Remember that it is a time of war.  Remember that, under sub-section (2), a person who contravenes <Col N="134" /> sub-section (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction on indictment thereof to penal servitude for any term not exceeding seven years or to imprisonment for any term not exceeding two years.  Therefore, when the Civic Guard or the soldier arrests he has to be indicted and sub-section (2) provides for what will happen to him if he is convicted. If he is not convicted, I presume he will be let out.  It is an authority and a power that should be given to those whose duty it is to protect the State, whether they be private soldiers or commissioned officers, during a time of war.  Remember, it is only during a time of war that the power operates.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the sub-section as it stands goes too far one way and Senator Sheehy Skeffington's amendment goes too far the other way.  The procedure suggested by Senator Stanford appeals to me, because it fixes personal responsibility upon a higher officer.  As against what the Minister has just said, I would suggest that, in such a period of war, emergency powers might be in operation at the same time, enabling the person to be held without trial for, say, nine days.  In such a case, I can visualise Senator Stanford, in the unfortunate circumstances he has imagined, not getting out immediately the solicitor applies, but being held for nine days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a lawyer, and I am not really familiar with what kind of safeguards Senator Cox has in mind for such a person, but I think the point made by Senator McHugh just now, that there might be some kind of compromise reached, would tempt me to think that, even if you granted this power, there ought to be some proviso that such a person shall in fact be charged under sub-section (2).  The Minister tells you that, under sub-section (2), a person who contravenes sub-section (1) shall be guilty of an offence.  There is nothing to say that he shall be charged. If the law required that he had to be charged, then, obviously, he would have to be brought to trial, but all that sub-section (3) says is that he shall be arrested.  There is no obligation on <Col N="135" /> the arresting person to charge him with any offence although it is admitted that, if he is charged and found guilty, he will be punished.  I should like, at least, something added to it, some words to the effect, &ldquo;provided that such person shall be charged with the offence within a reasonable time&rdquo;, or within a prescribed number of days.</P>
      <P>I am a little disturbed by Senator Hayes's attitude.  I am sorry he is not here at the moment.  It seems to me that his respect for the theoretical principles underlying law is just a little bit too vague.  He seems to say that theoretical principles are all very well, provided you do not have to use the law, but, if you have to use the law, you can steamroll any principle of civil liberty or anything else; all you have to do is convince the Minister that it is necessary.  That could have unhappy results and has had unhappy results.  The theoretical principles which underlie the law protecting the citizens have a practical as well as a theoretical value.  Therefore, I should like to see this sub-section at least amended, and to have put into it some proviso that a Civic Guard or a member of the Defence Forces who arrests an Irish national on suspicion shall be obliged to have him indicted within a reasonable time.  If the Minister would agree to introduce such a modification on the Report Stage, I would withdraw my objection to the sub-section.</P>

      <P>If we accept what the Senator has said, if an officer of the Civic Guards or of the Army arrests him, then we presume it is all right, if he is held the nine days, but if a Civic Guard or a private soldier arrests him, he must be tried the next day.  If we were at war, it would be better to have two, three or four people arrested by mistake rather than allow one of these <Col N="136" /> people to escape.  That may be a rather cruel thing to say, but your life is at stake and that soldier's life is at stake and if you are going to be soft with an enemy while you are at war, you will not win.  Kid gloves are no use at that stage.  You must take such steps as are necessary to protect your own interests.</P>
      <P>The Civic Guard is the civil custodian of your rights.  Take away this provision and you are leaving him and the private soldier without the power they require in a case such as this. Under the Criminal Justice Act, a person must be brought to trial.  There might be emergency regulations which would enable a person to be held for nine days but I do not think there will be any such thing.  However, that is a different matter.  Such a regulation, if made, must, again, be made under an Act passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Then, I submit, would be the right time for Senators to object to the lapse of that length of time between the arrest of a person on suspicion and the time he is brought to trial and not now when all we are seeking is the power to make arrests. In the legislation setting up the emergency power, you could then say that any person arrested shall be brought to trial forthwith, or within 48 hours, or as the Criminal Justice Act provides. To take this power of arrest away from the State which is at war would leave us in a very serious situation.</P>

      <P>I support this section as it will stand, with the addition of amendment No. 3 which we shall be discussing later.  I feel that sub-section (3) states that a member of the Garda Síochána or of the Defence Forces shall not arrest a person unless he has reasonable grounds to suspect that the person is guilty of contravening sub-section (1).  I think you will find that most people in the position of a Garda or a private soldier in the Army would not like to come before a court and be found irresponsible in their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that at a time of war no soldier or Civic Guard will arrest a person under this section and bring <Col N="137" /> him before a court&mdash;which the person has a right to go before within, as the Minister said, a very short time&mdash; unless he has very strong grounds for doing so.  I feel that this Bill is dealing purely with an emergency or wartime when conditions are not easy for the Government of the day and I consider that this section is quite satisfactory.</P>

I said I would be satisfied to give those powers, if it was made quite clear in the Bill that such a person would have a right to be indicted within measurable time of the offence of which he was suspected.  That in no way removes power from the member of the Defence Force or the Civic Guard, but it gives protection which, I think, most Senators would be willing to grant.  I do not think the security of the State would be endangered in any way by asking that the indictment be made within a reasonable time.</P>

      <P>The particular clause in the Bill lays it down that: &ldquo;It shall be the function of the Department of the Gaeltacht to promote the cultural, social and economic welfare of the Gaeltacht.&rdquo; My reason for inserting the word &ldquo;actively&rdquo; and asking that the clause should read &ldquo;actively to promote the cultural, social and economic welfare of the Gaeltacht&rdquo; is because the Minister on the Second Stage seemed to me to dismiss rather lightly any suggestions made about real activity to be undertaken. I myself mentioned the question of the economic welfare of the Gaeltacht, and I related it in my mind very closely to the conditions of the people and the welfare of the language there.  Although the economic welfare is included in this sub-section, the Minister seemed to me in his reply rather lightheartedly to dismiss the notion of economic welfare, almost as if he were prepared to have the word in the Bill but did not, in fact, intend to take any particular action on it.</P>
      <P>It seemed to me that that tendency was one to be deplored and that if the Bill is to mean something, and not to be mere window dressing, it must serve the people as well as the language. You cannot have the language unless the people are there, and you will not have the people there unless you save them economically.

The portion of the section says: &ldquo;It shall be the function of the Department of the Gaeltacht to promote ...&rdquo; If you put in the word &ldquo;actively&rdquo; before &ldquo;to promote&rdquo;, you <Col N="141" /> do not add at all to its effectiveness or strength.  You do not in any way put the Minister under more obligation than he is under as the Bill stands at the moment.  The amendment is vexatious and is for the purpose of allowing the Senator to say that the Minister dismissed the idea of the economic welfare of the Gaeltacht.  The Minister did no such thing and no opponent of the Minister anywhere would say that the Minister in question dismissed the idea of the economic welfare of the Gaeltacht.  He did not do any such thing.  If a man is not interested in the economic welfare of the Gaeltacht, he will not become any more interested or more bound by the insertion of the word &ldquo;actively&rdquo;.  The amendment has no meaning.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom freagra do thabhairt ar an Seanadóir Sheehy Skeffington.  Deir sé níos mó ná mar adúirt an Seanadóir Ó hAodha adúirt sé.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington said a <Col N="142" /> lot more than even Senator Hayes implies, because he said that not only did I dismiss the notion of economic welfare, but that I did not, in fact, intend to take any particular action on it.</P>
    <P>If the Senator, apart altogether from any other member of the Seanad, thinks that a new ministry is set up, dismissing the notion that the economic welfare of the Gaeltacht has any relation to the preservation of the language, and if he thinks that I have accepted the responsibility for establishing this ministry and that I came here to tell the Seanad that I did not in fact intend to take any particular action in relation to the economic welfare of the Gaeltacht, then he gives me credit for a lot more never than I think I have.  As far as his amendment is concerned and his use of the word &ldquo;actively,&rdquo; I have had a certain amount of good reason for realising that persons and bodies, very active though they may be, are not without catalytic effect and I would hate to think that an amendment emanated from a university representative in the Seanad that would deprive the new Gaeltacht ministry of ever having a catalytic effect.</P>
    <P>That is not the purpose for which the Gaeltacht ministry is being set up.  It is set up to provide the Minister, sitting in the Cabinet, with qualified officials serving him through an organised ministry, however small, for the purpose of preserving the position of the vernacular langauge in those districts where the language is continuously spoken, and for the purpose of saying in what way any aspect of their economic situation in those areas is preventing the maintenance and the spread of the language as a spoken language.  For that reason, the Bill gives the new Minister authority, in relation to co-operation and consultation with every other Department, to see that any economic assistance that can be made available through any Department will, to the greatest possible extent, be concentrated in the areas where the language is customarily spoken.  Every effort will be used, through the operation of the new ministry, for the purpose of bettering <Col N="143" /> the economic as well as the cultural elements of these people.</P>
    <P>I think it is unworthy of any member of the Seanad to suggest that people who approach the purpose of preserving the language as a spoken language, even at this hour of the day, are window dressing, or that they do not propose to take action of one kind or another.  The purpose for which this ministry is being set up is that, to the greatest possible extent, everything that can be done to deal actively with the problem of the people in the Gaeltacht will be done.</P>

      <P>I am sorry if the word I used was perhaps too strongly interpreted by both Senator Hayes and the Minister.  It seemed to me that the Minister had dismissed rather too lightly the economic question, and what I had in mind was what he said at column 117 of Volume 46, No. 1, of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The economic side will be dealt with in the best way we can, but our hopes are high enough in relation to the well-being of the people in these districts, their capacity <Col N="144" /> to hold on to and develop a free and happy life there and to maintain their language.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was that I had in mind.  I am now satisfied by what the Minister has said that he intends very actively to promote the economic life of the people. I am glad to know that and I think it would be presumptuous of me to say that such a statement was encouraged by the suggested insertion of this word &ldquo;actively&rdquo;.  I am prepared to accept the Minister's assurance that such has been his intention and will be his intention.  I will leave it to the new Department to do everything it can actively to promote the welfare of these people.  I think my amendment is therefore unnecessary.</P>

To say that a man who said that he would do his best is dismissing lightly a particular thing is a gross abuse of language.

      <P>The Bill has got a Second Reading, and the principle enshrined in Section 3 of the Bill has got the agreement of the House.  The principle is the principle of consultation and advice.  It is in general terms. What I would like to ask is whether it it is in order in Committee to insert an amendment which deals necessarily with the administration of the Department of Education?  Might I suggest that it would be in order, therefore, if this amendment is in order, to insert a number of particular examples of consultation and advice for all the Departments, and they are very many, which impinge on the Gaeltacht and the Irish language?  I submit this amendment can only be discussed by entering upon a question relating to the administration of the Department of Education, and that since the amendment involves such a discussion, other amendments of the same kind could be put down, and, in a parliamentary sense, that would surely be a disorderly proceeding and take us entirely out of the scope of this type of Bill.</P>

      <P>I had some difficulty in determining whether or not this amendment was in order, but I finally decided that I would permit the Senator to move the amendment.  I have no idea what arguments the Senator is going to make in exposing his view in regard to this amendment. However, I am not going to anticipate his argument, and if he gets himself out of order, he will have that proclaimed from the Chair, and he is, I am sure, very conscious of that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir.  I feel that, in all good faith, the <Col N="146" /> Senator has concentrated rather too much on one portion of this sub-section which I am endeavouring to have amended.  Part of the purpose was to urge the new Department to consult and advise, but, in the same sub-section, it is stated that the function of the new Department shall be not merely, as we have heard, to promote the cultural, social and economic welfare of the Gaeltacht, but also &ldquo;to encourage the preservation and extension of the use of Irish as a vernacular language.&rdquo;  It does far more than simply suggest that it shall consult with other Departments.  It is for that reason that I felt it worth putting down an amendment in relation to that, to add the words &ldquo;and notably to endeavour to have Irish treated as a living, spoken language at all Department of Education examinations,&rdquo; which are the only examinations over which a Department of State has direct control.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter on the Second Stage, and the Minister, while sympathetic with the notion that it would be a good thing and assuring us that his own Department of Education was going into the question, said, at column 115, that he would like me to</P>
      <P>&ldquo;set out a scheme by which the number of children, boys and girls, going through the Intermediate Certificate and Leaving Certificate examinations would be orally examined in Irish&mdash;in an examination which, so far as the Intermediate Certificate is concerned at any rate, is, to some extent, a competitive examination so far as certain results from that examination are concerned.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The implication there is that, because there is competition in an examination, and because that examination deals with large numbers of children, it would not be possible in this particular way to change the official attitude towards Irish as a spoken language, however much that may be desired.  The Minister went on to speak in column 116 of</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;the extent to which the Department of Education in this country is put to the pin of its collar to provide <Col N="147" /> examiners for the Intermediate and Leaving Certificates, as these examinations stand.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He says that any Senator would understand:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that there might be a little additional difficulty and that if he had to undertake an oral examination it might be the last straw that would break the camel's back.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He adds a little further down in the same column:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While I suffer from the fears of a breakdown of the examination system for the Intermediate and Leaving Certificates, under the strain to which it is subject at present, I am not going to consider in any kind of a practical way... the whole question of oral examinations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I feel disturbed by that, because I feel that there is a misapprehension in the Minister's own Department in relation to the possibility of finding more examiners to examine in Irish.  I should like to put it to the Minister that one way to find more is to pay more.  I reject utterly the suggestion that it is impossible to treat Irish as a vernacular tongue in official State examinations.  The Minister thinks that, with the best will in the world, it is not possible, and that the whole system might break down.  It is because of that doctrine of despair&mdash;he has accused me of being depressed and plunged in despair&mdash;but it is because of his own attitude of despair in relation to the subject that I feel it necessary to put down this amendment, so as to indicate that we do not believe it is an impossible thing, that you cannot find examiners or make arrangements for oral examinations in Irish in the Intermediate and Leaving Certificate examinations.  I believe that if we underwrite that principle and insert it here as part of the function of the new Gaeltacht department, we will be asserting our belief that it can be done, despite the despair in the matter on the part of the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Senator, I think, is getting mixed up in his <Col N="148" /> sequences and on the particular point on which this thing arose.  The Senator broached this question of the examination in Irish originally when we were here on the Second Stage for the purpose of showing that I, as a Minister, had been a failure in certain respects, and that not only did age tell against me in the matter of doing certain things but that there were young men who required to be brought in for a real fresh start, a real drive; and, in column 114, he brought this thing out and showed that this outstanding failure could be written against me.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it sounds as if there was failure stamped in a matter that I was vitally interested in myself and, no doubt, putting all the energies into that I could put.  However, I do not want to misinterpret the Senator, but I do want to recall him to the way in which he started, and then I would ask the Seanad to realise this, that if the position with regard to the Department of Education in relation to the work of the Irish language in the schools and in its examinations, that is, in all the examinations conducted by the Department of Education, is that the treatment of Irish as a living and spoken language is to be dealt with by the Department of Education, that is a subject that is eminently worth discussing in an atmosphere and in circumstances in which you will be responsible for facing up to the details of it, and the implications of it, and the various intricate aspects of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was rather of the opinion from the order point of view, that it was outside the scope of this Bill, but I realise that it could be argued that it is within the scope of the Bill, and if <Col N="149" /> that is so, the list of things within the scope of this Bill could be extended and I leave it to Senators to imagine all the amendments that could be put in in this particular form, notably amendments to endeavour to have Irish treated as a living spoken language.  Senators can fill in all the necessary things after that.</P>
    <P>Indeed, there are other kinds of amendments that could be put in, but it is the wrong place to discuss the matter.  It could not be discussed effectively here and, as I say, it is out of piece with the Bill, constructed as it is.  From the point of view of the Gaeltacht ministry's work and its dealings with the language as a vernacular used inside the Gaeltacht and spreading outside, we are providing machinery for discussion with the Minister for Education, and we have the machinery of the Department of Education for discussion as to what could or should be done in the way of oral examinations, if that is a matter that appears to have any strong or vital influence in maintaining or spreading the language as a vernacular. Again, it is a question of looking for machinery to do work rather than having talk or having something in a Bill pointing a way here and there, which is, as I say, something out of keeping with the structure of the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be grateful if Senators who understand how important an oral examination is in languages, particularly in the Irish language, would give some consideration to the matter and would endeavour to see in what way an oral examination could be worked, even leaving the competitive <Col N="151" /> side of things out, that would strengthen the teaching of the language in the schools.  As far as that is concerned, the Department of Education gives grants for excellence in oral Irish to certain secondary schools, following a particular type of examination, but that is a grant to the school as a whole.  To that extent, something is done in a small way to maintain and to encourage oral Irish in the schools.</P>
    <P>So far as any Senators consider, however, that it would be a good thing&mdash; and I consider that it would be a very good thing&mdash;if we had oral examinations in Irish in relation to the intermediate and the leaving certificate examinations, there is the question of the practicability of doing the work, and the question of having an element of competition in relation to scholarships, as far as the leaving certificate is concerned and there is, no doubt, the question of money.  If that is a matter that, in the mind of any Senator, is worthy of being put in a special place by itself into a Bill dealing with the Gaeltacht, then I consider that it is worth considering and discussing on its merits. As I say, this is not the time for discussion of it, but the Seanad surely is a place where a question of this kind could be discussed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to answer two points.  The first is the question of whether such an amendment comes within the scope of this section.  It seemed to me that the matter is of sufficient importance to be, I will not say singled out because several other important matters are included in the sub-section, but to be specifically mentioned.  I would regard it as fundamental to the proper teaching of any living language that it shall be regarded as a living thing when it comes to testing proficiency in its use.  As I said previously, students in schools and teachers inevitably are largely conditioned by the examination system.  I think perhaps that is unfortunate, but there it is. Consequently, if they know that, in the big examination, there will not be an oral test&mdash;I will not say they do not <Col N="152" /> bother about it&mdash;they stress it rather less than if they knew the children will be tested in oral Irish.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would refer to what I would call the impossibilism of the Minister.  He seems to suggest he is very much in favour of it but there is always some obstacle which he cannot surmount.  There is always something outside his power&mdash;money, or that he cannot get examiners, or that there is a &ldquo;competitive element&rdquo;, or that he does not know how it could be organised. I do not know if the Minister is aware that, under the British General Certificate of Education, it is possible to take Irish as a subject, and that the authorities there regard Irish as a living language and examine in it orally and in written tests.  That also applies in the North of Ireland.  What has been found possible there, and across the water, in relation to Irish, is not possible for us!</P>
      <P>If the Minister says: &ldquo;Yes, but the number of children involved here would clearly be much larger&rdquo;, I would repeat the example I gave before. Look at the French system where they deal with far more children than we do.  They treat every living language, including French, as requiring an oral examination.  Therefore, I would appeal to the Minister to get his advisers to look a little further afield and not to accept it that this is impossible.  The insertion of such an amendment to the sub-section might have a stimulating effect on the new Minister or his successor.</P>

      <P>On the question of being outside the scope of the Bill, I do not know exactly how the Bill, as drafted, constrains in the Seanad, but, certainly the Bill constrains in the Dáil.  I should have thought the amendment outside the scope of the Bill as drafted.  However, the Cathaoirleach has ruled that it is inside the scope of the Bill.  I am not questioning that.  I am not questioning that the spirit in which the Bill is drafted would admit, that there is nothing in the Bill that constrains the Minister for the Gaeltacht from taking an interest in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the second point, the impossibilisms that apparently attach <Col N="153" /> to me in relation to an oral examination, attach very, very much to the members of the Seanad.  If they do not, I should be very glad if the members of the Seanad, feeling that there is a way around these impossibilisms, would direct their minds in a constructive way to this matter because any of the impossibilisms that have been circumvented in the country in one way or another have been circumvented only by a lot of people joining together to get round the difficulty.  Therefore, let the Senator not lie down and say that the Minister is stuffed up with impossibilisms and that one cannot expect anything from him.  In relation to this matter, I can expect anything from the Seanad.</P>

Bíodh is gur dhein mé rún nuair a bhí mé ag teacht anseo inniu ná labharfainn focal Béarla ar an mBille seo, tá orm an rún sin do bhriseadh anois, bíodh is nach gá dhom é sin do dhéanamh, b'fhéidir; ach, mar sin féin, tá an-chuid Seanadóirí anseo nach bhfuil go leor Gaeilge acu chun tuiscint cheart a bheith acu ar na rudaí atá fé dhiospóireacht againn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before we part with this section of the Bill, there is just one other matter which I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister and the Seanad. We have the wording of the Bill here in Irish and in English.  No doubt the objects set forth in the section&mdash; especially in sub-section (2)&mdash;are very worthy ones, but if the present trend of things is permitted to continue in certain directions, I am afraid it will be found difficult to carry out the very worthy objects that are set forth in sub-section (2) of Section 3&mdash;to promote the cultural, social and economic welfare of the Gaeltacht, to encourage the preservation and extension of the use of Irish as the vernacular language, <Col N="154" /> and so forth.  I am afraid that if the present policy being pursued by certain Departments of State is permitted to be continued, it will be found very difficult, if not impossible, to carry out the objects here described.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be up against a certain tendency that has been noticeable in some of the Departments to make use of the English language when they could and should make use of Irish.  Quite recently in the West of Ireland there was a certain competition, Rásaí na gCurrach, the Currach Races, and those participating in the races were Irish speakers.  As far as I can ascertain, Irish was the language of the day.  Everything was grand, but interviewers went down from Radio Éireann to that function and interviewed the people there in English.  That is my information.  That kind of thing should not be tolerated. If that is going to be the policy of Radio Éireann as regards the revival or the restoration of the Irish language, then the sooner Radio Éireann is dealt with the better.  I just want to put that matter before the Minister as an example of how another Department of State can nullify the efforts made to preserve and spread the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Sin a bhfuil agam le rá ar an bpointe sin anois.  Tá súil agam go gcuirfidh an tAire é sin fé bhráid an Aire eile, an tAire Poist agus Telegrafa go bhfuil sé de chúram air an Radio sin do scrúdú agus, ní hamháin gan scaoileadh leis na rudaí atá i gceist agam, ach feabhas do chur ar an ngléas sin ar a lán slite eile chun cultúr dúchasach na tíre do chur chun cinn.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect that the Ministry will be established before the end of June.  I should also like to say that, when the Bill was passing through the Dáil, a question was raised in regard to the <Col N="155" /> matter of titles under Section 3.  It was suggested that the titles in regard to the member of the Government and the Department of the Gaeltacht should be in Irish in both sections.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the fact that there are bodies such as the Garda Síochána, C.I.E. and Bórd na Móna whose titles are in Irish only and that they are recognised and accepted as such.  It was thought that it would be rather inconsistent that the Gaeltacht Ministry should be called the Department of the Gaeltacht and the Minister called the Minister for the Gaeltacht.  At first, I thought that was a reasonable thing and that we might introduce an amendment in the Seanad that would meet the point raised in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>However, having considered the matter with the parliamentary draftsman, it was pointed out&mdash;the matter was further discussed with the Government&mdash;that the various Departments and sections of the Government are recognised as a group by the people indicating the different Departments under which different sections of the work of the Government as a unified body are carried out.  Having regard to the constitutional position in respect of the two languages and the necessity for keeping a clear unified picture of what the Government consisted of, it was felt that it would be too much out of accord with that idea to change the words &ldquo;Department of the Gaeltacht&rdquo; and &ldquo;Minister for the Gaeltacht&rdquo; into Irish.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the word &ldquo;Gaeltacht&rdquo; is maintained as the name of the area to which this Bill will refer. That is preserved in English as well as in the Irish section.  I think it is worth while mentioning that matter, in view of the discussion in the Dáil and the way I replied to that discussion.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 4 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As soon as reasonably practicable <Col N="156" /> the central office of the new Department of the Gaeltacht shall be established in the Gaeltacht area.</P>
    <P>I put this amendment down with the double purpose of drawing attention to the fact that we have in this new Ministry an opportunity which could not be so easily taken in relation to any other Department, that is to say, to achieve a degree of decentralisation of Government, at any rate.  It is quite clear that any other Department must be situated in or near Dublin for the purpose of central administration, but here it seems to me we have an exception.</P>
    <P>The main orbit of action of the new Department will be the area which it itself defines as being the Gaeltacht area.  It seems to me that most effective action could be done, if it itself was situated within the Gaeltacht area.  It is obvious that there would have to be contacts with Dublin and I think it is quite conceivable that we would have a Dublin branch office.</P>
    <P>The point was made that the Minister will be at Cabinet level, and sit at Cabinet meetings, and be able to put his point of view and the point of view of his Department to the Cabinet.  That is a valuable thing, but I see no reason why the Minister for the Gaeltacht should not live in the Gaeltacht and come to Dublin for Cabinet meetings in precisely the same way as Deputies or Senators come to Dublin for meetings of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I believe that in fact the imaginative quality of such a step, the decision to place the Gaeltacht Department in the Gaeltacht area, would have a very stimulating effect on the area.  I do not think it would be fitting for us now to suggest a particular town or centre.  I do not think it need necessarily be a large town but it is quite obvious that if the day-to-day activity of this Department is to be effective there must be a Department which will be accessible to the ordinary people living in the Gaeltacht.  I would stress the word &ldquo;accessible&rdquo; because I believe it is a valuable part of the machinery of democracy that the people can get at the particular people dealing with certain questions, matters related to industry and commerce, education or whatever it may be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> I think the people living in the Gaeltacht areas would feel the Minister was closer to them in every way if he was closer to them physically, and could be approached and his senior officials approached at any reasonable time during the week without the necessity of travelling to Dublin.  It is obvious that the Civil Service apparatus would be very reluctant to make such a change; that there would be all kinds of obstacles and difficulties.  To make a change like that would appear revolutionary in the eyes of some, but I would appeal to the Seanad to regard it as a valuable experiment and a useful thing from the point of view of the apparatus of Government itself, and also from the point of view of the purpose for which this Bill is introduced. It is for that reason that I move this amendment which proposes that a fresh section be inserted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerMcHugh" hpid="Dr. McHugh Dr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Sheehy Skeffington in his attitude to this amendment.  My first reason is that I think it will be a move in the right direction of decentralisation of administration.  I realise that the principle of decentralisation is very often a principle invented by some Departments for others; that is, the Department of Industry and Commerce may be quite satisfied to send the E.S.B. or some other Department down the country, but it is not in favour of going there itself.  I think that in this case there is a lot to be said for having the new Department in the Gaeltacht. Senator Sheehy Skeffington is in favour of decentralisation.  I think you may run the risk of other parts of the Gaeltacht being jealous of the district which gets the Department, but I think that, on balance, it would be an imaginative gesture which would restore the confidence of the people of the Gaeltacht in Government measures to revive their culture and to take care of their economic welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think part of the despondent picture which you find very often when you go to live in the Gaeltacht for a while to improve your blas is that a young man will say, if he wants to get a job in Cork or elsewhere outside the Gaeltacht, he has to learn English.  He will ask you why you bother to learn <Col N="158" /> Irish or to polish up the Irish you have. I think that despondency would cease, if the Department were to be set up in the Gaeltacht.  This will be a small Department, and I think its establishment in the Gaeltacht would considerably help the work of the voluntary Gaelic bodies such as Comhdháil Náisiúnta and Muintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>I would also argue that its location on the spot would give the Department a unique chance of assessing the immediate needs in a manner which is not altogether possible when you have the Department in Dublin.  It would have to contend less with Party politics and with situations like that which would be created when one Party sets up glasshouses for tomato growing and another Party is automatically against them.  I think a Department on the spot would be enabled to reach more objective decisions on matters of that kind.  For those reasons, I would support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment says: &ldquo;As soon as reasonably practicable&rdquo;. I take it &ldquo;Gaeltacht area&rdquo; means a Gaeltacht area, but I would point out that the areas which are to be defined for the purposes of the Bill have not yet been delimited.  It would appear to me to be simpler to leave the question over until certain work has been done.  In fact a proposal to put the Gaeltacht Ministry in the Gaeltacht means putting it either in West Galway or Donegal.  There are no other proposals one could visualise, because there is no Gaeltacht in Munster which would bear consideration from that point of view.  One of the results of putting the Ministry in one of these areas would be that the Ministry would be as far away from any other Gaeltacht as if it were in Dublin because each one of these areas is as far away from the others as Dublin is from them all.  That is one aspect of it.  If you did not confine the Ministry to a large city adjacent to a Gaeltacht area like Galway, you would have to establish it in a very small place and the Minister would find much greater difficulty in doing the work set down in Section 3 of the Bill, which is of very great difficulty, <Col N="159" /> involving considerable personal contacts.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a personal way, I would say that if I were the Minister for the Gaeltacht I would deem it a great disadvantage to leave Dublin and to correspond with Ministers rather than to meet them and to talk to them.  A great deal of Government work is done not by correspondence but by personal contact between Ministers.  The new Minister for the Gaeltacht will have to do more of that kind of work than any Minister does at present.  I feel that the Minister for the Gaeltacht, if he were put down in some remote place&mdash;and that is what the amendment means&mdash;would be at a very considerable disadvantage.  He would lose his influence in the Cabinet for the very difficult and complicated work which this places upon him.</P>
      <P>I therefore think that from the practical viewpoint it would not be a good idea at all to have the Minister isolated in one of the Gaeltacht areas.  From the point of view of doing effective work for the Gaeltacht, the new Ministry should be centred in Dublin.  The amendment, as drafted, would not mean anything at the moment because the words &ldquo;reasonably practicable&rdquo; are so vague that they can be interpreted in a variety of ways.  It might be useful for us to consider this by way of motion after the Ministry has been in operation; it might be advisable to see whether in whole or in part the Ministry could be transferred, but this amendment, as drafted, would not serve any purpose.  The idea is not a good one at the moment, although it has its attractions.  Since a considerable portion of the work must be done in the Gaeltacht, the Minister himself will, in the nature of things, spend a lot of his time there.</P>

      <P>This seems clearly to be one of these cases where there is a great deal to be said on both sides.  I would agree with Senator Hayes that more would be lost by isolating the new Minister than would be gained by putting him in a Gaeltacht area.  On balance, I think it would be better to keep him closely in touch with his colleagues in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any merit in this proposal.  The question of accessibility has been stressed. Dublin is, on the average, as accessible to most parts of the Gaeltacht as is what we might term the centre of the Gaeltacht, Galway.  Dublin is at least as accessible to Donegal as Galway would be.</P>
      <P>I rose specially to mention the question of the Gaelic colleges, the preparatory colleges.  When they were established 30 years ago, the idea was to have them placed in Gaeltacht areas, because it was thought that, by having them there, the students would more or less imbibe the real spirit of the Gaeltacht.  It was thought that there was something in the air that would help.  As a matter of fact, that has not been the case.  The students might as well have been placed anywhere else.  During the war years, most of these colleges had to be transferred to Dublin, to Marlboro Hall in Glasnevin, and the story is that they were more successful there than down the country.  It is generally believed that it has had no special effect from the point of view of the language where these colleges are placed.</P>
      <P>Possibly if the Ministry were placed in any of the Gaeltacht areas, as has been pointed out by Senator McHugh, there would be jealousy as between, say, Donegal, and the West and Kerry as to where it should be placed.  I do not think you would get general agreement among the Gaeltacht areas on fessor Hayes, it would be best, for the present, at any rate, to have the Ministry here, especially as it will be necessary for the Minister to have fairly constant contact with the other members of the Government.  I do not think anything would be gained by having it in the Gaeltacht.  You might as well take the Ministry of Lands and put it down in Galway, or Roscommon, or somewhere like that, where there is so much land to be divided.  There may be something in decentralisation, but I was never struck about the idea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with one or two points made.  One is that the Minister <Col N="161" /> would in some way be &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; from his colleagues, if he were to be in a Gaeltacht area.  I do not know whether Senators or Deputies who live in Gaeltacht areas feel a similar isolation from their Dublin colleagues.  I speak as a Dubliner myself, like Senator Hayes, and I fear that sometimes we in Dublin tend to think of Dublin as being the natural place for everything to be decreed and organised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Senators, it is true, think of other parts as being the natural place for things to be decided!  It seems to me that here in relation to the Gaeltacht the natural place for such decisions ought to be the Gaeltacht.  It might be that it would be a question either of isolating the Minister to some extent from his colleagues, or isolating him and his Department from the people in the Gaeltacht.  It is all very well to say that Dublin is just as available and accessible, but the ordinary people have not the means to be running up to Dublin to put a request or a suggestion to a Gaeltacht Ministry, so it would be more isolated from the Gaeltacht if it were in Dublin than if it were in Donegal or the West. The case made that, after all, if it were in Galway, Donegal would be just as far from it as if it were in Dublin, is not a case at all, because quite clearly the western Gaeltacht would be equally close to the Donegal Gaeltacht. It would not be further away.  I believe that the point I made originally, in which I was supported by Senator McHugh, of the value of the accessibility of such a Department to the ordinary people, is of high importance, and even more so, perhaps, in relation to matters with which the new Minister will be concerned.  Senator McHugh also made a good point that if the Minister and his officials are located there on the spot they will see the needs, and become more immediately aware of them and the problems for examination and so on, than if the Minister simply sees them in statistics on his desk in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes made a slightly involved <Col N="162" /> point.  He said you could not do it immediately because the Gaeltacht areas have not been defined yet under the Acts.  That, of course, was not what I said.  I said that it should be done &ldquo;as soon as was reasonably practicable&rdquo;. But then he objected to that phrase, and said that it did not mean enough, or was not sufficiently precise and immediate for him.  It is a good phrase, because it does not tie the Minister immediately to do it.  It ties him simply to do it as soon as it can be seen to be reasonably practicable. If some people think it is, and others that it is not, it will be for the Minister to say why it is not yet reasonably practicable.  In other words, his hands are not tied, but there would be an expression of sentiment on the part of the framers of the Bill that on the whole the Seanad and the Oireachtas would like to see the setting up of the central office of this new Department in a Gaeltacht area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to Senator Sheehy Skeffington that the words mean nothing from a legislative point of view.  They could not possibly have any legislative effect, and that must be understood in connection with the matter.  I am not saying whether the Ministry should be in a Gaeltacht or in Dublin, and I am accepting the responsibility imposed upon me to establish a Ministry and to let that Ministry, as an effective, thinking, corporate piece of machinery, see, as part of its work, where ultimately it should be.  There is no question that, while the Ministry is in Dublin, any part of the Gaeltacht will be without an authoritative office&mdash;say, one in Donegal, another in Galway, another in a suitable place in Munster&mdash;to which people can go, if they want to. That office will be there for the purpose of having a real advanced base from which the directors who are doing the work and co-ordinating the work and acting as the principal executive officers of the Ministry will have their place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators speak as if they were accepting the kind of thing that has arisen very much in the country.  It is possible for a Minister, when he has <Col N="163" /> been brought down in any constituency to a dance, to be stopped half-way up the stairs by somebody saying: &ldquo;I want to tell you so and so.  I would like you to do something that wants to be done, a really important thing&rdquo; and then looking at the Minister and saying: &ldquo;Have you e`er a piece of paper?&rdquo;  At this responsible end of our administration, we ought to realise that we want to get our people out of the habit of waiting for six months, or 12 months, or 18 months, until they find the Minister going around the corner some place and stopping him to talk to him about something or another.</P>
    <P>I would expect the Gaeltacht Ministry to be established to stretch the firm and timely arms of administration deep into the centres of the people and their problems, and to encourage them to co-operate in doing their own work, including writing a short letter in January, 1955, instead of waiting until November, 1958, to meet a Minister or a Deputy strolling round the place.</P>
    <P>There is no other place in which I see that the Ministry can be set up, from the point of view of doing effective work in relation to the Gaeltacht or in relation to co-ordinating things, than Dublin at the moment.  That is all I say, and nothing that we might put into a Bill will change or affect that situation radically.  It is only mistaking the whole character of people and the whole purpose of our institution, if we have to put into a Bill an admonitory phrase or a kind of hopeful phrase, hoping that they will do something that appears to some people to be more practical to-day than what exactly has to be done to meet the necessities of to-day.  I would submit to the Senator that that would just be a blot on a statute rather than anything else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather shocked by the Minister's attitude towards the insertion or the non-insertion of such a clause.  I realise, of course, that the Minister could not be forced on any specific date to institute the central office in the Gaeltacht, if this <Col N="164" /> amendment were to be passed, but to say that to pass it would not have legislative effect because it simply asks that the thing be done in a reasonable time, &ldquo;as soon as reasonably practicable,&rdquo; is, I think, wrong.  After all, in Section 3, this Bill states that the function of the Department shall be &ldquo;to promote,&rdquo; shall be &ldquo;to encourage,&rdquo; shall be &ldquo;to extend&rdquo; and it is quite obvious that there are 50 different interpretations of &ldquo;to promote, to encourage, to extend,&rdquo; yet it is obvious that one could not say that that did not have legislative effect, because someone could say: &ldquo;You did not promote; you did not encourage; and you did not extend.&rdquo;  Similarly, I think it possible to say that if the Oireachtas were to state that the view of the Oireachtas was that, in the foreseeable future, this new Department should have its central office in the Gaeltacht, then it would be legitimate, after the passage of some years, to ask the then Minister why it had not been found practicable, and to refer back to this ideal enshrined in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I deliberately phrased it in such a way as not to make it absurdly and immediately mandatory, but I do not believe at all that it is simply a pious hope unrelated to reality, and I think that that, in fact, has been disproved by the points that have been made by others.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us now that he intends to have local offices in many of the Gaeltacht areas, but I am inclined to wonder whether that really makes for accessibility to the Department. The Department of Posts and Telegraphs has a number of offices all over the country, but I am not quite sure that that makes the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs more immediately accessible to the people than any other Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister says that people prefer to wait 18 months to see the Minister going upstairs or around a corner rather than write a letter, he has mentioned something that certainly happens and which is to be deplored, but I cannot help feeling that perhaps one reason why people wait until they can buttonhole the Minister is that <Col N="165" /> they know that when they write to the Minister, they do not get a reply.</P>

      <P>At any rate, the Senator is clear that it would be reasonable after a few years' experience of the work of the Gaeltacht Ministry that a Senator would be able to ask the Minister what were the difficulties that had arisen that had prevented the headquarters of the Ministry being transferred to the Gaeltacht. Only to-day there was an example of a piece of legislation introduced into the Seanad being passed through all stages in the Seanad and that ultimately will become law.  There is nothing to prevent, in a year's time, in two years' time, in three years' time, any Senator with experience of what is happening in the Gaeltacht and of the operations of the Gaeltacht Ministry introducing a Bill, as the Oil Pollution of the Sea Bill was introduced, making it a matter of statutory requirement that the headquarters of the Gaeltacht Ministry shall be wherever he wants to suggest, from his practical experience, it ought to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as that is concerned, the Senator is apparently satisfied now <Col N="166" /> that he could not put a spot on where it ought to be and he could not put a spot on the time at which it ought to be anywhere in the Gaeltacht, apart from anywhere else.  All the machinery is here for the Senator to bring in at any time he likes in future a Bill in the way in which the Oil Pollution of the Sea Bill was brought in here, and have it discussed in the Seanad and, if it is passed in the Seanad, have it discussed in the Dáil.  There is no door shut to pointing out anything in the situation that would make it desirable that the headquarters of the Gaeltacht Ministry or any other Ministry should be anywhere else.  That door is completely open and the reason why it is open is that we are setting up a Ministry; in a very short time, the higher responsible officers of the Ministry will, I hope, be appointed; the Ministry will be established and then we will all begin our experience of what the Gaeltacht Ministry is, what it is capable of doing and the reaction of its work on the Gaeltacht, and we will be able to say then whether its officers should be here, there or elsewhere and where its Minister should be.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to speak again, but, in regard to that last point, the Minister is making an argument that is unsound, because, if the new Gaeltacht Department sets out now with the knowledge that it will be expected in a few years' time to have its central office situated in the Gaeltacht, it will take steps which will be quite different from those it will take if it sets out now without that knowledge.  If we do not pass this amendment now and if we wait for a few years the Gaeltacht Department will be congealed here in Dublin and then the Minister will come in and say: &ldquo;If only you had suggested this when we were setting up the new Department.  Now it is too late and you can talk your head off, propose any amendments you like; it is too late; we could not now transfer it.&rdquo;  That is why I think the principle should be in the minds of those now setting up the new Department when they set it up. It is not that we demand that it be immediately done but that that shall be the trend and the aim within a reasonable time.</P>

      <P>As Senators will have gathered from the explanatory memorandum circulated with this Bill, the measure is intended to facilitate the enactment of a Fisheries (Consolidation) Bill and it may be appropriate to recall at this stage how the process of consolidation now stands.  The Consolidation Bill as introduced in 1952 was in March 1953 referred by both Houses to the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills.  That committee completed its work and presented its report in July, 1953, but the Bill was not then proceeded with as it was considered more fitting that it should be revised to remedy certain defects and inconsistencies in the Fisheries Statutes as they stood to which attention had been drawn informally by the committee.  The Bill which is now before the House proposes to give effect to the committee's suggestions and also provides for certain other minor amendments of a procedural nature, the need for which has become apparent in the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum gives fairly full information as to the contents of the Bill and as it is proposed that the Bill be sent to a special committee of the House, no detailed comment by <Col N="169" /> me seems necessary at this stage.  I should, however, draw attention to groups of sections of the kind already mentioned, namely, those of a procedural nature not suggested by the report of the Standing Joint Committee but suggested rather by experience in administration during the past few years.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the first group, Sections 6 to 9, deal with fishery rating and do no more than bring the law on that subject into line with that relating to the rates struck by local authorities as regards liability for rates and the power to issue new or amended demand notes.  In point of fact, many boards of conservators had followed local authority practice in these matters, but on taking legal advice it was found that the local government code did not apply here, and what is now being done is simply to restore with legal effect what had until recently been regarded as correct practice.</P>
    <P>The second group of provisions, Sections 17 and 18, makes good some defects which were found to exist in the law relating to detention of boats and seizure of gear arising from offences under the Sea Fisheries (Protection) Acts.  A number of captures of this kind have been made in recent years and experience in dealing with them has brought to light the need for specific power to detain a boat and if necessary to have the boat moved from place to place and for the purpose of removing forfeited fish or nets and using the boat's own lifting gear for the purpose.  I am sure that Senators will have no difficulty in agreeing that these provisions are both desirable and reasonable.</P>
    <P>It is intended that on enactment of this measure the new provisions will be incorporated in the draft Fisheries (Consolidation) Bill, which will then be reintroduced at the earliest practicable date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that there has been so much legislation in recent years in connection with fisheries indicates the importance of fisheries in the economy of the country and the difficulties that have to be contended <Col N="170" /> with in the supervision and administration of that work.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentry Secretary has stated that there are only minor amendments in the Bill which is now before the House, but I should like to suggest that certain serious principles are introduced.  For instance, at this stage, I should like to refer the House to Section 16 (2) (b), in which the onus of proof that a fish is lawfully captured is placed on the person in whose possession the salmon or trout may be.  To my mind, that is a very serious infringement of the liberty of the citizen and it is putting too great a burden on the individual to have to prove that the fish was lawfully captured. In the 1924 Act, that section referred only to unseasonable fish, black fish or fish that are obviously unsuitable for capture.</P>
      <P>The Bill imposes an obligation on a common carrier.  I assume a common carrier is a person authorised to carry merchandise as, for instance, a railway company or a licensed haulier.  It is suggested that if fish are found in the possession of such a person and unless he can produce a certificate from the consignor that the fish was lawfully captured he may be committing an offence.  I feel that that is too great an imposition on a common carrier and on the consignor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to Section 23 in detail.  It is difficult to understand the purport of that section, because it does not specify explicitly the particular section of the State Property Act to which reference is made.  Under the 1920 (Ireland) Act, the Six Counties and two boroughs were granted to Northern Ireland.  At the time of the Treaty, those areas were entitled to opt out within a month and, if they did not do so, then they did not form part of Southern Ireland.  However, only those Six Counties and two boroughs were given to the jurisdiction of Northern Ireland, so that any territorial waters would be part of Southern Ireland.  If it can be suggested that County Derry is bounded on the west by Lough Foyle, then I suggest that all Lough Foyle and, possibly, the River Foyle belong to <Col N="171" /> this State, up to the high water mark on the County Derry side.</P>
    <P>In the Down survey made by Sir William Petty about the year 1657, County Derry was described as being bounded on the west by Lough Foyle. Section 27 of the State Property Act states that every right and every prerogative, which by virtue of Article 49 of the Constitution, belong to the people relate to any property and shall be exercised by the Government through and by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Might I suggest that by the implementation of this particular section this State may be divesting itself of part of the territory of the State and that the Bill may, therefore, be unconstitutional? It was argued in a case before the Lord Chancellor in 1856, Allen v. Donnelly, by the Irish Society that Lough Foyle was not part of County Derry.  If that is the position, then I suggest that this House should consider very carefully whether Section 23 of the Bill should not be deleted.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other amendments with which I should like to deal, but they can be dealt with much more satisfactorily by the Special Committee.  I take it that the Special Committee will report and that their report will then be considered by the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in the opinion of Seanad Eireann the Government should consider the question of introducing legislation to abolish capital punishment or to suspend it for an experimental period.</P>
      <P>The Seanad and the Minister will, no doubt, have noticed that this motion is phrased in very moderate terms. There is no desire to coerce the Government or dictate any policy.  We have phrased it simply to request them to consider what we think is becoming an urgent matter.  This moderation is partly due, I think, to our desire to have no high feeling, or emotionalism, or lurid details, in our debate this evening.  It is also, for my own part, due to the fact that I realise that the arguments in favour of retaining capital punishment are strong.  I think it is a fairly close balance between the arguments for and against, but, after very careful consideration, I came to the conclusion that the balance of argument was in favour of modification or abolition of the death penalty.  I also found that a good many citizens of this country, people whose opinions I respect, had the same view.  Because I respect the arguments in favour of capital punishment, I am going to try to deal with, or, at least, to discuss, those arguments first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I personally am inclined to be a conservative. I think the majority of the <Col N="173" /> people in this country also are inclined to be conservative, and I like it.  We are inclined to say: &ldquo;If this thing has been good enough for our ancestors for countless generations, why should we make a change now?&rdquo;  We are also inclined to ask why, if many nations throughout the world to-day believe that capital punishment is necessary for murder and for some other crimes, should we think that they are wrong. This argument from what I will call established custom is strong in the minds of many of us.  In Ireland, we are cautious about making what might be called doctrinaire changes.</P>
    <P>But I should like the Seanad to consider this argument from established custom a little more closely.  In fact, if we go back before the Norman conquest in this country, we find that capital punishment was very much modified. I refer to the provisions of the Brehon Laws.</P>
    <P>I have consulted a person who, I think we would all agree, is the highest authority in the world on the Brehon Laws.  He tells me that, before the Normans came to Ireland, capital punishment was rare.  It was almost entirely confined to offences against the king, the local king or the chieftain. Ordinary cases of homicide were atoned for by payment of a fine to the slain man's kindred, and this was to prevent a kin fight or a private war. Later, for a while, under the influence of the Normans in the early days of the kings the Irish chieftains levied the fine for themselves, and kept it for themselves.  But on the whole capital punishment was comparatively rare in Ireland before the Normans came. Similarly, though this argument will not weigh so much with us, in Anglo-Saxon England before the Normans came, capital punishment was comparatively rare.</P>
    <P>In fact, the rigorous law of capital punishment which we know in this country, and knew very much more rigorously 150 years ago, is essentially a Norman and a British introduction. Under British laws, as a matter of fact, as is well known to many here, I am sure, capital punishment was also exacted for larceny and many other felonies.  That has been abolished <Col N="174" /> within the last 150 years.  There have been changes in the law.  The law is not immutable in this country, and capital punishment, as we know it, is not a native Irish institution.</P>
    <P>As another example of the mutability of the law, the House will remember that hanging, drawing and quartering was valid in England until 1824. Slavery was legal and permissible until about 1770.  Public opinion changed that.  I am making the point that the law of capital punishment in this country is neither historical nor immutable. It was brought here chiefly by the Normans and it has changed considerably in the last century.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have in mind another argument, the argument that in many countries of the world capital punishment is still considered necessary. When we say &ldquo;many countries of the world&rdquo;, we must remember that it has been abolished, and abolished with success, in many civilised countries of the world.  Before the 1939 war&mdash;after it, there were some changes under the dictatorships, for obvious reasons&mdash;capital punish ment had been abolished in 13 countries in Europe, eight countries in South America and six States of the United States of America.  It has been restored in some States of America as a necessary dettrent.  I shall meet the implications of that later, but the fact remains that in 27 civilised States it is considered unnecessary to have capital punishment.</P>
    <P>We have seen that our neighbour, England, is about to abolish capital punishment for most kinds of murder. That will bring certain practical difficulties in this country.  England is going to join the large number of countries which think capital punishment is not necessary in its present rigour.  So the argument from history is not valid. Capital punishment is not based on the law in this country from the earliest date.  And it is not the law in many countries in Europe and the rest of the world to-day.  That removes the argument which so many of us may feel in our conservative hearts&mdash;the argument that what was good enough for our ancestors is good enough for us.</P>
    <P>I turn from these theoretical arguments <Col N="175" /> to the practical arguments for and against capital punishment in Ireland to-day.  What are the main practical reasons given in favour of capital punishment?  Why do a great many people say that we should retain it?  There are three main practical reasons.  First, many of us think of the old adage: an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.  I have heard this point argued very strongly.  It is the argument that death is the appropriate punishment for death.  I feel that we could argue this endlessly.  I can only give my own view on it, and, if Senators raise arguments in favour of that, I will try to reply to them.  My own view is that, in terms of absolute morality, it is as wrong for the State deliberately to kill a man as for the individual deliberately to kill a man.</P>
    <P>I put that bluntly and I mean it.  If we really agree that the terrible finality of capital punishment is such that only God Almighty should exercise it, we will take that view.  Expediency may confine us to turn that argument aside, but I repeat that ultimately, in my opinion, it is in terms of absolute morality, as wrong for the State to kill a man as for a man to kill.  I know that there is endless controversy on that point and I will not pursue it further.  I could try to submit further arguments at considerable length, but I will not do so.</P>
    <P>The second argument in favour of retaining certain punishments is that they help towards the reformation of the criminal.  That hardly arises in the case of capital punishment and we need not pursue it.  A dead man is not capable of reformation.  On the other hand, if we abolish capital punishment, or modify it, we are giving the criminal an opportunity of prolonged reformation to the full extent of his life.</P>
    <P>The third argument is the really strong one.  It is that capital punishment is an effective deterrent and preventive measure.  Obviously, if a man is hanged for killing, he will not repeat his offence.  What many people really stand on is this, that capital punishment <Col N="176" /> is necessary as a deterrent to other potential murderers.  That is the strongest argument.  If that argument holds, the case for abolition fails and the case for modification is weakened. If the death penalty was removed by the Irish Government to-morrow, some people would argue that murderers would become more frequent in Ireland as a result.  I have heard the views of many responsible people who have thought this argument decisive&mdash; judges, police officers and prison warders.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, it is a very weighty argument if a policeman or a prison warder says: &ldquo;If you cease to hang murderers, our work will become very much more dangerous.  Criminals will kill us far more readily when they know that the worst they can suffer is an increased period of imprisonment.&rdquo; If this were a certain fact, I would not be pleading my case here this evening. If I were convinced that that was beyond aye or nay, I would be in favour of retaining capital punishment. But is it a certain fact?  Is it anything more than a fear?  It certainly has not been proved by any statistics from countries where capital punishment has been abolished that murders have increased as a result of its abolition.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, policemen and prison warders have often been attacked and killed by criminals in countries where there is capital punishment.  It is certainly, therefore, not an absolute deterrent.  The facts, and I have read all the available statistics and literature on this subject, show that capital punishment is not a complete deterrent.  The Department of Justice has kindly provided me with some figures on capital punishment in this country since 1922.  They show that since 1st April, 1922, 89 people were sentenced to death in the Irish courts; that is nearly three people a year who were not deterred by capital punishment.  Though the death penalty is there, still murders happen.  And there may be other murderers who escape detection.  It is not an absolute deterrent.  History shows that even the most terrible punishments and the most terrible threats of punishment <Col N="177" /> have never been absolute deterrents. Burning, torture, hanging, drawing and quartering have failed to deter people who felt they should commit certain offences.  In the last 160 years of the history of Ireland dozens of people have been undeterred by such penalties &mdash;among them, I am glad to say, three graduates of Trinity College, Dublin, who were undeterred by hanging, drawing and quartering, undeterred from serving their country as they thought right.</P>
    <P>It is not an absolute deterrent.  Even what appears to be the most efficacious penalty will never be an absolute deterrent.  In fact&mdash;and I hope the Seanad will not consider this an oversubtle argument: I think it is a valid one&mdash;from a psychological point of view it is arguable that the murderer who plans in advance will assume success in escaping detection, while the passionate murderer will not consider the probability of a penalty at all.  So I question whether either in the case of the long-scheming murderer or the passionate murderer capital punishment is a particularly strong deterrent. Neither the murderer who lays careful plans nor the man who strikes in anger will think or believe that he will face the gallows.</P>
    <P>Now, in these remarks I have tried to face the main arguments in favour of retaining capital punishment.  I have tried to show that they are not decisive, not even the argument that our police, our prison warders, and others, may suffer if hanging is removed. I turn now to the positive side of my case, the arguments for abolition or modification of the present law. Out of very many possible arguments, I select four which weigh most heavily with me.  The first is on the ground of common humanity.  It is not really an argument.  It is an appeal, but I think a valid appeal.  I think all of us have the utmost reluctance to approve of the killing of a fellow man even when it is by a judicial decision.  On the grounds of common humanity, we shrink from death in almost any circumstances. This kind of consideration may, I hope, influence some.  Others may think it is not an argument at all. I shall not dwell on it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="178" /> The second argument is the fact, as I have already mentioned, that many civilised countries to-day get on perfectly well without capital punishment. I could give a list of them.  They are given in this Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, 1949 to 1953.  They are countries whose opinion is worth considering.  The third argument is the possibility of a mistaken verdict by juries.  I shall refer to that in a moment.  The fourth argument, and this is strongly against retaining capital punishment, is the effect of executions on all those concerned with executions.  Some of these effects will be made worse, I suggest, if the Republic is isolated by a change in the law of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>On the first argument, as to the possibility of a mistake by the police and by the courts, there are cases on record where convicted murderers have subsequently been proved, or virtually proved, innocent.  It is difficult&mdash;in fact I think it is impossible&mdash;to get any Government or any Minister for Justice to admit a mistake of this kind.  That is quite understandable.  I am not suggesting for a moment that any mistake of this kind has been made in Ireland since 1922.  But, in England, there are certain cases that have caused grave public disquiet.</P>
    <P>There was the case of Timothy Evans about six years ago; very many people believe that he was innocent.  There was the case of the famous Oscar Slater.  He was sentenced to hang in May, 1909.  The sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.  Then the Irish author, Conan Doyle, took up his case.  After a long campaign he was proved, 19 years later, to be innocent of the crime and the sentence was annulled.  If that man had not been reprieved, he would have been hanged, though innocent.</P>
    <P>Many people have shown, with considerable reasonableness, the risk of error in identifying a criminal.  We have often seen the disagreement of expert witnesses in the court.  For example, in 1925 Norman Thorne had three medical witnesses who swore that death, as described by the prosecution, was impossible.  He was hanged.  In 1953, another person was <Col N="179" /> hanged, despite the evidence of a former chief pathologist for the police. He was on her side and he said that she was innocent on pathological grounds.  She was hanged.  Far back in 1865, but I think the quotation is valid, Sir Fitzroy Kelly, a former attorney-general, said before a Royal Commission sitting then that &ldquo;formidable numbers of innocent men have been executed.&rdquo;  Formidable numbers of innocent men have been executed: that may be an exaggeration, but if two or three innocent men have been executed in the last 50 years and if two or three innocent men will be executed in the next 50 years it seems to me one of the gravest reasons for abolishing or modifying the death penalty.</P>
    <P>The fourth argument to which I attach considerable importance is the argument stemming from the effect on others&mdash;on the people involved in the verdict and execution.  The effect on the jury is in a curious way two-fold. On the one hand, one quite often finds a reluctance to return a verdict of murder.  A guilty man may therefore escape because of the death penalty. I quote from a book by Gerald Gardiner, a Queen's Counsel, entitled: &ldquo;Capital Punishment as a Deterrent.&rdquo; He is a partisan.  I think I should state that; but his opinion is worth considering.  He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The only way to stop verdicts of manslaughter which should be murder, to stop juries sending sane men to Broadmoor and to increase the conviction rate to the level which the facts justify is to abolish capital punishment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is one effect on juries.  The other is the terrible psychological strain on any jury which has to consider a murder verdict.  I shall not dwell on this.  It is clear to all&mdash;some here may have served on murder trials.  This terrible psychological strain is not, indeed, something that should be shirked if it is absolutely necessary and desirable.  But I think it is not absolutely necessary and desirable.</P>
    <P>I shall not dwell either on the argument of <i>ad hominem or ad ministrum</i>, <Col N="180" /> but I think we must also take into account the appalling strain there must be on the Minister for Justice and his Department when he has to consider whether or not a criminal should be reprieved.  I am not going to dwell on this.  One can easily imagine the awful strain it must be on any man in that case.  The fact is, as I have stated, that there have been 89 people sentenced to death since 1922 and of these 48 were reprieved and 35 were executed.  That means on 35 occasions the Minister had to exercise the terrible responsibility of sending a human being to the gallows.  I am sure no Minister wants to shirk his duty in that regard.  But is it necessary?</P>
    <P>There is again the strain on the prison staff and on the other convicts in the prison.  We have all probably read lurid details.  I hope during this debate nobody will dwell on lurid details of this nature.  But we all know that the strain on the prison staffs and the other convicts in the prison is of terrible magnitude.  There is also the strain on the executioner.  I would like to emphasise that I hope nobody will go into lurid details.  But at the same time we must consider all the facts.</P>
    <P>There is also the effect of executions on the public.  I do not think that this is as bad in Ireland as it is in some countries, to judge from the publicity given to them in some newspapers there.  But even in Ireland I think there is some risk of morbid and unhealthy interest, stimulated by disreputable newspapers.  If eventually Ireland becomes the only country in West Europe which has the death penalty, apart from France, the spot-lights of the sensational newspapers will be turned on any executions in this country with tenfold strength. They will not have anything of that type in their own country, if the death penalty is abolished there, and I am quite sure that they would then give full publicity to executions in this country.</P>
    <P>I would go further and say that in a few pathological cases criminals are attracted to kill by the publicity and the celebrity that they see other murderers enjoying on their execution day.  I think this could occur in not <Col N="181" /> more than one in 1,000 or one in 10,000 cases.  But it could be an influence in some of those cases.</P>
    <P>There are other factors on which I will not dwell now.  There are the effects on the condemned man's relatives and the effects on the condemned man himself.  Apart from the actual execution, the criminal is given no length of time for amendment of life; no long time for a gradual reformation.</P>
    <P>I think there is enough in what I have said, and there are other arguments, to justify our request that the Government should consider the present arguments for and against capital punishment.  Probably other speakers will raise other arguments. Before concluding I would like to refer to one grave practical difficulty which the Minister and his Department have in mind.  That is the question of what would happen if capital punishment is abolished.  The alternative would appear to be a sterner life sentence.</P>
    <P>Personally I think that a true life sentence would be in many cases a more cruel punishment than execution. I personally hope there will be no consideration of a life sentence for the whole of a life.  It does seem to me, and to many of those who have written on the subject, that a sentence of 20 years, with power to imprison for life in certain circumstances, would meet the case.  The criminal would be kept under close observation and would have careful after care when he leaves prison.  There is a good deal about this in the report of the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the figures in that report show that out of 156 people reprieved and released from prison in England only one became a murderer again.  Only one relapsed, so to speak, out of a total of 156.  That is not a high percentage.  The percentages elsewhere are lower still.</P>
    <P>I should like to add that it was on this report that Sir Edward Gower says he was converted to the abolitionists' point of view.  He had been an advocate of capital punishment, but he says that his views were changed as a result of this inquiry.  Before the inquiry, he was strongly in favour of <Col N="182" /> capital punishment and now he is strongly against it.</P>
    <P>To return to the question of punishment and what would be effective: I think a lengthened sentence of 20 years would constitute a sufficient penalty. If the Minister thinks it would not and if he thinks that in certain circumstances only death is a sufficient penalty, then I would ask him to modify the conditions.  I personally would prefer abolition.  But at least modification of the present law would go a considerable distance towards what I consider is the right end.</P>
    <P>I will sum up now.  In my opinion, and I think in the opinion of many others in this country and elsewhere, the death penalty is not necessary nor is it efficient as a deterrent.  In my opinion the arguments put forward strongly favour the abolition of the death penalty or at least its modification. The arguments in favour of this are: common humanity; the fact that many civilised countries have already abolished capital punishment without any clear increase in the murder rate; the fact that the death penalty causes grave strain on many of those concerned with the execution and evokes an unhealthy interest and curiosity; the fact that there is a danger of a miscarriage of justice in murder cases, a danger that at some time an innocent man may be hanged.</P>
    <P>I propose then that, in the opinion of Seanad Eireann, the Government should consider the question of introducing legislation to abolish capital punishment or to suspend it for an experimental period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerMcHugh" hpid="Dr. McHugh Dr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to second this motion which has been so ably proposed by Senator Stanford, I should like to begin by saying that probably a good deal of the discussion will concern itself with the morality or immorality of the death penalty.  There will probably be two groups in the Seanad. Group A will hold that the death penalty itself is evil and immoral and they will probably consider executions in detail and their effect on the police, the warders and others concerned. Group B will probably hold that the death penalty is a unique method of <Col N="183" /> retribution; that it is a moral necessity. They will, perhaps, consider a brutal murder in detail and show that it is only by preserving the death penalty that such brutal murders may be prevented.  Again, Group a may answer that argument by considering the suffering which an execution inflicts upon innocent people as, for example, the relations of the executed man.  I think that these arguments to a large extent will cancel each other out.</P>
      <P>Though I firmly adhere to the former group, Group A, I prefer to concentrate on the question which, I think, will influence most of the Senators: is the death penalty a better deterrent than imprisonment?  That question has been raised by Senator Standford.  It may be argued that the death penalty helps to maintain popular abhorrence of murder, but I should like to point out, in answer to that argument, which I anticipate here, that the death penalty for theft, which was preserved until the third decade of the last century, never caused theft to be held in the same abhorrence as murder.  I would further point out that hangmen are not notably beloved by many people and, in fact, are held in greater abhorrence than even condemned criminals.</P>
      <P>In relation to this matter, we can be guided to some extent, as Senator Stanford has indicated, by some of the findings of the British Royal Commission on Capital Punishment.  The summary of its findings, which appeared in <i>The Listener</i> for January 19th, 1956, may interest some Senators. I propose to read one paragraph from it:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission emphasises that no reliable inference can be drawn from the simple comparison of figures from abolition countries with those from death penalty countries for the same period.  Differences in outlook, character, in social and economic conditions may invalidate any inference from that fact, even where it is a fact, that the homicide rate is lower in the abolition countries.  Yet there are States in <Col N="184" /> North America, for example, and in Australia, similar in character, with figures compiled on a similar basis where the murder trends are similar though some had no capital punishment and others had.  Moreover, there are certain groups of neighbouring States, for example, North and South Dakota in America, Queensland and New South Wales in Australia, which present peculiarly different materials for sound inference: for, luckily, in each of these groups one country has retained the death penalty during a period in which another member of the group either abolished it or restored it after previous abolition.  So here we have something which is rare and valuable in inquiries of this sort&mdash;a controlled group to test the effect of abolition or restoration; and it shows an important fact.  In these cases the rise and fall of the murder rate was nearly the same for each of the countries in the group whether the death penalty was used or not and whether executions were frequent or not.  This made no difference. So for these countries at least the evidence shows that the rise and fall of the murder rate is not conditioned by the death penalty but by some other factor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a summary of very carefully considered and carefully digested evidence in the Report of the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, and I think that these findings should weigh with us.  The difficulty has been to get a proper parallel between countries which have abolished the death penalty and those that preserve it.  I do also say that the Royal Commission, the summary of whose findings I have quoted, held that the death penalty acts as a deterrent, as far as they can ascertain, only in the case of organised criminal classes, and then only in cases where the police are involved.  In other words, the organised gang murderer will think twice before shooting a policeman, if he knows that the penalty is death. They found that only in that group did the death penalty seem to operate as a genuine deterrent.  In this country, we are happily free from that kind of criminal class which will stop at <Col N="185" /> nothing to remove people from their path in order to achieve some financial gain or for some other similar motive.</P>
    <P>On the whole, any of our people who have been found guilty of murder seem to have acted largely under the influence of passion, or of drink, or of some other factors which could not, by any stretch of the imagination, be called cold blooded calculation.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would say that I base my argument largely on the test of personal responsibility.  I would ask myself a question like this: would I be willing to pull the lever that sends a convicted murderer, even a man convicted of a very brutal murder, perhaps, of a child, to his doom?  I would not.  I think it is important to note that hangmen have to be imported&mdash; that no citizen will take personal responsibility for it.  I think that is dictated by considerations other than considerations of possible revenge.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we should shelter behind our institutions.  Our institutions must embody our convictions, and I refuse to believe that Ireland is almost alone in the civilised world in retaining the conviction that the death penalty is absolutely essential.  It is, of course, notable that there is a strong move at present in the Six Counties to retain it, despite the likely passing of the English Act of abolition.  I do not argue that, simply because the SixCounty Government prefers to retain the death penalty, we should therefore propose to abolish it, but I do say we are often critical of the form of Government practised there, and are we to imitate its worst procedure at our peril?  I strongly support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>The best thought that I have been able to give to this very critical and important subject is that, in my opinion, the death penalty should be retained but that it should be exercised with the very greatest care. In fact, I think that is the case.  I understand that since 1948 there has been only one execution in the State. One might compare that with the fact that, in the same period, there were 1,706 people killed on the roads by motor cars.  They are quite different things; but I think the fact that in six years there has been only one <Col N="186" /> execution does show that this country is taking the view that the death penalty should be imposed only in the very rarest circumstances.</P>
      <P>I believe that the maintenance of the death penalty on the Statute Book is a deterrent, and I believe also that its existence there does tend to emphasise the terrible gravity of the crime of murder.  Senators have discussed whether the death penalty is a deterrent or not.  No one can really answer that.  I am glad to say that I have not had very much personal experience of murder cases; but I have had a certain small experience, and on occasion I have had the grave responsibility of having to look after the defence of people charged with murder.  There is no doubt whatever that in such a case the person accused, if it is clear that he is going to be found guilty, will always seek imprisonment rather than the death sentence, even at the terrible cost of escaping the death sentence by being found to be of unsound mind.  To the ordinary person trying to defend such a man or faced with that position, one fate seems almost worse than the other.  There is no doubt whatever that the effort of the unfortunate man who has got into that position is to secure, if possible, a life sentence rather than a death sentence. No one can really say whether the death sentence is a deterrent, but from my little experience, I am convinced that it is a deterrent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first duty of the State or any such organisation is to protect the citizens, and the first duty of this State is to protect the lives of those who live here.  If there is any reason for believing that the death penalty is a deterrent, then I would say it should be retained, and, as I have said, I personally do not doubt that it is a deterrent. I am not sure that I agree with the point of view that seems to have been expressed by the previous speakers, that punishment should be excluded. Speaking now as a Christian, I rather think that crime does merit punishment and that there should not be too much sympathy for a person who has been justly found to have committed a terrible crime.  I believe personally that the death penalty is a deterrent and that the element of shame involved <Col N="187" /> in it is also a deterrent.  I hope and believe that I am not in any way a bloodthirsty person, and any little experience I have had in such cases has shown me the horror of them.</P>
    <P>I agree with the present motion in the sense that it is obviously a most important matter and one which requires the closest attention of the Government.  I can quite see that the present very strong movement in England towards abolishing the death penalty does give one very grave cause for thought.  At the same time, reading as well as I could the debates in the English Parliament, I could not help feeling that a great number of the speakers were influenced far more by their human and natural sympathies than perhaps by absolute, cold logic.</P>
    <P>There is one part of the present motion, however, with which I would disagree completely and that is the suggestion that if the Government take action in this matter they should introduce an experimental period.  That seems to me to be utterly horrible, to suggest that, let us say, for five years a person would know that he was safe to murder and safe from the death penalty, but that possibly if he were foolish enough to commit a murder five minutes after midnight at the end of the fifth year, something different might happen.  While I am against the death penalty being abolished, I would be far more against it being abolished for an experimental period.  Whatever decision is taken should be a final and complete decision.</P>
    <P>While I am in favour of retaining the death penalty, I also think, and think very strongly, that it should practically never be exercised.  I agree with what the previous speakers have said when they state that probably in this country there are very few, if any, cases, of what I would call deliberate murder. I believe that in almost every case it is insanity, sudden emotion or some other force which suddenly seizes a man and carries him away, possibly almost against his own wishes.  Therefore, I would say that the death penalty should very seldom be exercised.</P>
    <P>It would seem to me that the consequences <Col N="188" /> of abolishing the death penalty would produce an almost more horrible result and that would be the strong inclination and almost the necessity in that event of making the punishment imprisonment absolutely for life.  As matters stand at present, if the death penalty is there, there is always the feeling that insanity, some great emotion or some other reason would justify release after a certain period. If the death penalty were abolished completely, the reaction would be to make complete life imprisonment almost unbearable, and one can hardly imagine anything more horrible.</P>
    <P>This subject is one which anybody trying to approach it sensibly must approach almost with fear and trembling.  One is dealing with the lives of human beings.  One is dealing with the safety of all the people who live in lonely houses throughout the country and, not least, one is dealing perhaps with the safety of the police and all those who are entrusted with the maintenance of order and who fortunately, in this country, are able to carry out their duties unharmed.</P>
    <P>I understand that on the Committee Stage of the Bill in the English Parliament, an amendment was carried retaining the death penalty in the case of a convicted criminal who had murdered. This is a matter which should be considered by the Government.  I am quite unmoved by the historical argument as to what the Anglo-Saxons did or what was in the Brehon code. I am also quite unmoved by the argument that at one time the property-owning class had to protect its property by savage sentences very often against the poor and the distressed. I think these are completely different things which are utterly irrelevant.  I believe, in considering this matter, the Government is, after all, in a very different position from that in which we are.  We are debating this almost like a debating society, but when the Government do so, they are taking the lives of men in their hands, and carrying much graver responsibility.</P>
    <P>As I said before, the death penalty should be retained.  I do not believe <Col N="189" /> man is not entitled to punish for grave offences; I do think that life is a very sacred thing and I believe life can best be safeguarded and protected by keeping on the Statute Book this terrible law, by keeping it there as a possibility, or as a threat, and as, in fact, it has been kept, in the wisdom of our Governments, practically since the institution of our State, and in the wisdom of our judges who in these matters advise our Government, possibly without ever putting that terrible sword into action except in the gravest and worst case.</P>
    <P>I am not in the least influenced by what other countries may have done. I think we have to consider the position here in this matter.  I have no doubt whatever of what the Government should do, although I fully realise that in deciding to keep the death penalty, it may do so almost with distaste, but I think it is its duty to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to identify myself with the proposals in this motion, and I also hope that it will be passed.  Senator Stanford has already dealt very well with the notions of the various purposes for which the death penalty is retained.  I think he has disposed of the idea that it does in fact act as a deterrent, but I should just like to pause and ask the House to consider whether, if the purpose of the death penalty is really to act as a deterrent, you should not make it more terrible and inflict torture, make the agony more lingering, if the purpose is really to instil fear in the heart of the murderer.  In other words, if you introduce as many humane measures as you can into the process of hanging, are you not in fact rendering it less a deterrent than if you leave it in all its brutal horror?  In France, up to an astonishingly recent time&mdash;within my memory&mdash;it was the practice to carry out executions in public in the open street.  A guillotine was set up, and the object of that was to show the public just what an execution means, for the purpose of instilling fear into potential murderers.  I think that notion is a horrifying one, though it is logical, if you regard the death penalty as necessary because it is a deterrent. <Col N="190" /> The effect of this, as has been pointed out, is in fact the contrary.  People came for the sight, for the show, for the spectacle, and it even had the effect&mdash;that I think has been demonstrated in some of the recent reports about the death penalty in Britain&mdash; that people had been led to commit murder by pondering and reflecting on the notoriety of such trials and executions.</P>
      <P>The question of other countries has been dealt with, and I do not want to go into that, although I disagree with Senator Cox on that.  I do not think we can be quite indifferent to what has been done in other countries&mdash;my nationalism is not quite so complacent as his.  He feels that we can decide for ourselves almost without reference to what happens elsewhere.  I feel, on the contrary, that we can look outside and perhaps learn.  If we reject the notion that the death penalty should be retained as a deterrent, for what other purpose then can it be retained? I hope nobody here thinks we should retain the death penalty for somebody who has killed simply for the purpose of exacting vengeance&mdash;&ldquo;an eye for an eye.&rdquo;  Even in the Old Testament phrasing of the incident, what was asked for in it was, in fact, that not more than an eye should be exacted for the loss of an eye.  It was, in other words, not a precept of brutality, as has sometimes been suggested, but a precept for the purpose of restraining those who would seek greater vengeance than the wrong that had been done to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that, even interpreted in such a way, the doctrine of an eye for an eye is a brutal and savage one, one, I think, that ought to have been superseded by a doctrine containing more mercy, a gentler, nobler one, one which hesitates even in the case of murder to cast the first stone.  It is sometimes said&mdash;and I think, at least, it has been hinted at by Senator Cox&mdash; that there is sometimes a good deal of sentiment or emotion about those who want the death penalty abolished.  We hear it said sometimes: &ldquo;You are not thinking of the victim or the victim's family, but you are thinking only of the poor murderer.  You are not thinking <Col N="191" /> of the family of the victim, and they demand that on account of the murder of their relation, there must be a death, another life sacrificed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think I may&mdash;and it is partly my reason for speaking this evening&mdash;speak as the son of a murdered man whose murderer was found guilty of murder in a military court of law&mdash;guilty but insane&mdash;and who was detained for not quite two years in jail and then released and as far as I know, is still alive in Canada.  It is because of that I feel I can speak on this argument about the victim's family from my own personal experience as the son of a victim.  My father was murdered when he was 37, and I can say that my father&mdash;and I can say this with certainty&mdash;would not have wanted the death penalty to have been exacted in the case of the man who killed him. He would emphatically not have wanted vengeance to be exacted.</P>
    <P>My mother, whom I knew better, and who was implacable in her desire to show up all the official attempts to stifle the truth in relation to that particular deed, had no personal vindictiveness whatsoever towards the murderer, and, were she alive to-day, would speak very vehemently on behalf of this motion.  I think it is untrue, and I think it is untrue in the generality of cases, that the families of the victims are crying out for blood.  I think, on the contrary, that the fact that death and what it means has been brought home to them makes them shrink in horror from the thought even of the death of the murderer.</P>
    <P>It is compellingly pointed out, as it has been to-night, and I think it is another argument that should be mentioned, that you cannot be sure, that human beings are fallible and that you cannot in fact be absolutely certain, 100 per cent. certain, in any case, and, therefore, that the risk of executing an innocent person is always there, unless you are prepared to believe that a court of law, with all the apparatus of law and the jury, can reach such a degree of near certainty as to be infallible, which is a thing I personally cannot accept.  I will not go into details but there have been two cases in England recently which have <Col N="192" /> shocked the public conscience and a near presumption that an innocent man was in fact executed.</P>
    <P>The point I would like to make is that all other sentences apart from the death penalty can be revoked and revised.  Once the death penalty has been carried out, nothing more can be done about it; it is final.  A man who is sentenced to life imprisonment can be released if it is discovered that he is innocent.  The death penalty is final and ought to presuppose a final and infallible human judgment, and, therefore, I would say that, since that cannot be presupposed, it is a wrong method.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out by several that this country has had a recent record of mercy, humanity, and I think we all ought to applaud the various Governments for that fact, that in recent years there has been only one execution.  We have, all of us, a distaste for the whole apparatus, for the whole machinery.  It has been mentioned that we have had to import hangmen, and it has even been suggested that you would not be able to get an Irishman to do the job.  I wish we could believe that.  I am afraid that, if the post were to be advertised in any country in the world, including our country, you would get volunteers.</P>
    <P>I should like to say, also, that it used to be the hope of my mother, who did many sentences in jail, that when we got our freedom here, owing to the fact that most of our leaders had had experience of the inside of a cell, we should take the lead in many matters of penal reform and it was her disappointment to note that those of our leaders who knew the jails from personal experience did very little indeed to institute penal reform.  I am glad to say that there has been some change lately there, but I would like to think that because of this personal experience we might be ahead of Britain, for instance, our nearest neighbour, rather than lagging behind.</P>
    <P>On this matter of the abolition of capital punishment we have lagged behind.  I should have felt prouder if we had abolished the death penalty before they did so in Britain, but I think we must recognise the nobility <Col N="193" /> of the present debate in the House of Commons and the fact that people are treating this matter with dignity, with concern and in a manner which makes one admire those who are so considering it.  I do not want just to praise those who are in favour of abolition but all of those who are bringing their minds and consciences to bear on the problem.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say very much more except that I view murder with horror.  I view killing with horror.  I feel that for us as a society to become involved in a killing, however judicial, however carefully prepared, with whatever preliminaries, is a horrible thing. I think we may say in this country that we have had in our history too many executions of all kinds and the shades of those men and women who have suffered that fate, for whatever reason, might well be standing behind us now and urging us to do honour to our country by abolishing the death penalty.</P>
    <P>I should like, therefore, to support the terms of this motion and to say, let us go a little further than we have gone in recent years, when the application of the death penalty has been minimal.  Let us go a little further, and let us urge the Government to consider its abolition altogether, never to be reinstituted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not say very much, but with the exception of the contribution by the last speaker, I feel there has been a certain amount of unreality about this discussion.  In some ways, of course, it is an established, old topic, the ordinary schoolhoy debating topic, but we are debating it here in circumstances that make it very different from the debates on the same theme in other circles.  Here we are in contact with the actual springs that control these things.  We are talking in the presence of those who may have to decide by their own action whether a man will live or die. We also are talking in the presence of those whose lives have been affected very much indeed by the circumstances that are at the moment being debated. I, for one, hope that the Government will consider these matters, but I, for <Col N="194" /> two, feel that still there are some things that require to be said.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that most of the previous speakers have really brought the subject up-to-date.  It is all very well to talk about the history of capital punishment.  The problem is that the saboteur to-day can inflict far more injury on his fellowmen and on the State than he could at any time in the history of the world.  He can put a bomb in an aeroplane; he can poison a reservoir; he can release the most awful bacteriological substances.  I will not dwell on that.  I am not going to become sensational.  It seems to me that, at this present time in the world's crisis, to require the State to forgo the terrible, but inevitable, I think, weapon of the death penalty is really asking too much.  I think the modern State must just keep that penalty. Treason to-morrow will be a very different thing from treason yesterday. Disaster and damage and attacks on the nation to-morrow will be far more serious than they have been in the past, instruments now are so powerful, and it is no argument to say that, when a war arises, legislation will at once restore the death penalty.  Wars do not arise now; they are on one before one knows, and it is entirely essential for the State to retain this procedure.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I do believe that the procedure can be modified and brought into line with the very humane desires of the previous speaker.  Certainly, there should be recognised grades in murder and that, of course, will have to be worked out.  I believe that the Government should have a commission to consider this.  There will be the different types.  I do not propose to go into the psychology of this, about which much has been written. I do not want to make a speech at all.  I have not come, as you realise, prepared to speak, but I was stirred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other question is this wretched business of hanging.  I do feel that hanging is the most abominable type of execution and I am perfectly certain that better and more effective methods could be introduced.  Electrocution, if anything, is worse than hanging. I think the Government could very profitably appoint a small committee <Col N="195" /> to consider methods of execution. The experiences of those taking part in hanging, with its dreadful ceremony, its terrible ceremonial and set up, however hardened they are, must be terrible and, as previous speakers have said, the thoughts of the relatives when the time is coming on and they are visualising what is happening must be dreadful.  I am certain that modern science could provide us with much more effective substitutes for this grisly and horrible and, I think, completely barbarous&mdash;even though it is supposed to be very quick, but we are not quite sure about that&mdash;method of execution. Meanwhile, until we undergo a general reform, I, for one, hope that the State will not be so rash as to forgo the right of the death penalty for some of the atrocious crimes that are possible in the world as it is to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the case that has been made by Senator Cox and Senator Fearon for the retention of the death penalty.  I believe that the solution of this problem rests, in the final analysis, with the Government. The Government must be allowed to have the weapons which are necessary to have the law respected. This is, in these countries, we hope, an enlightened age.  As Senator Cox said, there has been only one execution here since 1948.  I hope that, in the next eight years, we shall have no case of an execution, but I sincerely hope we will retain the death sentence.  The Government may grant a reprieve to persons where it can be shown that the circumstances were such that the murder was not premeditated, or where it can be shown that there were other extenuating circumstances.  In my opinion, the right, duty and responsibility of the Government must be to protect the citizen.</P>

    <P>I remember discussing these matters many years ago with a theologian.  He said to me that if a country was in a state of barbarism&mdash;say, a colonial country&mdash;one might be entitled to take life for the protection of one's property and might be morally justified in doing so, if conditions were such that property could not be protected unless the citizen shot on suspicion.  In the <Col N="196" /> early days of the last century in the Middle West, I understand that the only way survival was possible was by being &ldquo;quick on the trigger.&rdquo;  We have now reached a stage in this country where we have found it necessary to have only one execution in the past eight years and it is possible that we shall not have an execution in the next eight years.</P>
    <P>There are people who, in passion, temper, lust or a spirit of revenge, or for some other reason, will commit murder.  The fact that the Minister for Justice retains the power to use the death sentence in case of necessity to safeguard the wide interests of all citizens seems to me to be a great deterrent, I want to support what has been said in this respect both by Senator Cox and Senator Fearon.  I have been told that out in the bush in Australia, out where the law is not as well observed as it is in the more settled parts of the country, there is a tendency, if somebody is murdered, for the friends of the murdered person to remove the person who committed that murder.  If the death sentence had not been removed, what would happen is that that would become the responsibility of the police and maybe the second man would not lose his life at all.  Maybe he would not need to lose his life.  However, it will be seen that where cases like that arise, the people will take the law into their own hands.</P>
    <P>I remember reading a book years ago by an Irish-American named Sullivan. The name of the book was <i>Look at Chicago.</i>  The gangster elements themselves did more to settle the position in America at the time than anybody else, because they liquidated each other.  I believe that if you removed the death sentence, you would have cases of people going out&mdash;to use a vulgar expression&mdash;&ldquo;gunning&rdquo; for somebody as a form of revenge, if the State was not prepared to do it.</P>
    <P>No Government in this country should take the responsibility of doing away with the death sentence.  I believe it will be used only for the purpose of deterring murder of the worst type.  A very fine and interesting case has been made by Senator Stanford and other Senators, but I do <Col N="197" /> not believe that in Ireland there is any question of an eye for an eye or a tooth for a tooth.  If a man is executed here, he is executed purely for the sake of justice and principally for the common good in order to see to it that murder will not be committed and so that it will act as a deterrent to other people who might feel they could take life.</P>

      <P>I support the motion.  I am glad it has reached this stage. I am sure it is all of 18 years since I was associated with a society that conducted an active campaign against capital punishment.  The question then seemed to die down.  Now, because of protests made in other countries, I suppose the question is revived here. For as long as I can remember, I have had a horror of capital punishment. I do not know to what religion the theologian to whom Senator Burke referred belonged, but in my religion it was certainly never thought that any man could take life for the protection of his property.  I believe, as I was taught to believe, that the State has a right to take life, if it finds it necessary to do so, but I think we have reached a stage in our development in this country when it is no longer necessary to take a life, even if murder has been committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of thought has gone into this matter and a great number of books and papers have been written about it.  If we go over the recent debates in the British House of Commons, I think we can get a consensus of all that was written and said and thought on the matter.  The fact that they have reached certain decisions justifies this motion, in my opinion, which merely asks our Government to examine the situation and to consider whether or not we should put an end to the wilful killing of other people.  No matter what we say, when we boil it all down, we have to admit that what the State does on the morning of an execution is wilfully to kill somebody because they have been convinced that he killed somebody else. As Senator Sheehy Skeffington said, man is finite and all groups of men are finite.  When they kill a person, they perform an action that belongs to the Infinite Being.  That is my belief and <Col N="198" /> that is the reason I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>As yet, I have an open mind as to whether the time is ripe for the abolition of capital punishment in this country.  There are many things to be said in favour of it and, of course, there are some things to be said against it, as in most cases.  In any event, Seanad Éireann is not being called upon this evening to make any decision.  What we are doing is merely requesting the Government to consider the question of the abolition of capital punishment and I take it that that has arisen mainly because of what has happened across the water in Britain. There are people who hold that we should not take any notice sometimes of what they do in Britain, the circumstances of the situation here not being entirely similar.</P>
      <P>We remember that that was argued in connection with the raising of the bank rate and the Government at the time seemed to take up a rather independent attitude, but I am afraid that that independent attitude was not maintained for very long and that the circumstances at the time, international and otherwise, compelled the Government to take what they considered was the necessary action, but in this case also I submit that we cannot afford to close our eyes to what is happening in the British Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measure for the abolition of capital punishment has passed the House of Commons, with some little reservation which it is not necessary to mention here this evening.  It has not yet, of course, passed the House of Lords, but I should imagine that, since this motion appeared on the Order paper, a few months ago, the Government would have given the matter some consideration.  I think it would be expected that the responsible Minister would give us some idea of what the Government's attitude is towards this very important question, as, indeed, I said at the outset that is exactly what the motion seeks&mdash;to get consideration from the Government as to whether they propose to follow in the footsteps of the <Col N="199" /> British and come to some decision as to what should be done.</P>
    <P>The history of capital punishment is a very interesting one and anyone who has studied the matter will see that, up to medieval times, capital punishment was administered for even such a simple thing as petty larceny.</P>

      <P>At that time, people were hanged for the larceny of anything the value of which was more than 12 pence.  What one would infer from that is that the social order has been changing so much over the years that I think it is only right this question should be considered in the light of the social order we have here to-day. Times are changing and social habits are changing in every country. That is why I say it would be well if the Government gave the matter full consideration and gave us later what the result of that consideration was.</P>
      <P>I had hoped that even here this evening we would get some statement from the Minister as to what the Government's attitude is.  Indeed, apart entirely from the abolition of capital punishment or the retention of it upon which I am giving no views myself this evening, there is a case to be made at least for the amendment of the law as it exists, even though it has been said this evening by some speakers that there have been very few cases in which the capital sentence was carried out in this country during the past few years.</P>
      <P>We had a couple of years ago what was called the Bentley case in Britain &mdash;I am just referring to this in an abstract kind of way&mdash;where two people were engaged in a criminal conspiracy and loss of life resulted.  It is the law, as Senators know, that when people conspire to carry out a criminal act, whatever that criminal act may be, and if death results, then each of those engaged in that conspiracy can be pronounced guilty of murder and can be the subject of the extreme penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> In that case, as Senators may remember, there were two people involved, but the chief instigator at the time was under age and he was reprieved.  The person who played a lesser part in the crime was executed. There was an outcry in Britain at the time against the carrying out of the sentence, but the Home Secretary apparently discovered that he had to administer the law as he found it.  I suggest that there would be a reason, perhaps, for the amendment of the law relating to the administration of capital punishment.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to speak very long on this matter because, as I say, we are not being called upon to make any decision.  I hope that if the Government have given consideration to the matter before now, we shall soon get some inkling as to what their attitude is if we do not get it this evening.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Seanad that I am not influenced by what is happening or what may happen in England with regard to capital punishment. I rise to support this motion and I can assure Senators that long before to-day I discussed the merits and demerits of capital punishment.  I think we in this country have had as much experience of it as any country in the world.  I take my stand on the moral issue.  We are told in the Scripture that: &ldquo;Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord.&rdquo;  I think we as humans have no right to take human life.  I remember speaking to a man in Birmingham in 1931.  He had spent two years in jail in England as a conscientious objector. We had a long discussion on the topic. I was in England again last week and I met a 23-year-old man who had refused to go up for his two years' training, because, he said, he would not be responsible for taking the life of anybody. Again, I had a very interesting discussion with him on capital punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many things have been said here this evening for and against the motion.  I can assure the members that I am not influenced by anything that has been said.  Senator Kissane spoke about the need for a change because the social order is changing.  There is one thing on which we have to make up our minds and that is that principle does not <Col N="201" /> change.  I am convinced that, on principle, no Government or no State should take human life.  We must think of some of the murders that have taken place and of the men who stood before the murderers.  These men did not believe in taking life.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington gave a very good illustration.  Some of us have read and knew of the fact that his father had met his death at the hands of a murderer. Many of the men who stood before the firing squads here had the moral aspect in mind when they prayed for their executioners.  For these reasons, I take my stand behind the suggestion that capital punishment should be abolished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very difficult to know why any Senator should vote against this motion since it is simply for an inquiry into one of the most important aspects of our criminal administration.  If it were a motion calling for the abolition of capital punishment, I would find myself in difficulty.  In fact, I think I should abstain because I would be afraid of succumbing to an emotional bias against capital punishment.  I would find it impossible to make a decision and would probably abstain because I would not consider that the debate here this evening, excellent though the speeches have been, had sufficiently exhausted the subject to enable the Seanad to come to a definite opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is, however, is a motion for an inquiry into the question of capital punishment.  It has been abolished in every European country, except this, and it is about to be abolished in Great Britain.  The motion for an inquiry seems to me to be an eminently reasonable demand to make on the Government. Accordingly, I could not bring myself to vote against it, though my mind is very open.  If an inquiry were set up, I feel sure the members of the inquiry would approach the subject with an equally open mind.  We had a debate here recently on the question relating to the punishment of prisoners by the confiscation of their pensions. I said then, and I repeat, that this country seems to be lagging behind <Col N="202" /> others in humanitarianism and legal reform.  There seems to be a complacency in official circles as to what is right in these matters.  We have been slow to follow modern developments in these matters and that is why I think a revision of opinion on the law is long overdue.</P>
    <P>Up to 100 years ago, anybody who stole a cow or a sheep went to the gallows in public.  I have no doubt that if we had had this debate 100 years ago, the abolition of capital punishment could not have been safely advocated. It would be said then that if capital punishment were abolished, there would be wholesale thefts and burglaries; it would be said that the fear of the gallows would not be so great if executions were not carried out in public.</P>
    <P>The fact that such public executions have been abolished and that the crimes punished by capital punishment have been lessened more and more has not brought about a marked increase in crime.  In fact, records point in the other direction.  As I have said, I think the motion is an eminently reasonable one.  It seems to me to be an effort to bring Irish law in practice into line with that of other countries.</P>
    <P>A large number of people are undoubtedly unhappy about this situation. Public opinion is unhappy about this question of capital punishment; large numbers of people feel that the whole subject should be gone into afresh.  The reason for that unhappiness is two-fold.  The reason I am unhappy in the first place, is the matter which was mentioned by Senator Stanford&mdash;the possibility of error.  We all know there have been errors in recent years, certainly in England where the errors have been admitted publicly.</P>
    <P>For serious crimes like larcenies and burglaries, innocent men have been sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. Later, the real criminals have confessed.  It has been asked in these cases by newspapers: &ldquo;What would happen if these people had been hanged?&rdquo;  Then no reparation could be made.  A great deal of controversy has grown up around the Evans case. Some of the leaders of the English Bar are quite satisfied that a grave injustice <Col N="203" /> was done in that case.  It is the fear that circumstantial evidence might sometimes lead to bad results that makes me and other people unhappy about the terrible finality of the death sentence.  If a mistake is made, there can be no reparation.  Therefore, I think public opinion is entitled to be perfectly satisfied that errors of this kind will be impossible, in so far as human judgment can go.</P>
    <P>The second reason why people are unhappy has not been mentioned in this debate.  It is really my principal reason for rising.  It is that the law regarding insanity is generally admitted to be completely out of date.  If one could be perfectly satisfied that killings were done by people with a full sense of responsibility, after full preparation and with full malice aforethought and without any flaw in their minds, no one would have such objection to the death sentence.  However, everybody knows that the law regarding insanity, is really out of line with modern psychological developments.  The law regarding insanity was laid down under the McNaghten Rules in 1843.  These rules appear to be very crude and very rough.  They date from the period before modern psychological science grew up and great difficulties arise in the courts in trying to bring the tests laid down by them into line with modern psychological developments.  I suggest to the Minister that one of the things that need investigation is the whole law of insanity.  The present law is entirely outmoded by modern psychological tests and it is entirely inadequate to the facts of the situation.</P>
    <P>If people were satisfied, that in regard to convictions on circumstantial evidence, the possibility of error was reduced to the minimum, and that no person would be hanged unless he was really responsible by the modern tests of psychological analysis, a lot of the objection to capital punishment would be removed.  People are not satisfied regarding those two things and the time has come to investigate this whole matter in its entirety.  I do not see how any person, professing to be a liberal or a humanitarian, could vote against the motion asking for an <Col N="204" /> inquiry into this exceedingly important social problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I found myself approaching the subject of this motion with fear and trembling. I must also admit that I was tempted to listen to the presentation of the case, both for and against, before I felt myself qualified to speak on it. Having heard the debate and the opinions expressed on the motion itself, I must say that I am impressed by what appears to me to be the very simple issue involved in it.</P>
      <P>The strongest case made by those who speak in favour of the retention of capital punishment seems to rest on one ground only, that is, that the retention of capital punishment is a deterrent.  Surely we do not have to look far around us to see that that argument is fallacious and is not even based on fact.  We do known that, despite the fact that in this country and other countries, capital punishment is retained as a deterrent, it has not stopped people from committing murder.</P>
      <P>The second point that strikes me is that the calculating or premeditating murderer, we can assume, automatically assumes complete immunity before he sets out to commit the crime. Consequently, the existence of capital punishment is no deterrent in such a case.  On the other side of the picture, a person who commits a murder in a fit of passion or blind rage quite clearly does not stop to think of the consequences of his crime.  In that case also, the existence of capital punishment does not act as a deterrent.</P>
      <P>Finally, the position that, I think, has already been reached on this whole question is that, whether we admit it or not, capital punishment is not, in fact, a deterrent to murder at all, and if it is a deterrent, it is not a sufficient deterrent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am much more impressed by the arguments used by the mover of the motion in which he made the case that a far better punishment would be a genuine life sentence with a prolonged period of rigorous punishment which would present to any potential murderer a far greater deterrent than the possibility of a death sentence in <Col N="205" /> punishment of his crime.  I feel that, undoubtedly, we should approach this question with a great deal of timidity and caution.  If I was faced to-night with the question of deciding whether or not we should abolish capital punishment, even as a deterrent, I think I would be forced to consider this question much more seriously and with much more than ordinary care.</P>
    <P>I have not the slightest doubt in saying that an excellent case has already been established for a complete and an immediate examination of this whole problem and I could not find it possible to oppose the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that my name is associated with this motion will make it quite clear to members of the House where I stand in the matter.  There have been one or two Senators who have gone into the whole moral and theoretical aspect of the problem.  I was brought up in the belief that to take life, in any circumstances whatever, was wholly wrong.  I have always followed that belief.  I was brought up in the belief that to take life, even in time of war, was against the teaching of Christianity.  I have always approached this question of capital punishment from that point of view.  I was very sorry that I was unable to be present when Senator Stanford proposed the motion, but I did hear Senator Sheehy Skeffington's speech and I must confess that I was very impressed by the moderate way in which he approached this problem.</P>
      <P>I have known Senator Sheehy Skeffington for a very long time.  We were in junior school together and, as long as I have known him, he has never changed his position on the question of capital punishment.  That has certainly impressed me, because of the fact that his father had, in fact, been murdered. I think I may say that on some matters Senator Sheehy Skeffington may have changed his mind, but on this question he has remained adamant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have grown older, I have appreciated, although I still believe that to take life in any circumstances is completely wrong, the position of a Government who have to deal with the <Col N="206" /> problem, not merely from an individual point of view but also from a particular religious point of view.  They have got to face the problem from the point of view of all citizens.  I can appreciate the reluctance of any Government (whether in this country, Great Britain or any of the countries of Europe) which have taken the step to abolish this punishment when, in fact, it is so seldom invoked.</P>
    <P>When Senator Stanford asked me if I would support a motion dealing with capital punishment, I think he knew perfectly well my personal views.  I did say at the time that I felt I would at the moment prefer not to put my name to a motion which simply called on the Government to abolish capital punishment.  I made it also clear that I did feel that the time had come when the Government in this Republic should examine the whole problem and see whether or not we could modify the law, or, as a temporary measure, remove capital punishment from the Statute Books.</P>
    <P>I think it is rather absurd to say that we are following in the footsteps of Great Britain.  Rather would.  I say that Great Britain rather belatedly followed in the footsteps of other countries and we are now endeavouring to amend the position from the point of view of those many other countries of Europe which had a far greater problem in regard to the taking of life than Britain ever had.  The fact that countries in Central Europe have abolished capital punishment should enable us to examine it in that modern light. I think most members of this House have agreed that a motion of this type should be passed, even though they might not be prepared to go the whole way for the abolition of capital punishment.</P>
    <P>I hope that we will pass this motion unanimously and that we will hear from the Minister that the Government will in due course give full examination and consideration to this grave problem and see whether we can modify the existing law or remove the death penalty for a temporary period.</P>

Senator Kissane has challenged me now to say what is the Government's decision in the matter. I am unable to give the Government's decision until such time as they get an opportunity of considering in full the views expressed by Senators on both sides of the House.  I shall certainly bring those views to the notice of the Government for their consideration.  I can do that in the course of the next few weeks and I can promise Senators that the Government will give due consideration to the views which have been expressed here by each individual Senator on both sides of the House.</P>

I think we have shown that there are reasonable grounds for serious consideration of the matter by the Government.  Some of us hope that the Government will abolish capital punishment; some hope that the law will be modified; others hope that it will be decided to temper the law perhaps with even more mercy <Col N="208" /> than before.  I am not going to try to make out a case now for abolition, or modification, or anything of the kind. I think we are well satisfied with the Minister's undertaking.</P>
