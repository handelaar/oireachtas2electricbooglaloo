      <P>When the House adjourned last night, I was speaking about the malicious propaganda indulged in by some of the Fianna Fáil speakers, especially Senator Cogan. They were shedding crocodile tears last night about the milk producers and the delay in publishing the Milk Costings Commission report.  Senator Cogan is accusing the present Minister for Agriculture of refusing to give a report to the Irish people that he himself has not so far got from this commission. Last night, Senator Cogan made a personal attack on the members of this commission.  He stated that, in all probability, they were afraid to give their report to the Minister in case they would be sacked. I do not want to make any personal attack on those gentlemen, but this body was set up by the Fianna Fáil Party, and, perhaps, like everything else they set up, the majority of the members on it are of their own political opinion; and, perhaps, that is the reason that they have not so far furnished the present Minister with the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The milk producers should remember that the Fianna Fáil Party, when in power a few years ago, were not so <Col N="1638" /> ready to accede to their demands. They had to go on strike, and when decent farmers from Meath, Westmeath, Tipperary, Limerick, Kerry and other counties came up here to Dublin to picket in 1951, the then Fianna Fáil Government had them arrested for picketing and lodged in Mountjoy.  And it was only after long agitation that they gave them an increase of 1d. per pint for milk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of correction, the amount was 3d.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>One penny.  Senator Cogan also spoke about the price of wheat.  Recently, the Minister gave an increase of 2/6 per barrel for wheat and that amounted to £350,000, which has been put into the pockets of the Irish farmer.  We know that the farmers of this country are getting from 15/- to 20/- per barrel for wheat over the price we could buy it at from other countries.  When we realise that only one-ninth of the farmers of this country are producing wheat&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The number is 100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>One-ninth roughly are producing wheat&mdash;is it right that the other eight-ninths should subsidise those people, because, as the Minister pointed out here, the majority of the wheat is grown in those counties where farmers are relatively well off? Senator Cogan knows as well as I know that this year, in Louth, up to £32 per acre was paid for conacre to grow wheat.  In Kilkenny, £32 was also paid; and, in Tipperary, up to £25 was paid per acre.  One thing I must say about the Irish farmers is that they are not all fools, and they would not pay this price for land, unless wheat was paying; and I think it is paying at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the farmers of this country should go in for is intensive farming and not extensive farming.  Senator Cogan should remember that, in 1945, we had something like 662,000 acres under wheat.  The amount of wheat delivered to the mills was roughly 2,837,000 barrels; and in 1955, with an acreage of 357,000 acres of wheat, there were 2,500,000 barrels of wheat delivered to the mills.  That is what we want in this country.  We want the <Col N="1639" /> farmers to get the maximum from their land, provided, as the Minister has stated here in the past, that they leave their land in the autumn at least in better heart than they found it in the spring.  There are many people who believe that the amount of money being spent on the subsidies in growing wheat to-day could be spent in a different way, one which would bring more productivity to this nation.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins asked us why can we not have increased agricultural production in this State?  When we look back over the last 20 years and see what the farmers of this country had to face and what they had to go through, we wonder how they pulled out of it at all.  When we realise that they had to face an economic war&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, I want to state that the inter-Party Government were blamed here yesterday for our present adverse balance of trade. I should like to point out to those people on the opposite side of the House that we were exporting, in 1932, £36,340,000 worth from this country and our adverse trade balance stood at only £14,000,000.  There was a change of Government immediately after that and our exports dwindled.  In 1933 they were £19,000,000; in 1934, £17,000,000; in 1935, £19,000,000; in 1936, £22,000,000; in 1937, £22,000,000; and in 1938, £24,000,000.  On the other side, our adverse trade balance increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Senator not go to 1939?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with 1939.  In 1939 prices increased, not due to the action or the work of any Government, but to the fact that there was a world war.  In 1945, despite the fact that there had been a world war <Col N="1640" /> for six or seven years, prices had increased and our total exports were only £35,496,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Had we an adverse trade balance that year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>When the inter-Party Government came into office in 1948 our total exports stood at £35,511,000. Yet the people on the opposite side speak about increased production. What has been done to increase production? At that time we had the lowest number of cattle, sheep and pigs in this country since records were first kept, but, due to the work of the inter-Party Government and the Minister for Agriculture at that time, our exports increased.  He started the land rehabilitation scheme which helped to improve hundreds of thousands of acres.  He started the soil testing scheme and the fertiliser scheme, with the result that, when they went out of office in 1951, our exports had gone up from £39,000,000 to £81,520,000.  That is something that any Government should be proud of.  The less people on the far side of the House say about increased production the better.</P>
      <P>I admit&mdash;and I think we will all admit&mdash;that at present we have not reached the crisis which the people on the opposite side would, perhaps, like us to believe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not.  It is the people on the Senator's side of the House who are trying to scare the people into believing that.  We are a creditor nation.  I hope the action taken by the Minister and, what is more important, the action the people will take themselves will get us over all our troubles and difficulties.  I think we will all admit that the people are spending beyond their means.</P>

      <P>No.  Deputy MacEntee stated that.  Because they were eating too much, you taxed butter, bacon, eggs, tea, sugar and flour and made sure that the people <Col N="1641" /> were not able to eat too much after the Budget of 1952.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The people are spending perhaps beyond their means, while our exports are not paying for essential imports.  We all know that state of affairs cannot continue, for, if it did, we would head for bankruptcy.  To-day, we all have to admit that the danger of inflation is accentuated by the fact that every section of the community is striving for its own benefit, forgetful of the needs of the rest of the community and of the overall national economy.  I think far too many people at present are trying to get all they can and give as little as they can in return.  I do not blame any one section for that, but, to get money out of the State's purse, we must first of all put the money in, and we can put it in, if everybody works a little harder and pulls his weight.</P>
      <P>I should like to stress the point that we can maintain our present standard of living, if we increase production, export more and reduce our adverse trade balance.  Some other Senator stated yesterday that to increase agricultural and industrial production, all restrictive practices should cease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The country faces a problem.  In my opinion, it can be solved in four different ways.  I will run through the four of them.  In the first place, I think we can help to solve that problem through increased agricultural production.  If we could double our agricultural production, we could export four times what we are exporting to-day.  If we did that, then we would have a grand country for everybody to live in.  The <Col N="1642" /> present economy of this country depends on what the farmers are able to get from the land of Ireland and export profitably to the British market, because we have very little underground wealth.  We have no coal, or such minerals, and the standard of living for every man, woman and child in this country, whether living in the cities or towns, depends upon what the farmers are able to get from the land of this country.</P>
    <P>No matter what has been said about cattle or about the bullock in the past, everybody must agree that what we get for our cattle from Britain helps to pay for the raw materials that keep our factories going and our people in employment.  You may ask: How can we have increased agricultural production? We can achieve it through increased short-term credit facilities for farmers.  That will facilitate production. In my view, financial encouragement will meet with a response in almost every agricultural community. With the drop that took place recently in cattle prices, many farmers will have to dip down into their capital, or will have to try to borrow extra money to stock their land during the coming year.  We should encourage farmers to go in for a balanced economy.  Despite what Senator Cogan said here last night about one more cow, one more sow, one more acre under the plough, I think that would be the salvation of this nation.</P>
    <P>We should try to grow, as the Minister for Agriculture has repeatedly asked our farmers, barley and potatoes and feed them to the pigs for export to the British market.  We believe the British market is a good market; we have never said that it was gone and gone forever, and thanks be to God.  The Minister has now guaranteed a minimum price of 235/- per cwt. for grade &ldquo;A&rdquo; pigs.  The farmer wants stability in prices and, at that price, pigs will pay.  No farmer, big or small, will make a fortune out of them, but pigs will pay at that price. It should be borne in mind that, in 1925 and 1926, Irish farmers were exporting £7,000,000 worth of bacon to the British market.  If we could export the same volume of bacon to-day, we <Col N="1643" /> would get between £25,000,000 and £30,000,000.  That money would go a long way towards solving the problems that face us now.</P>
    <P>Another appeal we should make to the farmers is to keep the proper type of cattle.  Last night, Senator Cogan ran down the parish plan.  He ran it down for one reason only, namely, that it was sponsored by the Minister for Agriculture.  If the chief agricultural officers and agricultural instructors of this country had done their job for the past 25 or 30 years, there would be no need perhaps to-day for a parish plan.</P>
    <P>We want increased agricultural production. We want to encourage the farmers to keep the proper type of cattle&mdash;the small beast of 9 or 10 cwt. They should remember that the day of the 13, 14 or 15-cwt. bullock has gone. They should remember that the people in Britain to-day want quality, not quantity, and they should try to suit their customers.</P>
    <P>The last thing I would say as regards agricultural production is that Irish farmers should adopt the T.B. eradication scheme.  It is compulsory in two counties&mdash;in Sligo and Clare.  However, every farmer should avail of that scheme, which is free.  The farmer should remember that, in Scotland, the majority of ports are closed to-day and that nearly one-third of the English ports are already closed to cattle, unless they are free from T.B.  In another eight or ten years the majority of the ports in Britain may be closed. Therefore, it behoves our farmers, in their own and in the national interest, to have their cattle examined immediately by the veterinary surgeon. As I have already said, the scheme is free.</P>
    <P>The second way in which we could surmount our difficulties is through increased industrial production.  Our Irish manufacturers must make a more determined effort to secure a place in world markets.  To-day, we have industrialists who are protected by tariffs and quotas.  For what it is worth, my opinion is that many of them are not doing their duty to the public.  They seem to be more concerned with their <Col N="1644" /> dividends than with anything else.  Our industrialists must make goods that will sell abroad and be good enough to face competition from any other country.  We live in an era of ruthless competition.  People abroad will not buy Irish-manufactured goods for sentimental reasons only.  The motto of Irish industrialists should be &ldquo;Value for Money.&rdquo;  We all know that the Government are doing their best to help and to give a lead to our industrialists and manufacturers.  It should be remembered that the manufacturers themselves must play the leading role.  All policies and practices which are in conflict with the aim of producing the very best must cease immediately.</P>
    <P>We should have a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign and by a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign, I do not mean a campaign for one week of the year, but a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign for the 52 weeks of the year.  If we look up the official statistics, we will see that we are buying between £25,000,000 and £30,000,000 worth of goods from abroad that could be or should be produced here.  It is in the interests of all sections of the community&mdash;labour, industrialists, farmers, and so forth&mdash;that we &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo;.  It is not a matter of sentiment, but of common sense.  The citizen who takes foreign goods, or who takes the first thing he is offered without inquiring as to its origin is doing his country a disservice.  The shopkeeper who does not stock Irish goods or the shopkeeper who has Irish goods only on the back shelves is striking at the country's economy, at his own prosperity and at his own job.</P>
    <P>Let us take one small item as an example.  Take an Irishman who buys a suit length that was manufactured in England or Scotland and which costs 15 or 16 guineas.  The whole of that sum is distributed between the shopkeeper who sells it, the tailor who makes it, the wholesaler who markets it and the people who manufacture it. If the suit length had been manufactured in Ireland all that money would go to increase prosperity and to give employment in our own country.  But if a person buys a suit that is made abroad, or made from material that has been made abroad, the money goes <Col N="1645" /> out of the country.  He is helping to employ somebody in a foreign country and he is also helping to swell our adverse trade balance.  I think the people of this country, in order to help the Minister and in their own selfish interest, should make their motto this year: to buy Irish and to ask for Irish goods when they go into a shop.  If they meet the seoinín who says: &ldquo;We have not got Irish goods in the shop,&rdquo; let them say: &ldquo;I am sorry, I am going somewhere else where I can get the &lsquo;Irish&rsquo; goods.&rdquo;  If everyone in the country did that, we could reduce our adverse trade balance by £30,000,000 or £40,000,000 in the year.</P>
    <P>Everybody in this country should work a little harder and should try to produce more, and it is only necessary to look at what Japan and Germany have done through hard work and the proper spirit and the will to win through at all costs.  These people after the last war were defeated and were left prostrate.  They were sorely handicapped for capital, machinery and for everything except their tradition and their ability to work hard.  They started from scratch and worked hard, and to-day they have captured the majority of the markets of the world.  I do not believe that the Irish people are in any way inferior to the Germans or Japanese, because we know, when the Irish people emigrate, they work hard.  They helped to build up America, Africa, England and other countries.  If they worked as hard at home here in Ireland, they would make this a land of which we could all be justly proud.</P>

      <P>This Bill does give an opportunity to members of this House to deal with a variety of matters Together with the Supplies and Services Bill, it gives a chance to members to indulge in a rather wide discussion in regard generally to Government policy.  It is probably a pity that the two Bills are being taken at the one time this year, because there were some weeks or more between them in other years, and we had two opportunities of having a free-for-all discussion, whereas this year I am afraid, Sir, we will have only one opportunity. However, it is only natural that in this debate the recent duties should be discussed at some length.  May I say that it is rather interesting to hear members on the other side talk about uncharitable criticism and unfair criticism of Government policy?  In fact, it was amusing to hear Senator McGuire give a lecture on charity last night.  He obviously was addressing his remarks to people on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>It would be very effective now to see the drama, or tragedy or farce, if he had not been between Senator McGuire and Senator Hickey, because we could see more clearly the position of two people professing to adore the one oracle, but speaking in a different language.  We had Senator McGuire giving his definition or doctrine in regard to his viewpoint on the approach to money as being a token&mdash; a medium of exchange between producers of goods and services and commodities&mdash;and Senator Hickey propounding a different theory.</P>

While Senator <Col N="1647" /> McGuire did prove to me that he has some grasp, at any rate, of this involved or supposed-to-be-involved question of money, it is funny at the same time that Senator Hickey should seize the earliest opportunity to try to prove&mdash;and prove to his own satisfaction&mdash;I know he was quite sincere in the viewpoint he expressed&mdash;that he did not agree with Senator McGuire's doctrine in that regard.</P>

      <P>Still, Senator McGuire did give a lecture on Christian charity obviously addressed to people on this side of the House.  If a little more of that doctrine were practised by Senator McGuire's colleagues, if it had been practised by Senator L'Estrange last night and to-day, but last night particularly, I might not have to make some of the statements that I may make. Senator McGuire talked about the responsibilities of trade unions.  If Senator McGuire really believes that, he should practise what he preaches. He should become the one apostle of profit-sharing in this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cogan referred to the deficit in the balance of payments and also to the adverse trade balance.  He stated that a deficit in the balance of payments, and adverse trade balance, seems to follow Coalition Governments as the tail follows the cat.  As far as I can recollect, those were the words he used.  It is rather extraordinary that on two occasions, from 1948 to 1951, <Col N="1648" /> and in 1951, this country found itself with a deficit in the balance of payments to the tune of over £60,000,000. That is a fact that cannot be denied and no amount of trying to explain it away will succeed.  It just cannot be explained away.</P>
    <P>In 1952, certain steps had to be taken to safeguard the financial and even the political structure of this country. Certain things had to be done and the people whose policies and actions were responsible to a large degree for the position in which the country found itself in 1952, with an adverse trade balance of £50,000,000, went all over the country criticising the Government. Those people at that time suggested that the situation was not a dangerous one and that there was no need to do anything about it.  When certain steps were taken by the then Government, the people of the country were told that they were being taxed simply for the purpose of inflicting punishment on them.  The people who are now taking steps to deal with a similar position suggested that there was £15,000,000 in over-taxation in the 1952 Budget and they knew very well at that time that that was not so.</P>
    <P>There was no lecture then given about charity in public statements and I would say that Senator McGuire is rather belated in the lecture which he delivered in this House.  There was no reference made in 1952 to the difficulties of the situation which had been brought about by the then Opposition during their term of office, but the sky was the limit in misrepresentation and all the propaganda that could be used was used in an effort to deceive the people.  People who ought to have known better and who ought to have had a greater sense of responsibility went around the country talking about our sterling assets and their repatriation, and endeavouring to gull the people by telling them that there was some easy way of dealing with the situation.  The people who were talking in that fashion knew, as Senator McGuire and Senator Hickey know, that, in the long run, the currency of this country depends on our ability to produce the goods we need at home and for export.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do say that it is because of the statements that have been made in the past by these people that they find themselves in this difficulty now.  That is the reason why the present Government finds itself in the position that there is an adverse trade balance of £94,000,000 and a deficit in the balance of payments of between £34,000,000 and £35,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Cogan has said, it seems that the position with the Coalition Government is that the tail follows the cat.  He did not give any reason for that, but I would say that it is because of bad leadership and because of the statements that were made by the members of the Coalition when they attempted to discredit the Fianna Fáil Government for the steps it was taking to deal with a similar situation.  The <Col N="1650" /> very unsavoury duty has fallen on the Minister of dealing with this problem and I am not going to suggest, as members of the Government suggested on another occasion, that he is imposing a hair-shirt policy.  That was what was said of Fianna Fáil when they took similar steps to meet an adverse trade balance.</P>
    <P>It was then said that they were overtaxing the people to the tune of £15,000,000 and were imposing a hair-shirt policy.  I could change the words in this case and suggest that the Government is imposing a wire-shirt policy.  I agree, however, that the steps being taken are necessary and I am not going to apply the terms &ldquo;hair-shirt&rdquo; or &ldquo;wire-shirt&rdquo; policy.  What I think is that the Minister is making some little attempt to deal with the situation now facing this country.  The Minister quite realises, I am sure, that if we continue to spend more on imports than we are getting from exports and if we continue to show a deficit in the balance of payments and have a succession of unbalanced Budgets, then we are going to find the country in jeopardy.  In so far as the Minister and the Government are trying to deal with that situation, they should be supported.</P>
    <P>It is rather a pity that when a similar position arose in 1952, which was mainly the making of the Government in the years between 1948 and 1951, the then Opposition should have indulged in tactics of criticism that were unfair and unjust.  We have to realise that if the position were allowed to continue in which there was a deficit in the balance of payments and an adverse trade balance year after year, with no effort to correct it, the country would be living from hand to mouth.</P>
    <P>Everybody will agree when I say that the currency of this country depends ultimately on our ability to produce the goods we need.  While it may be in the long run that our currency is a cheque drawn on the credit of the people&mdash;it may be nicely drawn and well painted with Lady Lavery looking sideways, but it still is a cheque drawn on the credit of the community&mdash;it will be honoured according to what, in the opinion of other people, is the credit <Col N="1651" /> worthiness of the drawer.  I know, if I gave a cheque for £10 to any member of this House, it would be accepted.  If I gave a cheque for £10,000,000 and, providing the person to whom I was giving it had to render service or give me goods, I am afraid it would not be accepted.</P>
    <P>The same position exists in regard to the currency of this country, and there is no use in people who should know better trying to gull the people of this country into believing that, by tricking around with currency, you are going to solve every single economic, political and social problem in this country.  So much of that has been taking place that it is the reason for the tail following the cat&mdash;the tail of an adverse trade balance and a deficit in the balance of payments following the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>In so far as an attempt has been made to deal with the problem, the Minister should be supported; but I wonder, since his own estimate says that it will only relieve the situation to the tune of £7,000,000, would the Minister not have gone further, were it not for certain difficulties arising at Government level?  I just wonder.  I believe the Minister is a man capable of grasping the situation, but I wonder is he too happy himself in regard to the ultimate value of the duties recently applied?  I could argue that some of those duties are being imposed on goods that are not luxury goods.  It could be argued, for instance, that to put a duty on a bicycle&mdash;the transport of the poorer section of society here&mdash; can hardly be justified.  But I cannot quarrel very far with the Minister on any of these items because we here do accept that the Minister has to deal with the situation.  It is my feeling, however, that the Minister has not been given a free hand in dealing with this situation along the lines and in the manner which he would like.  Even on his own estimate, the value of these measures will be only £7,000,000, and the Minister knows, as everybody knows, that that is not going to solve the problem.</P>

      <P>Perhaps, after this lesson has been learned by the Government, they will, when difficulties of this type arise again, have more sense of responsibility and will not in the future indulge in the propaganda about hair-shirt Budgets and over-taxation to the tune of £15,000,000.  I hope this lesson will create a greater sense of responsibility in certain quarters.</P>
      <P>Last night, we heard quite a lot of talk from Senator L'Estrange.  He referred to the subsidies; he referred to the economic war; and he referred to the economic war again to-day, and the Chair felt it desirable that that should not be raised in the debate. Since the Chair did rule in regard to Senator L'Estrange, I think it would only be fair to the Chair that I should also not make reference to that.  Therefore, I will not.</P>
      <P>I think it takes a terrific amount of cheek for someone to talk about tea in this House as Senator L'Estrange talked about it last night.  He talked about the subsidies and he attacked Fianna Fáil.  It would be a lesson to him if I could display to him across this House some of the posters that Senator L'Estrange helped to display that guaranteed to the people of this country lower prices, lower taxation and better times for everyone.  I am sure he will rememeber them well.</P>

In view of the statement made by Senator L'Estrange last night, I am sorry I am not in a position, although I know I could get them, to show these posters up here and ask Senator L'Estrange what has he done in regard to redeeming those undertakings given to the public?  In view of the fact that nothing has been done, it takes a lot of &ldquo;neck&rdquo; to talk about subsidies.  It takes a lot of &ldquo;neck&rdquo; to talk about the cost of living, in view of the fact that Senator L'Estrange and others guaranteed and promised the people that, if elected to power, they would reduce the cost of those items.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

      <P>While I agree that other people on the other side of the House did fire questions at Senator L'Estrange when he was speaking, I think Senator L'Estrange will agree that I did not, and, since I did not heckle him, I think, out of ordinary courtesy, he should not heckle me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard also from Senator L'Estrange a barefaced attempt to try to prove to the farming community that the price of wheat has been increased by 2/6 a barrel.  It was a masterly piece of under-statement to say that the price of wheat has been increased by 2/6 per barrel, in view of the fact that it was cut by 12/6 and then increased by 2/6, showing a net reduction of 10/- per barrel.  Senator L'Estrange also tried to imply that very few farmers were concerned in the growing of wheat.  As far as I can remember, from my figures, between 90,000 and 100,000 farmers are engaged in the growing of wheat in this country.  There is no use in his suggesting <Col N="1654" /> that very few people engage in wheat growing.  Senator L'Estrange hid the fact that, because of the reduction in the price paid to the farmers, £5,000,000 had to be exported on the purchase of wheat.  That could have been prevented if a different policy had been adopted in regard to wheat growing, but apparently anything that certain Ministers do will be justified by speakers on the opposite side of the House.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, there is no easy way out of this matter.  While the measures taken by the Minister recently to deal with the difficulties may be partially successful, I do not think they will go far enough to right the position; but since the Minister has, at any rate, given some evidence of dealing with the situation, he can count on the fact that the measures will not be attacked as were similar measures in 1952 by the then Opposition.</P>
    <P>In future, when difficulties of this nature arise, no matter what Government is in power, I hope the misrepresentation of that time will not be indulged in in an endeavour to mislead the people or make the position worse. If the Minister had a Government decision in regard to the growing of wheat to increase the price to a level that would ensure the maximum amount of wheat required would be grown in the country, the adverse balance of trade could be righted.  It is agreed on all sides of the House that the real solution lies in increased production. The fact is that our exports are dropping.  They dropped to the tune of £5,000,000 last year as compared with the previous year, and that despite the fact that we were told agricultural production was on the upgrade.</P>
    <P>Senator Bergin tried to suggest that the farmers were not pulling their weight in so far as increased production was concerned.  As a farmer, I want to point out to Senator Bergin and everybody else that if you were to take the value of agricultural exports away from the total volume of our exports, exports would be very small indeed.  Our exports were estimated at <Col N="1655" /> approximately £111,000,000 in 1955.  I am prepared to argue that of that £111,000,000 approximately £80,000,000 would be the value of agricultural exports.  It is a simple matter of subtraction for Senator Bergin to discover the remainder.  It should be remembered, too, that less than half the people of this country are engaged in agriculture.  I do not think it is a good thing for Senator Bergin, who represents one interest in this country, to point the finger of scorn at the agricultural community, particularly in view of the fact that the figures do not justify his statement.  If Senator Bergin can prove to me that the value of our agricultural exports does not total up to £80,000,000, then I stand open to correction.</P>
    <P>It is only along the line of increased output that our problems can be really solved.  Unless this country is able to produce more and sell more on the export market, we cannot hope to maintain the standard of living the people seem to want to mainain; we cannot maintain the social services that we seem to want; and neither can we expect to import the consumer goods from abroad that we seem to want.  I do not think the levies imposed by the Minister will prevent the importation of consumer goods.  Some of these goods may be regarded as luxury goods.  What constitutes luxury goods is really a matter of opinion.  For instance, some people might claim that a television set is not a luxury, while somebody else might argue the contrary.  It is a matter of opinion. Naturally, it is the responsibility of the Minister to decide, but if we really want to solve this problem permanently, it can only be done by increased exports.</P>
    <P>With regard to agriculture, the greatest single item of export is cattle, and, unless we increase our cattle population, we cannot hope to increase our exports, but there are many people in this country and in the House who talk as if one can hatch out calves in an incubator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the people who give us lectures on increased agricultural production behave as if there was some easy way of stepping up agricultural production and the output of cattle.  They speak as if calves could be hatched out in incubators, the same as chickens.  That is not so.  If we really want to increase our cattle population, then it will mean that we shall have to increase our cow population. People who oftentimes speak for agriculture do not believe in fostering the dairy industry at all.  There are people in this country who depend on dealing in cattle and who still argue that they speak for agriculture.  They are not producers of cattle.  They may buy cattle at a fair, but it would be much better if those people increased the cow population.</P>
      <P>I will conclude by saying that, in so far as the Government are proposing to tackle this problem, they will receive all possible assistance from members of this side of the House.</P>

      <P>The debate at this stage reminds me of an archery contest in which the target is placed between opposing teams, the members of which are so busy firing at each other over and under and on both sides of the target that nobody hits the target itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are reminded from time to time that this discussion should be about the broad principles of financial policy. I should like to speak about that and the present financial policy.  There was some discussion about the &ldquo;sacred cow&rdquo; of sterling.  It seems to me that that is really an Irish bull, or perhaps I should say &ldquo;blunder.&rdquo;  Having <Col N="1657" /> secured a certain measure of political independence, we never went the whole way in taking unto ourselves proper control of our own financial system. That seems to have been the vital mistake that has been made.  All the sniping missed that particular target.</P>
    <P>We have not ensured that the bulk of Irish money is invested in productive Irish interests.  In this country, productive enterprise must mainly be agricultural enterprise.  At present, agriculture, our chief industry, is completely starved of capital investment. It is suffering from chronic malnutrition. It is also unquestionable that Irish capital is to a large extent invested in English securities.  It is availed of by the English banks to finance, for instance, the Scottish hydro-electric scheme; it is availed of by English banks to finance, for instance, British rearmament, which is an unproductive enterprise.  That is extremely bad at a time when lack of Irish capital investment at home has helped to increase emigration and to increase unemployment.</P>
    <P>At present, our greatest productive exports are people.  They find employment in England.  They work on the Scottish hydro-electric scheme and in British armaments factories.  At the same time we hear Irish Senators chanting in chorus&mdash;two of whom are directors of Messrs. Guinness&mdash;that there should be less capital expenditure, even though that will mean more unemployment and more emigration.</P>

      <P>Absolutely.  It seems to me improper to talk of the balance <Col N="1658" /> of payments as if it were some sacred thing that was to be allowed to interfere with the liberty and the pursuit of happiness of people.  We should hear more about people who want employment, who are forced to emigrate and who must stand in the unemployment queue.  It is absolutely vital that we should take over control of our finances, or, if we have control of them, we must use that control to develop our own country.  Potentially, Ireland is full of talent&mdash;intellectually, materially and physically.  The reason for our under-development is largely a lack of capital investment.</P>
      <P>It may be argued by the conservative financiers or economists that England is our best customer.  England is also Denmark's best customer.  Over 40 per cent. of Danish investment is in Danish agricultural production.  New Zealand controls its own finances. Politically, it is closer to England than we are.  Time after time, whether they be Americans, Danes or Swedes visiting this country, people have commented on the extraordinary fact that we have not an independent currency and financial system.</P>
      <P>My special interest in this is, if you like, limited to the factor that graduate training for employment is, to a large extent, bound up with capital investment.  Take agriculture as an example.  Not so long ago, two Professors of University College, Cork&mdash; Professor Boyle and Professor Quinlan &mdash;published in the <i>University Review</i> a study of agriculture in relation to the university.  They pointed out in the course of that study that the Danes</P>
      <P>&ldquo;who have less than 75 per cent. of our arable land and a correspondingly smaller agricultural population, have 25 agricultural colleges training 2,500 young farmers each year.  We have nine, training 400.  They train 120 to 150 graduates each year. We train 25 to 30.  They have one instructor to 300 to 400 farmers. We have only one to almost 3,000 farmers.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The training of instructors, the creation of agricultural institutes and research centres all demand capital investment.  Therefore, the investment <Col N="1659" /> of Irish capital, to my mind, affects our graduates in common with the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>England, where there is full employment, expends a large amount of money on education.  Take the universities alone.  At present 72 per cent. of English students receive State aid in one form or another.  At present, somewhere between 10 and 15 per cent. of our students receive State aid.  All told, I think less than half of 1 per cent. of our national expenditure is devoted to education.  I am not arguing that because I am an educationist myself, but simply because it seems to me that any country that neglects to develop the potential talent of its people is really neglecting probably the most important of its tasks.</P>
    <P>In his introductory remarks, the Minister said he would be willing to amplify any points he mentioned, or that he would answer any question arising out of his opening statement. Is the Minister aware that more and more people in Ireland are at present asking whether a financial policy suitable to England, a country where there is full employment, is necessarily suitable to Ireland where there is chronic under-investment and where there is quite a considerable amount of unemployment?</P>
    <P>Recently Dr. Lucey, the Bishop of Cork, asked this question.  He did not ask it as a financial expert: he is no more a financial expert than I am or than, I presume, the Minister is.  I think he asked it because many of his flock are asking it.  The question is whether the policy we are following is necessarily the right one and, if it is, why do we leave out one of the important factors, namely, a much more stringent control on capital investment? People have been asking why should a sudden rise in the English bank rate cause the closure of an under-subscribed Irish loan on the very day, in fact, that many Irish citizens received application forms by post from the issuing authorities for that loan?</P>
    <P>Anything other than a drastic change of policy is not going to enable us to <Col N="1660" /> solve that problem.  I think the present credit squeeze, as it is called, is only nibbling.  I think it is good, given certain suppositions which I, for one, would not take for granted.  Within the present framework of financial policy, I suppose it is a good thing to prevent people spending money on television sets which could be spent on more productive commodities, but I should like the Minister to answer this. It is pretty certain from the pattern of events in England since the credit squeeze, that among the effects of it there has been unemployment&mdash;a certain amount of unemployment.  That is not such a bad thing in a country where there is full employment, or perhaps over-employment in a sense&mdash;I do not know just what is the term&mdash; but you have complaints from the London County Council that they cannot get enough bus conductors.  Presumably the people who leave off making television sets would be diverted into such employment.  Loss of employment here, it seems to me, would not be such a good thing because people laid off as a result of the credit squeeze may very well follow the normal pattern of this country and emigrate to England.</P>
    <P>It seems to me also that there are certain things that should be done as well.  I suppose everyone is entitled to make suggestions, and it seems to me that one rather bad thing about the credit squeeze is this: You have the middle income group so crushed by income-tax that they cannot save. They are the people who usually save, and they are not the people who buy television sets.  It is usually in the lower income group that you have this buying of television sets.  Secondly, I think English firms, quite a number of them&mdash;and I can be corrected if I am wrong in this point&mdash;automatically transfer their takings to England.  They go into an Irish bank and simply ask for transfer of funds immediately to England.  I am assured that this is the case by a bank manager, but the Minister can correct me if I am wrong, or if the bank manager is wrong.</P>
    <P>Finally, there are certain luxuries which are not taxed and which should be taxed.  Can we afford so many <Col N="1661" /> banks for example&mdash;banks which seem to have no hesitation whatever in erecting premises that cost £10,000 or £20,000 or £30,000?  It is somewhat ironic to find these luxuries the stamping-ground of people who continually direct lofty warnings to the Irish people&mdash;warning us what a profligate, spendthrift race we are.  I rather resent that.  I do not think we are so profligate, but I do know that people are emigrating in great number and that quite a number are unemployed. I think the Minister, in adhering to the general pattern set by predecessors in regard to financial policy, is perpetuating what I call an Irish blunder.  We have 70,000 unemployed and heaven knows how many hundreds of thousands of emigrants attest the failure of that policy, and I think it is about time it was changed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have now for about eight hours debated the economic policy of this country.  I deplore the tendency that has crept in during the last couple of hours of rending one another rather than trying to make suggestions to deal with the problem. Of necessity, the debate has centred around the balance of payments and the efforts made by the Minister to correct the position.  It seems to me that the crisis in the balance of payments is not quite as severe as is being implied&mdash;I will come to that later&mdash;and secondly, that it could be corrected in three ways, or by a combination of them.  The first is by reducing imports, and I would stress that any policy of reducing imports must, in some sense or other, lead to a lowering of the standard of living, unless these imports are replaced by similar goods produced at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second way of tackling the problem, and the most obvious way, is by increasing exports.  I said there was a third way, but really my third is really a combination of these two.  The Minister has had of necessity to make a negative approach to this problem, that is by reducing imports and has rightly, in doing that, concentrated on luxury imports.  I should like to say, however, that the efforts of all Parties and of all sections of the community should be channelled into rectifying <Col N="1662" /> the balance of payments situation by the second method, that is, of increasing exports.  Now I can see, and I admit right away, that exports from this country are mainly agricultural.  They were, I think, in the last year 60 per cent. of our exports.  That compares, I believe, with 80 per cent. pre-war. Agricultural exports, as we know, can be roughly divided into foodstuffs and live stock.  Now the outlook in regard to exports of agricultural foodstuffs seems to be very dark indeed.  Personally, I find it hard to understand why we as a country a few miles&mdash;less than 100 miles&mdash;from the main market, cannot compete with countries which send their produce from the furthest parts of this earth.</P>
    <P>We have had various points made in this debate about the Milk Costings Report and it is suggested that the report is being held up by the Government, and that the milk producers are in equity entitled to an increase in the price of milk.  I find myself a bit puzzled by this, because it seems to me that already we are subsidising butter produced from our own home produced milk, to the extent of 8d. per lb. Somebody remarked to me the other day that, in effect, in practice, we could get butter from New Zealand to Ireland at 1d. per lb. less than Irish butter is being sold at here.  When you take into account the Irish subsidy, the difference is 9d. a lb.</P>
    <P>I do not know if my figures are correct, but I think this point is correct anyway, that we are unable to recover our place in the British and world market for agricultural foodstuffs. Particularly in regard to butter, bacon, eggs, we have been unable to recover our pre-war position. We have been priced out of the market.  If, in these circumstances, we are to further increase the price of some of these agricultural foodstuffs, I do not know what hope there is in the future of getting back into that market again.</P>
    <P>Somebody may say&mdash;Senator Cogan is not here&mdash;that I know very little about agriculture.  I do not claim to know a whole lot, but it strikes many of us that we can be excused in talking about agriculture because of the <Col N="1663" /> very poor job that is being done by agriculturists here at the moment.  I want to come to that later.</P>
    <P>The principal part of our agricultural exports is, as every Senator knows, live stock, and the bulk of these are store cattle.  I was glad that Senator L'Estrange referred to the threat to that export created by the bovine T.B. eradication scheme in Britain at the present time.  That, I believe, is making very steady and rapid progress and it does seem to people who have examined the problem that, unless we quicken our efforts here in that direction, we will very soon find ourselves out of a very big proportion of the market in Britain for our store cattle.  In that respect, I was glad to see the Estimates providing a substantial increase in the money for the eradication of T.B.  The amount asked for in the Estimate for that purpose is £570,500, an increase of £350,000 over last year.  That is a very substantial increase, but I venture to doubt whether a little over £500,000 which is asked for is enough to speed up dealing with this problem which, if not tackled properly, might lead to a crisis in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I have said that I do not think that agriculturists are making too good a job of this matter of production and I should like to illustrate that point by quoting some figures to the Seanad which have a bearing on the position and the volume of production in agriculture. Taking 1939 as the base year, we see in 1951 that it was 103.7; in 1952 it was 108.5; in 1953 108.7; and in 1954 it was 113.8.  I think the Minister stated in the Dáil that agricultural output in the past year showed a drop of £5,000,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in exports, but the point I want to make is that a 5 per cent. increase in agricultural output in 1955 would have given us some £10,000,000 more in agricultural exports. I fail to see why that increase in output would be consumed at home; I think it would inevitably have gone on the export market.  That would have given us something in the neighbourhood <Col N="1664" /> of £10,000,000 more in exports in 1955, whereas we have had a drop of £5,000,000.  In other words, the balance of payments position, if the two things are taken together, has been worsened to the extent of £15,000,000.</P>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is that it would have been reasonable indeed to assume that, if agricultural output had increased by 5 per cent., it would have given us £10,000,000 more in exports, but, instead, we have a loss of £5,000,000 and, if instead of a loss of £5,000,000, we got an additional £10,000,000 in exports, the balance of payments position would have been bettered to the tune of £15,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>A 5 per cent. increase in exports would give only £5,000,000, and not £10,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about an increase of 5 per cent. in agricultural output.  That, in my opinion, would inevitably have gone to exports and would not be consumed at home, so that, by the drop back in agriculture in the past year, the balance of payments position is £15,000,000 worse than it should otherwise have been.</P>
      <P>There is a deficit of £35,000,000 and I suggest that if, instead of talking about a deficit of £35,000,000, the deficit were only £20,000,000, there would hardly be all this hue and cry and sense of crisis which we have now about the position.  In reality, the crisis this year is due mainly to the falling back in agriculture and the failure of agriculture, in spite of all the money we have turned into it in the past year in the land rehabilitation scheme, the ground limestone scheme and others.  It does seem that the money invested in all those efforts has not produced the desired results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody may question whether industry has done better.  I think so; but of course the figures available are not comparable figures.  Taking 1936 as base 100, we find that, in 1952, it was 315.5, and, in 1953, 355.6, so it will be seen that the crisis is mainly due to the failure of agriculture to increase production and it is because of this failure that we have the difficulty over the balance of payments.  I have no <Col N="1665" /> ready cure for this problem, but I would suggest that it is not too helpful to have agriculture bandied about between the political Parties.  I would hope that some day we might reach agreement on agricultural policy and carry it out.  It is, I suppose, inevitable, politicians being what they are and the agricultural community having such a big weight, that there should be the football of wheat prices, and so on, being kicked from goal to goal. We all agree, I think, that there is a definite falling back in agricultural output in Ireland, and, unless we can tackle that problem and cure it, any talk about industrial expansion or the maintenance of our economic or political freedom is so much waste of breath.</P>
    <P>There has been talk about industrial expansion and I am concerned as to whether our hopes in that direction might be halted by the present financial crisis.  Senator O'Brien stated yesterday, I think, that not much harm or good would be done by a rise in the bank rate.  When he says not much good will be done, I am very much in agreement with him, but I do suggest that a great deal of harm could be done by such a rise in the bank rate.  I think the Minister and the Government generally realise that any increase in unemployment would be very serious and they should be prepared to tackle the problems which are facing the country.  Further increases in the bank rate would, of necessity, lead to an increase in unemployment. The procuring of money for house building is already very difficult.  I do not think that raising the bank rate will make it any easier; but it is far more difficult for the people building, for the tenant or the tenant purchaser who has to pay an extraordinarily high rate of interest for 30 or 40 years.  I wonder how these people who are at present purchasing houses in Dublin can hope, in the years ahead, to meet repayments and to meet the ever-increasing rates.</P>
    <P>Coming back to industry, industry cannot contribute materially in regard to our balance of payments problem. It can contribute something, but the chief task lies with agriculture.  The <Col N="1666" /> reason I mention industry in this respect is that, even though it might not be too much concerned in relation to the balance of payments, it is concerned in providing employment here. That should be the chief aim of this Government, to expand industry, incidentally in the hope that it will assist in the rectification of our balance of payments problem, but essentially because it will provide employment. Of course, the expansion of employment would provide a bigger and a steadier market at home for our agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>I hope I have not been too inaccurate in my assessment of the position.  But here I would like to turn to the levy which has been imposed by the Minister on our luxury imports.  I was disappointed that, in dealing with these imports, he did not see the wisdom of including in that levy commercial goods vehicles.  I say this, because, earlier in the speech which the Minister made to the Dáil, he stressed the need for savings.  It does seem to me and to many other people that the investment of capital in commercial goods vehicles is probably the most wasteful use of capital, speaking from the point of view of the national interest.</P>
    <P>We have at various times mentioned the transport crisis which is current here, because of the crisis in Northern Ireland.  The problem boils down to the fact that there is too much transport for the amount of goods and passengers to be transported.  By leaving out the commercial goods vehicles, the Minister has rather encouraged the expansion of this field, the spending of more money on these lorries, to the detriment, in my opinion, of the country generally, and particularly to the detriment of organised public transport owned by the nation.</P>
    <P>The effect on the public transport undertakings will be very severe, if the present tendency continues.  I do not know whether the Minister has a detailed knowledge of this position.  I was glancing at the Estimates and I find certain provisions are made under the Vote for Industry and Commerce for the losses arising on the Great <Col N="1667" /> Northern Railway.  The Estimates here are very modest and I do not think the Minister can expect to get away with the amount provided or asked for in the coming year.  The detrimental effect of this slant of the levy on the public transport undertakings will inevitably and eventually fall to be met by the Exchequer.  It will lead to greater losses and these must in some way, some day, be met by the Exchequer.  It will have the further effect of reducing employment in the public transport industry, both in the traffic sections and the workshops generally.</P>
    <P>The Government is not altogether sincere when comparisons are made with the policy in regard to the maintenance of railways and the policy of the Northern Ireland Government. The people concerned must realise that, whilst it may be a Northern Ireland problem to-day, it will be the Republic's problem to-morrow, unless something is done about the matter.  I am sorry, therefore, that the Minister has not included commercial goods vehicles in the scope of the levy, because I feel it would be helpful to the Exchequer eventually and to public transport, to do so.</P>
    <P>The same omission was made in the Order made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce dealing with the hire-purchase arrangements.  There, too, these lorries were excluded.  Such exclusion cannot be justified on a contention that these are capital goods increasing output and efficiency in the country generally.  It is wasteful investment and the levy should have been put on these goods vehicles, as well as on the ordinary motor car.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I express the hope that anything I have said in regard to agriculture will not add to the turmoil and that at least some notice will be taken of my appeal that agriculture and agricultural policy should, as far as possible, be taken out of politics and that we should attempt at least to unite and to solve the very serious problems facing agriculture to-day?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartney</NameTxt>
      <P>Efforts seem to have been made to establish that we on this side of the House are delighted that a crisis has arisen in this country.  I want to protest against that once and for all. No matter what Government is in power, they are only managing directors for a number of years.  The nation comes before political Parties.  Those of us who are sufficiently old to have served under a Government, every member of which had a price on his head, have maintained that loyalty all through the years to anybody who was doing the national work and, please God, we will carry it to the grave and create a tradition to be passed on to future generations.  I resent very much the gibes as to the great delight it is to Fianna Fáil that there should be a crisis in the country when they are not in power.  That is most unfair. I am speaking for my Party, realising the seriousness of the situation, and I say that such suggestions should be cut out once and for all and I trust that those responsible for them will be decent enough to accept my word.</P>
      <P>The Vote on Account is the forerunner of the Budget and represents the one opportunity given to the Seanad to discuss the financial policy of the Government.  In the Dáil, all Departments come up individually for annual review and ample opportunity is given to survey the whole field and to condemn and criticise as Deputies see fit.  This is the one opportunity available to the Seanad.  This is the third occasion on which the present Minister for Finance has brought the Vote on Account to the House and we are entitled to ask how is it that, in his third effort, nothing whatever has been done to redeem the promises made in 1954 at the general election.</P>
      <P>During the election, a guarantee was given by responsible gentlemen, over the radio and otherwise, that taxation would be substantially, reduced, that the cost of living would be reduced and that there would be better times for all.  It was even estimated that, in ten minutes, £10,000,000 could be taken off the Budget which was introduced by Deputy MacEntee, prior to the general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1669" /> The gentleman who was capable of doing that did not return to the office of Minister for Finance and it may be that his successor, who was new to the Department, could not do as much as the great man who had passed on to another Department.  It was natural to give a little time to the new man. In 1955, however, it was expected that there would be some results.  There were none.  Another year has passed and it seems that we can forget about those promises now because we are faced with an entirely different situation. I shall address myself to the position in which we now find ourselves.</P>
    <P>Several speakers have said that the one remedy is increased production, which must be mainly in agriculture.  It has been practically established that agriculture has fallen down on the job. It would be interesting to hear from all these people who have suggested that agriculture is failing the nation, how agriculture can remedy the situation. If the Government would give the agriculturists a lead as to how they can step up production, the agriculturists would do it to-morrow morning. They are entitled to encouragement and to a lead as to the direction in which they are to step up production.</P>
    <P>One cannot speak of agriculture as one speaks of a branch of industry.  A draper is a draper and nothing else; hardware is hardware, and nothing else.  Agriculture can be divided into three parts.  First there is the dairy farmer who is a dairy farmer and no more, who milks as many cows as he can afford and who usually is not able to hold the progeny beyond six months and often sells them within three days of birth.  Then, there are tillage farmers.  A certain percentage of farmers are mixed farmers, who milk a certain number of cows, devote a certain amount of their land to dairying and a certain amount to the raising of the progeny, and finally put the finished article on the market in the form of beef or otherwise.  Then there are graziers, who are graziers and no more, who buy cattle as cheaply as possible from the man who has got all the hardship by them and who has taken all the risk, and has suffered the losses involved.  The grazier will keep <Col N="1670" /> the cattle for a year or two years, and in all the time he has them, he may not do more than count them and then drive them to the fair to be sold. Several graziers do not even spend a fortnight in saving hay for the winter months, but take winterages where they maintain stock from November to the following mid-April.</P>
    <P>There are three branches of the agricultural industry.  Let us see where we have to start to step up production. I happen to be a dairy farmer. Is the cattle population to be stepped up?  The milch cow population at present is about sufficient to produce sufficient butter for the people of this country, and none for export.  If that point is passed by 5, 10 or 20 per cent. and a surplus of butter is created, that surplus will probably be exported to the British market, and if the price is to be remunerative to the dairy farmer it will have to be very heavily subsidised. Is it helping the Minister for Finance and his Government to move in that direction?  I suggest that that would mean asking the Minister to produce more money from a &ldquo;kitty&rdquo; that is already exhausted in order to make it possible to send such a surplus of butter to the British market.  That is an aspect that is worthy of serious consideration.</P>
    <P>The dairying industry is a very big branch of agriculture.  It is a pity that some of the people who have never spent any time at dairy farming would not take it up for three or five years. If they were then given the choice of several occupations, dairy farming would be the last one they would choose.  They have only a six months' production period, approximately, and have to live on that or any surplus remaining from that, during the other six months of the year.  We talk about the New Zealanders who can supply us with cheaper butter, but we must consider the difference in climate.  In New Zealand they have approximately two months of winter, while here we have six or seven months.  In some parts of the country, the poorer parts where they have to rely on dairying, they often have seven months of winter. I have seen cows having to be housed <Col N="1671" /> from October to May.  Would anybody envy the lot of the owner?  Then, in New Zealand, a man will have perhaps 500 head of cattle in his herd compared with a poor man's five or six cows here.  I suggest if there is any sincerity in the sympathy that is expressed with agriculture, that these factors should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>It has been said that we should keep this question of agriculture away from politics&mdash;whatever good that would do it.  I do not see that any other business is taken away from politics.  I am not speaking of agriculture as a plaything, because I belong to it, and, if I were a businessman, I would speak as a businessman.</P>
    <P>With regard to the tillage farmer, he can reduce our dependence on foreign markets and is quite capable of doing so, but he has not got fair play.  When he was producing good and sufficient wheat, after the most severe and unfortunate harvest&mdash;excluding 1946&mdash;and was just pulling through after suffering misery and uncertainty of crops, he had to take a cut of 12/6 per barrel. How is the tillage farmer expected to increase production in the face of that? A burned child dreads the fire and naturally the producer who has already been burned to the extent of 12/6 does not want to run the risk of being burned again.</P>
    <P>I should like to be shown how agricultural production can be stepped up, considering that, if this could be achieved, we would all be better off. The agriculturist is anxious to get a fair return for the time he devotes to agriculture, just as anybody else would be; but until such time as he sees some hope or some guarantee that what he proposes to do will be of some benefit to him, it is hard to expect him to make a special sacrifice.  It must be borne in mind that when our backs were to the wall during the war years, although I do not want to boast of one section of the community more than another, if any section did its job for the Irish nation it was the farmer. He guaranteed a sufficiency of food, and that was something that is not lightly thought of by the rest of the <Col N="1672" /> community.  This should be said in all fairness to them, because in 1946, when things looked bad for the farmers, it was a grand thing to see the way the people in the towns and cities came out to help to pull the harvest out of the fire, so to speak.</P>
    <P>A matter that has to be taken seriously into account is the substantial drop in the prices of cattle. There is no getting away from it, the big cattle, the £80 or £85 cattle, have lost £25 since last December.  When Senator L'Estrange was appealing for a greater supply of cattle for export and talking about how essential it was to breed the right type of cattle, he did not say what that breed should be. He spoke of the eight or nine cwt. beast and said that the buyers wanted quality, not quantity, now.  If we are to have the eight or nine cwt. beast, it must naturally mean that the breed which would most lend itself to that would be the Aberdeen Angus, but the Aberdeen Angus will not fill the bill for dairying purposes.  We cannot expect the Shorthorns or the Herefords to reduce to eight or nine cwt. from the 12 or 14 cwt. they normally are. It is wrong to say that in Britain to-day they are putting quality before quantity, because, if that were so, they would not be taking the tons and hundreds of tons of frozen stuff from the Argentine they are taking at 10d. and 1/- a lb. and using it in preference to our good beef.</P>
    <P>It is also very unfair to maintain that nobody but the <i>Irish Press</i> publicised the fall in the price of cattle: it is recorded in all the journals. With regard to the <i>Irish Press</i>, most exception was taken to the issue of 28th January and it told nothing but the truth.  I will go further and say it did not exaggerate.  It referred to the Munster Fair in the City of Limerick and said that the cattle boom was ended and that cattle were down by £5 per head.  That was a very modest account altogether, because 50 per cent. of the cattle that stood in the fair were not even priced that day. After all, whether we agree or disagree with its policy or what it says, the <i>Irish Press</i>, is a national journal and it always maintains a high standard of journalism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1673" /> For those reasons, it supplies valuable information for those in all walks of life who are disposed to read it.  If you fail to think along those lines, you might start muzzling the Press.</P>
    <P>Some time ago under an Emergency Powers Order the Press were compelled to conceal information regarding the adventures of a certain society operating within or outside the State. Does the Taoiseach mean to continue that system and prevent newspapers from publishing information of vital economic importance, if there is a suggestion that it might discredit the Government?  I hope that stage will never be reached.  The less of that kind of thing we have the better and I hope the people will recognise that this paper is a good national newspaper.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to hear the speech of my friend across the House, Senator L'Estrange, appealing for support for our own industries.  I hope sincerely that he will propagate that at every crossroads in the country, because at a time when our policy was to make our industries self-sufficient and to protect them, there were people in high positions who looked down their noses at them&mdash;they would not be seen wearing the homespun or the bawneen.  It is no disgrace to wear the bawneen; good men have worn it down through the years.  I sincerely hope Senator L'Estrange will propagate that doctrine at every crossroads, and even abroad, if he can.  &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; should be our slogan because, as I stated in this House already, anybody in this country who has any use for the old Sinn Féin economic policy will adopt that slogan.  Arthur Griffith said: &ldquo;If an Irish article costs you more, buy it.&rdquo; Those members who are old enough will have read about that statement and those not old enough will have heard about it.  That was Griffith's economic aim.  It was the policy on which was laid the foundation of our freedom and it was the policy which was to turn that freedom to advantage.  If it was a good policy then, it should be better to-day.</P>
    <P>Some of the big firms in England and elsewhere will not be prevented from sending their stuff here, by tariffs or <Col N="1674" /> other such levies.  They are prepared to sell at a loss in order to prevent new Irish industries from gaining ground and establishing themselves. The loss these big firms would sustain here would be such a small percentage of their huge turnover that they can afford to do it.  A big firm often loses money in order to squeeze out one which might ultimately be a formidable competitor.  I have often heard complaints that, because farm implements were Irish, they were not of good quality.  I have never made any apology myself for having used all Irish implements, such as the products of Pierce's factory, although sometimes it might not be up to the standard of the outside one.  If there were uniformity of mind about such things among all sections of the community, it would make for the betterment of the nation and for solidarity among our people in times of need.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention. I am convinced that one of the best mediums of rural employment we have is afforestation.  It has been starved by successive Governments and has never got the chance it should get. There is one question particularly which I should like to ask on this matter and I hope it will be possible for the Minister to reply to it.</P>
    <P>I have heard that the Department of Lands may not exceed a certain price per acre for land for afforestation. I am very anxious to get a reply to that, because, if it is true, it is false economy.  Whatever expense may be attached to afforestation, certainly the land is the cheapest.  The draining and fencing done will last only so long, but the land will be there forever to grow forest after forest and, at the end of time, if somebody computed its value over the years, I feel sure it would not have cost a fraction of a penny per acre.</P>
    <P>If it is true that a certain maximum price per acre has been fixed and may not be exceeded, good land, suitable for afforestation, is being lost and consequently employment in certain pockets is scarcer.  If necessary, afforestation can be adjourned during <Col N="1675" /> peak periods of farm work and it can be resumed when there is a slack period in the area.  It is unfair then that any petty regulation should retard the acquisition of land in this country.  If the Minister for Lands has not got the discretion to exceed a certain figure, I would suggest that the Minister for Finance take his hand off and let the Minister for Lands become a free agent.  As little as £1 an acre might make the difference between acquiring hundreds of acres of land and not acquiring them.  I appeal to the Minister to do his utmost to see that this regulation, if it exists, is repealed.</P>
    <P>The local bodies do not seem to have been very well treated as regards road grants.  I do not think the Department is keeping step with the increased expenditure under this heading.  There has been a vast increase in the number of mechanically propelled vehicles and road maintenance has become a terrible problem for local authorities. Roads are being used at the moment for purposes for which they were never constructed.  Many of them are national highways which should be maintained completely by the State, but agitation in that direction has not succeeded.  Secondary roads are now carrying a lot of commercial vehicles for which they were never built and local authorities are not getting for their maintenance a sufficient share of the revenue from these vehicles.  Something should be done in this matter, so that heavier burdens will not have to be borne by the ratepayers.  It is only fair that every penny that can possibly be made available should be distributed amongst the local authorities to enable them to carry out the many works that are necessary.  If they have not got the money, they may have to neglect some very valuable service.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I make my final appeal to the Minister to be more generous with the Forestry Branch, because I am sure such money would be money well spent.  It is better to see a man cycling down the old bog road in the morning than to see him going to the labour exchange.  To give money for forestry would be giving money for the production of something, <Col N="1676" /> but giving the other money in the labour exchange can only be regarded as a complete loss.  If the Minister can get a few pounds extra in any corner of his &ldquo;kitty&rdquo;, I should be glad if he would pass it on to the local authorities who find themselves in almost as bad a position as the Minister himself.</P>

      <P>I am reluctant to impose what I have to say on the Seanad, but I feel it is my duty to make the remarks I have prepared.  It is in the form of a vocational speech and is not a matter of national politics.</P>
      <P>I think it would be wrong if the increased grants to the universities were passed over in silence this afternoon. I regard them as an increase in the munitions of war, in the war of ideas.  The Republic has maintained a policy of neutrality in physical warfare, but, in the spiritual and psychological warfare going on all around us, we cannot remain neutral.  In giving this increased grant, the Minister is doing something to strengthen our position in that war of ideas.</P>
      <P>In this war of ideas, we must have the most highly trained troops possible, for it is a relentless and merciless war.  This is where the universities must play their part.  I do not say that the universities are the only places where these highly skilled troops can be trained, but I do say that they are best equipped to produce such people.  They are the best equipped to produce the people who will protect our national ideals and principles in this continuous, relentless warfare.  We can only hold our own in this warfare if our universities are as well equipped with academic staff, laboratories and classrooms as universities elsewhere in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sad fact is that no university to-day can pay its way from its own resources.  Even the wealthy universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Paris, or Madrid, must rely on the State to keep them going.  I have just returned from a visit to Oxford, and it is abundantly clear that they can only continue to serve the British nation through <Col N="1677" /> Government support.  Trinity College, Dublin, could once live on its own resources and serve the nation without any expense whatever to the nation, but now, owing to matters outside its control, inflation, devaluation and the rest, Trinity College, Dublin, can no longer support itself as one of the great national universities.</P>
    <P>So it came about that less than 20 years ago the authorities of Trinity College, Dublin, went to the National Government and said: &ldquo;We need support.&rdquo; To the great credit of that National Government, and to the credit, of successive National Governments, that support was given.  It was given very fairly and very justly.  This was to be expected.  It has been part of the national tradition of this country over the past 150 years that there should be impartiality in matters of this kind.  I am not going to start any hares at this hour of the evening, but I only wish that our local authorities were equally well imbued with the national tradition in that way.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking of the need for sustaining the training grounds for shock troops in the ideological warfare waging around us.  I consider that the Minister is doing well to keep that in mind.  But it is quite clear to everyone who has studied the problem that we need very much more money.  This is, perhaps, an ungracious thing to say when increases have been given, but it must be said.  I am speaking of the universities of the Republic in general. Under the Estimates, all our universities are to receive approximately £660,000, but Queen's University.  Belfast, alone receives over £1,000,000 per annum.  Our five university colleges in the Republic are receiving approximately two-thirds of what the university in Northern Ireland receives from public sources every year.</P>
    <P>I am not referring specifically to Northern Ireland now, when I say that we are going to lose the ideological warfare, if we cannot keep our training grounds up to the level of the universities in Belfast, England, Russia or China, or wherever they may be. These things are out of our hands apparently, but, generally speaking, there is a grave risk that, if our <Col N="1678" /> grants are not increased to the standard of the universities of England and the North of Ireland, our universities will fall behind.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a story from a man whose name would once have commanded great respect in this country.  It is a story from Plutarch. In his &ldquo;Life of Pericles,&rdquo; the Athenian statesman, Plutarch relates the following story.  Pericles was the pupil and friend of the great philosopher, Anaxagoras; but as time went on Pericles became more and more involved in other matters, such as party politics, and neglected his old friend.  Some years afterwards, Pericles received a message stating that Anaxagoras was dying and asking if Pericles would go to see him.  Pericles did so.  He found him in a miserable hovel, with scarcely a bit of clothing to cover him.  He was appalled at the sight and said how sorry he was.  He said that he had been very busy with affairs of State and had not been able to attend to his old teacher as he would have wished. Anaxagoras looked at him for a moment and said: &ldquo;If people want lamps to give light, they must pour in oil.&rdquo;  Now, the universities are in a sense the lamps of this country and it has come to a stage where, unless the Minister can keep on pouring in oil in increased quantities, he may in 50 years' time feel, as Pericles must have felt then, that something&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>But the more the Minister pursues a wise policy in increasing grants in the right direction, the more he will have a sense of self-satisfaction in doing the right thing; and so his general tone will be improved and he will continue to live on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the Minister, I hasten to add, <Col N="1679" /> who provoked this interpolation.  Now, there is one specific point to which I must refer.  It is a criticism of Trinity College, Dublin, in particular, in connection with these grants, a criticism which I should like very briefly to meet.  It concerns the percentage of overseas students in Trinity College. Objections are frequently made&mdash;I know this&mdash;to spending State funds on overseas students in our universities. Let us consider this for a moment.  I know this is a dangerous rumour, and I think it is one that must be stopped.</P>
    <P>We receive in Dublin University, or we will receive, all being well, a grant of about £130,000.  The number to benefit from that&mdash;I am including the members of the academic and nonacademic staff and the students&mdash;will be approximately 2,600.  If my arithmetic is correct, that means there will be about £50 for each person.  Consider for a moment the number of overseas students in the college.  Last year, there was a total of 563 from Great Britain and beyond.  They will have received £50 per head or £28,150 in all, if I am not mistaken.</P>
    <P>But how much do those students bring into the country?  That is the vital question.  I claim they bring in over £200 each into the country&mdash;I think probably a good deal more.  In other words, they bring into this country about £110,000 a year, almost double the amount of the grant.  Much of this money is spent in the shops, on the lodging houses and on transport in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I suggest, then, that the objection to foreign students on economic grounds is idiotic.  I suggest that, in terms of the bigger question of the war of ideas, it is foolish.  If there was&mdash;I must say this&mdash;a risk that the foreign element would become so large as to be likely to capture the spirit of Trinity College, as I conceive it&mdash;others may conceive it differently&mdash;then I think there would be a risk to the country.  I assert, without fear of contradiction, that there is no such risk. The students are less than one-third in proportion, and the proportion on the academic staff is very much smaller.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1680" /> In fact, these overseas students not merely enrich the revenues of the country, but they enrich our store of knowledge, academic methods, and learning.  We also have several overseas people on our academic staff and, on the whole, they have done nothing but good for the standard of efficiency in the college.  I hope the time will never come when we are so insular or so parochial as to be afraid of bringing in experts from outside.  That, indeed, would be disastrous for the country.</P>
    <P>I suggest, then, that if we look on the wider front of the war of ideas, these overseas students, and professors and lecturers are a very great addition. The students go back again to their own countries, with, I think, an affection for this country and an understanding of its problems.  If we look back to our history for a moment, the schools at Bangor and Lismore, the great monastic schools of our early times, won much of their great glory by bringing in so many foreign students to this country.  That redounded greatly to the honour of the country. I think it still redounds to our honour that a good many overseas students think it worth their while to come.  But, if our standards sink, they will not think it worth while to come.  Instead, Irish students will have to go to Oxford, to Cambridge or to Queen's University, to get an adequate academic education.  I suggest that it is wisdom of the highest order to cherish our Irish universities impartially and fairly, and, if the Minister remembers nothing else of what I have said today, I hope he will remember the story of the lamp and the oil.</P>

      <P>There is just one question.  It is a question of detail in relation to the imposition of duties on imported luxuries or semi-luxuries. I am curious to know what prompted the decision to regard nonalcoholic beverages as luxuries and alcoholic beverages as necessities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me answer Senator Sheehy Skeffington's question before I deal with the other matters to which I wish to refer.  I have not suggested anywhere that any article <Col N="1681" /> that is not included in this list is thereby an essential.  The list was framed in relation to those articles which are not so essential, but bearing in mind all sorts of other factors which arise in regard to them.</P>
      <P>This debate, which started yesterday, has covered a fairly wide field.  I had frankly hoped that it would have been carried on on a more general level than it was, to some degree at any rate.  I had hoped we would have discussed on a more general basis the measures that I brought to the Dáil last week, in the light of the general economic position of the country.  While some Senators did undoubtedly take that line, others did not.  I can understand, of course, the difficulty for Senators who do not get the opportunity we have in the Dáil of dealing with individual and detailed Estimates, since this is one of the few opportunities they have of raising these matters.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I can remember coming in here some 13 years ago, on the first occasion on which I sat in this House.  There was either a Central Fund Bill or an Appropriation Bill before the House and I must confess I was rather tempted to follow the line Senator Sheehy Skeffington took of raising all sorts of individual items. But, after I had been here a few years, I found that was not the right method of dealing with debate in the Second Chamber.</P>
      <P>For that reason I am not now going to answer some of the more detailed points raised.  I shall deal with them later by means of correspondence rather than take up time replying to them now.  I would, however, like to refer to some of the details which are more or less of general rather than specific application, as was the school in Finglas to which the Senator referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the fact that in the item in the Book of Estimates under public works and buildings the sum shown for maintenance and supplies for the Department of Finance is considerably greater than it is for any other Department.  That, of course, is because we, in the Department of Finance, have responsibility <Col N="1682" /> for all the parks, all the State harbours, all the offices of the Revenue Commissioners, national monuments, and so on.  It is not merely a matter of the maintenance and supplies for Government buildings; the item covers a very much wider sphere of activity indeed.</P>
    <P>I was also asked to deal with Secret Service.  Now, if I deal with Secret Service, it will be no longer secret. The Dáil, in its wisdom, passes every year a Vote, and, in passing that Vote, the Dáil dispenses the Government of the day from giving any information to it, or to the Oireachtas as a whole, as to the manner in which the amounts shown are expended.  Suffice it for me to say that they are unquestionably disbursed in the public interest, and if the Senator is, as I think he said he was, somewhat curious, I am afraid he will have to wait to satisfy his curiosity, until the day he will happen to sit in this seat or in a similar one.</P>
    <P>I disagree categorically with the Senator when he suggests that civil servants should be allowed to enter politics.  I think it is infinitely better that we should have here a nonpolitical Civil Service, free, therefore, and untrammelled, to serve successive Governments and to be, therefore, a permanent Civil Service.  If you are going to have a Civil Service free to enter politics, inevitably you move from that to the American system, by virtue of which the Civil Service changes to a large degree with each change of Government.  I think that would be a mistake.  All Parties and all Governments in the State have been extremely well served by the non-political Civil Service we have here, and I think it would be a very great mistake to alter that.  Certainly, so long as I am in this office, I will strongly oppose any such alteration.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh referred also to a couple of matters of general interest, one of which was the reduction in the Transition Development Fund sub-head of the Local Government Estimate from £100,000 to £5.  The Transition Development Fund was wound up as from 1st November, 1950, but without prejudice to the commitments that <Col N="1683" /> had been entered into before that date.  The commitments are gradually being exhausted, and the requirements that were met otherwise on that Vote in respect of local authority building are now met in a different way.  The nominal sub-head is provided just in case there should be some commitments still to come since 1950.</P>
    <P>The Senator also asked what was the position in respect of the hospital building programme.  The position in that respect is that the Hospitals' Trust Fund is not adequate to cope with the building programme, and we have, therefore, in these Estimates to provide an additional subvention, the additional subvention this year being somewhat less than before.  The decrease arises, first, because, I am glad to say, through the success of the sweeps, the fund itself is being fed to a greater degree out of sweepstake proceeds.  In addition to that, the building progress has not been as speedy as was anticipated and the Estimate is drawn to a much greater reality this year than was the position in the past when the amount voted was not expended.</P>
    <P>When I was introducing this Bill in the House, Senators who were here will remember I said that, as far as the G.N.R. was concerned, I felt I could not give a final verdict on the amount that would be needed for the board, until the accounts for that board close on the 30th September next.  I am afraid that is the situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Hartney referred to the cost of the acquisition of land for forestry purposes.  We must remember, in respect of forestry, that we have to try to strike a nice balance as between the land that is usable for forestry purposes and for agricultural purposes, and, if there was not some restriction in the amount to be paid for forestry land, we might very easily find ourselves in the position of utilising for forestry purposes land which would make a better contribution to the nation as a whole as ordinary agricultural land, and find also that land capable of being utilised only for forestry was not being used.  The Senator will note that, in the Estimate <Col N="1684" /> this year, a sum of approximately £250,000 more than last year is being provided for forestry development.  I do not think he can have had advertence to that fact, when making his criticism in that respect.</P>
    <P>The total of the Estimates Volume is some £3,600,000 up and, if we exclude capital services, on which there is a reduction of a little over £1,000,000, the total amount provided for non-capital services is increased by approximately £4,750,000.  As I said when introducing the Estimates, £3,500,000 of that increase is necessary for the Civil Service, for the Guards, for the Army, for postmen, etc.  There is an increase of £971,000 for health grants to health authorities.  There is over the Estimate for this time last year, which is the figure with which I was comparing the £4,750,000, an additional sum of £890,000 for old age pensioners.  There is an addition of £250,000 for the agricultural grant; an addition for forestry, to which I already referred, and there is an addition, to which Senator Stanford referred, for university grants.  All those things amount to an addition of approximately £6,000,000, so to speak, to be met on current account.</P>
    <P>I think when we take into account the fact that the Estimates had to be increased&mdash;that it was desirable that the Estimates should be increased&mdash; to that amount, namely, £6,000,000, the fact that the Government have been able to come to the Oireachtas with Estimates reduced by a sum of £1,000,000 from that £6,000,000 is a very great achievement indeed, and shows that, in the scrutiny of the bill that was being presented, the pruning knife was utilised fairly strongly.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins made a speech, which, according to the rules of order, Sir, I cannot say was deliberately misleading, but which was certainly recklessly inaccurate in many, many respects.  I do not propose to traverse all the ground that he traversed; nor do I propose to traverse all the ground that Senator Cogan traversed, although I will traverse a little of it, because I feel that both the Senators concerned will have an opportunity, if they have <Col N="1685" /> not already done so, of studying the facts of the situation and realising, after their study of the facts, that their presentation of those facts was not as accurate as they or anybody else would wish.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins said that the decision of the present Government to transfer the rural electrification subsidy to the E.S.B. had resulted in more people being fixed with a special service charge.  As I said when I interrupted at the time, and I want to repeat it now, that, of course, is not correct.  The special service charge is fixed by reference to the ratio of the capital cost of connecting a consumer to the flat valuation tariff that will be allowed for such connection, and the subsidy that was provided for rural electrification has no effect on or advertence whatever to that capital ratio.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins also made an attack which, if it might not have repercussions outside the country, would be laughable.  He purported directly to represent my colleague, the Tánaiste, and to suggest that the Tánaiste had attacked all Irish industrialists. Of course, the Tánaiste did nothing of the sort and, in fact, the attack would be quite laughable, were it not for the fact that there might be, perhaps, some danger of outsiders believing it.  The Tánaiste at that time was speaking purely of profiteers.  Nobody has done more than the Tánaiste in the past 12 months to ensure the development of Irish industry and I might add that the Irish industrialists are perfectly happy about the Tánaiste's policy in relation to the introduction of foreign capital.  No matter what Senator Hawkins said, the intention is to supplement and not in any way to displace or compete with existing industry.</P>
    <P>To come down to the terms of the special imports levy and the Hire Purchase Order, I had some further detailed queries put to me.  Some of them, I am afraid, I would find somewhat difficult to deal with in a speech such as this.  Quite occasionally, I get a little chipping over the fact that, as Minister for Finance, I am poacher turned gamekeeper.  I shudder for people in certain businesses, judging by <Col N="1686" /> the number of queries Senator Douglas put to me.  I can deal with some of them, but, with others, I cannot.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Senator will appreciate that the Revenue Commissioners are ready and willing to discuss with any industrialist, importer or exporter any difficulty that any such person may have in the interpretation of the regulations and the Orders that have been made.  Very often, it would not be an explanation, not an elucidation, but quite the reverse, if a Minister or anybody else were to attempt to simplify in a speech the exact significance of certain Orders of that sort.  I would suggest to anybody who is worried about whether the Orders cover what he has in mind that, if he wishes, the Revenue Commissioners will be available to give him any information available and any help in interpretation. That applies to any question of trade or organisations.</P>
    <P>The Senator also asked who was going to pay the levy.  I want to make it clear in that respect that the purpose of the levy is its deterrent effect. Already this week the Tánaiste has made a standstill Order in respect of gramophone records for the express reason that we had information that certain people&mdash;I exclude the Senator who mentioned that he had some interest in this; it was not the Senator or anybody connected with him&mdash;who had stocks of gramophone records, brought in before the levy, had announced their intention of putting up the price by the amount of the levy so that, in fact, they would make an adventitious profit.  The standstill Order was made to ensure that existing stocks, prior to the levy, would not be charged for at the original plus levy price.  As those stocks are used up, the situation will require to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>This is not the ordinary case where the stocks come in at a high price at one time and a lower price at another time and where there would be what one might describe as the swings and the roundabouts.  In the ordinary case, where you have the swings and the roundabouts, I can understand businessmen saying that, where they are going to lose at one end of the transaction, they must have a cushion to offset the loss at the other end.  But, <Col N="1687" /> in this case, the purpose of the levy is its deterrent effect and the whole of the deterrent effect would be lost, if that cushion were provided.  Therefore, it is essential, in our view, that the existing stocks in the country should be disposed of at their pre-levy prices, so that in that way there will not be over-inducement, shall I say, to replace those stocks.</P>
    <P>The Senator also mentioned certain matters in respect of the Hire Purchase Order.  There is, of course, a provision in the Hire Purchase Order which prevents ordinary hiring as an easy means of dodging the hire purchase deposit regulations, but I am afraid it is impossible in any legislation to protect oneself against every possible loophole and against every possible foolishness.  During the weekend, I happened to meet a friend of mine from my own constituency.  He threw his arms around me and said: &ldquo;Thank goodness, you have put on the restrictions on hire purchase&rdquo;.  I said: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  He replied: &ldquo;I have got a very foolish wife who is always seeking for everything on the hire purchase&rdquo;. We cannot completely protect that person against his trouble.  We can only make broad regulations to cover the difficulty, but if we find people deliberately trying to evade those regulations and drive a coach-and-four through them, then we must close the road to the coach-and-four as fast as we can.  Certain of the Senators' observations will be useful to us in that respect in determining how we can deal with such loopholes.</P>
    <P>Before I go on to discuss the principal matter in relation to the full import of our balance of payments situation and our economic situation, I would just refer to one matter so as not to drag it in across the debate at a later stage as a red herring in the general discussion.  It was a suggestion made by Senator McHugh.  Senator Hickey too, made the same suggestion in an entirely different way.  I will mention Senator Hickey's suggestion in a moment.  Senator McHugh threw out as a sort of red herring the question of our parity link with sterling.  I do not think it is desirable that I should <Col N="1688" /> go into that at any great length tonight at the end of this debate, particularly, if I may say so, on the slightly superficial basis suggested by the Senator.  I should like, however, to put one question to those who discuss from time to time the removal of the parity link with sterling.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that, if we remove it, there are three things that could happen. First, our currency might still remain exactly the same value as the British £.  If that happened, then we are talking about something that does not matter at all.  Secondly, the Irish £ might become of greater value than the British £&mdash;it might be overvalued&mdash;and the third is that the Irish £ might be depreciated in relation to the British £.  The first one does not matter.  We are left with the second and the third.  Entirely different results would inure to the Irish economy if it were a question of the Irish £ being overvalued or being undervalued.  When people suggest there should be a change, I should like them to give some real thought&mdash;not superficial thought&mdash;to what they want subsequently.  Do they want the Irish £ to be overvalued, or do they want it depreciated in value to the existing link?  When the people who advocate that give some indication of what they want then we shall have a better opportunity of seeing the effects that would flow from their suggestions.</P>
    <P>To change, just for the sake of change, is foolish.  Anybody who wants to effect a change has a duty first, I submit, to make a case as to why the change is desirable.  In this case, it is necessary to come down either on the undervalue side or on the overvalue side and make the case accordingly. When the case is made in that respect, then it can be considered.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I completely failed to follow the figures given by Senator McHugh.  As I understand him, he said we spend on education half of 1 per cent.  I do not know whether he meant half of 1 per cent. of our governmental expenditure or of the national income.  The current governmental expenditure in the Book of Estimates, as Senators are aware, is <Col N="1689" /> slightly under £100,000,000.  If you add the Central Fund and the rest of the figures, even with the capital expenditure, the Senator's percentage would be miles out.</P>
    <P>If he meant it in relation to national income, then I think it is equally wrong.  For example, the national income, in the last two figures that were available, was £448,000,000 or £450,000,000&mdash;I forget the exact figure. Half of 1 per cent. would come to £2.2 million.  The amount we pay to teachers alone is £5.6 million.  The amount spent on the Department of Education and its ancillary services&mdash;taking as ancillary to the ordinary direct State education, universities and so forth&mdash;is something like £15,000,000.  It is obvious, therefore, that I could not understand Senator McHugh's figures at all. Perhaps I have misinterpreted him when I say he said half of 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>There was also some discussion by Senator Hickey, Senator Sheehy Skeffington and one or two other Senators to the effect that they did not see why, on any change in rates of interest on either side of the picture, the banks should make an additional profit.  The fact is that any changes that have been made recently in respect of interest rates have been so deliberately balanced that there was not any profit to the commercial banks in the transaction.  It is well known that the deposits in the commercial banks carry interest.  If the rate of interest payable on these deposits is increased, the increase can only be met from the advance rates, and, as I say, the changes that were made were made quite deliberately on the basis of balancing out and there being no profit for the commercial banks in the transaction.</P>

      <P>I was saying I expected that the debate would range to perhaps an even greater extent on the measures that I, on behalf of the Government, introduced into the Dáil last Tuesday and on the necessity for these measures.  Senator O'Brien addressed himself to that exclusively. One or two other Senators did so in a slightly different way.  I think Senator O'Brien was a little bit harsh on me when he suggested I was too late in introducing restrictions in respect of hire purchase.  The growth of hire purchase in this country has not been a very violent growth.  At the end of 1953, the total hire-purchase debt outstanding was £6.4 million.  At the end of 1954, it was £8,500,000.  At the end of 1955, it was £10,500,000.  That is not a very large absolute sum nor is the growth very great by absolute standards. If the growth had been greater &mdash;and particularly very much greater during the latter part of last year&mdash; there might be some substance in the Senator's criticism.  I suggest it is not too great an acceleration on the one hand, or too absolute a figure, on the other.</P>
      <P>However, why I was particularly concerned and why I deemed it absolutely necessary that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would, as a finance suggestion, make these regulations was that we saw at the time that, as fast as the operations of hire-purchase firms across the water were being tightened up there, they were, so to speak, moving over here, and we were in very great danger on that account of having their inflation imported here, through restrictions on their operations in England, with consequent extension of their operations here.  That was one of the things we were particularly determined to avoid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1691" /> Some Senators have suggested that we deferred taking action until too late.  I think Senator Kissane started on that line.  I do not want to start from the beginning, or to initiate a further debate at this stage which might, perhaps, be as acrimonious as part of the discussion we had last night, but it is relevant, without doing it in any sense of acrimony, to look at the picture as it was when the Senator's Minister for Finance was making his case.  On 13th June, 1951, my predecessor, Deputy MacEntee, became Minister for Finance.  On 18th July, 1951, he came into the Dáil and made a very forthright speech in which he said he visualised a very serious balance of payments problem.  I am not going to comment as to whether he was right or wrong, I am merely taking him at his own words for a moment.</P>
    <P>What did he do?  He did nothing whatever from that moment until 20th October, 1951, when he produced a White Paper.  He did not take any measures.  He produced a White Paper.  I do not want to weary this House with my criticisms of the manner in which he produced that White Paper in my reply in the Dáil the other day and which are on the record.  But within a month of his accession in July, 1951, he admitted there was a very serious problem.  He did nothing about it, but issue a White Paper and nothing whatever was done by the then administration, although they had started to feel that there was a serious problem in July, until March of the following year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator did not hear me.  The Dáil went into Recess for the summer and came back in October, but again in October, in November, in December, and in January and February of 1952, Deputy MacEntee took no action of any sort or kind, except to make speeches, as his colleagues made speeches.  This is not a problem of that length of standing at all.  This is a problem that blew up in the latter half of last year.  The first time anything really became <Col N="1692" /> noticeable in our trade returns was in the August trade returns which became available in the middle of September. That was when it first seemed likely that there was something untoward in existence.</P>
      <P>In regard to deficits in our trade balance, I take the view that it would be not merely wrong, but very wrong indeed of any Government to move too quickly with such a delicate thing as the economy of the State, merely because something appeared in one month alone.  I took the view, and still take the view, that it was necessary to ensure that it was not an isolated transaction; secondly, that there was going to be a real trend; and thirdly &mdash;the point Senator O'Brien made&mdash; that there was no sign of automatic self-correction.  I think nobody can suggest that, having regard to the time the seriousness of the adverse balance seemed to appear and the necessity to follow these three canons in deciding what action should be taken, this Government has been remiss&mdash;remembering of course that there was action taken of one sort, although everyone might not agree with it&mdash;last December. Certainly I have no doubt whatever of this fact, that when the historians come to write of what I consider were the problems of 1955 and the early part of 1956 and the time at which I took action to deal with the problem, and set that against what the previous Government thought in 1951 and 1952, history will judge that I moved into the breach vastly more quickly than they did.  That is not to say that I agree with their analysis in 1951-52.</P>
      <P>Their analysis in 1951-52, as I made quite clear in my statement in the Dáil, was wrong, in that they did not allow adequately at all for the Korean stockpiling and for the possibility of increased agricultural exports.  Both of these criticisms were clearly borne out by the figures that were available in the following year and that are now available for us to look back on the situation in retrospect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hinted a second ago about action in respect of interest rates.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington&mdash;unfortunately I <Col N="1693" /> did not hear him, as I had to go to another meeting last night for a short while, but while my colleague was here, he took a note of what the Senator said&mdash;attributed to Professor O'Brien a remark he did not exactly make in regard to the discussion on bank interest rates.  Last year, I made it very clear again and again that I did not regard the action taken then as being action once and for all, action that was going in any way to crystallise or freeze the position.  I made it clear again and again that I regarded it as a flexible policy to be adjusted to the needs of the time as the Government of the day thought fit.</P>
    <P>I think I made that fairly clear last year when in this House on 15th March, 1955, I was replying to Senator O'Brien, and, among other things, I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I agree with the Senator that in respect of interest rates, the room for, shall I say, independent manoeuvre is admittedly somewhat limited.  The tendency inevitably will be towards a move in parallel directions not merely as between this island and the adjoining island but the world over, when one considers that the world is an economic entity and that money is the international commodity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In fact, that is what has happened. There has been a move the world over and nobody would quarrel with my saying, I believe, that while there is a move the world over and while there are international influences that must inevitably affect our whole economic position, at the same time we must try to judge how we may limit these international effects in so far as we can.  I do not think certain people realise how little any country&mdash;not merely this country, alone&mdash;in the world, can adopt a totally independent angle away from the events that are occurring all around us.  As I said there, the world is an economic unit to some degree and that is bound to have its influences and effects everywhere.</P>
    <P>I was taken up, not merely in this House but in the other House as well, as calculating, as my estimate of the extent to which our balance of payments would be remedied by these <Col N="1694" /> limitations, a mere £7,000,000.  That is not at all the position.  The fundamental thing we have got to do is to ensure that our people realise that they cannot have as much investment and as much consumption as we might all perhaps wish at one and the same time; and while the special import levy may deter to the extent of £7,000,000 or £8,000,000 by reason of the additional duties which will have to be paid if people insist on bringing these goods in, it is far more on the psychological effect this measure will have on the community as a whole I would hope to rely.</P>
    <P>If we are able to ensure that our people save more, then with their saving, by a switching from consumption into capital investment goods, they will do more than anything else to relieve our difficulties.  That very switch will enable us to go ahead with many of the productive capital schemes that many people have in mind and that are in the mind of the Government, and to go ahead with them in a way that will not add fuel to the inflationary fire.  We must realise, as I have said, and I think Senator Hickey agrees with me, that what we want here is to ensure that the over-all level of production rises, so that we can increase all our standards of living.</P>
    <P>Some people sometimes suggest that employment is an end in itself.  I think that is not following the pattern to its proper conclusion.  Employment is the end of getting a good standard of living and it should be apparent to all of us that it is the standard of living at the end of employment that is really operative.  Therefore, it is up to all of us to see that our main endeavour in that employment is to produce as efficiently as we possibly can.  If we do not produce and produce efficiently, then it means that we will not be able to get the standard of living that all of us would desire.  I think it is true to say that, taking it over the years&mdash;it is not necessary to go into the reasons now&mdash;there has been far too much attention paid to gross production at the expense of productivity&mdash;that is at the expense of efficient production.</P>
    <P>If we can produce more efficiently, it will raise the standard of our living more quickly than anything else.  If <Col N="1695" /> we can produce more efficiently, for example, it will enable us to compete on better terms on the export markets and raise our whole production, so that there will be in that production, not merely enough for domestic consumption, but, in addition, a surplus for export.  This is very essential, if we are to be able to buy the things we would wish.</P>
    <P>The main way in which we can get more efficient production is by getting inanimate objects of all kinds to do the work for us.  I have always taken the view in, for example, agriculture that the employment of machinery in agriculture should never be looked on by farmers as a means of doing without labour, but to ensure that the labour they have will enable them to increase substantially their production.  So it is in relation to industry as well.</P>
    <P>There was an article the other day in one of the more serious papers, and to which I referred in the Dáil, in relation to events in another country. The article suggested that if the people in that country wanted to double their standard of living in the course of a given period of years&mdash;I cannot remember the exact number of years, but let us say it was 20 years&mdash;they could only get that increase in standard of living by doing one of two things: that all of them and their children would work twice as hard or that they would work as hard and get machinery to enable them to produce twice as efficiently.  We have not got the machinery in our production, industrial or agricultural, that will enable us to produce things more efficiently without the aid of the inanimate objects that science has brought to our assistance. I include in that term &ldquo;inanimate objects&rdquo; everything from machinery in industry to agricultural fertilisers and so forth.</P>
    <P>We can assist that production by greater capital investment in these things, but we can only get that capital investment, by and large, by the savings of our own people; by a switch from consumption to the investment which, in the long run, is going to mean a better standard of living and a higher standard of consumption, but <Col N="1696" /> if we try to get the two things together, then the result will be that we will fail to get either.</P>
    <P>Senator McHugh interrupted a short time ago in respect to capital investment. When speaking in the other House, I made it quite clear beyond question, and I want to make it quite clear again, that I am afraid that the trouble we have had in respect of the balance of payments deficit last year has been that the deficit was created for consumption purposes and not for capital purposes.  If it was a deficit for capital purposes, then it would mean that it would be producing more aids to production and more goods which, in turn, would enable us to increase our standard of living, but unfortunately it was on other lines.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by certain people that one of the reasons for that deficit was, for example, wheat.  I do not really think that the people who made that suggestion knew the facts, but, so that we will have it on record that I did not let the matter go uncontradicted, I will refer briefly to it.  It is generally accepted that we require in this country 450,000 tons of dried wheat for bread purposes.  Whether accurate or inaccurate, those who are making bread here are satisfied that it is not possible to make that bread out of an entire native grist.  The previous Government accepted that position and we accepted that position in so far as the information is available to us at present.</P>
    <P>The previous Government decided that a fair mixture was in the ratio of two to one and on 22nd February, 1954, they decided that we needed 300,000 tons of native dried wheat.  The reason that more wheat was imported last year was not that there was any reduction from that optimum desire to get that amount of native wheat, but because of circumstances outside the control of this or the last Government. It was because we were given in 1954 frightful harvest weather and the wheat harvested in 1954 was wet, and therefore the mixture of imported to native wheat had to be slightly changed and we had to carry over into 1955 some part of the 1954 native wheat crop which otherwise would have been <Col N="1697" /> utilised before the 1954-55 cereal year had terminated.</P>
    <P>That meant that we had to put in the 1955 bread more imported wheat than would otherwise have been the case, and to that extent certainly we could save in our imports of wheat during the year.  The 1955 crop of wheat is showing that it has brought to the mills of the country, as nearly as anybody can possibly get in realistic terms at the moment, 300,000 tons of native wheat.  The provisional figure is so near that I venture to say that, when the final figure is produced, everybody will accept that this is as near as anybody could possibly approach to it.</P>
    <P>In so far as coarse grain is concerned, one of the troubles in that respect heretofore was that there had been built up in this country a desire to feed pigs with maize.  I do not purport to be a farmer who knows anything about pigs&mdash;pigs are not a type of agriculture to which we in Kildare are particularly addicted&mdash;but I am told by those who do know that maize feeding for pigs does produce a fatter pig than the trade at present requires, that it is better&mdash;and I do not think there is any difference at all between the two sides of the House in this respect&mdash;to have our pigs in the future, so far as can be, fed on barley instead of maize, so that we will produce the type of lean pig that is now being graded as grade A.</P>
    <P>What has been the difficulty in pig production over the years?  I suggest it has always been not so much the actual price at any one moment, but the fluctuations in price.  Without going into the details into which Senator O'Reilly went in respect of cows, pigs are a type of animal husbandry which people can get into quickly and get out of quickly.  The habit and the practice has been always, up to this, that the pig producers, when the price of feeding stuffs was very low, have rushed into pig production all over the country.  Then there is a surfeit of pigs and the bottom falls out of the price; everybody goes out of pigs again and the cycle starts all over again.</P>
    <P>We have been working on this problem <Col N="1698" /> for some time and the Minister for Agriculture has announced a new basis, on foot of which we propose to announce from 12 months to 12 months a stabilised floor price&mdash;not a maximum or a fixed price, but a floor price.  For the next 12 months, the price will be 235/- per cwt., deadweight, so that, in fact, any pig producer now going into pig production knows that no matter what happens, he will get at least that price.  That should enable our pig population, our pig production, to be expanded.  It ought to do more; it ought to enable a permanent market to be established for Irish feeding barley.  The day when we were discussing barley as a possible mixture some 20, 25 or 30 years ago is entirely different from to-day.  Now there are strains of Ymer and Hereford feeding barley that will give a yield which will enable an adequate profit to be made by the person growing it.  We hope that these two things we are doing in that respect will mean that our pig production and pig exports will increase, on the one hand, and on the other hand, mean the substitution of home-grown barley for some of our imported coarse grain.  That will have, therefore, a double effect on our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude on that note.  All of us&mdash;I do not think there is any difference in relation to this on any side of the House&mdash;agree that the long-term aim and objective of this and every Government must be to ensure that our production rises, so that it will be able to catch up on the arrears and, having caught up on those arrears, give us in the years ahead a progressively improved standard of living.  It is only by our production increasing in that way that we will be able to get that improvement in our standard of living.  The best way of getting it is to ensure that we have more productive investment coming in a non-inflationary way from the savings of the people.</P>
    <P>The best way of avoiding an increase in our continuing deficits in the balance of payments is for our people to realise that that investment is necessary, that it is essential for us to step up our national home savings, to step up <Col N="1699" /> savings, whether it is for ordinary agricultural production, for industrial production or for the productive capital projects it is necessary for the Government to carry out, because they will not be done by private enterprise. I stress that it must be productive capital expenditure, because, if it is not productive capital expenditure, then, as Senator O'Brien has said and, I think, also, Senator Guinness, it will merely make our inflationary problem worse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, which is a short one, similar to those introduced for each of the last ten years, proposes that the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946, which is due to expire on 31st March shall be extended for another year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1701" /> In introducing a similar Bill last year I referred to the formidable legislative programme to be undertaken before the Supplies and Services Act could be allowed to lapse and indicated that an extension of the Act would be necessary if it was not found possible to complete this programme within the year during which the life of the Act was then extended.  Despite very considerable progress the year intervening since the 1955 Act has not been sufficient to permit the introduction of all the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1946 enables the Government and Ministers to make Orders for the control of essential supplies including control of prices, control of imports and exports, reduction or suspension of customs duties and various other matters.  As I assured the House last year, and now repeat, it remains my desire and the desire of the Government to dispense with this temporary legislation as soon as possible and to provide by permanent legislation for such powers conferred by the Act of 1946 as it is essential to retain in the public interest.</P>
    <P>So far as my own Department is concerned, such alternative legislation has already been enacted for the control of exports by the Control of Exports Act, 1955, and for transport matters by the Transport (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1955.  The powers exercised to control the importation and wholesale distribution of tea are provided for in the Tea (Importation and Distribution) Bill, 1955, at present before the Dáil.  Matters still remaining to be dealt with are the control of prices, the control of subsidised flour and the suspension or amendment of customs duties.  While it has not been possible as yet to introduce Bills covering these controls the progress towards that end has been as rapid as possible.</P>
    <P>As regards other Departments, many of the controls formerly exercised under the Supplies and Services Act are now operated under powers conferred by recent enactments.  I referred last year to the State Guarantees Act, 1954, and the Exchange Control Act, 1954.  In the meantime the Agricultural Produce <Col N="1702" /> (Meat) (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1954, the Fertilisers, Feeding Stuffs and Mineral Mixtures Act, 1955, the Seed Production Act, 1955, and the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) (Amendment) Act, 1955, provide permanent legislation for various controls for which the Minister for Agriculture is responsible.  The Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) (Amendment) Bill, 1955, is before the Dáil and two other Bills dealing with the controls which he also proposes to retain over milk and dairies, and pigs and bacon will be introduced at an early date.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare will shortly sponsor a Bill to continue certain social services (the cheap fuel scheme, cooked meals scheme and public assistance footwear scheme) at present operated under the Supplies and Services Act and the Minister for Local Government has a new Bill under consideration to amend the Road Traffic Act which will provide for the maintenance of such controls at present exercised under the Supplies and Services Act as are considered necessary to retain.</P>
    <P>In all, seven Bills have already been enacted, and two further Bills are before the House.  Some nine Bills will require to be enacted before the Supplies and Services Act can be permitted to lapse.  The matters still remaining to be dealt with require very careful consideration and the controls pertaining to them operated at present under the Supplies and Services Act must be retained until alternative legislation is enacted.</P>
    <P>The control of prices, in particular, is a matter to which I have given the most careful consideration.  On the outbreak of war in 1939, it became obvious at once that the price control arrangements provided for in the Control of Prices Act, 1937, would be totally inadequate to meet the emergency conditions then prevailing. That Act, which with an amending Act of 1938, represents our only permanent legislation dealing with general price control, was, therefore, immediately superseded by the emergency powers legislation which has constituted the statutory basis for our price control arrangements right up to the present <Col N="1703" /> time.  Although not repealed, the 1937 Control of Prices Act was left in abeyance and is now moribund.  I am satisfied that it would be neither practicable nor desirable to attempt to revive the 1937 Act and that it would be preferable to make an entirely new approach to the problem of permanent price control legislation.</P>
    <P>Out of the experience of the operation of the emergency price control arrangements, there has emerged a certain pattern of procedure which could possibly form the basis of permanent legislation.  There can be no doubt but that the flexibility of the existing arrangements has proved advantageous in dealing with the wide variety of price problems which have arisen&mdash;particularly over the past 12 months.  To mention but a few, investigations have been undertaken in relation to the prices of bread, coal, gas, cigarettes, intoxicating liquor, fertilisers, and motor car insurance.</P>
    <P>The public has become familiar with the procedure of public inquiry and representative groups are now more ready to appear and support by direct evidence their views in relation to price increase proposals which may be under investigation.  Whilst certain criticisms have undoubtedly, and perhaps unjustly, been levelled at the Prices Advisory Body, I think it will be agreed that the body represents for the community generally its best assurance against unscrupulous price exploitation in the difficult situation in which, in common with many other countries, we now find ourselves.</P>
    <P>It would be a relatively straightforward matter to devise permanent legislation to provide only for the methods of price control in force to-day, but I am not satisfied that that would represent the most desirable solution to this difficult problem.  The existing arrangements were primarily designed to meet the problems arising from emergency conditions and the fact that they are so readily adaptable to the circumstances of to-day merely reflects the near-emergency situation through which we are now passing.  It is not so certain, however, that the present arrangements would represent the ideal approach to the problem if we <Col N="1704" /> returned&mdash;as I hope we soon may&mdash;to a more tranquil economic situation in which wide fluctuations in the prices of essential commodities would be very much the exception.</P>
    <P>Above all else, it is in my view essential to ensure that the public will have the fullest confidence in the methods adopted to control and stabilise prices. Any disturbance of that confidence could well defeat the whole purpose of price control arrangements.  It is for this reason that I feel a considerable reluctance, at this particular point of time, to substitute for the now familiar arrangements, new and untried arrangements.  It would be most unfortunate if any new price control arrangements became, at the outset, associated in the public mind with the rising costs inseparable from a general inflationary situation and the harmful economic consequences which would inevitably follow, or become discredited through inability to hold prices stable in circumstances, like those at present prevailing, in which increasing costs stem primarily from external factors which it is beyond the capacity of any authority here to control.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I feel that it would be wholly unjustifiable for me to attempt to introduce permanent comprehensive price control legislation at this stage.  I consider this question of timing to be one of some importance. If a suitable economic climate for the introduction of such legislation should not develop before the expiry of the Supplies and Services Act, then I shall have to consider the expedient of introducing a temporary measure designed to maintain the existing price control arrangements in operation until a more appropriate opportunity offers to deal with the problem in a fully comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>The House may be assured that the legislative programme necessary before the Supplies and Services Act can be allowed to lapse is proceeding as rapidly as possible.  The continuance of the Act is still necessary to retain vital controls pending the completion of the programme and I am, therefore, asking the House to continue the Act in force for a further period to 31st March, 1957.</P>

Tá súil agam nach é seo an port a seinnfear arís i gceann bliana eile má bhíonn an tAire seo i mbun Roinne Tionscail agus Tráchtála an uair sin.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to dwell at any great length on the observations of the Minister for Industry and Commerce this evening in relation to such things as price control and so on, because I realise that many of these things have already been debated on another measure.</P>
      <P>I will start off by referring again to the cost of living because, in my view, a discussion on the cost of living is somewhat more appropriate to the measure we have now under discussion than it was to the measure we have just disposed of.  Everybody knows, of course, that the views of the Minister and the views of the other members of the Government have completely changed in so far as this question of price control is concerned.  At one time I know that they believed, or pretended to believe, that the cost of living could be brought down by Government action.  That was, of course, when another Government was in office here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They tried, the Minister himself included, to create the impression that the high cost of essential commodities here was being deliberately kept up by the then Government and that they could have, by positive action, brought down the cost of those essential commodities that we have heard about here this evening.  Now the Minister himself refers to circumstances over which he and the Government have no control.  He says that there are certain economic factors at work in the world <Col N="1706" /> abroad over which they, the Government, can have no control.  I wonder would he even admit now that that was exactly the case when the previous Government was in office and when they were supposed to have a ready remedy for the problem of rising prices.</P>
    <P>As I said before, on another occasion, it is extraordinary how people change their views with the changing political situation in this country and the views that are to be put forward by certain politicians when out of office are diametrically opposed to their views when in office.  We have now an admission from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as we have already from the Taoiseach himself, that they have no remedy whatever for the ever increasing cost of living here.  They ascribe the whole difficulty now to circumstances over which they have no control&mdash;as the Minister himself put it &ldquo;to external factors&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These external factors were in operation during the years that the previous Government were in office and no member of this Government, not even the Minister himself, ever referred to that matter or ever accepted it as being an explanation as to why the Government of the day was not able to bring down the cost of living as they would, no doubt, have liked to do.</P>
    <P>Apropos of this cost-of-living question, there was a short discussion last evening on the matter and certain figures were given to the House by Senator Cogan.  He proceeded to point out to the Senators here that the cost of living had risen more during the Coalition period than it had during the period of office of the Government's predecessors.  I want to point out to the House that, despite the contradiction that came from the opposite side of the House, these figures were correct. Anybody who will go to the trouble of looking up the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> will find these figures for himself.</P>
    <P>In February, 1948, when the first Coalition Government took office, the cost-of-living index figure was 99 and when they left office in June, 1951, it was 109.  The Minister, no doubt, has these figures himself.  That was an <Col N="1707" /> increase of ten points during that three-year period.  This Coalition Government came into office in June, 1954. The cost-of-living index figure then stood at 124 and by mid-November of last year, 1955, it had risen to 131.  That was an increase of seven points.  Add seven to ten and that makes 17.  As to the increase that took place during the Fianna Fáil period of office, they came into office the last time in June, 1951.  The cost-of-living index figure then stood at 109 and when they left office in June, 1954, it stood at 124. That was a rise of 15 points.  Therefore it is 17 against 15 and I submit that the figures given by Senator Cogan last evening were correct.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing about it is that they were challenged, not merely by Senator L'Estrange, but by the Minister for Finance himself.  These are cold figures and bear examination by anybody here and there can be no doubt about them.  Either the figures are right or wrong and if they are wrong the table in the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> is wrong and that is hardly possible.</P>
    <P>As I said, I do not propose now to deal at length with the question of rising prices.  I will say, however, as has been said on other occasions, that this second Coalition Government owes its existence to the statements they made to the people in the last general election that they would bring down the cost of living.  They held out hopes to the people that that would be done; and they drew comparisons between 1951 and 1954 in relation to the prices of certain commodities in order to emphasise what they would do.  The extraordinary thing is that, persisting so emphatically in that attitude during that campaign, they did not lead many more people astray.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is, as everybody knows, this Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government to which he belongs have thrown up the sponge as far as bringing down the prices of essential commodities is concerned. Remember, their attitude was that they were going to bring down prices.  It was not even a question of <Col N="1708" /> maintaining prices at the level at which they happened to be at the time.  It now transpires that they find themselves unable to hold prices even at that level and prices of essential commodities are soaring day by day. Every housewife knows that better than I do.  She has good reason to know.</P>
    <P>As I have said, many of the matters that would arise on this Supplies and Services Bill have already been dealt with on the Central Fund Bill.  The extraordinary feature of the debate on the Central Fund Bill was the almost complete by-passing of certain social problems confronting this nation at the moment.  We have heard a good deal in the past about such things as unemployment and emigration; they were described as twin social evils.  Again, we were given to understand at one period that emigration was such a terrible social evil that it was the primary duty of any Government to tackle it.  The former Government was blamed for not stemming the tide of emigration.  Everybody knows that to-day the tide of emigration is flowing faster than ever before.  We have no exact figures for emigration.  The most recent figure I have seen for emigration is 40,000 per annum.  In my opinion it is more.  There was a time when the figure stood at 20,000 per annum and there were politicians who condemned the Government at that time for not having a plan to deal with that situation.</P>
    <P>The problem of emigration now has taken on a different and more serious complexion.  From certain parts of the country, notably along the western seaboard, not merely are the boys and girls leaving their homes, but whole families are moving out.  It is quite a common thing for a boy or girl to go to Britain and bring their parents over after them.  Certain skilled and semiskilled workers are going over as well. There are a good many of our kith and kin working in Britain at the present time, compelled to work there through no fault of their own.  Some people think they have good wages, but, by the time the various demands are met, I do not think there is a whole lot left to boast about.</P>
    <P>The question poses itself: if, within <Col N="1709" /> the foreseeable future, some of these emigrants are forced to come back, what will be the position here?  What policy has the Government?  What policy do they propose to evolve to deal with that situation?  Up to now there has been full employment in Britain; now it appears that the tide is turning and that it is possible in the not too distant future many of those who emigrated to find work in Britain will find themselves out of employment and will be forced to come back home.  If even 10 per cent. of our emigrants to Britain come back, where is the work for them?  What provision is made for them?  Is it that their names will be put once more on the unemployment register?  That is one aspect I would put before this House this evening.</P>
    <P>I heard Senators talk last evening about capital investment.  Senator O'Brien, for instance, suggested that capital investment should be curtailed until such time as the economic position here was rectified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the suggestion that astronomy would be as relevant as emigration is to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Cathaoirleach decides I am out of order, I will be only to glad to obey his ruling.  In any case, I do not want to weary the House too much with these details, except that I would say, in passing, that I am not in agreement with the suggestion that capital investment should be curtailed here, even for the <Col N="1710" /> purpose of dealing with the economic difficulties that confront the country to-day.  The position in Britain is totally different.  In Britain there is over-capital development and full employment. Here in this country there is under-capital development and there is unemployment.  Therefore, the problems that confront the two countries are completely dissimilar in character.</P>
      <P>There was one thing mentioned in the other House last evening on this measure.  I do not want to repeat some of the arguments that were put forward there, but there was one question referred to, and I think it is right to refer to it here, and that is the problem of coal supplies from Britain. In so far as I can judge, this matter is going to be a very difficult one for this country in the years ahead.  We have seen reports in the Press that the British will be finding it difficult to supply their own requirements of coal for their own people and for their own purposes.  And the question is: what action is this Government taking to meet that contingency&mdash;the contingency that there will be a shortage of coal supplies, apart entirely from the cost of that commodity; and the cost of coal, as every Senator knows, is increasing from year to year.</P>
      <P>I think it would be right for the Minister and the Government to look into the future with regard to this matter and prepare measures&mdash;whatever measures they think are necessary &mdash;and have them ready to meet this contingency.  If the price of coal delivered here from Britain is going to keep on soaring as it has been in the past few years, the poor people of this country, especially those living in the cities and towns, will find it increasingly difficult to purchase coal.  And if they cannot purchase coal, what are they going to get?  Is there any attempt being made by the Government to develop further our peat resources here?  I will leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said I do not want to weary the House too much with this matter except to say that I consider it a matter of the utmost importance. I mentioned it here last year on another occasion and nobody seemed <Col N="1711" /> to take the slightest notice of it.  This question of coal supplies and the price of coal must also be related to the price of gas here in the City of Dublin and in the other cities and towns, and the question is, if coal is going to keep on rising in price and if the price of gas is going to follow that price, what is going to be the position?  I know, of course, that the Minister cannot be expected to work miracles in connection with this matter, no more than he can be expected to work miracles in connection with the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I, for one, do not blame the Minister for not being able to bring down the cost of living; but what I would blame him for, and what I would blame anybody for, is the pretence that they put forward that they were able to do these things.  I wonder has the Government any plan or have they given any consideration to the possibility of arriving at a long-term agreement with the British with regard to this question of coal?  This is a matter of the utmost importance, as I have said.  I am not going to refer to it any longer.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening remarks, many of the things I would like to speak of, agricultural production and so on, were dealt with on the Central Fund Bill.  In connection with agricultural production, I was surprised to hear a Senator here to-day give it as his view that the farmers of this country were getting too much attention; and that, perhaps, the position in the country would be better if they did not get so much attention.  In what way are the farmers of this country getting too much attention?  That is what I would like to know.  I will leave it at that.  We all talk about agricultural production and the desirability of having more and more produced from the land of this country but, as I said before, on another occasion, what is the use of indulging in platitudinous statements about this matter unless we have some positive measures to help the farmers to produce more?</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House any longer.  I would not like to see Senators getting uneasy because I dwell too long on these things.</P>

I will conclude by expressing the hope that, maybe, after 12 months the Minister may have made up his mind that the economic position here in this country would be such as to justify the introduction of permanent measures here for price control or whatever controls are now being exercised by the various Ministers of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already had before us to-day the Central Fund Bill, and I think we have all spoken pretty extensively on the policy of the Government generally and, therefore, I would hope that we will not repeat ourselves too much by saying the same things on this Bill as we said on the last one to-day.  I, in the course of my own contribution to the debate, referred to the habit that seems to be becoming a national disease nowadays, which I called &ldquo;blame placing&rdquo;.  I would hope that on this Bill here to-night we do not indulge too much in this national pastime.  We do realise that it is, perhaps, up to the Opposition to put up a certain amount of criticism of the Government, but I would urge in this case, we should all recognise that we are in a situation where it is most important that, instead of blaming one another, we should get down and see how we are going to produce more goods and services in this country that will put us in a strong financial position.</P>
      <P>This Bill deals with the supplies and services of the State and I would hope to hear something constructive on it from Senators.  If we are going to talk a lot and if we have very little time, it would be much better to direct our words to constructive suggestions that would improve the supplies and services of this country.  I will only say a few words and I hope, at least in a general way, to suggest something that will lead to this desirable end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already we seem in this House to be referring, as they did in the other House, to the control of prices and bringing down the cost of living.  I suggest there is no good talking about <Col N="1713" /> controlling prices and bringing down the cost of living, unless you have the goods to talk about.  We are all talking about prices, but I suggest that we should have far more goods before we start talking about prices.  For all those reasons, the attacks on Governments about the cost of living and the bringing down of prices are really calls for controls and for the setting up of all sorts of tribunals and inquiries, all of which cost the State money and all of which cause business people and other people engaged in production and producing wealth to waste their time and occupy their minds in dealing with matters which should follow on prosperity rather than precede it.</P>
    <P>That is what we are doing.  We all know we are not producing enough to export and that we import too many goods.  What most of our newspapers and debates are full of all the time are requests to control everything and everyone.  I suggest that the time has come when we should think more of freeing people and giving them incentives, rather than restricting them in every possible way.  In a debate of this kind and with the Minister for Industry and Commerce present, I suggest that, instead of chastising him for not tightening up on this and on that, we should exhort him to open up the markets of this country, give incentives to people and give them freedom to get on with their work.  When we have plenty of goods and our economy is in a sound, economic condition, it will be time enough to talk about prices tribunals.</P>
    <P>The Prices Advisory Body was set up in 1948 and kept on by the last Minister for Industry and Commerce. That body is still in existence.  There are very few cases in which it has been shown that high prices are due to profiteering, or to any of these practices that are always spoken of and bandied about, and with which business people and those in industry are charged in this country.  I suggest that, instead of utilising the debate to make attacks on the Government for not bringing down the cost of living, we should get down to the main purpose of the Bill.  The real purpose of the Department of Industry and Commerce is to foster and build up our <Col N="1714" /> Irish industrial economy.  Any suggestion that could be made to further that object should be made to-night rather than talk about tightening up on every person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals principally with the matters mentioned by the Tánaiste, but it also allows us an opportunity of dealing with some of the matters, particularly those mentioned by Senator McGuire.  We ought to see what we can do to make our money more valuable in this country. I believe that we will have to export primarily the produce of agriculture, and, while we have a special position in the greatest food purchasing market in the world, we will still get what is called the world market price, plus something because we are neighbours.</P>
      <P>Senators might have noticed recently that the British Government, when making a bacon agreement with Denmark, mentioned that they would charge an import duty of 10 per cent. From that, we can take it that we will get 10 per cent. benefit in the British market.  The same thing is true with regard to live stock and live-stock products. We come under the British umbrella.  I am not going to develop that.  I merely want to illustrate that we will have to take the market price, although it will be the world market price on the British market.  If we can then increase the value of our own money in this country, we will be rather well off.</P>
      <P>We will have to try to reduce the cost of national and local government. The money available should be used in large measure to subsidise the cost of essential products and in that way bring down the cost of living.  That is one of the reasons we should exercise economy in every Department of the State, so that we will have the money for that purpose.  If we can make it possible for our people to live very well on money standards that are better than Britain, because the £ purchases more, we will be doing a good job for agriculture, industry and everybody.  Whatever we export, we will get more real value for.  We ought to consider that slant to our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1715" /> We have not to maintain a large standing army, nor have we to engage in international obligations with regard to defence.  We ought therefore to be able to use the money for the bolstering up of our economy and increasing the real living standards of our people by subsidising food production. The first thing this Government did was to reduce the price of butter by 5d. per lb. and the only thing I am sorry for is that, owing to the enormously difficult world conditions which arose during the past couple of years, we were not able to do more.</P>
    <P>Listening to the debates to-day and yesterday, one would imagine that anything that happened in the world was the creation of the present Government. Sometimes Governments and fathers of families have to adopt measures with regard to balancing the State and family budgets that are not very palatable.  The United States of America has by far the most buoyant economy in the whole world.  The United States found it necessary in the first year or two of the Eisenhower administration to impose controls.  I should like to read just a few lines from <i>The Economist</i>, dated 17th March, 1956. This is in reference to the Roosevelt administration.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Throughout their first summer and autumn of office the Republicans kept a sterner economic policy in being than the steady growth of American unemployment might have seemed to warrant; they forsook for a short period the advantages of an increase in production and, in doing so, they sent a shiver down several, people's spines.  Yet, even in the American context, and even by those who doubted their wisdom at the time, the policy must be admitted to have been astoundingly successful.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that these stern measures will be taken here, but sometimes it may be necessary to tighten the rein.</P>
    <P>We saw last week that our Minister had to impose some controls with regard to the import of many nonessential products.  An appeal was <Col N="1716" /> made to-day by Senator L'Estrange&mdash; an appeal that was echoed by Senator Hartney and others&mdash;to &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; the 52 weeks of the year.  If we did that, we would remove a great deal of the burden placed on every modern Government&mdash;the burden of catering for people who find themselves temporarily out of work.  Someone said we have nearly 70,000 on the unemployment register.  In an economy of this size, probably half that number would always be changing from one occupation to another.  Unless you have the direction and regimentation of labour, it is not possible to have over-all employment. While there is over-all employment in Britain, there is still an unemployment figure.  One can go to Birmingham, Manchester or any of the big industrial cities in the Midlands of Britain and see notices outside factories that hundreds of workers are required.  Nevertheless, on the returns, there are people unemployed.  There must be some percentage of people who will be unemployed, even in an economy where there is what is called at present &ldquo;full employment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to saving.  It is the duty of every person to save.  In particular, it is the duty of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I am glad the Tánaiste mentioned that, very shortly, a Road Traffic Bill will be introduced in the Dáil.  I am glad the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Local Government have seen fit to give this matter high priority.  What is happening on our roads to-day is not a credit to us and it is well that that very important matter is being taken care of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to some of these controls, the Minister said they were exercising a control on pigs and bacon. In view of the recent agreement of the Minister for Agriculture with the bacon curers, in relation to a fixed minimum price for pigs for the next 13 months, and as this is very likely to have the effect of less fluctuation than heretofore, would the Tánaiste controls <Col N="1717" /> sider having the retail price control removed?  I think he said it was the fluctuation in prices that suggested to him the necessity for control.  If this desirable agreement which has taken place removes fluctuation in prices, that will be satisfactory.  In the marketing of products which are not in short supply, the prices vary from province to province and from town to town.  It is almost impossible to fix a retail price for a commodity such as bacon.  It has often been said that, with the various cuts, it is like making a book&mdash;that it depends on what is favourite and that, if somebody fixes the price, you cannot balance your book.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no fixed price at present for bacon.  You can sell it at any price you like under the maximum price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a maximum price, but it has a certain effect.  If a maximum price were put on what you might charge on any horse in a racecourse, it might also be hard to balance the book, although the level of prices might be lower under a free system.  If there are not the violent fluctuations we had over the past couple of years, I suggest the Minister might consider removing that.  The power had to be taken in order to stop the effects of the violent fluctuations.</P>
      <P>One of the factors that may be responsible for increases in the price of commodities such as coal is the handling cost.  It has been suggested to me that many of the methods of loading and unloading coal at our ports are antiquated and expensive.  I was told recently that, at some of our ports, it costs at least 5/- per ton more to unload the coal than it would if proper mechanical apparatus were used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was informed that, at some ports, they are allowed to use only buckets.  If they used cranes, the price of the coal could be reduced by 5/- a ton.  If that is so, I should like to have the position remedied.  It represents a direct tax on the poor. <Col N="1718" /> They have to pay this extra 5/- a ton. Furthermore, as Senator Kissane pointed out, they also have to pay it through the cost of gas and coke and other fuel they purchase.</P>
      <P>Many of the items which were dealt with under the Supplies and Services legislation have now been dealt with in permanent legislation.  The Tánaiste has informed us that, during the next 12 months or so, he intends to deal with some other items which he is now covering by this present temporary measure.  This suggests we are getting back from the aftermath of the last great war and that we shall find ourselves, by the end of the term of office of this Government, in the position that it may not be necessary to have an omnibus measure like the Supplies and Services Bill.</P>
      <P>So much ground has been covered on the recent Bill that I do not propose to delay the House any longer.  However, we shall all be interested in the statement which the Tánaiste will have an opportunity of making here to-night on this very important measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we ought to welcome what the Minister has said about his intention, in the not too distant future, to abolish this Bill altogether.  He told us something similar last year.  I think that he has kept his word, in seeing to it that a number of independent measures have been introduced since last year, going towards the total&mdash;which is admittedly a large one&mdash;that would make it possible to drop these emergency powers if not next year then the year after.</P>
      <P>I think one ought to start by recognising that a great number of these measures have already been put through, and that others are already before the Dáil, and that quite clearly others are in the mind of the Government. Therefore I think we can confidently look forward to the day when the necessity for passing this Bill year after year will cease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the Bills the Minister mentioned, however, as having been brought in for the purpose of eventually abolishing this particular Bill was the Tea Importation and Distribution Bill.  I was slightly disturbed to find <Col N="1719" /> that this Act in fact is due to expire on the 31st March, 1958, or earlier.  I am sure there is some explanation for that, but I do not quite see it as part of the framework of legislation designed to replace permanently this temporary measure before us to-day.</P>
    <P>Speaking as an Independent in this House, I may say that I am not really very impressed by the case made by the Opposition in attacking the Government on the question of prices and the cost of living.  The reason is that I am not convinced that the Opposition, when they were in power did, or if they again come to power will, behave in a manner very different, in relation to prices and supplies, which are the topics before us this evening.  I do not in fact see a very big difference, and I think both contingents are caught in the same nexus, the same mechanism, which is the mechanism of the capitalist state which conditions both production and distribution to a very great extent in this country.</P>
    <P>I notice that on the same debate last year Senator Burke, who has just sat down, in volume 44, column 867, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The dear money policy of the previous Government has been the cause of increases in rents, rates and taxes on every individual, rich and poor, in this country&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He went on to point to the contrast with the present Government which favoured a &ldquo;cheap money&rdquo; policy. Well, things have changed apparently. I do not wish to develop that, but I do not see any enormous difference between the two attitudes towards money.  The Minister referred to-day specifically, in general terms which I would approve, to the question of price control, and to his reluctance, which I found understandable, to abolish such bodies as the Prices Advisory Body and the Fair Trade Commission, before someone could suggest to him an alternative which would demonstrably be better.  He made the point, which I think we ought all to recognise as a valid one, that these bodies are working reasonably well, and that the <Col N="1720" /> public is becoming increasingly aware of them and becoming used to their mechanism, and consequently these bodies are increasingly able to serve the purpose for which they were intended&mdash;the controlling, to a certain extent at any rate, of prices and conditions of distribution.</P>
    <P>The first function of the Prices Advisory Body, as we know, has been to make recommendations as to maximum prices of commodities, recommendations which the Minister usually follows.  Those recommendations in no way preclude private enterprise, which is so often spoken of here by some Senators in terms of the loudest praise, from price-competition below that maximum.  The only kind of competition that is prevented by implementation of the recommendations of the Prices Advisory Body is competition in raising prices, and I take it that no exponent or praiser of private enterprise wants that kind of competition. Consequently, the mere fixing of maximum prices, or the recommending of maximum prices by the Prices Advisory Body, does not prevent competition in cutting prices, the only kind of competition which is beneficial to the consumer. Below that level of maximum prices, private enterprise can compete to its heart's content and, I think, to the general satisfaction of the consumer. In other words, the first function of the Prices Advisory Body in no way trammels private enterprise&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>No, except that for private enterprise it is a case of: &ldquo;Heads you win, tails we lose.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be prepared to accept that analogy, but in any event I would prefer to continue with my second point in regard to the Prices Advisory Body. Their second function is to see that any price increases asked for, in relation to a particular commodity, are publicly justified.  I think that is a most precious thing and represents one of the big differences between the Prices Advisory Body and the older mechanism, which worked more or less well, but which was a Civil Service body conducting its investigations behind closed doors.  I regard it as <Col N="1721" /> most valuable, and I think the Minister indicated that himself, that when prices for necessary commodities have to be increased, that increase has to be publicly justified.</P>
      <P>Senator McGuire has spoken of the terrible waste of time in going to the court and giving evidence and so on. Senator McGuire is a very sincere man, but I think he is also a very innocent man, or he would not believe there is this tremendous waste of time in going to the court for a couple of days and giving evidence about a thing that affects the businessman himself pretty nearly, that is, the necessity of increasing prices.  He would have to spend a lot more time, of course, if the necessity for an increased price were not as obvious to everyone else as it was to him.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>However that may be, the fact is that I regard it as an excellent thing from the viewpoint of the consumer&mdash;I think I am supporting the Minister and the Government in this matter&mdash;that when increases in prices have to be brought about, those increases have to be publicly justified.  Even when that increase is recommended to the Minister he still retains the right to act or not as he thinks fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the other body, which is concerned partly at least with prices, the Fair Trade Commission, I would view their functions and their work in a similar light.  But I think one can praise both Governments here, and recognise that one body was set up by one Government and the other by the other Government, and that perhaps, the alternative Governments might unite here in praise of these two bodies which they set up.  The Fair Trade Commission is there to examine <Col N="1722" /> restrictions on trade where they exist, restrictions on the distribution of supplies, on the basis&mdash;on any basis where restriction in the distribution of supplies exists&mdash;and frequently on the basis of &ldquo;suggested prices&rdquo;.  I say &ldquo;suggested prices&rdquo;, because I know there is great indignation if one talks about &ldquo;fixed prices&rdquo;.  No one &ldquo;fixes&rdquo; prices, but a manufacturer can &ldquo;suggest&rdquo; prices, and all he does to a retailer or wholesaler who does not fall in with his &ldquo;suggestion&rdquo; is simply to withhold supplies.  But that must not be called &ldquo;fixing prices,&rdquo; of course.</P>
    <P>But in relation to such &ldquo;suggested&rdquo; prices, the function of the Fair Trade Commission has been to examine whatever restrictions may exist.  Now should the Fair Trade Commission in any particular industry make recommendations, and should the Minister act upon these recommendations, then the recommendations in every case, by the commission's very terms of reference, will relate purely to the removal of restrictions.  I submit that the removal of restrictions cannot in any way prevent competition.  It is sometimes said that these bodies are trammelling private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire has appealed for the setting free of people in private enterprise.  I suggest that quite a lot of people are set free by the removal of restrictions of that kind.  These restrictions, as long as they obtain, and until their removal by the implementation of the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission, act against competition, which used to be said to be &ldquo;the life of trade&rdquo;.  They act against competition.  We are told that these official bodies and commissions represent &ldquo;controls&rdquo;, but the very big difference is this, that these controls over restrictive practices are for the public benefit and not for the benefit merely of private interests.</P>

      <P>The removal of restrictions, in my submission, cannot in any sense be called the imposition of controls.  With relation to the Prices Advisory Body, the Minister has quite recently made an innovation which I think should be welcomed, and which I hope will provide the pattern in other cases. That is his decision to publish a summary of the findings of the Prices Advisory Body, in relation, I think it was, to their recommendations on the price of bread, and also in relation to one other recommendation.  I have felt, and I think many members of the public have felt, that it would be extremely useful if we could see, not merely the results of the recommendations of the body, but something of the considerations they took into account in reaching their decision.  I think that the decision of the Minister to publish a summary of the findings is an excellent one, and gives encouragement to the public to take an interest in the prices framework, and in the considerations that go to make up the situation in regard to prices.  The more interest the public take in matters of <Col N="1724" /> this kind, the better it will be for everybody.</P>
      <P>I should here like, nevertheless, to make some of the criticisms which are occasionally, I think, legitimate in relation to the work of the Prices Advisory Body.  I quote, for instance, from a report in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 6th December, 1955, during the proceedings of the Prices Advisory Body in relation to the price of bread. According to this report, the chairman of the body said as follows: &ldquo;Someone will have to try and make out some kind of costings.  You can be sure the members of the body would like to have costings, even if it is difficult.&rdquo; The secretary of the Association of Master Bakers intimated that they would like an opinion as to what type of costings the body would like.  He would undertake to supply them.</P>

      <P>The point I am making is that all too often costings are not produced at all before the public at the Prices Advisory Body. After two days' investigation there, it was suggested by the chairman that the body would like to have costings and so on, and the costings given on that particular occasion were made on the basis of the figures of 30 &ldquo;representative&rdquo; bakeries out of over 200 members of the association and these show that there was an &ldquo;average profit&rdquo; of 6s. 7d. on a sack of flour. In fact, there was no public evidence of any kind as to how that &ldquo;average&rdquo;<Col N="1725" /> was reached nor how &ldquo;representative&rdquo; these bakeries were.</P>

      <P>I submit to your ruling, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, but I did understand the Minister to make the point that he had decided to maintain the Prices Advisory Body, and it seems to me that I might be in order in examining its work.  I had one or two suggestions to make as to how it might be improved.</P>
      <P>I will pass from that, however.  There are two general categories of prices: the prices of import goods and the prices of home produced articles.  It is fairly clear that, in trying to control the prices of imported goods, we are not in a very strong position. Occasionally, we can exercise some measure of control over the pricing of goods which we buy in bulk, as we have in relation to tea, for instance.  In regard, however, to home prices I feel that there is more that could be done.</P>
      <P>A good deal has been said here about productivity and the need to produce more, and the effect on prices and so on.  It seems to me, in relation to both industrial and agricultural prices, that we have not yet done everything in regard to home prices that we could. In relation to agricultural prices, it appears to me that there has been a rather lazy contention that the only way you can increase production is to increase prices.  It is very seldom adverted to that, in the case of milk for instance, too many farmers regard milk not as a first product of the farm, but as a by-product of the cattle trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without going into details on this matter, I would suggest that many small farmers, in fact, are dependent on what is known as the dual purpose cow to keep going, and they can only do so by gaining an increase in the price.  As in the case of the price of flour, the tendency is, I fear, to base our prices upon the uneconomic unit. <Col N="1726" /> In the case of the flour, it is the least economic mill in the country, and in the case of the production of milk, it is the least economic farmer in the country.  Nobody wants to see the small farmer going out of business, but I think many may be being forced out of business by pressure of circumstances, and if they are not to be so, they should enter into some form of co-operative farming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you say collective farms are the answer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said co-operative farms.  There was a most respected Senator here, Senator R.M. Burke, who put the case for co-operative farming in Ireland, from 15 years of practical experience of farming in this country, and I do not know whether any Senator ever made the sneer at him that Senator McGuire has made at me.  If that form of co-operative farming could be done in East Galway, it surely could be done in other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Senator McGuire and I are really much at variance on the point. I am sorry if the Senator was perhaps over-sensitive on my calling him &ldquo;innocent&rdquo;, but that was the only remark I made that could be regarded as anything like a sneer, and I withdrew it at once when he denied the charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I would like to turn to the question of efficiency in industry.  I believe I am right in saying that the Minister has very much at heart the whole question of how efficient our industry is.  I should just like to ask him a question. I think he told us some time ago here that the question of the effective efficiency of certain industries benefiting by protective barriers was being examined by an official body. He mentioned some of the details of the findings, and I should like to ask him whether more results have been <Col N="1727" /> produced.  I noted and I pointed out that, on a previous occasion, he took action in respect of the protective duty, removing it when it was thought that a particular industry had reached a stage of efficiency when it no longer needed protection.  I think I am at one with the Minister when I hold that too much protection makes the manufacturer too soft.  All too often in this country State interference for the benefit of the consumer is held to be very bad, but State interference for the benefit of the manufacturer is considered to be a very good thing.</P>
    <P>I intended to deal with certain attacks that have been made lately on the Prices Advisory Body and the Fair Trade Commission.  I will leave that out, because I think it has been deemed to be out of order here.  There will be another occasion for that, but I should like to say now in relation to those two bodies that I think our Government has given a lead.  I notice in Britain they are now wondering whether they might not be able to tackle the same kind of problems, and I should like to think they are studying what has been done by our Fair Trade Commission and our Prices Advisory Body.  The reports presented by those bodies on the working of certain elements in various trades, not all by any means, have enabled the position to be made more clear to the public; and I think the exposure of anything like a restriction imposed on trade for private interest is a good thing, from the public point of view.</P>
    <P>There is an obvious relationship between prices and incomes and spending power, the amount of money available and the effect that a lot of money available has upon prices.  There has been an attempt to curb spending power in this country.  It is quite obvious that, if you have a lot of money running around looking for consumer goods, prices will tend to go up.  I should like to quote if I may from the <i>Spectator</i> of 2nd March an article by Mr. Brian Inglis, who says that according to the calculations of an economist whom he quotes, a Mr. Kaldor, &ldquo;Two-thirds of the propertied classes in Britain finance their personal expenditure from capital appreciation; <Col N="1728" /> and of the not necessarily propertied, but well-to-do classes a substantial proportion finance their personal expenditure largely from expense accounts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In relation to pricing, I feel that the Government, sooner or later, will have to consider the whole pattern, if you like, of the system of distribution of money, the distribution of this spending power.  Earlier to-day the Minister for Finance referred to the necessity for having &ldquo;efficient production&rdquo; so that we might all enjoy a better standard of living.  But he forgot to mention that as well as efficient production we must have efficient distribution, and for me that means equitable distribution of the benefits of efficient production. I would suggest that what is required, consequently, in relation to the whole framework of control, of quotas, of prices and supplies, is some guiding principle in the harnessing of our available labour force to the available resources in the country, so that the planning principle be applied not merely to &ldquo;production&rdquo; but to useful production, production with the main emphasis on necessities and not on luxuries or semi-luxuries.</P>
    <P>For this purpose, I would suggest in relation to that problem that a purchase-tax system, even started in a small way, on luxuries, would provide at least a valuable piece of guidance.  The Minister for Finance has stated that he does not think it &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; to this country.  I recognise that it might not be ideal, that it might prove cumbersome and have disadvantages if the retailer was forced to pay the full purchase tax on buying from the wholesaler, but I do believe it could be a most useful instrument in the guiding, establishing and controlling of channels into which our productive effort would be put and where it ought to be strongest.  I appeal to the Minister to consider experimenting even in a minor way with such a tax and an examination of its effects upon price structure and the distribution of income and spending power.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, then, I would appeal for bolder planning not only of production but of distribution, so that, more and more in Ireland, the community <Col N="1729" /> need and the community interest will be the prime considerations, when as a community we decide what shall be produced, and how widely it shall be distributed&mdash;which is a factor all too often forgotten.  Concern for community need, and not for private greed, should be our guiding principle, increasingly, whenever we turn to the problems of prices and supplies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like at the outset to make a brief reference to a statement made by the Minister here when concluding the debate on the Bill last year.  The reference was to myself and I trust the Minister will take it in good humour, because I do not feel very strongly about it.  At the same time, I am anxious that the records of the House should be right. The Minister said at column 944 of the Official Debates of 10th March, 1956:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have listened to Senator Cogan speak for many Parties.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>For the records of the House, I should like to say I came into the Oireachtas as an Independent.  When I was satisfied that one of the two rival political Parties was much better than the other I decided to join that Party. That is the right of any Independent and I exercised that right, certainly with the consent of those who supported me.  That reference to me, personally, is slanderous.  It is a slanderous statement to suggest that I, as a public representative, have been a member of a number of Parties, whereas in fact I took an independent stand, entered public life as an Independent and, having weighed up the difference between the rival Parties, decided to join the better of the two. The Minister will admit that he, having weighed, possibly, the difference between the two rival Parties, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, and having many times bitterly attacked Fine Gael in the past, decided to join that Party.  So his position does not differ very much from mine, except perhaps that he is a little better paid.</P>

      <P>The Minister should not persist.  I hope he will accept this in good humour.  He should not persist in the attempt to misrepresent me.  It is right and proper that a man in public life should be a member of a number of associations.  I am a member of a number of associations, such as the Farmers' Association and others of a non-political character, and I do not think there is anything wrong in that. It is not my intention to prolong this debate unduly, but I think the Minister was shocked, and I think the Minister for Finance also was shocked when they learned, apparently for the first time, to-day or yesterday that the cost of living has risen higher during the Coalition period of office than it did during the Fianna Fáil period. Certainly, it appeared to be news to them.</P>

      <P>I submit that that is not a point of order, but rather of disorder, and it may arise from the fact that Senator L'Estrange was not in the House when Senator Kissane explained this point very clearly, and pointed out that the cost of living rose ten points during the first period of the Coalition Government, that it had risen a further seven points during the present period of the Coalition Government.  Ten and seven are 17 under any system of mathematics, even the Westmeath system of mathematics.</P>

      <P>The entire rise in the cost of living during the Fianna Fáil period of administration was 15 points. That ought to clear the position beyond all question.  It is unpleasant perhaps to people who have talked about the high cost of living and who have unjustly blamed Fianna Fáil for the high cost of living to find that they themselves have been greater offenders in that respect.  It is true that the failure of the Minister in particular, and of the Government generally, to do anything substantial to protect the people from the pressure of rising prices is causing a good deal of resentment and perhaps a good deal of scepticism amongst our people in regard to politics generally.  People are more inclined now to say that they cannot trust promises given at election times, that they mean nothing at all, that they are made mainly, if not entirely, for the purpose of securing office.</P>

      <P>Point 15 of the 17-point programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with point 15 of the 17-point programme.  These 17 points may not be the 17 points by which the cost of living has risen under the Coalition Government, but I shall deal with point 15 in due course.  The Minister, when he was addressing the people in 1954, repeatedly stated that the one thing above all that he would do was bring down the cost of living. Speaking at Kildare, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on the 5th May, 1954, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the Labour Party participated in an inter-Party Government it would guarantee to the people that the policy of that Government would be directed towards a reduction in prices.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Again, at Ballymore Eustace he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If Labour participated in an inter-Party Government its object would be to reduce prices.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He made the same statement at Narraghmore and at Brownstown, Curragh Camp.  In other words, by persistent repetition, he was endeavouring, and probably succeeded, in stamping upon the minds of the electorate that, no matter what happened, if he were elected to Dáil Éireann, he would use his power to force down the cost of living.  To his credit, he did endeavour to put himself into a position to exercise that power, inasmuch as he took over the office of Minister for Industry and Commerce which gives him at least the authority to deal with issues such as this.  Other shadow Ministers who made extravagant promises were wise enough to fade out when the time came to deliver the goods.  I am quite sure that the Minister has endeavoured to carry out the promises that he gave, but he has failed absolutely and completely.</P>
      <P>Nobody appears to be more conscious of that fact than one of the Minister's lieutenants, Deputy J. Larkin, who said yesterday:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1733" />&ldquo;The Government is not exercising effective national leadership.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on to say that he was critical of them because they had not been able to deal with many problems.  It is in that respect that the Government have failed most lamentably, that they have not given this country any kind of effective national leadership.  They have just drifted along into the particular kind of crisis, economic and financial, that has arisen.  Notwithstanding the fact that some rather drastic measures were adopted, which one would imagine might have an effect on the cost of living, the cost of living has risen seven points since they resumed office.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the price of wheat, one would imagine, would have had the effect of bringing down the price of bread.  It must have reaped from the farming community a sum of close on £2,000,000.  Certainly that £2,000,000, if it had been passed on to the consumer, would have had some effect on the cost of living, but somewhere along the way that £2,000,000 appears to have been lost; it certainly never reached the consumer.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke, I think, suggests that unpopular measures are required and that stern measures should be taken.  If somebody on this side of the House, or somebody on the Opposition side in the Dáil, were to suggest such a thing, we know the outcry there would be.  If any member of Fianna Fáil, when they were in office, had made that suggestion, I know it would have been received with howls of derision.  Now, however, when it comes from the Coalition, it is apparently accepted as being something that should be taken by our people in a good spirit.  While I do not agree with the solutions to our national problems offered by Deputy Larkin, I believe there is a good deal in what he says about the failure of this Government to give an effective lead to the nation and I think the most effective lead that is needed at present is to create a feeling of confidence among all those who are engaged in production.</P>
    <P>There is altogether too much criticism of the producer.  It does not matter <Col N="1734" /> in what line he is engaged, the man who creates or produces anything is apparently marked down as the first object for attack, and I do not think that is conducive to making our country more productive and thereby raising the general standard of living.  I could not agree with the line taken by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  All along in his speech, there was the suggestion of restrictions and controls of every possible kind and no question of any fair incentive being offered to the producer. If we were to take a census of the number of people engaged in productive work at present, it would be found they are only a minority of the total community, and that the great majority are endeavouring in some way or other to reap some benefit from the efforts of those who are trying to produce.</P>
    <P>One has only to consider what it costs, for example, to produce one bacon pig and how very small is the amount of profit when the price of the food he consumes is reckoned by the time that animal is fit for the market, even if he does succeed in passing the examination for grade A classification. Could we not now have a suggestion or a proposal from the Minister to change that?  He, himself, was at one time very critical of Irish manufacturers; I think he is not quite so critical now and Irish producers, whether they be in factory or farm, are doing most important national work and it would be wrong for anyone who has not the clearest and most definite figures and facts before him to brand as a profiteer any man who is doing productive work.  If by the figures it can, in fact, be proved that there is profiteering, then by all means let that man be criticised, but it is utterly wrong for anybody to condemn or even criticise a farmer or manufacturer without that clear-cut definite evidence.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister, since he has a certain measure of control over matters of this kind relating to investigations, should do something within the Government to urge that this investigation of the cost of milk should be completed at an early date.  In that connection, I think the Minister and the Government have failed lamentably.  They took a certain stand on providing a <Col N="1735" /> temporary subsidy for tea, possibly in the hope that the world market would decline.  The net result of their interference in the matter is that tea to-day is costing at least 3d. a lb. more than it would cost if they had not interfered at all.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether restriction or control of profits and prices affects such things as the rise in the rate of interest in the banks.  It might be possible for the Prices Advisory Body to inquire into the working of the banks and see whether they are making a profit or a loss&mdash;as some people suggest&mdash;by raising the bank rate of interest.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has come rather prominently before the public within the last few months is the price of meat and its relationship to the price of cattle.  It is admitted that cattle prices have fallen by anything from £10 to £20 per head.  Some members of the Government made themselves ridiculous by suggesting that the fall was due to the <i>Irish Press.</i>  The suggestion, apparently, was that the British buyers who come over to the Dublin markets study the <i>Irish Press</i> before bidding for cattle here.  I think that is too fantastic to be accepted by anybody.  However, the price of cattle came down very substantially during the past two months and, as far as I know, there has not been any attempt to pass on that reduction to the consumer. I think, as far as anyone can judge by the prices charged for meat, these are as high as when the higher prices were ruling for cattle.  I am not pressing very much on this matter but I will say, if there is a pretence of control or regulation of prices and profits or profiteering, I think it should apply to a matter as vital as this.</P>
    <P>I am strongly convinced, however, that the better way to bring down the cost of living and to bring down prices of food and other essentials is to give real encouragement to those who are engaged in production.  I was rather shocked to read that one member of the Minister's Party yesterday suggested that a policy of coaxing the farmer should be abandoned and that, instead, penalties should be inflicted on <Col N="1736" /> farmers who, in the opinion of the politicians, are not producing the maximum.  That seems to me to be a line of action which would tend to lead or drive this country in the direction of collective farming.</P>
    <P>I think that the suggestion also of a tax upon land, made last year also by a member of the Minister's Party, is still under active consideration by the Government.  I should like to ask the Minister whether it is or not.  If anything is to be done which could be of an effective nature to bring down the cost of living it should be with regard to the encouragement of production. If subsidies are to be provided, they should be paid at the source and not at the other end of the line.  In other words, it would be perhaps the most effective way to reduce the price of food, if some measure were adopted for the subsidisation of fertilisers, or other measures of that kind, which would reduce the farmers' cost of production and enable him to produce and sell his goods more cheaply. That is the line we would like to see the Government adopting in regard to the cost of living, rather than the unlimited and endless type of regulation or restriction contemplated in this Bill and spoken of earlier by Senator Kissane.</P>
    <P>There is one other point with which I should like to deal, because Senator L'Estrange hinted it might be raised later.  It is in regard to point 15 of the policy outlined by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1951.  The Fianna Fáil Government never undertook at any time to maintain food subsidies at the level at which they found them, or at the level at which they first introduced them, because they were the Government who initiated the food subsidies. They did promise to maintain, not the existing food subsidies, but food subsidies. They did that in a very substantial measure, because, when they were going out of office, the amount voted for food subsidies was in the region of £7,000,000, a very substantial contribution to the reduction in the cost of living and a very substantial percentage of our total revenue.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, acknowledged that a <Col N="1737" /> very substantial portion of the money saved by the reduction of food subsidies was devoted to improving the social services, particularly to the improvement of children's allowances. That, I think, was the most progressive piece of social legislation enacted in this country.  Anything that tends to ease the burden of those who have large families is desirable and it is desirable that the benefits of the taxation of the better off sections should be enjoyed by the people in the lower income groups who have large families. That was a noteworthy line of action and one which has not been modified to any great extent since the present Government took over.  Notwithstanding that, the cost of living has risen very sharply in the past two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express to the Minister for Industry and Commerce a welcome back from the United States.  This is the first time since his visit there that he has appeared in this House.  I should like to say that, like me, many other Irish industrialists viewed his visit somewhat sceptically but we did wish him well and hoped that his visit would have the desired results.  I know from practical experience that there is a demand in the United States for Irish goods and at least one of the industries with which I am connected is not just able to meet the orders from the United States.  I only wish it was possible to do so.</P>
      <P>It does show that the Minister's visit was well worth while, in that there is a market abroad to be obtained for Irish industrial production, if we are prepared to get down to the question of costs and if we can produce goods of a quality acceptable outside the country.  I feel quite certain we are able to produce goods of a sufficiently high quality to attract outside buyers.  In fact, I feel sure we could produce better goods than could be found elsewhere in the world.  We must, first of all, be prepared to produce these goods and, secondly, to produce them at a cost that will compete on world markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was expressed by the <Col N="1738" /> Minister for Finance earlier this evening that Irish industrialists were worried about the efforts of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to bring foreign capital into this country.  I think the Minister for Finance to a certain extent misjudged industrialists here.  We would welcome new capital for Irish industry, and, if we are to compete successfully in world markets, we need a certain amount of increased capital.</P>
    <P>Some of the things that did worry us were reports of some of the Tánaiste's speeches in the United States.  I feel quite certain many of them were abbreviated and distorted reports of what the Minister said while on the visit.  One of the things that did perturb us was a statement attributed to him that there was no control of profits in Irish industry.  I am satisfied the Minister said no such thing and I would hope that he will deny that he did just as emphatically as I did. What I believe he did say was that there was no control of profits on foreign exports.  That distinction is very important.</P>
    <P>Our industrialists, in so far as the home markets are concerned, enjoy protection and so they must have control over the profits they may make. Any of us in industry or labour would not disagree with that.  As far as exports are concerned, they should have a perfectly free hand, and, if it is possible to make increased profits, there should be no control on the goods actually going out to world markets.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke, I think, referred to imports of coal to this country and referred to the additional costs of coal due to old-fashioned methods of handling it.  Deputy Hickey said that as far as he knew our ports had the most modern mechanical equipment for the loading of coal.  If Deputy Hickey visited the Dún Laoghaire coal harbour, he would get a reverse opinion because coal is handled there by the most old-fashioned methods.  You will see the colliers being unloaded by buckets and a man standing on a platform tilting the buckets on to the lorries with a lot of effort.  I have quite a lot of experience of ports around the <Col N="1739" /> country and I do know the methods of unloading coal are uneconomic.</P>
    <P>One of the policies of the present Government and of the previous Government has been an effort to reopen the shipping trade in our smaller ports around the coast, and, while I agree entirely with that, I should like to say that I think it has met also with the approval of the people in the smaller seaports.  This brings me to one point which has worried me considerably. Most of the raw materials for Irish industry come from countries abroad and there would be many advantages were these materials brought directly to the smaller ports rather than to Dublin, Cork or other big ports and transported then by road.</P>
    <P>We are attempting to provide industries for the less developed areas and particularly for the areas of the West. I was very perturbed last year when, in June, I received a letter from the commander of one of the ships which bring supplies around our coasts and in which he submitted to me a list of navigation charts which had been withdrawn by the British Admiralty and which he said were essential for the navigation of the west coast of Ireland.  Navigation around our coasts, and particularly round the west coast, is extremely difficult, and the withdrawal of these charts imposes considerable handicaps on any ship's captain travelling north or south along the west coast of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Being aware of that difficulty, I asked Deputy Maurice Dockrell to put down a question to the Minister with regard to the withdrawal of these charts and in Volume 152 of Dáil Debates he asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...whether he is aware that during the past 12 months a number of charts essential for navigating on the Irish coast have been withdrawn by the British Admiralty and, if so, if he will take steps to have them made available by the Stationery Office.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1740" />&ldquo;I am aware that the charts in question have been withdrawn.  I am advised, however, that in each case the areas concerned are adequately covered by alternative charts which are available.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On hearing the Minister's reply, I felt that he had been wrongly advised and I went back and wrote to the Minister a letter in which I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Having heard your reply this afternoon to the question by Maurice Dockrell with regard to the charts withdrawn by the British Admiralty in which I think you said that alternative charts were available for the areas covered by the withdrawn sheets, I would like to draw your attention to the following charts which have been withdrawn and which are not, I believe, replaceable by any existing charts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first one I referred to was a chart of the west coast of Ireland which was most profitable to ship masters navigating our coasts.  There is no need for me to give the whole list of charts. Small ships bringing supplies into our west coast ports are considerably handicapped by the fact that the charts were withdrawn by the British Admiralty and that there was no alternative available, as far as I could find out.  Nearly all the charts withdrawn referred to the west coast of Ireland.  The charts for Bantry Bay and Bere Head were both withdrawn. The chart for Bantry Bay is essential for the navigation of that harbour which is one of our biggest natural harbours and which is often used by transatlantic liners.</P>

In supporting the passage of the Supplies and Services Bill, I do feel that I ought to make the comment that the proposals contained in the Bill are designed to meet our present problems.  I wish to add my voice to the approval voiced by the country generally within the past few days of the action of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I feel justified in complimenting him on the rapidity with which he acted, on receipt of certain reports of profiteering. The Minister and the Government could feel assured of the support of the House on any such action it would be found necessary to take in dealing with any further reports of profiteering of that kind.  The Minister deserves the support of all sides of this House.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of Fianna Fáil to repeat lies <i>ad nauseam</i> and, if one does not contradict those lies continuously, they are eventually accepted as truth.  To-night, we have once more seen crocodile tears shed about the cost of living and Fianna Fáil has now made the very interesting discovery that the cost of living has risen to a greater extent under the inter-Party Government than it did under the Fianna Fáil Government. Of course, for purposes of comparison, they very conveniently took a Fianna Fáil term of office of three years and compared that with an inter-Party term of office of five years already, and I hope many more after that.  Senator Kissane might have had regard, when he was dealing with these figures, to averages.  I notice that, for the three years of Fianna Fáil Government, the cost of living, according to Senator Kissane's own figures, increased by 15 <Col N="1743" /> points, which represents an increase of 5 points per annum.  For the five years of inter-Party Government so far, the increase has been 17 points, which is an average of 3½ points per annum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking the Senator's own figures.  We had yesterday and to-day the same outcry about the cost of living as we had on this measure last year.  Fortunately, on this occasion, at any rate, Senator Cogan did not attempt to deny the relativity of the cost of living, even though he did not acknowledge it. Last year, he tried to tell us that the workers in general had not got compensation for the increased cost of living under the inter-Party Government. I think we disproved that conclusively on that occasion.  We pointed to the different approach of the two Governments to the cost of living.</P>
      <P>I know Fianna Fáil are sensitive where the cost of living is concerned because they can claim the credit of deliberately increasing the cost of living by budgetary action, whereas this Government has never done so. This Government can rightly claim to have made every effort to keep the cost of living as low as possible and, where it has increased, workers have not been prevented from getting compensation to offset that increase.  We have not had any standstill on wages under this Government.  We have no threat now, as we had some three years previously from a Fianna Fáil Government, of a wages standstill.  Neither will we have any such threat, by all accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry Senator Cogan has left, because I would like, for his edification, to compare the data given us by <Col N="1744" /> Senator Kissane in relation to the cost of living with the agricultural price index for the same period.  Senator Kissane pointed to the increase of ten points in the cost of living between February, 1948, and May, 1951.  Judging by the agricultural price index, the farming community in general during that period got ample compensation. They got increased prices, because the index of agricultural prices in that period rose from 248 to 298, an increase of 50 points.  In the following three years of Fianna Fáil Government, as Senator Kissane pointed out, the cost of living increased by 15 points, but he carefully refrained from drawing attention to the fact that over half that increase was deliberate policy on the part of the Fianna Fáil Government and the agricultural price index in that period rose by only 13 points, from 298 to 311.  Current experience is that since June, 1954, the agricultural price index has gone up by another 30 points and the cost of living in the same period has gone up by only seven points.  I think that eventually we shall all, and the sooner the better, realise that the cost of living is relative.  It is foolish to talk about the cost of living, without having regard to incomes at the same time.</P>
    <P>Mention was made by Fianna Fáil speakers of emigration, unemployment and capital investment.  I was rather sorry those speakers did not clarify their Party's attitude to foreign investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>If it does not arise, I shall leave the point.  I did think they might have given us some information as to their attitude.  They did not do so, however, and I will leave the matter there.  I can understand that they are a bit hesitant about it and possibly reluctant to make their viewpoint known, so we will let them off this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other aspect in regard to the cost of living.  In the past 18 months, we have seen a deliberate campaign by the organ of Fianna Fáil to highlight the cost of living on every available opportunity and to suggest <Col N="1745" /> to wage earners and trade unionists alike that the cost of living was going rapidly out of control, putting it to them that efforts should be made to increase their rates of pay.  Now, I think Fianna Fáil might leave it to the trade unionists to do their own business.  I noticed reports in the Fianna Fáil organ during the past 12 months of meetings of trade unions and the reports were to the effect that the meetings had decided to lodge a particular claim.  Some of us trade unionists have been puzzled to know what meetings were referred to, or whether the report was just something that existed in the imagination of Fianna Fáil.  It did seem to many of us that the Fianna Fáil Party were deliberately trying to stampede trade unionists into taking certain action.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Fianna Fáil Party, with all respect, that trade unionists are well able to look after their own affairs and this unrealistic approach by the organ of Fianna Fáil to the cost of living will not help anybody.  Even if Fianna Fáil are in opposition, they are still part of this nation, and it would be regrettable if, in their disappointment at finding themselves out of office, they should behave mischievously to the danger of the economy of the nation.  I do not think they really mean to do that.  I do not believe it is deliberate on their part.</P>

      <P>I was referring to the cost of living and pointing out that the cost of living is relative.  I think I have shown, to the satisfaction of Senator Kissane, that the rate of progress in regard to increasing the cost of living was better under Fianna Fáil than it has been under the inter-Party Government.  I have also shown, I hope, to Senator Kissane's satisfaction, that the farming community, whom he has very much at heart, has enjoyed more ample compensation in relation to increased prices under the inter-Party Government than it did under the Fianna Fáil Government, the Party the Senator supports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Seanad for the way in which it has <Col N="1746" /> dealt with this Bill and for the expeditious consideration it has given to it. There have not been many matters raised which call for any deep or widespread reply, although some points have been raised which ought to be cleared up, from the point of view of providing the necessary elucidation for the Senators interested in these matters.</P>
      <P>Senator Kissane painted on a rather wide canvas this evening.  He dealt with a number of matters, some of them under general heads, and I will deal with these general heads later.  At this stage, I will deal with the rather particular problems which he raised as far as coal is concerned, for example.  In respect of coal, we were able to get during the current year a greater allocation of coal from the British Coal Board than was provided for originally.  In addition to that, the British Coal Board were able to give us an increased allocation of anthracite coal; and I must say that, during the past 12 months in particular, the British Coal Board have co-operated, as far as supplies are concerned, in a spirit of goodwill and with the desire to help in every possible way.</P>
      <P>We have, as the Senator knows, an agreement with the British Government, known as the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement, which was negotiated by the last inter-Party Government&mdash;a very valuable trade agreement as far as the farming community are concerned and also as far as the industrial community are concerned.  Under that agreement, the British have undertaken to make available to us not less than 1,570,000 tons of coal each year and to do their best to meet any demand in excess of that tonnage.  They have supplied not only the quantity stipulated in the agreement, but have provided the excess demand of our additional requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the problem of coal prices, and everybody knows that the British themselves have been in difficulties in respect of coal, having, in fact, to import coal from America and pay a much higher price for it than the price of the coal which they mine at home.  That has impacted adversely upon us and <Col N="1747" /> the whole question of the prices now charged for coal by Britain is the subject of negotiations between the Irish Coal Importers' Association and the British National Coal Board.  These discussions are proceeding and it would be unwise at this stage to make any reference to what is likely to emerge from the discussions.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington raised the question of the new Tea Bill, and wonders why its duration was fixed at two years.  The reason is that the purpose of this Bill is to continue the present pattern of tea importation, namely, to restrict the importation to Tea Importers Limited.  But it is hoped that, before the two years expire, it will be possible to introduce a permanent Bill dealing with tea purchases. The new Bill&mdash;the Bill ultimately to be introduced&mdash;may not follow the present pattern, and therefore, it is desired to allow the present pattern to continue, until such time as such care has been given to the proposed new Bill as will enable us to evolve a Bill which will be part of our permanent tea importation legislation. That is the only purpose of the Bill now before the Dáil, namely, to stereotype the present position, until such time as we get a really good Bill which will fit the pattern of our future tea purchases.</P>
    <P>As far as the review of tariffs is concerned, I indicated last year, and in 1954 as well, that I had asked the Industrial Development Authority to review the application and the operation of tariffs in all the tariffed industries. That review has been proceeding and reports made by the Industrial Development Authority, which involve alterations in the tariffs, have been published from time to time.  The Industrial Development Authority have not been able to devote as much time to it as I originally intended they should, due to the fact that they have had to spend a very considerable amount of time in endeavouring to enlist the co-operation and interest of foreign industrialists to come here to Ireland to manufacture goods which are not at present produced here. Because this work of tariff review is high-grade work and has to be dealt <Col N="1748" /> with largely by the same people as are engaged in seeking foreign technical investment in this country, it has not been possible for them physically to overtake the expanded task in discharging these two substantial functions at the same time.  However, the Industrial Development Authority does continue to undertake these tariff reviews and some of the reviews are at present proceeding.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas raised the question of a speech I was reported to have made in the United States.  I have seen some appalling emasculations of speeches which I made there.  I have seen, in fact, a speech which I made there, an actual copy of which was handed to the Press representatives present, a second copy of which was delivered from here to the Irish News Agency and a third copy of which was supplied here to the news agency by the Government Information Bureau. Three of these copies were correct, one as delivered, two as supplied. The two correct copies as supplied were in the Irish News Agency.  The third one was one which represented a speech I made at Washington, and a copy of it as delivered was handed to an American journalist whose function it was to communicate it to a news agency, to the Irish News Agency here.  And, because he misread the speech, he gave the whole thing a completely opposite slant to the slant which it had when I delivered it. Although there were two correct copies in the news agency and one incorrect copy, I was so unlucky as to draw the incorrect copy, which was published as representing my speech, whereas the two correct copies correctly reported me, but, unfortunately, it was the incorrect copy that was set.</P>
    <P>I did not say, of course, that there was no control of profits here.  What I did say, in endeavouring to sell the advantages of Ireland to American industrialists to manufacture here goods which we do not produce ourselves, was that, if they established industries in Ireland to supply markets outside&mdash;markets which they now supply from the United States&mdash;they could feel assured that the Irish Government did not desire to control <Col N="1749" /> any profits they made on an export market, and that is one of the advantages for any industrialists starting here.  That applies not only to American industrialists, but we have extended it to Irish industrialists as well.</P>
    <P>I come now, Sir, before I finish, to Senator Cogan.  The Senator appeared to have a long memory this evening and quoted what I said on this Estimate last year.  He charged me with saying that he had spoken on behalf of many Parties.  I have a recollection that Senator Cogan himself pleaded he was an Independent.  He subsequently endeavoured to organise the Farmers' Party.  It failed.  We know he tried to establish a Ratepayers' Party.  Then he felt rather chilly in his isolated position as an Independent and he decided that he would join one of the two major Parties in the State, and he selected the Fianna Fáil Party as the one which should get his allegiance and, I suppose, what he promised, his abiding loyalty.</P>
    <P>The Senator quoted some speech which I made, or he said I made, during the last election and it would not, therefore, be inapposite if I quoted something from one speech which the Senator made.  When the Senator joined the Fianna Fáil Party, it was quite clear that no references were asked for as to his past performances. That is borne out by the fact that, speaking in the Dáil at column 29 of the Dáil Debates, Volume 110 of 18th February, 1948, Deputy Cogan, as he then was, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When this chapter of Irish history comes to be written it will carry as its title &lsquo;The Downfall of de Valera&rsquo; because responsible historians of the future will attribute the main cause of that downfall to the desire of the outgoing Taoiseach to concentrate all power in his own hands and to his refusal to share with other Parties the task of building up this country.  We all know that no democratic nation depends for its existence or its future upon the whims of any one man.  Outside that group that the Taoiseach has formed around himself we know there are men in this country who love freedom and justice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1750" /> Then he went on and I quote him again.  This is Deputy, now Senator, Cogan, talking:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Just as King Herod sought to destroy an Infant rival so Eamon de Valera sought to destroy a new Party in the field.  He failed to destroy that Party completely but he has succeeded in destroying his own. When I tried to instil into the mind of that senile delinquent, the Minister for Local Government, some sense of responsibility and when I reminded him of the danger of a midwinter election which would inflict a grave injustice on a large section of the rural population by depriving them of their right to vote, I was told by that gentleman that I was suffering from cold feet.  He will have plenty of time now to cool his own feet and I suppose that to-day he bitterly regrets that he did not try to cool the feet of his chief when that gentleman started pawing the ground looking for fight.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And Senator Cogan, then Deputy Cogan, goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But, during his political career, the Taoiseach has eaten enough of his own words to choke an elephant and it would not do him any harm if he were to eat his words again and agree to come into a Government under the leadership of Deputy John Costello.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And all this is underlined by this final declaration of Senator Cogan: &ldquo;I have taken a stand consistently in this House since 1939&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think it was Emerson who said that consistency was the hobgoblin of little minds, and, on the basis of that speech, contrasted against the background of the speech which the Senator made here this evening, I think Senator Kissane will concede that Senator Cogan cannot be accused of having a small mind.  Certainly he has shown a most expansive mind.  Having made that speech he now fondly embraces the Deputy whom he described as a &ldquo;senile delinquent&rdquo; a few years ago.  Indeed the Deputy has a power of mastication at least as good as that which he attributed to Deputy de Valera some years ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1751" /> There must have been a very touching reconciliation in the Fianna Fáil Party when Deputy Cogan, having called Deputy MacEntee a &ldquo;senile deliquent,&rdquo; went in and said: &ldquo;Now we are all together.&rdquo;  A little modesty on the part of Senator Cogan would not be out of place when he comes to discuss matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>Then the Senator accused some member supporting the Government of wanting to impose penalties on the farmer.  I do not know of any person who wants to impose penalties on the farmers.  The whole country has shown clearly that it desires&mdash;and the Government also desires&mdash;to help the farmers in every possible way.  The only person I know who wanted to punish the farmers as viciously as he could was a Dáil colleague of Senator Cogan, Dr. Noel Browne, who, in the Dáil, declared that the farmers did not, in fact, own the land; that they were there as trustees, and, if they did not till the land in the way he wanted them to do it, then the land should be taken from them and given to others to till.  That is the only voice ever raised in this country on the side of punishing the Irish farmers.  It was left to Dr. Noel Browne, an ill-starred colleague of Senator Cogan, to make that threat against the Irish farmers.</P>

      <P>It is usual, when quotations are made of speeches by members of the other House, that the reference be given.  I expect the Minister will provide the reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  It was, in fact, provided in the Dáil last evening by Deputy Michael O'Higgins.  I will supply the reference.  I now want to come to the main burden of the criticism from the Fianna Fáil Party but, before doing so, let me deal with one other point in regard to Senator Cogan.  Senator Cogan thought that bread prices ought to have been reduced. We have held bread prices steady.  They are still steady, notwithstanding the fact that Senator Cogan's Leader in the Dáil prophesied about six weeks ago in Kerry that bread prices would be increased the following week.  They were not.  In any case, <Col N="1752" /> if there is any one Party that ought not talk about bread prices, it is the Fianna Fáil Party, because, on the files in the Department of Industry and Commerce, there is a report of an interview which took place between the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, and a certain miller-baker in this country.  The interview took place on 18th December, 1952.</P>
      <P>This is part of the interview and Deputy Lemass, Minister for Industry and Commerce, is the person who is speaking: &ldquo;I took advantage of Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s visit to ask his opinion on bread prices.  He said that we blundered in July last when adjusting flour prices after the Budget changes by giving the bakers too large a profit margin.&rdquo;  In the case of his own firm, the miller-baker said that the profit margin on batch bread was inordinate. This is the view of a miller-baker of the way the Fianna Fáil Government treated miller-bakers and bakers generally after the Budget of 1952.  The miller-baker says: &ldquo;The profits of my firm are inordinate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The last paragraph in this memorandum made by Deputy Lemass, Minister for Industry and Commerce, states that he, the miller-baker, said his firm and other bakers in his view could all stand a lower profit.  Here is a miller-baker confessing that all the miller-bakers and all the bakers could stand a lower profit.</P>
      <P>It is clear Senator Cogan did not know about this when making references to bread prices this evening.  Is it not inconsistent, if not hypocritical, that the Party which provoked from a baker the charge that his profits were too high, thanks to the way he was treated by Fianna Fáil, should now pretend it has an interest in reducing the price of bread to the bread consumers of the country?  There is the document. It can be read in full by anybody who wants to read it.  If there is any responsible demand, I will table it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that prices have gone up since we came into office.  Nobody denies that.  We do not deny it.  When we came into office, the first figure we saw during our period of office was an <Col N="1753" /> index figure of 126.  The figure was 124 in mid-May: we were not in office then. The first figure we saw was 126 points. That was the mid-August figure&mdash;the first figure published after we went into office.  We were not in office when the previous figure was taken.  In any case, I do not mind that difference at all.  The figure had risen to 131 in mid-November. That represents an increase of five points, or, if you like, an increase of seven points over that period.  When we left office in May, 1951, the cost-of-living index figure was 109 points.  By mid-May, 1954, when Fianna Fáil were still in office, it had gone up to 124 points&mdash;an increase of 15 points during that period.</P>
    <P>The Korean War broke out during our period of office.  The whole world was endeavouring to stockpile: remember the experiences of the Second World War.  Naturally, that impacted on prices, particularly of commodities we had to import.  It must be quite clear to any reasonable mind that a small country such as Ireland, with a buying population of 3,000,000 persons, including children and invalids, could never hope, by its buying capacity or its organised buying strength, to be able to keep world prices at a level to suit the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Prices have gone up with us, but not nearly as much as prices went up under Fianna Fáil.  The difference between us and Fianna Fáil is that, in 1952, the Fianna Fáil Party need not have increased prices.  They deliberately slashed the food subsidies, as the Central Bank advised them to do the year before, in order to make commodities dearer and, as a result, they increased the price of tea, bread, butter, sugar, flour and the prices of a whole variety of other commodities such as tobacco, cigarettes and beer were also increased.  But the main increase in these cases took place because the Fianna Fáil Party deliberately slashed the food subsidies and need not have done that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait a second.  Let me come to that.  On promises, you have <Col N="1754" /> a reputation quite unique in that field. One of the points in the 17-point Fianna Fáil declaration of 1951 was that Fianna Fáil would control prices and maintain the food subsidies.  That was said in 1951.  Twelve months after that, the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;the very Party which promised the people it would control prices and maintain the food subsidies&mdash;slashed the food subsidies in a very vicious way.  As a result, the cost of living catapulted high.  They failed to control prices; they failed to maintain the food subsidies. By deliberately pushing these prices&mdash;because they could have controlled them&mdash;they debased the standard of living of every person who depends on wages, on a salary or on a fixed income which he is not able to adjust.  That was the deliberate policy of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1952. After the 1952 Budget, the conditions of the people deteriorated substantially.</P>
      <P>We did not deal with the problem of a rise in the cost of living in that way. We have not been responsible in a single instance for pushing the prices higher than they were 20 months ago. We have done our best against world circumstances to control the cost of commodities, but there have been circumstances outside our control.  Coal is an item which is used in most manufacturing industries.  An increase in freight rates, an increase in the cost of metal goods of all kinds, impacted on our economy.  Trade unionists have wanted to get back some of the standard of living which was filched from them by Fianna Fáil under the 1952 Budget.  Where they got that back in the form of increased wages, that also impacted in some measure on the cost of manufacturing commodities. But we did not deal with the problem in the way Fianna Fáil did.  If prices had to rise, we said the way to meet that problem was to adjust incomes so as to give the people compensatory purchasing power.  That is what has happened over the past 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position to-day is&mdash;and Senator Kissane can confirm this by reference to the Central Statistics Office&mdash;that the real value, and not the money value, of wages and salaries is higher <Col N="1755" /> than the purchasing power of these wages and salaries in 1954, because the money increase and the buying power of that money has increased to a greater extent than has the cost-of-living index figure in the meantime. We have permitted the free play of all collective bargaining between employers, on the one hand, and trade union organisations, on the other.  That is as it should be in a democracy.  I know there are people in the Fianna Fáil Party who have a Napoleonic mind in this matter and feel that they can think out for the community better solutions than the community can think of for themselves and that, even if the community could think for themselves, they should not be allowed to do it.  The attitude is that the superior minds in the Fianna Fáil Party can think better for them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Kissane will remember October, 1947.  In that month, we had two speeches in the Dáil.  Deputy Lemass said the Government regarded as essential the control of wages.  They regarded it as essential to prevent wages from rising. He said that if the trade unions would not consent to a voluntary control of freezing of wages, then the Government would introduce legislation to do so.  In order to give him authority for that statement, Deputy de Valera, the then Taoiseach, came in and said the Government regarded it as essential to impose a limitation on the increase in wages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he said it on 10th October, 1947, in the Dáil.  I quoted it last night in the Dáil and I could not draw a murmur of protest from the Fianna Fáil Benches, because it is true.  In any case, I do not need to rely on that.  Deputy Lemass did not make idle threats.  He went back to the Department of Industry and Commerce, having made that speech, and, with his own hand, wrote a two-page memorandum directing the Department to produce for him at once a wage freezing Bill.  He indicated what <Col N="1756" /> should be done in the Bill&mdash;all in his own handwriting.  Having signed what he wrote, he put in this postscript: &ldquo;The penalties should be severe for transgressions.&rdquo;  The Bill was subsequently produced.  There is a copy of it in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I shall be happy to give the Senator a copy of it, if he wishes to inspect it.  In that Bill, the fines for transgressions were fines of £500 for each offence.  What was the offence?  The chief point was that an employer could not give a worker an increase in his wages over and above the level fixed by the Bill.  What level did the Bill fix?  It set out a schedule of the increases which could be given without transgressing the terms of the Bill.  What was in the schedule?  It provided that if you had £5 a week in 1939, you could only get an increase of 50 per cent. on that.  The cost of living increased by 84 per cent. between 1939 and 1947.</P>
      <P>I put this to Senator Kissane as a fair-minded man.  Does he think it is fair to treat Irish workers in this way? Heaven knows, they were not millionaires on an income of £5 a week in 1939 but, if the cost of living rose by 84 per cent. between 1939 and 1947, is it not blatant dishonesty to say to them that you will prevent their employer from giving them anything more than 50 per cent. over and above that? Even if the employer wanted to give them 60 per cent., in compensation for a rise of 84 per cent., it was an offence. If he gave it to one man, he could be fined £500 for doing it.  I do not know whether Senator Kissane has been made aware by the Party managers that this was the Machiavellian treatment which his Party had in store for Irish workers.  It is the truth.  It cannot be gainsaid.  This has been quoted on a couple of occasions and not a single member of the Fianna Fáil Party has been brave enough to say that it is not true.  He cannot.  There is a special file in the Department of Industry and Commerce dealing with this whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not dealt with it in that way.  We believe that it is better to let the workers and the employers negotiate matters of this kind. When the present pattern is fully explored <Col N="1757" /> and negotiations take place we can settle down to an atmosphere, in which we can set about arriving, as far as human ingenuity can, at a perfect pattern of wage negotiation which will not do harm to the whole national economy.</P>
    <P>I would have wished, and I have urged it already, that workers and employers could settle down and discuss these problems.  I believe that nothing but good can come from discussions between trade union representatives and the representatives of the employers on these facets of our economic and social life which impact in one way or another on the national scene.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There could be no denial.  I had the document in my hand in October last and I was reading from it.  These are the facts, and when this Government is being reprimanded for not being able to perform miracles which the gigantic nations of the world have been unable to perform in the economic field&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  You give us credit, Senator, for a wisdom we do not claim for ourselves.  I remember the merry old days of 1932 when the Senator's Party had a programme to bring back <Col N="1758" /> the emigrants to do all the work that Fianna Fáil was going to make available for them, and Deputy Lemass then expressed the view that he might find difficulty in getting them all back and might have to comb the United States of America to ensure that enough of them came back.</P>
      <P>I am not denying all the credit for anything that the Senator's Party has done.  A bad part of our life is that we do not give credit to each other for what each has done.  One is, however, inclined to break away from that principle of giving credit when we hear the reckless speeches made by Senator Kissane, and his newly found colleague, Senator Cogan, and remember the speeches made in the Dáil in 1948 on the election of Deputy Costello as Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>I believe that the overwhelming body of the people in this country believe that this Government is doing a good job.  I think they realise that the Government is confronted with a difficult task which springs from things which are outside their control.  I believe that they understand that this Government and country, with its small territory and population and inability to influence world markets, cannot hold back the inflationary tendencies which have manifested themselves in all parts of the world.  The most we can do is to try to insulate ourselves as far as we can against those tendencies.</P>
      <P>I think the people understand that and it is our job to explain to the people what we are endeavouring to do in that field.  Recently, the people have had opportunities of expressing their views on the policy of this Government over the past 20 difficult months, and I should like, in concluding my comments on this Bill, to express my sincere thanks to the people for giving the Government such an overwhelming vote of confidence in the North Kerry by-election.</P>

      <P>This is an unusual procedure, unless a document is challenged. In this case, it is really not challenged.  The Senator is really engaged in research now.  It is a very commendable activity, but the purpose of putting a document on the Table of the House is not to give information; it is to establish the fact of its existence rather than to provide additional mental equipment or more forceful arguments for the Senator.</P>
