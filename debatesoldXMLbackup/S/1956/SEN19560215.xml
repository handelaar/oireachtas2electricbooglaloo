      <P>It is intended to take business as on the Order Paper. The Minister for Agriculture will not be available after 7 o'clock, because the Greyhound Industry Bill is being taken in the other House.  Perhaps, therefore, if it were possible for him to intervene before 6 o'clock on motion No. 8, it would probably be convenient for the House to take it.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter.  A Wireless Telegraphy Bill is being introduced in the Dáil to-day and I understand that agreement has been reached to take all stages.  If that should happen before 6 o'clock, I think it would be for the convenience of the House to bring it in here at 7 o'clock, if there was agreement.  Subject to agreement, that will be taken at 7 o'clock.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(8)  Before making an Order under this section the Minister shall first submit a draft copy of such Order to a committee representative of the growers of wheat with a request that such committee shall express their opinion on such order.</P>
      <P>As this is a very important section of the Bill&mdash;it is, perhaps, the really important section of the Bill&mdash;it is desirable, having regard to the wide powers which are being given to the Minister under this section, that some provision should be included in the Bill to ensure that the utmost consideration is given before these powers are employed.  I assume&mdash;I may not be correct&mdash;that the Orders made under this Bill by the Minister may be annulled by the House, as was the position under the Emergency Powers Orders.  I should like to have confirmation on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, whether that is true or not, the powers are very substantial.  They enable the Minister, not only to fix the price of wheat, but to make Orders in regard to the manner in which the grain may be disposed of, in regard to the marketing and storage of the grain and everything connected with the harvesting, sale and disposal of the crop.  As this is permanent legislation and not merely a year to year enactment, I think this House should be <Col N="1114" /> careful to ensure that the best possible provisions should be included in it.</P>
    <P>The provision which this amendment seeks to make is that, before making an Order under this section, the Minister shall first submit the terms of that Order to a committee representative of the growers of wheat, with a request that such committee shall express their opinion thereon.  The Minister might say that it would be his intention and desire to meet representatives of the growers before taking any decision, but something more is needed than merely meeting the representatives of the growers.</P>
    <P>I think he should lay before them the precise terms of the Order which he intends to make, so that they will know exactly what he is going to do. It would not serve any useful purpose if he were merely to meet the representatives of the growers, hear what they had to say, listen to them with all due courtesy and promise that their views would be considered, because the growers at the time would not be in a position to know what the Minister's intentions were.  I think what happened in 1954 was that the growers, organised and unorganised, woke up one morning to find that an announcement had been made cutting their gross income by 15 per cent., and that Order was made at a time when everybody else's income was being increased.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say: &ldquo;Well, it is all right.  I would be quite willing to meet the representatives of the growers provided I could know who they were and provided there was some machinery for electing such a committee.&rdquo;  That would, perhaps, have been a valid argument up to this year, but, in recent months, a very representative and, I think, formidable organisation of farmers has been established.  There are provisions in that organisation for the appointment of a grain committee to meet and confer which the Minister on matters such as this.  Therefore, I think there is no valid objection on that ground.</P>
    <P>It would, of course, be open to the Minister to say: &ldquo;This amendment, as worded, is not entirely acceptable.&rdquo; I am quite willing to concede that, if the principle of the amendment is accepted, <Col N="1115" /> the exact drafting is not a matter of importance.  What is of importance is that the growers should be informed of the terms of the Order which the Minister is about to make and should have an opportunity of discussing the exact provisions of that Order and of making recommendations thereon.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting&mdash;nor do I think that anybody in this House would suggest it&mdash;that the growers should have the final word.  That would be an impossible position.  In fixing the prices, the interests of the public as well as of the growers would have to be considered.  Therefore, I assume that the only arrangement would be for the Government to have the final decision&mdash;unless, of course, the farmers or wheat growers were to be put in the same privileged position as civil servants who have their incomes fixed by an independent and disinterested tribunal: that is something which might be considered in regard to the fixation of agricultural prices, particularly wheat, milk or anything of that kind.  Pending that, at least in this case, the growers should have the right to have before them, through their representative committee, a draft of the Minister's proposals so that they could express their views as to whether the proposals were right or wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must ask the Seanad to reject this amendment because, in the first place, it is administratively impossible to give effect to it.  The amendment would place a statutory duty on the Minister to submit a draft copy of the Order to a committee representative of the growers of wheat.  There is no such statutory body in existence.</P>
      <P>If you attempted to submit an Order to a body representative of wheat growers, anyone could raise the question as to whether the body to which you had submitted it was, in fact, adequately representative of wheat growers.  In fact, of course, it has always been the practice to discuss the contents of these Orders with growers and with a variety of other interests who are intimately affected by the provisions of the Order.  Section 13 of the Bill provides:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" />&ldquo;Every Order made under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the Order is passed by either such House within the next subsequent 21 days on which that House has sat after the Order is laid before it, the Order shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under the Order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have indicated, it would be administratively impossible to consult a representative of any vested interest affected by this Order in advance.</P>
    <P>I would further suggest to the Seanad that we ought to walk warily in laying down principles that the Oireachtas, or Ministers acting under the authority of the Oireachtas, should ever be placed under a statutory obligation to submit their actions to the vested interests affected by them.  It is a sensible thing for any Minister who is going to make an Order affecting any vested interest, whether it be powerful or weak, to hear the view of that vested interest before making the Order.</P>
    <P>In the last analysis, however, the sovereign authority rests in Oireachtas Éireann and this is the body&mdash;the Seanad, the Dáil and the President&mdash; which is charged with the ultimate duty of legislating for the general good.  It is not open to any individual vested interest to assert a pre-emptive right in a matter which affects a wide section of the community but the provisions of Section 13 of this Bill ensure that if reasonable regard has not been had to the legitimate interests of any group in the community&mdash;however small or however powerful&mdash;it is open to any member of the Seanad or to any member of the Dáil to put down a resolution and call for the annulment of anything that appears to have done substantial injustice to any person high or humble in the State.</P>
    <P>I want the Seanad to be fully assured, however, that it is the invariable practice to discuss the provisions of these Orders with every interest which is affected by them before the Orders are drafted or made.  I <Col N="1117" /> hope the Seanad will agree with me that that assurance, taken with the guarantees contained in Section 13, should prove adequate to ensure against the possibility of substantial injustice being done to anybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like to say that I disagree with the Minister in regard to the impossibility of giving effect to this particular amendment. Administratively, I believe it is possible. Under many Acts passed by the Oireachtas, recognition is given to well-established organisations.  When you have a seriously considered effort to organise the farming community and when that effort has been brought to fruition in the past year through the establishment of a very representative organisation, with every indication of permanence, in my view it would not be doing anything administratively impossible even to ask that the proposed legislation be submitted to a body representative of those people.</P>
      <P>I know it is difficult to frame a section or sub-section to cover this point adequately, but if the Minister would accept the principle that this step ought to be taken, I think the drafting of the appropriate sub-section would not offer any insurmountable difficulties. Here again there could be consultation with the farmers' organisation on the matter.</P>
      <P>The question could be adjourned until the Report Stage, if the Minister so desired, but I think it is time that the principle of consultation should be embodied in legislation.  It is all right for the Minister to say that he will invariably consult with the interested bodies, but I do not think that any representative body of farmers knew of the Minister's intention in 1954 to cut the price of wheat until they heard the announcement over the radio, and I would be extremely doubtful if even the farmers members of the Minister's own Party were consulted in the matter.  I think they received as great a shock as the wheat growers generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister objects to apparently in this amendment is the laying down of a statutory obligation on him <Col N="1118" /> to consult with the interests concerned. I would be inclined to join issue with him on that.  The matter is so important that a statutory obligation should be laid on the Minister or on any other Minister who is likely to occupy that position in the future, because agriculture can never be put in exactly the same position as other interests.  In other interests, you have a small number of very large units, for example, millers or merchants, or any other types of people &mdash; you have a rather limited number of people each with a substantial interest &mdash; but in dealing with farmers&mdash;wheat growers, for example &mdash; you are dealing with 100,000 small people, and if they have taken upon themselves the difficult task of establishing a united organisation&mdash;and they have done so &mdash; that organisation should be recognised in our legislation and that is why I am putting this amendment very strongly to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I was not quite sure of the point in regard to the Order being annulled or not.  It does give a certain safeguard, I admit, and I think that, while I would not be inclined to press this to a division, at the same time, it is a very important matter and I would like if the Minister would consider it, even if it were necessary to defer the Report Stage, in order to give it further consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is, I think, a very reasonable and proper one, namely, to facilitate the Minister in acquiring land for forestry, where possibly the title may not be absolutely perfect, but is, I presume, a sufficiently good title to be accepted by an ordinary willing purchaser.  The intention is to enable the Minister in such a case to negotiate such a purchase and to avoid the long delays that might be attendant on putting into operation the full clauses of the Land Acquisition Act which might involve having to lodge the purchase money in court, and leaving it to the parties to try to get it out after, a course which would cause great expense and which is sometimes quite impossible to succeed in, so that the money might be there for ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that, I think, is quite wise and obviously desirable and reasonable. The point which I wish to bring to the attention of the Seanad and the Minister is the provision that, after the legal officers of the Minister are satisfied that there is a reasonably good title and have paid over the purchase money, if it should prove afterwards that a mistake was made, the person who claims to be the proper owner and who should have been paid can make a claim and be paid within six years. The point that occurred to me on that <Col N="1120" /> was, first of all, that it is possibly a matter of some importance, because what is done in this Bill may form a precedent for what may be done in the future in other Bills in which there is a like power of acquisition by the Minister or a public authority; consequently, it did seem to me that the period of six years named is too short and is perhaps inappropriate.  In the normal course, if lands have been acquired and occupied by the Minister, then although he had not a good title at the outset, he would acquire a possessory title in 12 years.  I would suggest that, during that period of 12 years, it should be open to the person who claims to be the true owner and the person who should have been paid to make his application to be paid.</P>
    <P>The matter will probably arise very infrequently, because I am quite certain that in no case is the Minister likely to pay over to a person who has not such a good holding title that it is likely to be defeated, but it may occur occasionally.  Possibly, too, there might be a point under the Constitution involved, that is to say, that, if the period were not what I might call the ordinary legal period of 12 years, it might be suggested that the result of the section would be that the State was acquiring the private property of a person without paying compensation at all to the true owner.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that the point is one which merits the consideration of the Minister.  To make the period 12 years is probably, in practice, not going to affect more than a very few cases, but the principle involved is important.  If such a change were made, it would not in the least show up the acquisition of land under the Bill.  Of course, it is quite easy to say, &ldquo;Why should not the true owner make his claim in six years?  Is six years not a very long period?&rdquo;  That is so, but cases do arise when people are out of the country and I myself have known such cases.  Therefore, I think it is incumbent that in the Bill the provision should be that the period in which the true owner might claim to be paid should be extended to what I might call the statutory possessory period of 12 years, and not be limited to six years, as it is in the Bill.  That <Col N="1121" /> is the amendment which I wished to move.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment suggested by Senator Cox.  I think that what he says is valid and true.  The owner frequently may be out of the country or otherwise engaged and may not be alive to his legal claims in this matter. I do not really see why the ordinary period of limitation which applies to real property should be shortened in a case of this kind.  The law on the statute of limitations is very clear in this country and the normal period in relation to real property is 12 years.  I do not see why it should be shortened to the ordinary six years which applies in the case of ordinary actions.</P>
      <P>There is before the Oireachtas at the moment a Bill for a new statute of limitations, and I suggest that the time, if there is going to be an alteration in this respect, when it should be dealt with is when that Bill is before the Oireachtas, when the whole question of the limitation period will be debated and discussed.  It could be appropriately altered then in connection with any changes made in the general principle in the statute of limitations.  To bring it in in this stage is, as Senator Cox says, conferring a right on the State and on the Minister greater than it is on the private individual, and is giving the Minister power to acquire title in six years, whereas the private individual would take 12.  That, to my mind, is favouring the State as against the individual, favouring bureaucracy, and against the general spirit of the Constitution. I suggest that if there is going to be a change in the statute of limitations regarding the acquisition of real property, the time to make that change is when the present limitation Bill is being debated before the other House or this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the analogy with the usual statute of limitations in regard to real property is quite sound.  This provision, Section 3 of this particular Bill, is put in for the purpose of expediting the operations of the Forestry Department. From the point of view of the ordinary <Col N="1122" /> layman, it seems to be a provision for enabling more than one person to be paid for the same land.  As I understand it, that is the practical point of view, and I am all for the individual as against the State.  Payment will be made to A for a particular piece of land.  If, within six years, B turns up and proves that he has a better title, he may also be paid.  If he is paid, provision is made under sub-section (3) for the Minister to recover the money paid to A, but one does not need to be very experienced in this country to know that, in nearly all the cases of this kind that arise, the money paid to A will, in fact, be irrecoverable.</P>
      <P>The position is that in the period of six years the State is open to having to pay a second time for land which it already has acquired.  In modern conditions, six years seems to be rather a long time, sufficient for news to get abroad&mdash;certainly sufficient for news to get through this country and in present circumstances for people, say, in North America, the United States and Canada, in England or in Australia to hear that land an individual conceives himself to have a claim to has been acquired for the purposes of forestry.  To leave the position open, where a second payment might be made, for a further period of six years appears to me to be asking rather too much.  If you are going to prosecute forestry on the lines which we all desire, you must take some steps, and one of them is to reduce the difficulties about acquiring proper title to land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision, in fact, is for the reasonable period of six years.  I do not think there is a good analogy with the general situation of the statute of limitations, and in this instance, where we are all interested in getting forestry accomplished, six years is a reasonable time.  It may result in expense to the State if extended to 12 years, which seems to me to be rather too long, considering the matter on its merits and in modern conditions, and considering what used to happen in the days of the sailing ships when even six years was long enough.  In the present conditions, it is a substantial period in which to allow a person to get information <Col N="1123" /> about some transaction dealing, for example, with the farm on which he was reared.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in sympathy with the proposals put forward by Senator Cox and I was anxious to hear Senator Hayes on the matter, but I fear that he has not made a case for the substitution of six years for 12. You are giving a privilege to the Forestry Department as against the individual.  As far as the increased cost that might arise is concerned, that question, to my mind, does not enter it, because, if the Minister was prepared on Report Stage to go back to the original position of 12 years, the State would be put in an advantageous position in regard to the payment of moneys rather than if the period were six years.</P>
      <P>Senator Cox has raised a very important matter also as to whether it would be lawful under the Constitution. We are all anxious to expedite afforestation, but we do not want to rush a step of this kind.  If only one case is involved, we must safeguard the rights of the individual as against the State.</P>
      <P>A six year period would make it more difficult than would the 12 years period as proposed by Senator Cox.  We know that the Minister would put up a proposal against the amendment of Senator Cox, on the grounds that it would hold up the acquisition of lands or prevent planting, but there is no reason why it should do so.  We should see that the rights of the individuals are protected in these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite appreciate the arguments that have been made on this point, but I think that we have provided sufficient safeguards in the provisions of this Bill. For instance there is adequate provision for the payment of compensation to claimants who come along after the land has been acquired.  In this section, we are making provision to make sure that, so long as we are using compulsory powers of this nature, the person from whom the land is taken has been in occupation for six years at least.  He will have to be for six <Col N="1124" /> years in occupation of the land before we will deal with him, and, at the same time, there is a general safeguard for the interests of any other persons who might have a general claim to the farm.</P>
      <P>In the matter of compensation, it is clear that we are being over-scrupulous in safeguarding the rights of any other claimants who might have had a claim to the farm, or to any other portion of the farm.  This section is really safeguarding them.  Some Senators seem to be under the impression that this is a device to give the Minister full title, but such is not the case.  Anybody who goes back to the 1946 Act, and looks at the compulsory powers there, will see that, if the commissioners authorise the Minister to acquire land and the necessary Order is made, that gives the Minister absolute title.  Once the visiting Order is made by the Minister, the Minister has an absolute legal title from then on.  The provisions in this section therefore are merely to safeguard the interests of those who may have a claim to the farms.</P>
      <P>I think we have taken an extraordinary step to safeguard those interests.  This was a serious step to take and was an over-generous step by the State to secure the rights of everybody concerned.</P>
      <P>Senators Cox and O'Brien have made the case for a 12 year period, but if the Senators would look at Part I of the Schedule, which, by the way, is an amendment of Section 3, they will find a provision in paragraph (1) which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In case, within three months after the final determination of the compensation, any person applies to the Minister for payment thereof and&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the Minister is satisfied that that person has enjoyed such interest for a continuous period of not less than six years immediately before the vesting date.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That provision applies to the person in occupation of the land, in the first instance.  The most typical example I can think of is that of the young man who stays at home&mdash;perhaps the youngest member of the family&mdash;while his brothers and sisters go out all over <Col N="1125" /> the world, and, at some later date, the father dies intestate.  That man's brothers and the other members of the family would have a claim to a share of the lands.  Already he is entitled to compensation, if he has been in occupation of the farm for a period of six years.  We will deal with him immediately because he has already been in occupation for six years and we pay him, knowing he has had at least an imperfect title for a period of six years.  The other members of the family then have a further period of six years in which to prove their claim, if any, and in that case they will be paid in relation to that claim.  That actually gives them a full period of 12 years in which they can make their claim.</P>
    <P>We have three precedents for the period of six years provided in this section.  The first is in the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1906, Section 11, sub-section (6).  The next is the Land Act, 1931, Section 34, sub-section (2) and the next is the Land Act, 1950, Section 28, sub-section (9).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1906, was passed by the British House of Commons to enable local authorities to acquire land for the building of labourers' cottages and it says in Section 11, sub-section (6):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any person claiming to be entitled to any money paid to another person pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section may within six years after the payment has been made, on giving such notice as may be required by rules of court, apply for relief in manner provided by those rules to the county court within the jurisdiction of which the land is situate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is one Act which I took as a precedent.  The second is the Land Act, 1931, Section 34, sub-section (2), which deals with the case of lands, whether the Land Commission acquire them by private treaty or on the open market.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the person claiming compensation was under the age of 21 <Col N="1126" /> years on the day on which the purchase money was distributed, within six years after such person attains the age of 21 years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a case where the land was held by a minor and where the Act gives him six years after the date on which he attained the age of 21 to re-establish his claim.</P>
    <P>The next is the Land Act of 1950, Section 28, sub-section (9), which reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a transfer Order is made in respect of any land, the Land Commission shall be liable to pay compensation in respect of every interest (other than an easement continued by the Order or an easement in lieu whereof a new easement has been created by the Order) subsisting therein immediately before the operative date, but no claim for compensation shall be made after the expiration of six years from that date.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are three instances in which I found that a period of six years was provided and, I think, personally, that it is a very generous period for a person to make his claim.  We will not deal with any person, in the first instance, until he has been six years in occupation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me only natural that he would like to be paid.  I should like to refer to the fact again that we are making a precedent here. What we are dealing with is the question of the payment of compensation, because, as the Minister has pointed out, the moment the Minister takes over the land, he gets absolute title. The question of title is not what we are talking about therefore; what we <Col N="1127" /> are dealing with is the question of compensation. The Minister has submitted that they are dealing only with persons who have been in occupation of the lands for six years.  It happens in hundreds of cases, where the person in complete occupation is not the owner and is merely a trustee and perhaps trustee for a child.  Naturally, I am not able to take up at a moment's notice the three Acts which the Minister has cited, but in one of them he referred to the fact that a period of six years is provided for, after the owner has attained the age of 21 years. That might mean anything from 26 to 27 years from the date of the Order.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Act are likely to have other effects and likely to be followed in the case of the Dublin Corporation or similar authorities.  Therefore, I think one should be careful of what is being done in this matter.  Both the Minister and Senator Hayes have submitted that six years would be a reasonable period, but we all know that strange things happen.  I know at the present time of a case in which a certain company was taken over something over 12 years ago and the person now claiming to be the rightful owner has really only now become alive to his rights.  I do think there is a very important matter of principle involved in this and I would hope that, if it is possible, the Minister might perhaps reconsider the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I really assure Senators Cox and Hayes that we have gone as far as we could possibly go in this matter.  We could, of course, give 12 years, but there is really no point in it.  Surely, in these days, when the distances between Canada and Australia and America have become so much shorter, a period of six years is sufficient for a person to know what is happening at home, and I can assure the Senators that it will not be more than a matter of weeks until some kind neighbour or some other member of the family will tell them what is happening, or what a scamp the brother at home is being.  For that reason, I think that six years is an ample time for others to make a claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Bill becomes law, I <Col N="1128" /> imagine there will not be any case in which anybody who has a claim will not come forward within the six years prescribed.  Every possible step has been taken to safeguard the rights of any claimant.  Perhaps 60 or 70 years ago, when travel between countries was much slower, the period of six years might have been regarded as too short, but even then claimants would have no trouble in finding out what the position was.</P>
    <P>There is the type of person who leaves the country and it is very hard to have any respect for their rights. These are the people who go away and leave family, farm and lands derelict and who, because of their claim to those lands, stand in the way of improvements and developments in the district.  I get very annoyed by that type of case, and I feel sometimes that we should have extraordinary powers to take over such property.  I feel very strongly about this matter, but then it probably would not be right to interfere with the rights concerned. At the same time I have little sympathy with persons of that type and I really feel, in cases like that, that such a person should not be allowed to stand in the way of development.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the matter of commonages.  The question I should like to have clarified is the procedure the Minister proposes to adopt in regard to the rights of a group of parties on commonages.  The Minister may decide that a particular commonage is suitable for afforestation and should be acquired.  He may then make the necessary representations to the Land Commission to have this acquisition undertaken.  I want to know what is the procedure for bringing a particular commonage to the Minister's notice.  I think that is important, because, if we are not clear on that procedure, then a number of things could happen in relation to the proposals to acquire a particular commonage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> The section makes various proposals and lays down the principles on which the work is to be undertaken, where a group of holders of a commonage object to the acquisition.  There is provision for compensation by way of reallocation to meet the objector's portion of the original rights in the commonage.  Compensation in cash would be of small value in such a case, where the person usually kept a number of cows on the commonage, and it would be better to have some provision made whereby the Land Commission would take powers, in cases where an objector's rights in a commonage were being taken away, to provide him with other land.</P>
    <P>I fear&mdash;I expressed that fear on the Second Reading&mdash;that the operation of this Bill will make a very small contribution to our afforestation programme. There is also the danger that it will contribute very largely to removing more people from the land.  The small holdings which those people have are not sufficient to maintain them, and, if you take the rights of commonage from them, it may well happen that, in a few years' time, their original small holdings will be taken over.  Whether that would be of national benefit or not is a question which we have not to decide to-day.</P>
    <P>The question of the upholding of the objectors and the giving to them of a holding on the commonage will, to my mind, encourage objectors.  There may be a number of holders who, because of their circumstances, are put in the position to avail fully of their rights in the commonage and who feel that it would be a financial benefit to them to have the land acquired.  But there are others who see the possibility that if the objection of five, six or seven of them are upheld, they will secure a reasonable portion of the land in compensation for their objection.</P>
    <P>On Second Reading, we asked the Minister what contribution this commonage would make to the acreage made available for afforestation.  I feel it will be very small.  I think the Minister admitted in the Dáil that he has not got the figure.  That being so, we have a very vague idea of how this <Col N="1130" /> whole Bill is going to operate.  I should like the Minister to clarify the procedure he proposes to adopt.  The principles are laid down in the Bill, but we are still not aware of how the Minister is going to make up his mind as to how he is to get the information, whether it is by representations made by one or a number of holders of the commonage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hawkins wants to know what line the operation of this particular section will take. This section is for the purpose of acquiring commonages or part of commonages. The position is that, where some person or persons say they are prepared to sell their interest in the commonage and notify the Department and the Minister for Lands that they are willing to sell it, the forestry inspector will inspect that commonage and appraise it for what it is worth from a forestry point of view.  If he recommends acquisition to the Minister in that case, the Minister applies to the lay commissioners for an acquisition order for the whole of the commonage, despite the fact that one, two, three or four people may be objecting to such acquisition.  The commissioners must publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, and in the newspapers in the area in which the commonage is situated, a notice giving due prominence to the fact that acquisition of the commonage is proposed just as they do in regard to the acquisition of land for the relief of congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who do not wish to sell then can employ a solicitor or send a letter, which does not even require a three-penny stamp, to the secretary of the Irish Land Commission, saying that they are objecting.  Incidentally, the commissioners may refuse the application for the acquisition order for the whole of the commonage, particularly if there are six, seven, eight, nine or ten who are not anxious to sell for forestry purposes.  The commissioners then, after hearing the case made by the objectors, may, if they do not refuse the acquisition order altogether, partition the commonage and give the objectors a fair share.  There is nothing wrong about that.  That is the way the machinery will work.  The <Col N="1131" /> first part of Section 4 of the Bill deals with cases where two or more people object to their share being taken up. If two or more object to their shares being taken up, the commissioners may give the portion they are giving in common to the objectors.  They would grant a sole right in the case of one objector.  The rights of objectors are very carefully safeguarded in this section, so much so that I am giving the commissioners power to refuse the acquisition order, even where people are willing to sell for forestry purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Minister's statement I take it that in no case, except where the holders of the commonage rights make an application, either individually or in a group, to the Land Commission to have their lands acquired, will proceedings be taken under this Bill to have the commonage acquired for forestry purposes? There is no such provision in this particular section.  The only provision there is is for the Minister to make representations.  What worried me was from where should come the initiative.  You must have the goodwill of all the people concerned, if this matter is to work successfully.  My worry is that, if the Minister decides on making representations to the Land Commission for acquisition, without some section of the holders on a particular commonage being agreeable, and on their having already made the necessary representations, the section will not be as workable as it would be under the procedure outlined by the Minister, as being the procedure that will be adopted.  I should like to see that procedure incorporated in the Bill, so that, as soon as the Bill becomes an Act, what I or the Minister will have to say will be done will not matter, but what is in the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is probably afraid that people other than the owners of commonage may initiate proceedings and whisper into somebody's ear that such a commonage should be taken over for forestry purposes. Suppose that I, for some well concealed desire, wished to let loose the forestry inspectors on commonage <Col N="1132" /> owners like a pack of hungry wolves seeking to devour what land they could and suppose I did so, no action could be taken under this section, unless the people themselves were willing to sell. Or, suppose an inspector has a roving commission and sees a particular mountain which he says should be acquired, again nothing can be done. If the people are not willing to sell, the forestry application would be open to rejection by the Land Commission. The Minister would apply to the commissioners for an acquisition order.  Suppose now that only two out of ten of the tenants who have a right to the common are willing to sell? If the Minister makes an unreasonable proposal surely three commissioners will not lose their sanity at the same time?  They will say: &ldquo;We will not make an acquisition order.  We will not allow the Minister to confiscate their common, when they do not want to sell.&rdquo;</P>

    <Title>Price of Wheat&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Eireann is of opinion that in view of the substantial decrease in the total area under tillage as a result of the reduction in the price of wheat last year and having regard to the increased cost of production it is essential that the price of next season's crop be increased.&mdash; (Senator Cogan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this motion.  This is not a Party question; it is a national question.  In my view, the best case that one can make this afternoon in support of this motion is that which has already been made by the persons most concerned, that is, by <Col N="1133" /> the deputation who waited on the Taoiseach and put the importance of the subject matter of this motion before him.  The result was that, having heard their arguments, the Government decided to make a somewhat belated and very small increase in the price, regardless of the fact that, when the Minister brought about the reduction of 12/6 per barrel, we were told in this House that the price then fixed by him would be in operation for a period of two years.  The Minister said on that occassion that his action was not because he was not in favour of the growing of wheat.  All the old arguments were abandoned.  No longer did we hear that the soil of this country was not capable of growing wheat; no longer did we hear that it should not be encouraged.  The reason advanced by the Minister was that he was taking that step in order to discourage people who took conacre in a very extensive way in the Midlands and who, by availing of the then price, made somewhat large profits.  I do not know whether such a large number of persons of this type engaged in the production of wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not one of those people who have a terrible disregard for the conacre system, such as the Minister seems to have.  In some circumstances, the conacre system is an essential part of Irish life.  It has saved many a holding and maintained it during a difficult period.  Many things can happen to a family and the conacre system can then be availed of.  For instance, the head of the family may become ill and may not be able to attend to the farm for a considerable time.  Again, he may die and his widow and young family may not be able to look after the farm.  In such circumstances, it is a great relief when somebody comes along and takes that land in conacre for a number of years.  I have known quite a number of farmers in my part of the country who farm conacre in grassland, that is, for the raising of live stock, and there is no serious objection to that type of conacre although it is not at all as beneficial as the type of conacre under which the land is taken from the landowner because the landowner may not be able <Col N="1134" /> to undertake the tillage at the particular time.</P>
    <P>The action of the Minister was, no doubt, effective inasmuch as it did bring about a reduction in the acreage of wheat and of tillage in general.  If it had the effect the Minister desired, and which he expressed to us here, of reducing the then acreage of wheat and having the farmers change over to the production of barley, oats, potatoes or any other farm crop, the picture might not be so black, but the result of the Minister's action was not alone to reduce considerably the wheat acreage, but also to reduce the acreage devoted to crops of practically every kind.  Once the farmers felt that the Government did not advocate a policy of going ahead with tillage, it seems that their reaction was to slacken off in production in general, and the aim the Minister had was not achieved and will not be achieved while that seems to be his approach.</P>
    <P>Arising out of my earlier remarks, we have the position that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and practically every member of the Government are now engaged in a campaign of drawing our attention to the national necessity of cutting down imports and of trying to even up our balance of payments.  As a result of the action of the Minister for Agriculture, we have been compelled to import wheat, maize and other feeding-stuffs that could have been produced here in Ireland, if the inducement had not been taken away from our farmers. The direct effect of that is not so much the effect it had on the farmers as on production in general.</P>
    <P>During the worst period for farmers in our lifetime, 1947, when all the other cereal crops were beaten to the ground, everybody will admit that wheat was the one crop that stood up best, which proves that it was not the nightmare to the farmer which many speakers up to then had suggested it was.  All these old slogans as to the land of this country being unable to produce wheat were dropped and then something new arose.  We were told about the difficulties of making a good loaf from Irish wheat, but I was pleased recently to see that that has also been blown to the winds by experiments <Col N="1135" /> carried out in Sweden, so that, one by one, we have got around to the idea that it is good national policy to encourage our farmers to grow food for man and beast in this country.  You cannot do that in the face of actions of the kind taken by the Minister, when, after the bad year the farmers had, he reduced the price of wheat and reduced it as drastically as he did.  If the evil which the Minister sought to eliminate was there, it could have been dealt with in many other ways rather than in the way the Minister approached it.</P>
    <P>This motion has been on the Order Paper since last November.  I feel that this question of wheat, like many other questions, should, if at all possible, be taken out of the realm of politics and out of the realm of discussions of this kind.  I should like to see set up some organisation&mdash;and I think it could be set up, with the assistance and goodwill of the Minister&mdash;now that the farming community have been organised as they were not previously organised, somewhat on the lines of the Beet Growers' Association, so that agreement on prices and so forth could be negotiated between it and the millers, and so that some facilities could be made available in the way of the provision of essential fertilisers, as is done by the Sugar Company for the people under contract with them.  Now that we have agreement&mdash;it may have taken a long time, but it is worth it&mdash; that it is a good thing to grow our own foodstuffs, we should set about having an organisation of this kind set up.</P>
    <P>I quite agree that, where the general community interest is involved, Parliament must at all times, play a very prominent part in negotiations on prices that may arise as between the bodies concerned, but these are matters which have been very satisfactorily dealt with by the Sugar Company, as between it and the beet growers.  If we had an organisation similar to that to deal with this question of wheat, it would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will hold out a hope that some arrangement will be made for giving a greater increase than he has given.  If the price was <Col N="1136" /> justified in 1953, having regard to the increase in rates, in wages and in general farming costs, but, in particular, the increase in the price of fertilisers, a more substantial increase in price should be offered than has been offered.  It has been stated by many of these people that the offer made by the Minister to them is more of an insult than an encouragement, in view of the many increases which other sections of the community, except the weaker sections who have no means of fighting for themselves have secured over the year.  The farming community, particularly in regard to this question of wheat, are the only section who seem to have been picked out for a reduction rather than an increase.</P>
    <P>The Minister not so very long ago gave a guarantee that there would be no such thing as an increase in the price of fertilisers.  The reason advanced by the Government when they gave the increase of 2/6 per barrel quite recently was that it was to counteract the increase in the cost of fertilisers; but that 2/6 would not meet the increased cost of fertilisers, and nobody&mdash;not even the Minister&mdash; can argue that it would meet the increased cost the farmer has to meet in every other item of his expenditure. It would not meet the increased cost of labour or the increased costs that every section of the community have to meet and in respect of which they have got advances in remuneration of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>When we talk so much about encouragement and having more production, the Minister would be wise if even at this stage he recognised that the action he took last year in reducing the price&mdash;it may have got rid of the spivs and others who, he said, came in here and took conacre&mdash;had the very drastic effect of reducing the acreage of tillage and also reducing the acreage of every other crop in the production of which farmers are engaged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must not trespass upon the patience of the Seanad by recapitulating all the discussion that took place here on a previous occasion on the <Col N="1137" /> general question of wheat prices, but I direct the attention of the Seanad to the fact that, since his motion was set down, certain events have transpired. The motion sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann is of opinion that in view of the substantial decrease in the total area under tillage as a result of the reduction in the price of wheat last year and having regard to the increased cost of production it is essential that the price of next season's crop be increased.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On representations having been made to me that the farmers had to contend with certain increased costs, the Government, on my advice, since this motion was introduced in Seanad Eireann, did decide to increase the price payable for wheat this year by 2/6 per barrel, which increase, in my judgement, will fully cover the increased costs which farmers may have to undertake this year.</P>
      <P>I heard Senator Hawkins describe that as an insult.  That insult is going to cost the Treasury £350,000.  Anyone who wants to insult me by giving me £350,000 will be very welcome to do so as soon and as often as he pleases.  It is right for the Seanad to bear in mind that a conservative estimate of the differential in favour of home grown wheat as compared with wheat of corresponding quality which is being imported from Australia or from the Pacific Coast of America is 15/- per barrel.  That means that a farmer growing wheat here is getting £6 per ton more for his wheat dried on the mill floor than we could buy that wheat,, for delivery on the same mill floor, from Australia or the Pacific Coast.  £6 per ton in the price of a commodity costing from £24 to £34 a ton is no small measure of differential. I am very glad they should get it, but it would be quite illusory to dismiss from our minds the very relevant fact that we have decided that they will get a differential of that size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder have Senator Hawkins and Senator Cogan forgotten the decision taken by the Government constituted by the Party to which they now belong?  I think it is something about which I must refresh the memory of <Col N="1138" /> the Seanad.  The Government of which Mr. de Valera was Prime Minister in 1954 recorded the following decision on January 22nd, and that decision was communicated to the Department of Agriculture in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am to refer to memoranda dated the 18th instant submitted by the Minister for Agriculture and by the Minister for Finance and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wish the Seanad saw the contents of those memoranda, and if they did we would hear less of the monolithic unanimity of the Fianna Fáil Government and of the dissension that is alleged to exist in an inter-Party Government. I am a long time in an inter-Party Government, but I never saw memoranda of such ferocious dissent as I have seen in connection with these memoranda addressed to the Department of Agriculture:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am to refer to the memoranda submitted by the Minister for Agriculture, by the Minister for Finance and by the Minister for Industry and Commerce relative to the policy of the growing of wheat and to inform you that the Government at a meeting held to-day the 22nd January, 1954, decided that the general aim of policy in regard to the growing of wheat should be to require an annual mill intake of 300,000 tons of dried native wheat, and that the Departments concerned should forthwith consult together immediately with a view to finding solutions of the problems concerning transport, drying and finance likely to arise to ensure that adequate facilities will be provided on a permanent basis for the handling in future years of an annual crop of a magnitude represented by a mill intake of 300,000 tons of wheat.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to ask the proposer and seconder of this resolution how did their Government propose to limit the annual intake to 300,000 tons of dried wheat?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember that in their policy of 1948 they advocated compulsory tillage, and I assume that in 1954 they were returning to their old love and that they proposed to ration the acreage among the farmers.  If they did they should tell us now how they proposed to do it.  The policy of this <Col N="1140" /> Government is founded on a different principle, and that is that we do not propose to tell any farmer how to run his own holding.  We propose to leave it within his right to get from his holding the maximum return his land is capable of yielding for himself, his wife and his family, always provided that he will leave his land in autumn a little better than he found it in the spring.  To that end we sought to provide what was a fair and equitable price for wheat which would yield a profit to those farmers who chose to grow it, and not only to yield a fair and equitable margin but a guaranteed market, with a certainty that whatever quantity was grown would be bought.</P>
      <P>How shall we test conclusively whether the profit to be earned from growing wheat at 72/6 per barrel is calculated to yield a competent farmer a fair margin of profit on the work he does?  I suggest that the only reliable test is to inquire what are prudent farmers paying for conacre for land up and down the country this year in the knowledge of what has been fixed as the price.  I have conacre rentals here. In the County Carlow up to £32 per acre, Irish measure, is being paid for conacre for wheat this year.  According to Senators Cogan and Hawkins they are fearful that a farmer who sows wheat on his own land would not have a fair return for his labour, but there are farmers in County Carlow, Senator Cogan's neighbours&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is the only word I can use to describe it, and I apologise to the Seanad for the necessity for having to traverse so fantastic a proposition. In Louth £32 an acre has been paid for conacre on which to grow wheat.  In Tipperary up to £24 10s. an acre, in Kilkenny up to £30 an acre for conacre.  How can any rational man, offering his own certificate that these are the best farmers in Ireland, say that they are paying those prices and then go on and argue that when they grow it on their own land they cannot make a living on it?</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear the Senator pay that courteous tribute to the excellence of the agricultural policy of the present Government. Was there ever a higher conacre rent paid in this country than under an inter-Party Government?  The land of Ireland has at last become of value to those who own it, and those of us who helped to make them owners rejoice accordingly.</P>
      <P>Somebody said something about grass and cattle.  In despite of all the <i>Irish Press</i> and the Fianna Fáil Party can do, they cannot smash the price of cattle, because this Government has put a bottom to it.  The dirtiest, rottenest, foulest campaign that has ever been run in this country has been run by the Fianna Fáil Party and their &ldquo;Pravda&rdquo; the <i>Irish Press</i> to wreck the farmers of this country, and force them to sell their cattle to Fianna Fáil tanglers who are trying to make dirty money out of it by buying cattle cheap from farmers whom their own rotten ring has deceived into believing that the price of cattle has gone down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price of cattle will not go down and nothing that Fianna Fáil can say will bring it down.  I advise the farmers to recognise Fianna Fáil and its rotten rag for what they are.  They are at the same old game again.  They want to bring the farmers of this country to their knees, so that they can walk on them in the future as they <Col N="1142" /> did in the past, but, thank God, they have a Government now that will not let them do it.  My advice to the farmers is: do not sell your cattle at Fianna Fáil prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So I thought.  Senator Hawkins referred to the desirability of producing all the barley we required. I cordially second his view.  He will have noticed that, in the five-year plan which I ventured to propose to farmers recently, I suggested that we should grow all the barley requisite to replace all our coarse grain imports of every description on our own land.  The price of pigs is being subsidised and there is a further assurance that no farmer <Col N="1143" /> who has a surplus of barley to sell will have to take less than 40/- per barrel for it.  I would emphasise that the true aim of the expansion of the tillage of coarse grain is to persuade the farmers to grow all their own coarse grains, but even so, over and above that, the farmers whose circumstances require them to grow an acreage larger than they can conveniently convert into live stock can be assured that in respect to any surplus they wish to dispose of they will receive not less than 40/- per barrel for it.</P>
      <P>It is right to direct the attention of the Seanad to another fact, a fact which is constantly overlooked.  I feel a certain delicacy about trespassing on the time of the Seanad to repeat facts to which I think I have already drawn Senators' attention.  Sometimes it appears to me that these facts are overlooked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In evaluating the price payable for wheat, it is a very relevant consideration to bear in mind the average yield per acre, not by any basis of estimation, but measured by a yardstick of actual delivery to the mill. Here are the facts.  I must apologise for trespassing on the time of the Seanad to give a comprehensive statement of these facts.</P>
      <P>In 1944, the average yield per statute acre, expressed in terms of mill intake, that is to say, the quantity of wheat delivered to the mills from each statute acre of wheat, was 9.5 cwts.  I am speaking of cwts., and not of barrels. In 1945, the average was 10.7 cwts.; in 1946, it was 9.8 cwts.; in 1947, it was 6.3 cwts.; and that was the very wet year; in 1948, it was 12.3 cwts.; in 1949, it was 16.7 cwts.; in 1950, it was 14.2 cwts.; and in 1951, it was 13.2 cwts. I would direct the attention of the Seanad to the fact that I am speaking of cwts. and not of barrels as is commonly done in referring to wheat. In 1952, it was 15.7 cwts.; in 1953, it was 18.5 cwts.; in 1954, it was 16.85 cwts.; and in the past cereal year of 1955, it was 18.9 cwts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In assessing the price payable for wheat, we have got to bear in mind <Col N="1144" /> that not only has the price increased from what it was in 1947 to what it is to-day, 72/6 per barrel, but the average yield per statute acre has risen as between 1947, which was an abnormally low year, from 6.3 cwts., not barrels, per statute acre, to 16.85 cwts. in 1954, which was every bit as bad a year as was 1947.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am glad the Senator has come to realise that in the period referred to the yield has increased per statute acre by something like 150 per cent. to 200 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an argument which the Senator will seek to impose on the Seanad, but, judging from the quality of the Seanad, I think he will have pretty tough going in his attempt to make that case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When the yield was only 6.3 cwts., the cost of production must have been three or four times the cost when it was 18.5 cwts.  Perhaps, if it were put at two and a half times as high, it would be reasonably accurate. I think I have already mentioned that the 2/6 per barrel extra will represent £350,000 more for the farmers, on the assumption that the acreage and yield is approximately what it is this year. I would ask Senators to bear in mind that, while the acreage of wheat has declined from 662,000 acres in 1945, we are getting almost the same yield to-day from 357,000 acres of land.  In effect, while we had 662,000 acres of <Col N="1145" /> land under wheat in 1945, the yield was 2,837,000 barrels.  In 1954, we had 486,000 acres under wheat and the yield was 3,286,201 barrels.  This year, the yield will be close up to 2,500,000 barrels from 357,000 acres&mdash;and that, the House may be interested to know, is about the same as what we got in 1944 from 642,000 acres.</P>
      <P>I expect that, in this year, from 357,000 acres we will get as much wheat as we got from 642,000 acres in 1944.  I have not the slightest doubt that at the present time wheat pays the farmer who grows it a very fair margin of profit.  We have to bear in mind that diversification is an important thing in our circumstances.  It is known to us all that there exists in the world at the present time a very large surplus of wheat.  In many parts of the United States of America at the present time, wheat is being stored in the open.  If the existing stocks of wheat in the United States of America and Canada and Australia were released for sale, the world price of wheat would fall forthwith by about 50 per cent.  Even taking the present artificial world price, which is being maintained by very careful restriction of sales by large world producers, the price payable to our farmers averages about 15/- per barrel higher than the world price for wheat of similar quality.  Fifteen shillings a barrel represents approximately £6 per ton. I think it would be improvident and, indeed, bad practice to widen that differential further than has already been done.</P>
      <P>I believe that, in the last analysis, the economic salvation of this country depends upon the prudent exploitation of the only natural resource of consequence with which our people have been endowed by God.  The only natural resource of consequence on which our people depend, in the last analysis, for their living is the land of which we have approximately 12,000,000 acres which can be deemed arable.  If we cannot get out of that an income sufficient to provide an adequate livelihood for our people, the plain fact is that our people will go elsewhere to get that livelihood and they would be damn fools if they did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this Government is to <Col N="1146" /> get from the land of Ireland&mdash;for nowhere else can we get it&mdash;a standard of living sufficiently high to ensure that all our people will have an opportunity to live in their own country in circumstances of modest comfort.  With the total natural resources of which we are possessed, we can never hope for more than that.</P>
    <P>Every other economic activity in this country ultimately depends on the success or failure with which we exploit the resources of the land.  Our aim, then, is to get from the land the maximum return that it is capable of yielding for all our people.  To that end, I have suggested&mdash;with the authority of the Government to which I belong&mdash;that we should embark together upon a five year plan of mixed farming, exploiting to the limit the potentialities of the land of Ireland for all our people.  I believe that any Government, seeking the whole-hearted co-operation of all its people, should have due regard to the strongly held views of minorities as well as of majorities.  I believe that whatever the economic implications of growing wheat may be, there is a substantial minority in the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>One hundred thousand farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who believe passionately in the desirability of growing wheat.  It is philosophically and politically wrong for any Government to trample on the deeply-held sentiments of any minority and, although the bulk of the wheat grown in this country is grown by relatively wealthy farmers east of the Shannon, I think it is a prudent and sensible thing to provide them with a secure market at the expense of their neighbours, within reason.  I believe that the market that they at present enjoy represents a fair guarantee, albeit at the expense of their neighbours, for a profitable husbandry founded on the growing of wheat.  I have no hesitation, in all the circumstances, in recommending the maintenance of a price 15/- per barrel higher than the world price, out of respect for the views of those who are deeply attached to this type of farming and because I believe that, on the whole, this method of tillage can profitably be integrated in a wise system <Col N="1147" /> of husbandry in this country.  I have no doubt whatever that, on the basis of the present price structure, we will get a fully adequate supply of wheat from the competent farmers of Ireland.  I do not think it is right to ask that the consumer or the taxpayer should find more money than they are at present finding to subsidise this particular crop.</P>
      <P>I believe that, in the last analysis, the economic survival of this country depends on the successful and provident exploitation of the resources represented by our 12,000,000 acres of arable land.  I hope, in the course of the next five years, that we shall be able to raise the cattle population on that land, the cow and heifer population, to 2,000,000.  That will make a substantial and real contribution to the standard of living of our people.  I hope that, within the next five years, we should be able to render ourselves independent in respect of supplies of coarse grains from our own resources. I believe that that will further contribute to the standard of living of our people.</P>
      <P>I believe that the growing of wheat will be a continued charge upon the resources of the State, because, to get it grown here, we will have to continue to pay 15/- or 20/- a barrel for it above world prices.  I do not think it is altogether the fault of the Irish farmers.  I think it is the fault probably of world economy, because, in the wide prairies of Canada, the United States and Australia, mass production of wheat is so highly mechanised and so highly developed that they can produce it at prices which, in the absence of their wide spaces and the intensive mechanisation those wide spaces make possible, no other nation can match.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that in a civilised democratic community every decision of a Government should be dominated by nothing but the cold logic of economics. Whether we like it or not, there is a considerable body of farmers in this country who have a deep attachment to the growing of wheat, who believe that the profession of farming is <Col N="1148" /> incomplete, if it does not, in the course of its normal cycle, produce its quota of wheat.  So be it.  In a well ordered democracy, profound respect should be entertained by any prudent Legislature for the strongly held legitimate prejudices of any minority, be it small or great.  Therefore, I think our Legislature does wisely in saying: &ldquo;So be it.  If these feelings are deeply entertained, we can afford them and we will, accordingly, take measures to make it economically possible for those who wish to grow wheat to grow it and to find a market for it.&rdquo;  Whether in the cold light of pure economics, one can justify that decision, in our circumstances, is something on which I would not care to record a final opinion at this stage.</P>
    <P>But there is no use in closing our eyes to the fact that Divine Providence has ordained that the average annual rainfall in this country is 42 inches. There is, so far as I know, no other country in the world with an average annual rainfall of 42 inches which seeks to grow wheat for human consumption. In Norfolk and the eastern counties in England, the average annual rainfall is below 25; in Denmark, Holland and western Europe it averages 22 to 23 inches.  On the prairies where wheat is becoming the dominant crop of the new world, the average annual rainfall is of an entirely different pattern from that experienced in our part of the world.  But I agree that the strict rule of economics cannot always condition the somewhat more variegated patterns of political men and, thanks be to God, in this country we have not yet degenerated to the deplorable status of economic robots.  We are still political men and women; we have feelings and we are entitled to look to our Government to consider not only our narrow economic interest but also our human prejudices and sentiments.</P>
    <P>I hope that it is from that enlightened approach the present Government have fixed a price of 72/6 per barrel for wheat.  We do not pretend it is an economic price, but we believe it is a price that our people can afford to pay and get fair value for it, albeit that part of the value perhaps must be accepted in the form of the contentment <Col N="1149" /> enjoyed by a minority of our farmers who have a possionate attachment to this crop.  I think it is wise Government.  I do not think that you can govern human beings by the arid laws of economics.  I think that disaster awaits you if you forget that such laws function, but equally, disaster must encompass you if you accept them as your only guide.</P>
    <P>We seek to take a middle path, and, while recognising that, in a country with an annual average rainfall of 42 inches, we should look to live stock and live-stock products as the principal source of our national revenue, it is not impossible in these circumstances to grow cereals, but it is extremely difficult.  If I recall to Senators our national experience in 1954 and 1947, I am sure they will agree with me that, in those years, the growing of satisfactory cereal crops was a very great burden to the farmers who had to undertake it.  If I recall that all our economy depends ultimately on our capacity to export agricultural produce, I think Senators will agree with me that it behoves us all, if we wish to get for our people a steadily rising standard of living, to make the maximum use, on optimum lines, of every acre of land that we can bring into production.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say this: the deadly error into which an overenthusiastic Minister for Agriculture can fall in this country is the belief that he is a better judge than each individual farmer as to how best his land can be exploited.  The only people in this country who can get from the land of Ireland its maximum economic production are the farmers who, under our blessed dispensation, purchased at great cost, own the land.  They hold it from no landlord other than the Lord Himself.  We are one of the few countries in the world to-day in which we can say that the humblest farmer holds his title direct from God.  In that happy state of absolute ownership of land, it seems to me that the function of a prudent Government is to bring within the reach of those who own the land and live upon it the means of using it to the best advantage, so that thereby we can get from it the maximum return, in the knowledge <Col N="1150" /> that, in the last analysis, every individual in this State depends for his livelihood on what comes from the land.  All we buy from abroad must be paid for with what comes from the land, and our common experience and knowledge is that, if we do not export the produce of the land, we have not the means wherewith to buy the imports which we require for industry and other means of employment for our people.</P>
    <P>We can afford to go a certain distance in meeting the moderate prejudices of traditional farmers with a passion for a particular crop, but we have got to remember every day and every hour of every day that, in the last analysis, the standards of life of everybody in Ireland depends upon the success with which we exploit the resources of our own land, and that success must be measured in the wealth which we can extract from that land, always ensuring that we leave that land in autumn a little better than we found it in the spring.  Too long in this country did our people labour under the hideous illusion that you can mine your land of all its inherent riches and squander the proceeds and then return to the land in the hope of getting a living from it still.</P>
    <P>Now, I think our people have awakened to the fact that the land's capacity to carry the people depends on the care of the farmers who own the land&mdash;remember that we are the only farmers in Europe to-day and almost in the world who can claim to own our land&mdash;the care with which they keep it in heart and rehabilitate it after they collect their crop.  If we divert the land from those methods of husbandry best calculated to get from our farms the maximum income which the land is capable of yielding, always provided that there is a margin left to make it a little better in the autumn than we found it in spring, we dig a pit into which the whole nation must fall.  We can afford to encourage certain forms of agriculture dictated by deep-felt prejudices, but the bulk of our agricultural operations must be founded on the rock of economics.  If it be taken off that, we should all perish in bankruptcy.  There is no <Col N="1151" /> other source from which the Irish nation can draw the essential wherewithal to survive economically.</P>
    <P>I think we are dealing with this wheat situation within the limits of prudence.  I believe that the 12,000,000 acres of arable land we occupy can bear this burden and still retain a profit margin sufficient to provide for all our people a moderate standard of living on their own land. But I do ask the Senators to remember that the inevitable incidence of this heavily subsidised crop falls in the richest counties in Ireland, and for every million of money Oireachtas Éireann determines to distribute in this subsidy, £7 out of every £10 finds its way into the pockets of relatively well-to-do farmers.  Less than £3 goes into the pockets of the small farmers of Ireland.  West of the Shannon there is little or no land on which wheat will grow.  The bulk of it will be found in East Cork, Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Kildare, Louth, Westmeath and Meath.</P>
    <P>I do not deny that I was brought up amongst the congest farmers of the West, and I do not conceal that, in my work as Minister for Agriculture, these neighbours are ever present to my mind.  I cannot forget, if I wanted to, that it was mainly they and their exertions that made the land our own. From this benefaction, they received nothing, and those who fought so hard to make the land our own and who themselves to-day live on ten or 15 or 20 acres of it, get no share of the £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 that this subsidy of the price of wheat disburses amongst the farmers of our wealthier counties.  It is on the produce of all the farms, large and small, that this nation ultimately depends.  I think that on the whole we can afford this provision, but we can only do it so long as the farmers of all the land of Ireland have a chance to live.  The small farmers are getting nothing.  It is for the big man that wheat grows, and they will do reasonably well out of the provision that is being made this year.</P>
    <P>I am thinking of the little farmers who have to produce the cattle and <Col N="1152" /> the pigs and the oats and barley which truly constitute the exports of the land of Ireland.  If these should dwindle town and city and country will perish in this land of ours.  I am prepared to justify the burden we put upon them in this proposal, but not a penny more, and I want to say to the relatively wealthy farmers who will benefit by this dispensation that I do not think they are doing badly out of the 72/6 which their relatively less prosperous neighbours will have to pay.</P>

      <P>Thank you very much. The Minister last year, when making the case for drastically cutting the price of wheat, based that case on four great falsehoods.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is running away from these four falsehoods.  He has dropped three of them and he is running away from my reply, because he realises he has been found out. Where now is the case that the Minister made last year about speculators in wheat?  There is not one word about speculators or any mention of them in the course of this debate, because the Minister knows that it has <Col N="1153" /> been proved to be completely wrong. There has not been one word in this debate, or any word by the Minister, of the alleged negotiations that Fianna Fáil made with wheat exporters which would compel us to import 270,000 tons of wheat.  We knew at the time that that accusation was false and that there was no such obligation in actual fact and the Minister has admitted that to-day.</P>
      <P>Again, the Minister referred last year to the danger of a wheat surplus in this country, a danger that we may have an export surplus of wheat.  In actual fact, during the past year, instead of exporting wheat, we have had to import over £4,000,000 worth from the United States of America, at a time when the balance of payments is running heavily against this country and when our balance of external trade is one of the most serious things that the Government has to consider.  The only point, one of the four points which the Minister made last year in support of the cut in wheat prices, to which he adhered in this debate is the accusation that Fianna Fáil intended to reduce the acreage and to reduce the price of wheat.  Yet, for two years, the Minister has undoubtedly searched the files of the Department of Agriculture and of every other Department and has failed to find any evidence or any suggestion that Fianna Fáil intended to reduce the price of wheat. All he found was an assertion that Fianna Fáil was aiming at a minimum of 300,000 tons of millable wheat delivered to the mills.  Was there anything wrong in that?  There was no decision by Fianna Fáil to reduce the acreage of wheat, nor was there any decision to reduce the price and the Minister has failed absolutely to find any evidence of such suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Fianna Fáil intended to do was to ensure that this country would be made mainly self-sufficient in the matter of bread cereal.  Fianna Fáil never intended to produce wheat for export.  It intended to ensure that this country would be independent of imports from external sources of supply, and I think anyone who judges the position fairly will maintain that, in so doing, Fianna Fáil was not <Col N="1154" /> only serving the interests of the farming community but the best interests of the nation as a whole, because it does not matter what the world price of wheat is to our community, if we can produce sufficient wheat at home for our needs and pay our farmers a fair price for it.</P>

I have answered the point as to what Fianna Fáil would have done if there had been a danger of an exportable surplus of wheat in the foreseeable future.  What they would have done in those circumstances would have been to encourage the growing of other cereals or root crops, such as potatoes, thereby giving an incentive to the farmers to grow more of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of compulsory growing of wheat during the period of the emergency was not a matter of disagreement and even the Fine Gael Party, in its worst days of depravity, agreed with that policy during the emergency right up to 1948. That was the main point on which the Minister depended when he made the case for a reduction in the price of wheat.  He then stated that Fianna Fáil were committed to a reduction of the price and of the acreage.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure the Minister will in future drop it as he dropped the other three excuses which he put forward for cutting the price of wheat last year. He has got some little consolation in the fact that some farmers in some counties pay a high price for conacre. It is hard to imagine that a Minister for Agriculture in an agricultural country such as this could be so ignorant of agricultural conditions that he would not know what causes a high price to be sometimes paid for land in certain areas.  Is it not the result of acute land hunger?  For the Minister to say that the fact that people sometimes pay excessive prices for land to grow wheat is a justification for the reduction in the price of wheat would be the same as for one of the old landlords in the last century, when there was acute land hunger here also, to base his case for increasing the rents on unfortunate tenants, on the fact that some tenants were quite willing and appeared to be quite happy to pay those excessive rents.  Anyone who understands agricultural conditions will know that in many cases people who pay excessive prices are driven to do so by economic circumstances.</P>

      <P>There are quite a number of farmers who lost money last year in taking grassland.  I hope that will not happen again, but some of those farmers have been forced by the circumstances in which they are placed to pay high prices this year again. This matter is not governed entirely by economics.  It is governed sometimes by social conditions.  There is only a certain amount of land and the area cannot be increased.  There is <Col N="1156" /> only a limited area offered for letting each year.  There is a very large number of applicants for that land and competition inevitably forces up the price beyond what is economic.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We would like to hear some practical farmer, such as Senator Burke, giving his explanation of the position.  I will admit this, in fairness to Senator Burke, that there are certain exceptional cases in which a farmer may pay a fairly high price for exceptionally good land in order to grow wheat, in the hope of reaping a small margin of profit, but, remember, the estimated yields that are given to us are average yields.  Some yields are much lower.  Some unfortunate farmers have to take lower yields, but there are some lands where the yields are very high, and, if you have an exceptionally high yields, such as 24 or 25 barrels per Irish acre, you can pay a very high price for conacre.  That shows how fallacious, to use the Senator's expression, it is to rely upon conacre prices as an argument in favour of cutting down the price of wheat.  I am quite sure that if Senator Burke stood up at any meeting of the National Farmers' Association or Macra na Feirme and made the case that wheat should be cut because of the high price paid for conacre, he would be laughed out of the room because his argument would be absolutely and completely silly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Another point the Minister made, and laboured for some time, as justification of the reduction in the price of wheat, was the increase in yields over the years.  Now, if we examine the figures, we will find that the increases have not been very steep, particularly since the period of the emergency ended.  It is true that, during the emergency period, estimated yields, or yields of wheat delivered to the mills, were relatively low, but we must remember that statistics are very <Col N="1157" /> unreliable.  There is now no incentive for providing misleading figures as there was during the emergency, when every farmer was compelled to put 10 per cent. of his land under wheat and when there was naturally an incentive, perhaps, not to give the accurate acreage, or to exaggerate the actual acreage he had grown.  That incentive disappeared when compulsory tillage went, so that the figures since 1948 would, therefore, be more reliable.</P>
      <P>There is not such a very wide difference between yields now and in 1948 and 1949.  Whatever increase is taking place, it may be readily agreed, has been due to an enormous increase in the utilisation of fertilisers.  People who, prior to the war period, used perhaps very little fertilisers on their grain crops are now using up to 6, 7, and 8 cwts. and, in some cases, up to half a ton per acre.  That increase in the use of fertiliser has inevitably had a very marked effect on the yield secured and it has also had a very big impact upon the cost of production.  If a farmer has to purchase £6, £7 or £8 or £9 or £10 of fertiliser per acre in order to grow his crop, that must be added to the cost of production, and, for that reason, it is not a true comparison; nor is it a sound case to base the reduction in the price of wheat on the fact that farmers have, by good farming and intensive manuring, stepped up output per acre.  It is penalising efficiency, if you like, and is entirely unjustifiable.  In 1954 the Minister for Agriculture crowned the farmers of Ireland with a cut of 15 per cent.  This year, he has graciously crowned the wheat grower with half-a-crown and we are asked to regard that half-a-crown as a wonderful concession given to the farming community by a gracious and kindly Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows that the representatives of the farmers' association met him and proved conclusively by figures which could not be disputed that, since the price of wheat was fixed at 82/6 in 1953, the cost of production had increased by 16 per cent.  The Minister did not dispute those figures. They cannot be disputed because the farmers' association went into the matter in detail, went into every item <Col N="1158" /> of costings and they proved that the increase in the cost of production had occurred, but, notwithstanding the fact that that increase occurred, we have been given a reduction of almost 15 per cent.  We are asked to regard that as a wonderful concession to the farming community by a gracious and kindly Government.  I am sick and tired of hearing the Minister say that wheat is a political crop and that the only people that grow wheat in this country are the supporters of Fianna Fáil.  I wish they were.  I wish that every man who grew wheat was a supporter of Fianna Fáil.  Senator Burke contradicted him openly and showed us that there is at least one wheat grower in this country who is not an enthusiastic supporter of Fianna Fáil, but I do not agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister annoyed Senator Burke by saying that the fact that he grew wheat made him a Fianna Fáil supporter.  He was so annoyed that he bounced out of the House.  A genial and kindly Senator like Senator Burke should try, if possible, to put some sense into the Minister's head.</P>
      <P>The growing of wheat is not a political issue and a farmer does not grow wheat because he is a supporter of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.  He grows wheat as a part of his farming operations&mdash;a very useful part.  Let it be clearly understood that, so far from accepting the Minister's assertion that the growing of wheat causes a deterioration to agriculture and a cutting down of output, the opposite is the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's whole case was based on the contention that he would only tolerate wheat because some people had a sentiment for it, but that good farming practice demanded that we should grow oats, barley, and particularly grass, rather than wheat and that he was just tolerating the growing of wheat because some Fianna Fáil farmers wanted to grow it.</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that wheat fits in very well into our crop rotation. Wheat with a guaranteed price enables the farmers to carry on a certain percentage of tillage on their land which, without wheat, it would be impossible to carry on.  In carrying on a rotation of tillage on the farm, land is freshened up as it would not be under permanent pasture, notwithstanding our heavy rainfall to which the Minister referred.  It is absolutely absurd to base the case against wheat upon our heavy rainfall because, if the rainfall prevented us from growing wheat, it would have the same effect on the growing of oats and barley which are far more subject to damage by rain than wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the worst year which many of us remember, 1954, wheat stood up to the continuous torrent of rain for weeks on end, whereas the barley and the oats <Col N="1160" /> were beaten flat into the ground, so that it is a fallacy to claim that wheat is more subject to destruction by excessive rain than any other crop.</P>
    <P>Not only has the Minister failed, but he has not even tried to convince farmers, particularly wheat growers, that the cut in the price of wheat which he imposed in 1954 was justified. He has failed to convince anyone that the injustice he inflicted on the agricultural community in that year has been rectified by this gift of 2/6 in the coming year.  Every factor which has been brought to his notice proves that the farmer was entitled to at least a continuation of the price which prevailed in 1954.  Farmers would be rather reluctant to press for an increase in that price, having regard to production costs, because farmers are not an unreasonable body.  Everybody realises that it would be in the interests of our national economy if prices could be stabilised at a reasonable level.</P>
    <P>Farmers are not the kind of people who would try to enforce an inflationary policy on the Government, but, on the other hand, they are not the kind of people who should be expected to tolerate a grave injustice inflicted, as I say, on pretences that were without basis or foundation.  As I indicated, three of the excuses the Minister gave for cutting the price of wheat last year have now been dropped.  They have been proved to be without foundation and they have been ridiculed out of existence by the farmers and by the farmers' representatives who have met the Minister again and again.</P>
    <P>Nobody now dares stand up anywhere and say there was widespread speculation in land for wheat growing or that there was widespread taking of land by foreigners.</P>

      <P>Anybody in favour of an increase can vote for the motion. Senator Hayes says it is no trouble to Fine Gael Senators to vote against any increase for farmers, but they have a great deal of trouble in voting against any increase for any other section of the community, strange as it may seem.  Perhaps the farming community, and I am including in that term the farmer members of the other Parties, do not exert all the power they should.  It just shows us that at least a number of people in high places think that farmers are the one section of the people who can be trampled upon and imposed upon and who can have their incomes drastically reduced, <Col N="1162" /> without any valid case being put forward in support of that reduction.</P>

      <P>On many occasions, the Minister for Agriculture has told us to forget about this savage reduction in the price of wheat, to forget about the fall in the price of cattle that has taken place in the past three or four weeks, to forget about the fall in the numbers of live stock, to forget about the fall in the acreage under tillage <Col N="1163" /> and the increase in the acreage of grass, to forget about all his faults and failures and to join him in a five year plan which guarantees the farmer nothing whatever, except that the Minister will indulge from time to time, as he did to-day, in a little patronising patter.  The five year plan and the parish plan are the things the Minister advocates now, but, only a few years ago, he was telling us that the one thing he detested was plans or attempts by anyone to plan his life or the life of the country.  His only plan now for the wheat grower is to compel him to accept a price for his wheat which is lower than the price paid to wheat growers in every other country in Europe, with the exception of two.</P>
      <P>Why should the Irish farmer who is tilling his land and growing wheat be forced to accept a standard of living lower than that of the French peasants, lower than that of the peasants of Germany, of Austria, of the Balkan States, lower than that of any farmers in Europe, simply because the Minister for Agriculture has a deep-seated prejudice against the growing of wheat and cannot get over that prejudice? The Minister seeks to represent the people who grow wheat, not as practical farmers, but as people who have a prejudice in favour of growing wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking as a practical farmer, I want to say that farmers have no prejudices in regard to crops or stock. They will grow any crop that suits their land and yields them a modest profit.  They will keep any type of live stock that pays them for their toil and <Col N="1164" /> enterprise.  However, they expect a fair deal from the Government of this country.  They feel that, now that farmers are organised on vocational lines, the Minister for Agriculture should be prepared to meet the representatives of vocational organisations, such as the National Farmers' Association, and settle with them the price policy for each successive year, as is done in Great Britain and in every other moderately civilised country. Here, however, we unfortunately have a Minister for Agriculture who wants to make political capital out of every issue, who claims that wheat is a Fianna Fáil crop&mdash;a political crop, if you like&mdash;in regard to which some people have prejudices; but in that case he is speaking only for himself.</P>
    <P>We have a Minister for Agriculture who stands on public platforms throughout the length and breadth of the country and claims credit for every increase that takes place in live-stock prices and unloads the blame for any decrease that occurs upon his opponents. I ask the House to accept this motion with or without whatever reservations Senator Hayes may have at the back of his mind.</P>

    <Title>Decentralisation of Industry&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That this House is of opinion that the policy of the Government should be actively and urgently directed towards securing the decentralisation of industry and administrative control generally throughout the country, and, towards securing as far as it is found practicable henceforth the diffusion of sites for new industries throughout the provinces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment of this debate, I was dealing with a few points made by Senator O'Brien.  Senator O'Brien, on this particular motion, has taken up an extraordinary attitude, namely, that nothing whatever should be done to interfere with the normal flow of industry in whatever direction circumstances influence it.</P>
      <P>I will quote, in order not to be accused of misquoting, exactly what he said.  In column 606 of the Seanad Debates of 9th November, 1955, Senator O'Brien said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The point I want to make is that both types of protection&mdash;national protection and local protection&mdash;are really distortions of the natural pattern of localisation, in which industry would be directed into the area where it would naturally be directed because the cost of production in the area is below what it would be somewhere else.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In other words, he is making the case that no steps should be taken to divert industries away from wherever a potential industrialist feels inclined to place them.  In other words, if an industrialist wishes to locate his factory in the Dublin City area or somewhere adjacent to Dublin, because of all the natural advantages there, the State should not intervene to induce or encourage him to go elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not say the State should not intervene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what he did say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Read it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator wishes to controvert that, I will quote other extracts from his speech to confirm that particular point.  He stressed the advantages of Dublin:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There are other advantages perhaps even more important than those&mdash;a good water supply, good drainage and sewerage, good supplies of power and light.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of quotations I could give.  He seeks to establish the viewpoint that industry should be allowed to find its location normally, rather than be directed or induced elsewhere.  But the Government's predecessors in office took an entirely different view and they sought, by legislation, to divert industry elsewhere, and in the Undeveloped Areas Bill <Col N="1167" /> they provided certain rather strong incentives to manufacturers to go west of the Shannon, to certain defined areas known to be congested. There was at the time, and has been since, a considerable amount of criticism of that legislation, on the ground that it was ineffective.  I do not think it has been completely ineffective, and even since this motion appeared on the Order Paper, we have heard of a fairly substantial industry being established in one of the western towns. It would seem to indicate that the inducements that were provided in the Bill are having, slowly but surely, an effect, and potential manufacturers, seeing the advantages, are inclined to avail of them.  That is, of course, what anyone might expect.</P>
    <P>I think Senator O'Brien is quite wrong in his statement that we are distorting the natural picture, as he said, by inducing industry to go elsewhere than Dublin.  I do not think that the tendency on the part of industrialists to come to Dublin is what could be regarded as a natural tendency.  It is, if you like, a distortion brought about not so much by natural advantages, natural geographical or geological advantages in Dublin City as by political events.  It is true that the port of Dublin has a certain attraction, but so, too, have other ports.</P>
    <P>Dublin was historically selected as the political centre of this country, first by the Danes, then by the Normans.  It was almost by external forces, if you like, but it was established as the centre of government, and, being the centre of government, it naturally attracted money and wealth and a certain amount of security in troubled times.</P>
    <P>The result was that industries moved in that direction and that tendency has been aggravated since the establishment of this State, because now, with our own Government, with all our Departments centralised in Dublin, there is a big circulation of money in the city that leads business people to move into that area and industrialists follow.  There is a very large consuming <Col N="1168" /> public and a large volume of available workers in the city.  The tendency is, on the whole, undesirable if pushed too far.  It is all right to have a fairly substantial capital city in a small country such as this, but we cannot allow the whole population of the country to be concentrated in this one capital city, and already the tendency has moved altogether too far.  I think Senator O'Brien is a voice crying in the wilderness when he seeks to persuade us to leave things as they are and not to take action to prevent that tendency.</P>
    <P>Another extraordinary development occurred which cuts across the whole purpose of this motion, if the viewpoints expressed were accepted.  I am referring now to a statement made by the Minister for Agriculture in Rome as reported on 9th November, which, by a remarkable coincidence, was, I think, the same day as that on which the Seanad was discussing this decentralisation motion.  He said, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent:</i></P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the United States and the British Commonwealth were to take the lead in establishing a new commonwealth, with guarantees of free passage of men, money, and goods, we could forget about the world surplus.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that is an expression of governmental policy, we may not only forget about the world surplus, but forget about the Irish nation, because if men, money and goods are to be freely exchanged, I am greatly afraid very few men, money or goods would be left in this country.  The country would be flooded with foreign goods from the big industrial centres of Britain and America.  The men and the money would be forced out of the country, and we would have a very peaceful, unoccupied and deserted nation here.  There would be no population left to make any trouble.</P>
    <P>At any rate, taking the matter seriously, if that policy were to be put into operation, it would force the population down to about half of what it is at present.  That would be the natural result.  However, it is not clear yet whether that Minister was expressing governmental policy or his <Col N="1169" /> own peculiar views, and that is a matter that is required to be cleared up.  If I might refer to this as James's Epistle to the Romans, I hope it will be commented upon, perhaps, by the Parliamentary Secretary because it certainly is against everything that this motion seeks to establish.  This motion seeks decentralisation of industry and population, and that decentralisation can only be brought about by governmental policy in inducing and encouraging the wider distribution of not only industry, but agriculture and administration.  Under the heading of decentralisation, agriculture, industry and administration must be considered, and I will deal with them in that order.</P>

      <P>I do not want to comment on Senator Burke's interjection, because he might get offended and go out, and I would not like that.  I think he does not really understand the position.  Senator Walsh discussed decentralisation in regard to land at a considerable length and in a very constructive way.  It was also, if it may be remembered, discussed by the Commission on Population and Emigration, and Most Rev. Dr. Lucey commented at considerable length on the concentration of agricultural population in a few areas known as the congested districts and the complete depopulation of very large areas throughout the country.  He did suggest that it should be Government policy to promote better and more even distribution of agricultural land.  Decentralisation arises in regard to agriculture. Every farm is, if you like, a small factory, where the soil, in the first place, is converted into plant food and the plant food, again, is converted into animal produce.  It is desirable that those agricultural factories should be widely and evenly distributed over the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to, but I do not intend to make this point, that it is desirable to have a higher standard of living amongst those who are living and working on the land in order to promote the decentralisation of manufacturing industries, because if you have a prosperous rural population in any particular area there is an encouragement to a manufacturer to set up his industry there, since there will be a number of prosperous consumers for the goods he produces.  On the other hand, agriculture may also be directly related to decentralisation in this way: some of the industries most desirable at the present time are industries which process agricultural produce, and, therefore, a higher degree of efficiency, better credit, better distribution of the land, though I cannot mention that, would lead to the establishment of more small rural industries. I will pass then, from agricultural decentralisation and move on to industrial decentralisation, which is possibly the main feature of this motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>At least it is implied. With regard to industry, I have indicated that the Undeveloped Areas Act was a step in the right direction.  It is yielding results.  I do not think those results can be expected to occur in one week or one year, but they are certain to develop, and we may take it that, as a result of the inducements offered, new industries will spring up in the areas that are so favoured.</P>
      <P>Those of us who do not live in what are known as the undeveloped areas cannot help feeling a little perturbed, in as much as there will not be a tendency for potential manufacturers to go outside those particular areas where State aid is given.  I think, therefore, that the main factor for the promotion of those industries outside those particular areas is local effort and local finance, as far as possible.  I think it will need a tremendous effort to induce people in our provincial towns and in small villages to think seriously about the development of productive industry in their centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, unfortunately, a long tradition of disinterestedness, or perhaps hostility, to industrial development here, and that tradition has to be broken down.  It is a tradition which does not exist in Britain, where normally every young man has had skilled employment, and it is his ambition to have a factory of his own.  I had experience some time ago of meeting a young Englishman and his one ambition was to start a factory, though he had very little capital.  He had, however, the spirit of enterprise. He interviewed some officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce and told them of what particular line he was thinking.  They told him that the line he was thinking of was already overdone in this country and how much he was up against, if he followed it.  He did not allow it to affect his ideas and he established in a small way an industry here which has continued to grow, slowly but surely.  That just shows that, if we had more of this type of person in this country, enterprises would spring up here and there throughout the country. That particular industry has been established in a small village where <Col N="1172" /> there is not much employment or natural advantages for young men.</P>
    <P>I think that, in this matter of promoting new industrial developments, the technical and vocational schools could play a leading part, in that they could inspire their students with a desire to help in the promotion of new industries.  They could, if you like, create a public opinion among the young workers in favour of such industrial development.  They could do a very useful work in that sphere, and, in addition, they could give their students the technical skill that is essential in the promotion of potential industries in their areas.</P>
    <P>There has been in recent weeks or months a development which may or may not cut across this whole policy of decentralisation.  That is the tendency to encourage foreign capitalists to come in here and establish industries.  It will be, I believe, extremely difficult to bring these industrialists to the areas where we think they should go. As a matter of fact, if a potential industrialist from abroad is to come here, it will require a big effort on the part of the Government to ensure that he will not add to our problem of over-centralisation, so I think that, if that development takes place, the strongest pressure should be put on such manufacturers to locate their industries in areas where it is desirable to have them from the national point of view, rather than centre them more in one big area.</P>
    <P>The same thing would occur to any Government in regard to our sea ports. I think the policy of the Government should be wherever possible and as far as possible to ensure that foreign goods being imported or goods being exported should be to see that ports other than the port of Dublin are utilised. Without taking unduly from the city, it would be wrong to centre all the shipping of this country in the port of Dublin.  Therefore, all the harbours along our coasts which are quite suitable should be promoted.</P>
    <P>One of the methods by which decentralisation could be carried out effectively is through the larger State companies.  While it is not always possible in the case of private enterprise, the Government certainly should <Col N="1173" /> be able to ensure that, when a large State company is set up, its operations should be decentralised.  I think the sugar beet industry set a very desirable example in that respect, inasmuch as, instead of establishing one great factory for the whole country, they established four.  It might have been even better if they had established five, but at any rate there was a certain amount of wise distribution in that case.  It is true that one of the factories has been disappointing in regard to the supplies of raw materials which they have been able to secure, but I think that the efforts to increase the supplies there should not be abandoned. I think that propaganda and publicity directed in that direction should be used to get the people to grow beet in the area and keep the factory going.  I know that every farmer large and small supports the sugar industry and even the cottage tenants have grown beet extensively. The efforts have been so great that the case has been made that disease has occurred on these crops because of the continuous growing year after year of sugar beet.  Many of these small land holders with less than one acre are disappointed that they are prevented from continuing to grow it.</P>
    <P>Another development over the years which was, I think, desirable was the promotion of wheat growing.  It had the result in County Wicklow, and possibly in other counties, of opening up flour mills which had been closed down, and I think there again there are people who would say that these small mills are a burden on the community, inasmuch as they cannot be altogether as efficient as the very large units of production.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, looking at the matter from a national or social point of view, I think they are desirable.  In small villages where they are located, they provide useful and remunerative employment for workers and should be preserved.  The industries which could be, and should be, promoted under a decentralisation plan are those which depend on agriculture for their raw materials.</P>
    <P>Modern trends are moving more in the direction of processed foods of <Col N="1174" /> every kind.  This opens up big possibilities for manufacturing industries based on agriculture.  Almost every product of the farm can be processed and marketed in a condition that will not be dependent on an immediate market.  For such things as vegetables, poultry and eggs, the market can be evened out, or the products preserved till the markets improve.  They can be transported considerable distances, if better markets are available a long way away.  In those particular directions, there is an opening for decentralisation.</P>
    <P>Again, in regard to mineral development, the successful exploration work carried out by Mianraí Teoranta in Avoca during the past seven years has shown that, if we are prepared to spend a certain amount of money on exploration, we may succeed in uncovering greater mineral deposits than we thought existed.  In regard to this particular enterprise, we understand now that all of the £500,000 that were expended will be returned to the State. That gives the State £500,000 to utilise in further exploratory work, whenever it is deemed to be desirable.  I have heard, moving through County Wicklow in particular, local traditions of the existence of various types of mineral in practically every part of the county. There has been proof of considerable deposits in the Tinahely area, in the Glendalough area, and in many other areas.  Whether they are sufficient to justify further development or not is a matter which can only be proved by exploration.</P>
    <P>There was another matter that was mentioned in the course of the debate, and that was the famous Ferguson car. I understand that efforts have been made to have that car manufactured in the Six Counties.  How far those efforts are likely to be successful, I do not know, but I think it would be a glorious idea if the promoters of this company were induced to establish their factory&mdash;and, of course, it will be a very large one&mdash;right on the Border between the Six Counties and the Republic.  Such an industry would become a unifying force for the nation. That might not come completely under the heading of decentralisation, but at least it would be a development which <Col N="1175" /> everyone would favour.  The Ferguson car, I understand, will have many new and revolutionary features.  It is a car that will go not only backwards and forwards, but sideways as well. It would be an ideal State car for Coalition Ministers.</P>

      <P>I have dealt at length with the decentralisation of industry and I think that the State, by inducement and incentive, must do whatever is possible to promote that decentralisation. Encouragement must be given, not only to manufacturers or potential manufacturers and businessmen, but also to potential workers in those factories, and a new spirit must be created in our rural areas directed towards the establishment of new industries.</P>
      <P>With regard to administration, it is, perhaps, one of the least desirable features of self-government here that practically all our Government Departments are established and retained in the City of Dublin.  This, of course, applies not only to Government Departments, but also to large State companies.  I think that here is a field in which direct action by Government can lead to a considerable amount of decentralisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two lines which decentralisation could possibly take.  One is to locate certain Departments in large towns or cities removed from Dublin. The second line, of course, would be that each Department would locate considerable branches of its service outside the City of Dublin.  That would be, I think, a desirable course, and it is one which appears to be possible. I know that there would be some difficulty, perhaps, in having one Minister with his Department in Cork, and another with his Department in Galway, with, perhaps, another in Waterford or Wexford.  I think, and particularly so in a Coalition Government, it is difficult enough to keep <Col N="1176" /> Ministers together and promote unity, without having them widely separated.</P>

      <P>It is not, Sir, but it has been introduced.  As we are on this, I was rather shocked to notice that recently, when some substantial grants were given to certain agricultural organisations to finance their activities, one of the first developments was to set up a headquarters, very substantial headquarters, here in the City of Dublin.  I think they should have set an example in the direction of decentralisation, but apparently Dublin is the great magnet that attracts all types of people, even those who try, and are trying successfully, to build up a representative national farmers' organisation.</P>
      <P>The Government should seriously consider sending some of the less important Departments out of the city, if not the larger Departments.  It might be a bad thing to have Ministers separated from each other, but I see no reason in the world why the headquarters of Departments run by Parliamentary Secretaries should not be removed from the city.  The Department of Fisheries, the Department of Forestry and many others could certainly be moved to some other centre.  The Land Commission, which is a body that does not require very much ministerial intervention and which acts independent of the Ministry, should have its headquarters set up elsewhere than in the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By promoting distribution of that kind, a trend would be established opposite to that which operates at the moment, and we would even possibly give a lead to other bodies.  There are many very large public companies and very wealthy bodies, including banks, <Col N="1177" /> insurance companies and bodies of that kind having large offices in the city, which could very well take themselves away to some other large town such as Clonmel, Carlow, Arklow, or any of those places, where they would have substantial accommodation and where they could do their work equally well.</P>
    <P>On the whole, the motion is worthy of support and I do not see why anyone could oppose it.  It is one thing to accept a proposal such as this and it is another thing to give it practical effect.  Passing a pious resolution does not get us very far.  I should like to hear whether the Government have some serious plans in mind for development along the lines indicated by this motion.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. O'Higgins) (for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs) Thomas Francis (Jnr.) O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. O'Higgins) (for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is intended to remove certain doubts that have been raised about the powers conferred on the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926.  The doubts have arisen by reason of a recent decision of the High Court <Col N="1178" /> under which it was decided that a district justice was wrong in law in not convicting a man who had been prosecuted for having an unlicensed radio set in a motor-car at a particular place.  In the course of their judgment, two of the judges expressed the opinion&mdash;and they emphasised that they were giving merely an opinion&mdash;that the wording of Section 5 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, restricts the issue of licences for wireless telegraphy apparatus to apparatus &ldquo;in a specified place&rdquo; and that, accordingly, there is no power under the Act to issue licences for wireless apparatus in motor-cars.</P>
      <P>On this view of the law every person who has or has had a wireless set in a car outside or away from premises already covered by a wireless licence has been breaking the law and has been committing an offence, whether or not he has held a separate licence for it.</P>
      <P>The Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1926 was intended to make provision, among other things&mdash;I am now quoting from the long title:&mdash;&ldquo;... for the regulation and control of wireless telegraphy on land, at sea and in the air ...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Moreover, under Section 3 of the Act the following provision is made:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... no person shall keep or have in his possession anywhere in Saorstát Éireann or in any ship or aircraft to which this section applies any apparatus for wireless telegraphy ...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>without a valid licence from the Minister.</P>
      <P>It seems clear that the Oireachtas intended that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should have the widest powers to issue licences for the keeping and possession of wireless telegraphy apparatus anywhere within our jurisdiction and that the reference to &ldquo;a specified place&rdquo; in Section 5 was not intended to restrict the Minister's powers to issue licences, but rather to ensure that each licence would be related to a particular address or place for the purpose of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs since 1927 have taken and acted upon that view which was and <Col N="1179" /> is a reasonable interpretation of the law.  However, since doubts have been raised that it does not accord with the strict letter of the law, it is considered desirable to remove these doubts and that is the purpose of this Bill.  It is a very short one and deals only with the issues raised in the recent High Court case.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides that a vehicle shall be deemed to be a place separate and distinct from the premises in which the vehicle is ordinarily kept.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the retrospective operation of Section 2 and for the validation of the statutory regulations made, the licences issued and the licence fees collected in respect of wireless telegraphy apparatus in vehicles before the passing of the Act.</P>
    <P>Although retrospective legislation is objectionable in principle, I do not think that reasonable objection can be taken to it in this instance.  We are not in any event proposing to create a new offence or to impose a new burden retrospectively.  In so far as successive Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs since 1927 may have been assuming powers not conferred on them by the Act&mdash;I say &ldquo;may have been&rdquo; advisedly because the position is not at all free from doubt&mdash;they have been doing so in all good faith.  Moreover, if they were wrong in assuming these powers, there has been, and is, no provision in law for having a wireless set in a vehicle and motorists who use or have used car radios have been committing an offence.  If so, this Act is needed to regularise the position.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, essential for the control of the use of wireless telegraphy that the Minister should have the same general powers of regulation and licensing in regard to vehicles that he undoubtedly has in regard to premises, ships and aircraft.  In other words, the Minister must have the machinery for licensing.  The Minister's power to fix the licence fees (if any) to be charged in particular circumstances by statutory regulations is already conceded in Section 6 of the 1926 Act.  I mention this because representations have been received from certain quarters to <Col N="1180" /> abolish or reduce licence fees on car radios and this Bill may appear to be a rejection of these representations, but that is not so.  It will merely confirm the powers the Minister has been operating and under these powers he will still be free to deal with such representations on their merits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be little doubt but that it was the intention of the Oireachtas, in passing the 1926 Act, to empower the Minister to issue licences.  Therefore, as the Minister pointed out, the purpose of the Bill is to clear a doubt that has arisen as a result of a court case.  With regard to car licences and licences in general, I think we all agree that, where a wireless set has been used and the Minister has authority to issue a licence, that should be the case.</P>
      <P>I would recommend, for the Minister's sympathetic consideration, the representations which have been made for the removal of, or at least a remission in, the licence fee in the case of a wireless set attached to a car.  It is an entirely different question from that of a wireless set in a caravan or any other temporary place of abode.  In a car, a wireless set is, as it were, a substitute for the wireless set in the man's home from which he is temporarily absent and such a set may be of very great value to him.  In many cases, it could be a very important part of his business.  Therefore, I would urge the Minister, when making the regulations authorised by this Bill, to remove, if possible, or at least to reduce the licence fee in relation to a wireless set attached to a car.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from Senator Hayes that the Minister is anxious to get this Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas to-night.  I do not want to delay unduly the passing of this Bill, but I should like to express my regret that the opportunity will not be given to the Seanad to have a debate on the Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1926, because there are a great many other sections of the Bill which, I think, could well be amended in the present year.  For instance, in the Wireless Telegraphy Bill of 1926, I do not think <Col N="1181" /> there are adequate provisions for dealing with interference, which has now become a very serious problem for people using wireless sets not only in this country but in other countries. Similarly, I think there are no adequate provisions under the 1926 Act for insisting that very high frequency apparatus in hospitals are suppressed, so that they will not interfere with what has now become quite a popular habit in Dublin and the Northern Counties, television.  It is an extremely great problem to-day and one which, sooner or later, will have to be faced up to by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I feel that if there had been an opportunity to discuss this Bill at length we could have asked the Minister to consider introducing into this Bill&mdash;which is, in fact, an amendment to the original Act&mdash;legislation which would enable him to enforce the fitting of adequate suppressors to electrical apparatus which interferes particularly with wireless reception.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has made it perfectly clear outside this House that at present he is not considering the introduction of television into the Irish Republic.  Therefore, that is not an immediate problem.  It is a problem, however, which, sooner or later, we shall have to face in this country. I think the opportunity might have been taken under this amending Bill to introduce legislation to deal with these things.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister how portable wireless sets are covered by legislation.  There has been a large development in this type of wireless apparatus in recent years.  I notice people using small portable radios in trains, buses, motor-cars and at picnics.  It may be the radio used in the house: it may be a second radio. It seems to me that, if it was found that a radio in a motor-car was not covered, it is possible that a portable radio which is taken out of the house where it is usually operated is not covered by the existing legislation.  It may be found that there is a defect in the legislation.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to delay the passage of this necessary Bill, but I think that at least one member <Col N="1182" /> of the House should express a reluctance, which I imagine is shared by many of us, in regard to the retrospective legislation involved in this Bill. The Minister has made a case for it and, in the circumstances, I think we must accept that case.  However, as we all know, it is a very dangerous principle and a doctrine of intention, as applied to legislation, would be extremely dangerous, too.  I should just like to put it on the record, and I think other Senators would like to have it on the record, that we deplore the necessity for this retrospective legislation.  The plain fact is that a mistake was made by the Government, a mistake was made by the parliamentary draftsman, a mistake was made by the members of the Oireachtas in 1926.  We are now passing legislation to deem that mistake not to have been made.  I think many of us are unhappy about that and I am sure many of us hope that it will seldom, if ever, be necessary to pass retrospective legislation of this kind again.</P>

      <P>Might I add a word to the appeal which has been made to the Minister in considering this matter to give some relief in regard to the licence fee on cars, particularly in cases where the licence holder is already paying a licence fee on a radio in his own home?  Where a person is already paying a licence fee in respect of a radio in his house, I feel he should be entitled to have the radio in his car at a reduced rate: if he had no other radio except the one in his car, that might not apply.  It will be recognised that a car radio is of very limited benefit, inasmuch as the owner cannot expect to derive very much advantage from it because it is only at infrequent times that it can be of any use at all.</P>

      <P>Arising out of Senator Stanford's remarks, if my memory serves me correctly, I doubt if there was a radio in any motor-car 30 years ago.  It would be as well to have that clear.  I have a fairly lengthy recollection and I never heard of a wireless set being installed in a car away back in 1926.  As I say, it would be no harm to have that clarified, because it seems that we are not tuned-in properly to <Col N="1183" /> that particular year, a year in which the Government were not bothering about radios in cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>While Senator O'Gorman may be right in saying that radio sets were not being installed in cars when the Act was passed in 1926, that still does not take away from the fact that this is retrospective legislation. So far as I have gathered, retrospective legislation seems very obnoxious to lawyers.  There seems to be only one thing more obnoxious to legal gentlemen and that is <i>ad hoc</i> legislation.  It can be argued, as it has been argued by Senator Stanford, that that is an undesirable thing and it is unfortunate that the Oireachtas has to mend its hand in this matter.  It is, of course, a fact that it was not possible to foresee the development in this field of science and, even though it is retrospective legislation, I suppose that nothing can be done about it.</P>
      <P>The point I really am interested in is that, since this has arisen by reason of a decision in a court case dealing with sets in cars, it should be put on record that it is the opinion of many members of this House, at any rate, that there should be some consideration in relation to the fee for car radio licences.  I would suggest that, where people have sets in cars, in 99 cases out of 100 they also have a set in their homes.  Are they then to be put in the position of having to pay two licence fees?  It is hardly fair that they should be expected to pay the full car radio licence.  Some people have more than one set in their dwelling houses and I think it would not be the intention of the Minister to charge for a licence on the two sets.  I would like to hear from the Minister whether it would be intended to charge a licence fee on those two sets because the more likely thing would be that there would be extension speakers from a master set.</P>
      <P>That being so, since the use of a car radio set is relatively limited and since those people who own sets in their homes are paying licence fees, the licence fee for car sets should be at a reduced fee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Senator Stanford over-simplified the position and I was rather surprised to find him making an attack upon Trinity College.  I thought he was the last man who would do that.  It is a great simplification of the position to say that, when the Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1926 was passed, there was a mistake made by the parliamentary draftsman and a mistake made by the members of the Oireachtas.  That is not so.  There is no legal decision to the effect that a mistake of any kind was made.  This is a Bill to remove doubts, owing to an expression of opinion from the Bench, but not a legal decision and, therefore, it is not proved that any mistake was made by the draftsman of 1926.</P>
      <P>With regard to the drafting of Bills in 1926, it should be remembered that the Government at that particular time founded the Parliament and founded the parliamentary draftsman's office, with a very distinguished draftsman, who was, unless I am greatly mistaken, a graduate of Professor Stanford's university and who was succeeded subsequently by another graduate of the same university.  That office was founded, among other things that were founded at the time, by our first Government, and has worked with great success and great accuracy for successive Governments. It was one of the best offices that was founded by the State and has given very great satisfaction.  It should not be said in a rather casual fashion, that the draftsman made a mistake and that the members of the Oireachtas made a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Bill which is merely for the purpose of removing doubts.  The draftsmanship of a great variety of measures is, in the nature of things, since we are all human, always liable to flaws.  That is what judges are for in a way&mdash;to find flaws in draftsmen's work&mdash;but it could be said, I think, that the drafting of Bills here since 1922 has stood up well to a great variety of tests.  It would not be correct to interpret the introduction of this measure as any criticism upon the draftsman of 1926 or any other <Col N="1185" /> draftsman, or any other Oireachtas, either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>First, on the question of the view expressed, quite properly, that this Bill has retrospective effect.  Of course it has.  That is regrettable, but I think it is necessary. As I said, the Bill is needed to remove doubts, not to change what has been declared to be the law, but to deal with doubts which have arisen and do exist.  So far as the certainties are concerned, I think Senators should appreciate that, under Section 3 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1926, the position is clearly stated that &ldquo;no person shall keep or have in his possession anywhere in Saorstát Éireann or in any ship or aircraft to which this section applies any apparatus for wireless telegraphy.&rdquo;  In other words, the law is clear; no one in this State may have in his possession anywhere a wireless set, unless he holds a valid licence from the Minister.  The doubt created concerns the Minister's power to issue a licence to a person to have a radio set in a motor vehicle.  If the Minister has no power, then a person who has such a wireless set, of course, perhaps unwittingly but nevertheless as a fact, offends against the provisions of Section 3 of the Act of 1926.  Therefore, apart from anything else it is, of course, necessary to put that position in order, and while there is retrospection, it is, I think, in the interests of those who have had for a number of years car radios that the law should be put in order and that the position should be removed from doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Burke mentioned the question of portable radios.  The position, as I understand it, in regard to that is that separate licences are not required for portable radios, if the owner already owns a licence for his premises. This is covered by Regulation 7 of the regulations made under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, and no additional licence is required.  The same applies to a second or third radio set in a house mentioned by Senator O'Reilly&mdash; the one licence normally covers the <Col N="1186" /> sets in the house, except, of course, where there are separate families in the house.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Gorman doubted whether there was such a thing as a car radio in 1927.  The Senator's recollection may be accurate, but I do notice that, if no car radios existed at that time, the Minister of that date showed considerable foresight, because, in the regulations made under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, made in 1927, there is a provision that a separate ordinary licence shall be necessary to cover the private use of a wireless receiving set in a motor-car or other conveyance.</P>
    <P>I do not think there are any other matters it is necessary to mention, except to repeat that the Bill is intended to remove doubts which have arisen from the recent decision, and I think it is necessary in the interests of those who have had radios in cars up to this, and, of course, in the interests of the administration by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs of the Act itself. The other matters which have been mentioned by Senators are in no way affected by this Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is to restore the position before the decision of the High Court. Representations which have been made concerning the amount of licence fees and various other matters arising in relation to the administration by the Minister of his powers under the Act are not in any way affected, but I can assure the House that the matters mentioned will be borne in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he would clarify the statement he made with regard to portable wireless sets, because I think that might cause a little bit of misunderstanding. Under Section 2, it is proposed that, for the purposes of  Principal Act, a vehicle shall be deemed to be a place separate and distinct from the premises in which it is <Col N="1187" /> ordinarily kept.  The Minister has stated that a portable wireless set is covered under regulations made under the original Act.  It has been the practice in recent years, and is a growing one, for people to use portable wireless sets in their cars, rather than to have an actual car radio installed in the car.  I am anxious to know will this Bill mean that a person who goes to the trouble of having a permanent set installed in his car will be liable to pay a wireless licence, while other people who merely use portable sets in their cars will be exempt.  It seems to me that in many of our modern houses where garages are built as part of the house, it could be deemed that the car radio installed permanently in the car was normally kept in that particular place of residence and would be exempt from a wireless licence fee, in exactly the same way as the Minister has stated that a second or third wireless set inside the house does not require an additional wireless licence.  We all know instances where the premises of a wireless dealer may have 200 or 300 sets, but only one licence is paid.  I feel that from the statement made by the Minister a few minutes ago there is liable to be a misunderstanding as to what is a portable wireless set, and whether or not a portable wireless set normally used in a car, and taken out on picnics and so on, is liable to a separate additional licence.  Possibly the Minister would clarify that.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether, unwittingly, I used terms of art in relation to portable wireless sets as opposed to a radio in a car, but, whatever the legal position may be, I am told that, in relation to a portable wireless set which can be carried around by a person, no licence in fact is required or sought, the reason being that a portable radio normally is only occasionally used outside the premises in which it is ordinarily kept.  A car radio is normally a permanent fixture in the car, and, in fact, though Senator Douglas will correct me on this if I am wrong, I am advised that it is not a very happy experience to try to use a portable radio in a car, because you <Col N="1188" /> will not hear much.  In the case of a portable radio as such, the Minister does not seek any licence for it, on the basis that it is only occasionally used outside the house, perhaps on picnics or something of that kind, and if there is a current licence in respect of a radio in the house, that is taken as covering a portable radio.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that I am entirely satisfied with the Minister's explanation in his opening and subsequent remarks that we will not be injuring anyone by passing this piece of retrospective legislation; otherwise I am quite certain we would all be opposing it.  With regard to Senator Hayes's remarks, I should like to say with great emphasis that I admire Senator Hayes's chivalry in defending those graduates of T.C.D.</P>

      <P>I hope that the graduates of T.C.D. will always have that chivalrous support and that they will continue to be his friends, both in the House and outside the House. But I would stand, if I wanted to delay the House, on the matter of a mistake.  I hold with the learned judge of the High Court that the section was inadequately drafted.  The mistake, as I see it, lay in not providing for the possibility that wireless sets could be used in cars; in other words, in appearing to limit the possibility of having a wireless set in vehicles to a ship or aircraft.  Apparently they appear to limit it to that, and that, to my mind, was a mistake and faulty drafting.  I do not want anyone for a moment to think that I am criticising the draftsman or the Legislature of 1926.  We are all liable to make mistakes, and when a House makes a mistake of that kind, it should admit it, and say &ldquo;we are sorry; we will put it right as well as we can&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I felt that it was consonant with the dignity of this House that someone <Col N="1189" /> should protest against retrospective legislation, and against rushed legislation.  As Senator Douglas rightly said, there are many things we would like to have an opportunity of discussing on a Bill of this kind. There is much praise to be given to Radio Éireann, and some criticism may be made.  We are being precluded from that by this Bill.  It is necessary but we accept this Bill under protest. I hope that the time will never come in the Oireachtas that someone will have to bring in a piece of retrospective legislation and will say that, on such and such a day in the year 1956, no one seemed to mind about retrospective legislation.  I am simply regarding this as a very exceptional case, and I think it is consonant with the dignity of this House that that should be said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>It has occurred to me, listening to the speeches that have been made, that there is some confusion of thought on this question of retrospective legislation.  I would suggest that retrospective legislation is legislation which <i>ex post facto</i> affects the rights of parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what Senator Stanford means by the rubrics, because I am not looking at it.  I am proceeding on the ordinary commonsense view, which is that retrospective legislation is something which retrospectively affects the rights of parties, or the rights of private property, or which imposes penalties which had not previously existed.  I think there is quite a different kind of Bill and that is a declaratory Bill, which declares that the law is so and so, but does not affect rights already established, or impose fresh penalties, or, if it does appear to affect those rights, provides that existing rights will not be prejudiced. I am mentioning this merely to try to clear one's mind.  I think that, in the Statute Book, there will already be found a number of Acts in which the Oireachtas has declared the law to be so and so and it has always taken care <Col N="1190" /> not to interfere with rights previously established.</P>
      <P>I think it would be a bad thing that it should go out that, even on a special occasion, when people had made a protest, this House had passed a retrospective Bill.  In my opinion, this Bill is not retrospective, but is a declaratory Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Stanford has referred to the lack of foresight displayed in the past. May I point out to this House that it is at present displaying a similar lack of foresight, because so far as I know it has made no provision in this Bill for wireless used in machines travelling through space, and I can quite foresee in some years to come some reflection being made on a lack of foresight by Senators passing this Bill, as was made by Senator Stanford in regard to previous legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cox has, I think, made the position absolutely clear.  Senator Stanford is not the only person here interested in keeping this Oireachtas right in matters of principle.  If anybody ever wanted to pass an Act which would retrospectively interfere with somebody's rights in the future, this Bill will not be an example for him to work on.</P>
      <P>This is quite a different thing from those other examples of retrospective legislation.  We all remember the case where a decision was taken to prevent an appeal to the House of Lords.  That established the first example, and, apart from my quip about Trinity College, I was quite serious in paying tribute to the draftsmen of that period. I think it is too facile to get up here in 1956 and to say airily that mistakes were made in 1926.  That has not been proved and there is no legal decision to that effect.  There has been no mistake made and there is no decision of any court enabling anybody to say that a mistake was made.  If anybody wants to pass legislation of a retrospective nature, in the sense of interfering with anybody's rights, then this Bill cannot be taken as an example.</P>

      <P>This Bill has done what I hoped it would do, to show that the House would never be a party to retrospective legislation and that this Bill was not an example for <Col N="1191" /> future retrospective legislation.  I should like to point out that the Minister, in his opening remarks, referred to the Bill as retrospective and that is why I think I was justified in making my remarks.  If a mistake is made, whether by graduates of my own university or some other university, or anybody else, I think it is better to say so and to put it right, if possible. I should like to say also that I agree with Senator Hayes in the tribute he has paid to the draftsmen of the previous legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBergin" hpid="Mr. Bergin Mr. Bergin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bergin</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the speeches in this House since the debate on the motion began, I find that the greater part of the debate has been directed to the centralisation of industry in this country around Dublin.  That would suggest that Dublin is the greatest centre of industry in this country.  As far as I am aware, that is not the fact, because, unless I am very much mistaken, the heaviest centre of industry in this country is Belfast.  What most speakers seemed to forget was that there are not only 26 counties in this country but that we have a country of 32 counties. I think that that should be borne in mind in a debate of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This resolution can be divided into two distinct parts.  The first is: &ldquo;That <Col N="1192" /> this House is of the opinion that the policy of the Government should be accurately and urgently directed towards securing the decentralisation of industry.&rdquo;  That, to me, implies that decentralisation of industry should be one of the main concerns of the Government. In cases where the Government have been concerned, we find that there has been decentralisation, and I think that our main concern should not be this question of decentralisation, but rather in getting more efficient production from the industries we have.  We should have that efficiency in the industries to ensure maximum production, whether they are centred in Dublin or not.</P>
    <P>We have had in industries in which the Government had any concern quite an amount of decentralisation.  As Senator Cogan stated, there has been decentralisation in the sugar industry. Again, there has been decentralisation in the electricity supply stations which we find placed all over the country and we should give the Government credit for its interest in these matters. Similarly, we find decentralisation in the case of Bord na Móna, where supplies are brought from all over the country for that industry.</P>
    <P>The second part of the resolution urges that administrative control generally should be decentralised throughout the country and some of the speakers have referred to the possibility of moving Government offices to other centres throughout the country.  It was noticeable in that regard that other organisations, when they were setting up executive or administrative offices, looked to Dublin, possibly because of its history, its central position and its general facilities.  We had that in the case of Macra na Feirme and Muinntir na Tíre when they got grants towards their organisations.  I think that any decentralisation of Government services would mean increased costs in administration. This is something to be avoided as much in Government services as it is in industry, where the aim should be to get the highest possible efficiency in production.</P>
    <P>The resolution suggests that the Government should interfere in the matter <Col N="1193" /> of plans and sites for industry, but the people who make that suggestion are not prepared to accept that philosophy in regard to private industry and they then blame the Government for not doing something which they themselves would not give the Government power to do.</P>
    <P>Incentives are given to people to start industries in certain areas and those incentives are really extraordinarily generous and show that the Government is interested in the decentralisation of industry, as far as it possibly can go and within the powers it has.  I think this motion is based falsely, because it implies that the Government is not taking an active part in seeking the decentralisation of industry.  The motion, therefore, is a little bit of hypocrisy because the people blaming the Government for not seeking decentralisation of industry are not prepared to give the Government the powers to carry out that work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I have had a fair amount of contact with the establishment of new industries in this country which goes back right to the beginning of the State.  I think it is only right to say of this Government and all previous Governments that in every case in which I was concerned the offices of the Department suggested that the industries be put somewhere outside Dublin.  There was, however, no unfair pressure put on by the Minister or his Department, but everything within reason has been done towards that end.  Quite valuable and large industries have been situated outside Dublin, and, in every case of a new industry, the matter has been examined from the best point of view by the officers of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has to be remembered that the location of industries away from the centre of the country meant an increase in the cost of production, and I think one has to bear these things in mind at all times.  The first thing to be remembered is that production should be as cheap as possible, if industry in the State is to continue in existence.  The other is that, if a healthy national life is to be maintained, the entire life must not be concentrated <Col N="1194" /> in one place.  I think these are principles which have always been fully realised by those in authority.  It is very difficult to see how they could do more, even if a motion such as the present one was passed.</P>
    <P>As regards the spread of the administrative centres throughout the country, I think it is perfectly clear that, to do that, would add very much to what is already an appealling burden of cost.  The motion is to some extent misleading and ill-advised and, for the Seanad to pass it, would be an indication that things in the past have been different from what they were.  It would also involve some reproach on the work done in the past.  I myself know of many instances whereby industries were put down the country at the insistence of Ministers and others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer only to two references to the Irish universities made in an earlier part of this debate.  In the Official Report of the debate on 9th November, 1955, column 618, Senator Walsh said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Until we get a residential university in Ireland, we will not have proper university life and culture.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That statement is clearly open to misunderstanding and would seem to imply that, in the Republic of Ireland, we have no residential university.</P>
      <P>I should not like to leave this misapprehension in the minds of Senators. We have, in fact, one residential university in this country.  Many citizens may not wish to go to it or may have certain objections to make to it, but we must not ignore the fact that it is there.  T.C.D. has as good residential opportunities as the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge mentioned by Senator Walsh a little earlier in his speech.</P>
      <P>The second reference to the universities was made by Senator George O'Brien in his final paragraph in column 612 of the same Report.  This is what he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Finally, before sitting down&mdash;I hope I will not be misinterpreted or misunderstood&mdash;may I, as one of the representatives of the National University, <Col N="1195" /> say I would consider it highly undesirable to leave another institution with a monopoly of university education in the capital city of Ireland?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>May I say that I entirely agree with that sentiment?  I am fully in favour of healthy rivalry between the two universities in the City of Dublin, but the remarks may be turned round, and I think I can speak with full sincerity in saying I believe that Senator O'Brien would hold, with equal conviction, that he would not like to see either university in the City of Dublin having a monopoly.</P>
    <P>I do not think I am misinterpreting him when I say that he would share with me the view that healthy competition between these two great universities will be for the good of education and for the good of Ireland. Perhaps I am not misinterpreting him in any way when I say that I share his views, if these were his motives.  At the moment, it is important to affirm that healthy competition between honourable foundations like U.C.D. and T.C.D. is the best thing for Irish education and for our country as a whole.  Those are at least my firm convictions in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to intervene briefly on this motion to point out that, in the first place, it asks us to do things&mdash;to declare that we believe in the decentralisation of industry and of administrative control.  I take that to mean that industry should be decentralised as much as possible.  As Senator Cox and other speakers before him pointed out that has been done. That has been the policy of successive Ministers for Industry and Commerce. It has been accomplished, as far as they could accomplish it, without going to the lengths of absolute compulsion, although I understand they have gone pretty far in some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Crowley also asks us to declare that we are in favour of the decentralisation of administrative control, which I take to mean that he wants to send some Government Departments to the country.  That is a matter of great difficulty, and is also <Col N="1196" /> a different matter.  With regard to the motion generally, the question of overgrowth&mdash;I think that is the proper word to use for it&mdash;in cities is one which is not an Irish problem solely, nor is it merely a problem in small countries.  Some of the largest and most important countries, France and Britain, particularly France, have suffered from that, too.</P>
    <P>The difference between life in the country and life in the city is by no means what it used to be.  The cities are no longer the unhealthy places they used to be and the country is no longer the idyllic place it is sometimes represented to be particularly by city people.  The city has a great many amenities but the argument for preventing country towns in particular from decaying is that we ought to have as much diversity of culture and occupation as we possibly can.</P>
    <P>Another thing, of course, is that the great growth of Dublin means an immense growth in services&mdash;health services, transport services and so on. It was pointed out by other speakers that you could accomplish a certain amount of decentralisation but it would, certainly, be at a cost.  I should like, <i>en passant</i>, to make a point about Government intervention.  Senator Crowley will forgive me&mdash;I am not making any special reference to him&mdash; if I say that everybody advocating a particular interest or desiring to further a particular idea calls for Government or State intervention. Everybody wants the State to interfere with somebody else but not with him.</P>
    <P>The fact is that in this country since 1922 for very valid reasons and on a very plausible case in every instance the State has intervened to an extraordinary degree and while in each instance you could make a good case, the sum total of State intervention is really enormous in this country now and if you insist on making it more so you will reach complete State control. For example, without expressing my own view on it, it may be true to say that if we are going to insist upon capital and industry going into a particular area in the country the next very simple and proximate step is to insist upon labour moving also from one <Col N="1197" /> point to another point.  The stage may be reached where we would say to people with money that they should establish an industry in Baile-i-bhfadsíos and the next step would be that we would say to Patrick Murphy, with a wife and five children: &ldquo;Sorry, we cannot do anything for you here but there is work in Loughrea and you will get no benefit until you go to Loughrea.&rdquo;  By proceeding thus the stage is bound to be reached when the State will intervene in matters which will not be desirable.</P>
    <P>With regard to administrative control, I think a good deal more thought should be taken about that.  Our system of parliamentary and Cabinet Government depends upon collective responsibility and Ministers should certainly be within call.  A Minister operating in Cork or Galway is out of touch with his colleagues.  That is one thing.  Civil servants also&mdash;no matter what one may say in criticism of them: I have no criticism to make of them at all, as far as I know them&mdash;cannot be tossed about like snuff at a wake.  They are appointed to a particular Department and settle down in Dublin and then you decide to move them to some other part of the country, say, Athlone. If you want a branch of the Civil Service with a staff of, say, 300 persons, 200 of whom are married, to move somewhere or other, you have to find in that place 200 houses, accommodation for children in schools and accommodation somewhere else for another 100 persons.  Indeed, 300 is a very small number: it would want to be a very much larger number.  Undoubtedly, if they went to a particular country town I am sure they would help to improve the social and cultural activities of that particular town&mdash;I agree with that entirely&mdash;but you would be taking a certain number of people up by their roots and planting them somewhere else.  I know there is transferring in certain branches of the Service, such as Revenue.  There, when you go into the Service, you know you may be moved but you always have a chance of getting back to Dublin.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of anybody with administrative experience, one of the difficulties would be that contact <Col N="1198" /> with the Department of Finance would become more prolonged than it is at present.  It would all have to be done by letter and it takes long enough now, irrespective entirely of the Government in office or the Minister in power, to get the Department of Finance to do anything.  If your relations with the Department of Finance had to take place at a distance of 150 miles, by letter, I shudder at the results.  It is obvious, therefore, that you would have a problem which is not so simple as some people think.  If you are going to establish a whole Civil Service Department, where would you find a place to do it?  Other countries which had a Federal Government, such as Australia and the United States, decided to establish artificial cities. We could not do that.  It is very desirable to add to the population of country towns&mdash;that has been the policy here&mdash;but I very much doubt if it is feasible to do it by adding a Civil Service Department and, before it is advocated, these difficulties should be contemplated.</P>
    <P>The same applies to something that was said about universities.  A university or a university college is something a great deal more complicated than a mere building where people give lectures.  Not only does it require many buildings but it requires, too, workshops for engineering, libraries, museums and you cannot create, in this country at any rate, a new university town.  You move people from Dublin, from libraries, museums, art galleries, academies, collections of manuscripts and books, and so forth.  You could not duplicate these collections anywhere else.  Therefore, while you may say, in theory, that it would be very good to move away from Dublin, the actual difficulty of doing it is very great.  The actual cost and decrease in efficiency, perhaps, would also be very great.  Therefore, I personally feel that this motion in its present form is unacceptable because it asks us specifically to decentralise industry and administrative control generally, as far as is found practicable.</P>
    <P>Senator Crowley is to be congratulated on having put down the motion and on having initiated the discussion. <Col N="1199" /> However, this is a matter of very great difficulty.  I do not think we should be called upon to express the opinion that both industry and the Civil Service should be decentralised.  Perhaps at an earlier point something could have been done about it.  A good deal has in fact been done about industry: it has been the declared policy of various Ministers.  With regard to the Civil Service, it is a matter that offers very great difficulties.  Therefore, I suggest that it is not practicable for us to adopt this motion and, as far as I am concerned, the second part of the motion is something which I would not urge upon this Government or upon any Government.  For that reason, I suggest that, although the subject has been very well discussed, it is one on which we should not be asked to express an opinion in the terms of the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Crotty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the mover of this motion that Government policy has been directed and is being directed towards encouraging the decentralisation of industry.  The Minister has no statutory power to direct any qualified person or industrialist to start an industry in any particular place but, under the Control of Manufactures Act, he has power to attach a location condition to any licence which he issues under that Act.  Allowing for that power, the promoters must still be satisfied that the location is reasonable for the business which they intend to promote.  Since the passing of this Act, 250 licences have been issued and, of these, 131 have been issued outside Dublin.  While the final choice of the location of any industry rests with the promoters, every encouragement is given to any industrialist who comes to the Department or to the Minister looking for information towards establishing his industry outside the large cities and all information as regards location facilities and amenities is given to that person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Attention is also drawn to the facilities under the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952.  An Foras Tionscal is empowered to give grants in respect <Col N="1200" /> of areas scheduled under that Act as undeveloped.  These areas are Counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway, Kerry and the rural districts of Clare and Cork.  Senator Murphy mentioned that two-thirds relief of rates was given in any part of the country, whether Dublin or otherwise.  The fact is that local authorities are empowered, under this Act, to give two-thirds remission of rates for ten years for premises in respect of which An Foras Tionscal has given assistance.  He also referred to the Six Counties Government's power to erect factories.  An Foras Tionscal has also this power but it does not use it very often because if they set up factories and built them without any real industry in sight they could be most unsuitable for whatever persons wanted the factories afterwards. Therefore, when persons come and put up plans for the factories they require they give them, according as they think right, grants towards the building or the completion cost of the factories.</P>
    <P>Senator Kissane inquired if the Government had any intention of amending the present legislation under the Undeveloped Areas Act.  I do not think this legislation has yet had time enough to prove itself.  The volume of grants approved so far is as follows:&mdash; From 22nd January, 1952 to March, 1953, £104,800; year ended March, 1954, £159,000; year ended March, 1955, £232,800; current year to date, £532,700.  The grants approved in the current year under the Act are £36,000 higher than all the grants that have been approved in the previous three years.  If that is not progress and encouragement to industrialists to decentralise, I do not know what more could be done.  Out of a sum of £2,000,000 which the Act provides might be spent over a period of seven years, over a quarter has been approved in the present year.</P>
    <P>The effects of these grants during the current year will not be noticeable because it takes about two years to have these industries set up and to have the effect noticeable.  If the Minister really sets out and insists on a certain location for a factory, the possibility <Col N="1201" /> is that industry may be lost altogether to the country, and I do not think anybody would wish that.  We feel that the investors in the industry must be the final arbiters of the risks involved.</P>
    <P>According to the Central Statistics Office table, showing the location of industries, in the period 1938 to 1952, the net output of industries in the County Borough of Dublin and Dún Laoghaire increased from £17,000,000 to £49,000,000, an increase of 181 per cent.  In the same period, output for the rest of the country increased from £15,000,000 to £50,000,000, an increase of 237 per cent., as against 181 per cent. in Dublin County Borough.</P>
    <P>The numbers engaged in industry in the County Borough of Dublin and Dún Laoghaire increased during that period from 65,000 to 88,000, while the numbers in the rest of the country increased from 87,000 to 114,000.  Output was 54 per cent. of the total of all industrial production in 1938 and this had fallen to 49 per cent. in 1952.  These figures indicate that the rest of the country secured a very significant proportion of the total new industries established.</P>
    <P>The smaller towns have supplies of labour, and, in some cases, their housing programmes are moving towards completion, which is not the case in the larger cities, and as well, in the smaller towns, the workers are much nearer the factories and have not got the trouble of travelling for half an hour to the factory in the morning and spending another half an hour coming back in the evening which would be a great advantage to anybody seeking to set up an industry in the country.  As these facilities become known, I feel that we shall have a much greater degree of decentralisation, especially as these smaller towns at present can offer equal facilities as regards water, sewerage, electric light and power to those available in the city areas.  Also, in the towns, there is a much lower valuation on buildings, so that lower rates have to be paid.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;...by making it perfectly clear, and, in fact, by emphasising that I am not attributing either blame or responsibility to the present Government or to any Government in the past...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think we can all be perfectly satisfied that the existence of the problem can be traced, quite understandably, to the anxiety of successive Governments to secure at any cost siting of the new industries we needed so badly somewhere inside the country, and I am perfectly satisfied that one Minister after another must have had the gun, so to speak, put to his head by manufacturers or others who, of themselves, insisted for their own ends that their industries should be sited where they had the freest and fullest opportunity of access to suitable facilities and, of course, the opportunity of operating at the cheapest possible cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I do not think that is a very bad thing either, but I do want to stress that I am perfectly conscious, as I hope every other member of the House after the discussion we have had is conscious, that no blame should be laid at the door of any responsible Minister, past or present, for the fact that we are still left with this problem. The fact is that we have the problem still with us and the fact is that, socially and economically as a nation, we are supporting a very lopsided structure.  I believe that if we are to continue to take no notice of the problem, we will eventually, and, as I believe, inevitably, have to face an even greater problem in the long run, and it was solely for the purpose of <Col N="1203" /> directing public attention to the fact that the problem exists and that we feel that something ought to be done about it that I put the motion down, in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer very briefly to a few of the points which some Senators made and I want to begin by thanking Senator Murphy for the contribution he made, and in particular for the emphasis which he put on the necessity for what he described as selective planning of our economy and this particular aspect of it in future. I think that adds emphasis to the purpose of my motion.  I should like to say also that I was glad to hear Senator Kissane voice the assurance that members on his side supported completely the principle of the motion, at least.</P>
    <P>In passing, I should like to say that every possible credit must be given to the previous Minister who was responsible for the enactment of the Undeveloped Areas Act in 1952 and it is very gratifying, I submit, even at this comparatively early stage&mdash;it is just a little over three years since the Act went into operation&mdash;to find that some very beneficial results are flowing from that legislation.  The Parliamentary Secretary has just quoted some figures which, I submit, give great promise for the future.</P>
    <P>I wish also to refer as briefly as I can to the contribution made by Senator O'Brien to the discussion.  My friend Senator O'Brien made it clear, in the introduction to his remarks, that he was expressing what I might describe as a quite neutral view.  In the course of his speech, he said that the motion suggested a certain type of what he described as artificial localisation of the pattern of industry inside the country.  I am sorry that I cannot altogether share or subscribe to that particular opinion.  I can only say in reply to it that there is nobody more conscious than I am myself of all the advantages that Dublin has.  It has an excellent port, well equipped, conveniently located to handle substantial volumes of imports of raw materials. I am very conscious of all that, and of the advantages that the siting of <Col N="1204" /> industry near our principal port offers both to manufacturers, and indirectly to the consumers, in the long run. But I would like to make the point in reply, that even a policy of more vigorous protection for our industries could quite possibly prove even more costly than a policy of decentralising our existing industries, if it were put to the test.  At any rate, my whole point in putting down the motion was to ask: are we satisfied that we are doing all we should be doing in our efforts to try to stem some of the very serious problems we are faced with as a people, and would we be justified in continuing or pretending to continue to ignore the fact that it exists?  That was the sole purpose of the motion.</P>
    <P>I want particularly, however, to refer to another aspect of Senator O'Brien's speech, and to take the opportunity of assuring him and the House that my motion was not intended in any sense to advocate anything like the decentralisation of U.C.D., or any other university for that matter.  In moving the motion, I did quote, in fact, deliberately, as one of the worst examples I could think of, of the aspect of the problem we wanted to combat, the current proposal, which I understand is quite a serious one, to transfer the existing buildings and personnel and so on of U.C.D. from Earlsfort Terrace to the Stillorgan Road.  I have read, or heard, the figure of something like £4,000,000 quoted as an estimate of the initial cost of that proposal.  If this is so, I simply made the point in my opening comment which, I think, was perfectly justified, and feel quite justified in repeating now, that plans of that type, involving expenditure of that proportion, would be far better directed towards either the provision of additional constituent colleges of our university in provincial centres like Limerick, Waterford or Sligo, or any other provincial centres, or, if that was not possible or feasible, towards extending the existing constituent colleges, either at Cork or Galway. I do submit that, in either direction, the amount of effort, and certainly of money, involved would be far better employed than by transferring U.C.D. from Earlsfort Terrace to the Stillorgan Road.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> Senators Walsh and Cogan made valuable and lengthy contributions to the discussion.  I am sure they will hardly expect me to comment on all they said, but to a very large extent it was clear that they were in agreement, as many other Senators were, with the principle of the motion itself.</P>
    <P>Senator Bergin did not hesitate to express his views, and I am very grateful to him for his contribution, even though it was opposed to my own point of view.  He made, however, one or two points, apart from the one I have referred to already, in which he accused me of having, in some sense, by implication or otherwise, blamed the present or some past Government for the existence of this problem.  I have already assured the House that nothing was further from my mind, and I trust that the House will accept that assurance.  He also said, or suggested, that, even though I put down this motion, I was not prepared to give the necessary power to the Government to exercise some form of direction or control in a reasonable way towards securing the results which the motion seeks.  I want to assure Senator Bergin that that is not so.  I would not have put down the motion if I were not prepared to support giving more power to the Government, and I would like that to go on record as being my own point of view on that suggestion of Senator Bergin.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes in his reference to the motion&mdash;a very valuable one, too, I think&mdash;made the point that decentralisation was very costly, which I am satisfied it would be if we were to go piecemeal at this problem and try to begin as and from to-morrow, so to speak, to start decentralisation of our industries and administrative control and send them down the country.  I should like to assure Senator Hayes and the House that that was very far from my intention in putting down this motion.  I am satisfied that it would be as impracticable to secure the actual decentralisation of our existing industries in their present form, as it would be to secure their location in some other part of the country at the time when those manufacturers and so on came in here with their factories.  I certainly would be very slow to suggest <Col N="1206" /> to this House that we should seriously consider the practicability or possibility of doing precisely that.  I am not at all sure that it is even desirable or in the country's interest in the long run, but this much, I think, I would be quite clear in saying, that whatever has been done in the past, and having regard to the fact that we have this problem on our hands, particularly here in the capital city, we could, and should as a people, and as a House, be unanimous in suggesting, at any rate, that anything the present Government or any Government of the future can do should be done actively and urgently towards securing, as far as they can secure it, the location of industries in future in the provinces, in preference to Dublin.  That was the principal point I wanted to suggest in bringing in this motion.</P>
    <P>Again, I would like to assure Senator Hayes that I am very far from thinking in terms of the creation of a new university town, but I certainly would say that, unless and until such time as the country can really afford to play around with grandiose ideas of that type, we should be just as reluctant to give approval to the creation of a university town in one of the suburbs of Dublin as anywhere else throughout the country.  That was the only point I made on this matter when I was introducing this motion.  I certainly had no intention then, nor have I any intention now, of advocating that we should seriously consider any such suggestion at all.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary that the Department is alive to the urgency and importance of this problem.  I may say in all sincerity that I never had the slightest doubt that the Department would be alive to the importance of this problem, and I would not have to look very far to get more definite evidence of that if I were in need of it. I also realise that, under existing legislation, quite clearly the Department has not the power to direct, so to speak; but I submit that the Department could, perhaps, do a little more than has been done in the past towards securing the desirable ends I was seeking.</P>
    <P>Let me say that it appears clear to <Col N="1207" /> me from the discussion we have had that there are members in all Parties represented in this House who are in agreement, at least with the principle of the motion.  I am very glad to note that, because I think that, in itself, is something and as long as we have that type of thinking, we are not entirely lost.  Secondly, I should like to say that I have no desire whatever either to embarrass or actually press my particular views on the Government by forcing a motion of this type on such a subject to a division, and I have no intention of doing so.  But I would like to say before I conclude that I am satisfied, having heard the discussion, that the motion has, in fact, served quite a useful purpose and there has been an interesting debate upon it. I want to thank all the Senators who have spoken on the motion, either in favour or against.  Finally, I should like to appeal to the Government at least to take note of the views, the very intelligent and strong views, which have been expressed in the course of the debate.  I hope that in future we shall hear&mdash;I trust from the Government side&mdash;something perhaps more constructive and far reaching than I could offer the House at this stage.  That is all I have to say about it, except again to thank all the members of the House who contributed to the debate.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann would welcome the alteration of the Department of Education regulations so as to prohibit altogether the use in Irish national schools of corporal punishment for girls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like, in proposing this motion, to say that, in my opinion, it ought to be possible some day, surely, to stop corporal punishment altogether in our schools for both boys and girls.  My aim in proposing this resolution was to suggest a valuable first step towards what I would regard as a normal objective.  I understand that the Minister is ill&mdash;I am glad to hear not <Col N="1208" /> seriously so&mdash;and presumably, cannot be present to-night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say on this motion is not directed against any individual Minister, but rather against a certain concept, perhaps, in the Department of Education, one that can be changed, one that has already indeed been modified.</P>
      <P>Now, my reason for proposing that corporal punishment be abolished in the case of girls is that it seems to me that such a motion is likely to be more widely accepted, not only in this House but outside, than if I were to propose the abolition of corporal punishment for both boys and girls, because, in the case of girls, there can be no valid argument about &ldquo;gangsters&rdquo; and &ldquo;little toughs&rdquo; and &ldquo;little hooligans&rdquo;, as sometimes is argued in relation to the beating of small boys, even small boys of eight and a half, such as the one I mentioned previously with reference to the County Clare case.  My view is that it ought not to be necessary for any teacher to have the right to give any form of corporal punishment to Irish girls from four to 14 years of age in our schools.  I would regard as basically bad educationally, any teaching method based upon corporal punishment, because of three conditions: (1) it is based upon fear; (2) it presents to the rest of the class the disedifying spectacle of a child being beaten by a grown-up, a girl at that; and (3) there is a very powerful force of bad example given to children who see a small girl being slapped by a grown-up. Sometimes the younger the child, the younger the observing child, the more likely is the moral to be drawn by it that no shame need be attached to hitting children smaller and weaker than itself.  The image, to my mind, of a man or a woman hitting a child with a stick is an unpleasant one, and one which I think we ought, at any rate in relation to girls, to be able to remove from our educational scene, in so far as the State, at any rate, directs it in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1209" /> I believe that the beating of children, the beating of girls in particular, has a brutalising effect, not only on those who receive the punishment, but also on those who see it, and, I fear, not infrequently on those who deal it out.</P>
    <P>Now, the present regulations permit corporal punishment only for &ldquo;grave transgressions.&rdquo;  I quoted before, and the Minister quoted here, regulation 96, the departmental regulation on the infliction of corporal punishment.  It contains the following clauses: (1) corporal punishment shall be administered only for grave transgression.  In no circumstances should corporal punishment be administered for mere failure at lessons; (2) only the principal teacher, or such other member of the staff as may be duly authorised by the manager for the purpose, shall inflict corporal punishment; (3) only a light cane or rod shall be used and punishment should be inflicted only on the open hand.  The boxing of children's ears and the pulling of hair and similar treatment is strictly forbidden; (4) no teacher should carry about a cane or other instrument of punishment; and, (5) frequent recourse to corporal punishment will be considered by the Minister as indicating bad tone and ineffective discipline.</P>
    <P>That is the present position in theory.  But, in fact, every parent in the country with children at national schools knows that punishment is not always confined to the open hand, that implements are, in fact, used other than the prescribed &ldquo;light rod or cane,&rdquo; and that corporal punishment is frequently administered for minor offences, including lateness, failure at lessons, and so on.  Yet the Minister strenously denies this, denies in fact, that, save in the most isolated cases, there is any corporal punishment at all for minor offences or failure at lessons! Now, I am certain that the Minister sincerely believes that, and I am equally certain that he is out of touch with the facts.  And so we have the position, in my submission, that the whole country knows that in this matter I have been telling the truth, and that the Minister has remained resolutely and indomitably ill-informed on the subject.  I have had many <Col N="1210" /> discussions with members of the public, with Senators, with Deputies, and even with Ministers, since I first raised the matter last June, and not one of them has denied that there is slapping and beating in schools for minor offences. Not one.  Nobody has said it does not happen.  Several have defended it, in spite of the fact that it breaks regulations. Some have even told me that they themselves are what they are, owing to the fact that they were beaten when they were at school.  Well, one does not always like to put the question, but it seems to me that that might be interpreted as meaning that had they not been beaten at school they might to-day have been even more shining examples of virtue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir.  I believe, as I say, that this unauthorised form of punishment, the beating of girls, does go on under a regulation which tolerates its use only for grave transgressions.  I believe that all kinds of minor offences are treated as if they were grave transgressions within the meaning of the regulations, and I believe that the Minister not only cannot check this abuse, but cannot even detect it.  It is for that reason that I contend that corporal punishment should be abolished altogether for girls.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is for the reason that I believe that this very &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;grave transgression&rdquo; has led to a breaking of the regulations, that I believe what I call this &ldquo;escape-clause&rdquo; should be removed, because then there could be no argument about what constitutes a &ldquo;grave transgression&rdquo;&mdash;incidentally, the regulations, the Department regulations, give no guidance as to what is meant by a &ldquo;grave transgression&rdquo;.  I say, in that case, that if we abolish corporal punishment altogether for girls, there could then be no argument about what constitutes a grave transgression; and everyone would know that all physical <Col N="1211" /> punishment for girls, would be, in fact, a breach of Department regulations.</P>
      <P>I suggested before that if the Minister found in practice that his regulations were unworkable, he should suggest modifications, rather than pretend that they were being observed, rather than connive at their being broken.  But I discovered, and I may say it was to my surprise, that the Minister was convinced that not only were his regulations workable, but that they are never broken, except in the rarest cases.  This leads me to feel that what I have called the escape-clause, allowing slapping and beating for grave transgressions, should be removed, at any rate for girls.</P>
      <P>When I raised this matter on the Adjournment last June in the Seanad, it was suggested by one Senator, and I think with certain justification, that it would have been fairer to the Seanad and to the Minister to put down a motion on the topic, and give other Senators and the Minister time to discuss the matter fully.  That is what I have done this time.  There will be no time to-night, but there will be time when next we assemble, I hope, to debate the matter as fully as is desired by any Senator, and I hope, personally, that that opportunity will be used.</P>
      <P>My own personal hope is that most Senators will support me in this proposal, which seems to me an eminently reasonable and acceptable one.  And I hope that those Senators who do not support me will make a reasonable case for the retention in our schools of the right to let small girls be physically punished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope, too, that the Minister, or his representative here, will give some indication of the kind of offence that he has in mind, when he permits, under the present regulations, beating for &ldquo;grave transgressions&rdquo;.  I may be unimaginative but I find it hard to imagine the discovery of what is somewhat pompously called &ldquo;grave transgressions&rdquo; on the part of little girls in schools.  I should like to ask him, therefore, to attempt to give some kind of indication as to what he has in mind <Col N="1212" /> in that phrase, to ask him, or his representative, how often would he expect such grave transgressions&mdash;meriting corporal punishment for girls&mdash; to appear in any girls' school per year; how many would he expect to appear per class; how many, on average, grave transgressions would he expect to be discovered per 100 girls in any school. I feel certain that the Minister will agree that true education should be based on affection and not on fear, and I am quite certain that the best of our teachers, and, indeed, the majority of our teachers, get their results from affection and not from fear.</P>

      <P>I feel certain, as I say, that the Minister will agree that true education should be based on affection and not on fear, on the lead given to the child, the girl in this case, and not on authority harshly imposed, on discipline encouraged to grow from within, rather than on discipline laid on with a stick.</P>
      <P>The Minister himself told us in the Seanad that in 1946 these regulations were modified, and I would say &ldquo;Splendid.&rdquo;  I think it is an excellent thing.  He made it quite clear what the modifications were in December, 1946, and what it was that prompted the Department at the time to send out a circular to all the schools.  The points changed were that it was stressed that when they said there should be only corporal punishment for boys and girls for &ldquo;grave transgressions&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
