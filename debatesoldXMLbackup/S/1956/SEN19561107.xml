    <Title>Superannuation Bill, 1956 (Certified Money Bill)&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amending Superannuation Bill is to enable a retiring civil servant to surrender, subject to certain conditions, part of his pension for his wife or for one dependent nominated by him.  A woman civil servant may provide a pension for a dependent.  I am sponsoring this Bill, which introduces a new feature into the superannuation code, in response to requests from staff representative bodies and I am glad to have the opportunity of promoting this much desired measure.  The pension payable under this Bill to the wife or other dependent of a civil servant will be the actuarial equivalent of the part of his own pension which he surrenders&mdash;so that in essence the civil servant is being given an option to distribute, within limits, the pension awarded to him or her under the Superannuation Acts.  No charge will be imposed for the administrative costs involved. These costs, which should not be very great, will be borne on public funds.</P>
      <P>The key section of the Bill is Section 3, which enables a civil servant to surrender part of his or her pension in return for the grant of a pension to a wife or to one specified dependent. Regulations are to be made under the section to provide for administrative procedures.  A statutory declaration will be required in proof of financial dependency and certain penalties are prescribed for the making of a false declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill contains the necessary definitions, the most important of which is that of &ldquo;dependent&rdquo; and Senators will notice that there is no reference there to the wife. <Col N="935" /> That is because the provisions of the Bill apply specifically to her.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that the pension to a wife or dependent shall be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of pension surrendered.  Actuarial tables showing the equivalents for various amounts according to the age of the civil servant and the beneficiary are being compiled and will be made available to all retiring civil servants. Where the beneficiary is a wife, an option is provided in Sections 5 and 6 for payment of her pension as from the date of her husband's death, or alternatively, from the date of her husband's retirement, at a rate which will be doubled after his death.  The rates of pension will vary with the option.</P>
    <P>Section 7 enables a life pension under the Act in favour of a young person to be converted into an annuity for a limited period of years.  This will be done only on the application of a parent or guardian and where it is considered that this step would be in the best interests of the beneficiary, for example where a short-term annuity at a higher rate would be of value during a period of maximum expenditure on education.</P>
    <P>Section 9 imposes certain limits on the amount of his pension which a retiring civil servant may surrender. This is to ensure that he shall not on the one hand divest himself of an unduly large proportion of his pension or, on the other hand, surrender so little that the beneficiary's pension would be trifling in amount.</P>
    <P>The benefits of the Bill will be available to civil servants retiring after the appointed day which will be fixed by order under Section 2 of the Bill.  It is necessary for me to fix a date by Order so that during the interval the regulations and necessary actuarial tables can be brought into final form and effect.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill are consequential and enable the Bill, as such, to be fitted into the superannuation code or to provide for due administration.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a benefit which <Col N="936" /> has been requested for a long time and, while providing that benefit, at the same time it does so in a manner which will mean that in the long run there will not be any additional charge on public funds.  I hope, therefore, it will commend itself to the House.</P>

      <P>No doubt this Bill is a well thought out measure and I suppose it is as a result of discussions that have taken place between the Minister for Finance and his Department and Civil Service representatives that it has been brought before the Oireachtas.  I do not know exactly how it is going to work out and there may be many people who would question the advisability of some sections of it, but at the same time if this arrangement has been approved by the Civil Service representatives, I suppose that should be good enough for us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  I regard it then more or less as an enabling Bill. It will enable civil servants who retire on pension to avail themselves of the provisions of this Bill, but they need not do so, if they like.  It is purely optional.  As to the question of surrendering part of the pension I have not bad time to study the Bill as well as I would like to, but is there any provision in it for the commutation of portion of the Civil Service pension; in other words, that some portion of the pension could be commuted to a bulk sum in certain instances at the discretion of the retiring civil servant in question?  I do not know if there is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of dependency also comes in.  Part of the pension can be surrendered for the benefit of the pensioner's wife and one dependent, as the Minister said, one specified dependent, and I take it that it is the pensioner who will specify the dependent <Col N="937" /> and that there can be only one dependent.  I take it that it will be up to the retiring civil servant to prove the dependency of the individual concerned by declaration, affidavit, or whatever one likes to call it.  This Bill will come into operation as and from the appointed date, but we have not yet been given the appointed date.  I suppose in no circumstances will it be made retrospective because it could happen that there would be people retiring at the present time, members of the Civil Service, and members would have already retired, who might like to avail themselves of its provisions.</P>
    <P>Would there be anything wrong in extending it to existing Civil Service pensioners?  I know that would open up a big field and the same argument has been put forward in connection with retired teachers.  Pensions has been a controversial matter for a long time and I do not think any satisfactory decision has ever been arrived at.  In any case, perhaps it would be as well if the Minister would give consideration to this question of taking existing Civil Service pensioners into account.  There is also the question of State servants generally.  I do not know what repercussions this Bill will have on State servants, apart from civil servants.</P>

      <P>Army, Gardaí and so on.  I do not think it can be argued that this will involve additional expenditure, except whatever administrative expenses will be involved.  It will be, one might say, an adjustment of the pension as between husband and wife and dependent.  We have no objection to the Bill from this side of the House, seeing that it has been given the consideration that the Minister tells us and has been requested by the Civil Service and the Civil Service representative body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we all agree with what the Minister said and what Senator Kissane has said about welcoming this Bill.  It is quite obvious that it meets a case which has been made by the civil servants, and <Col N="938" /> that it will be appreciated by them, and consequently will be approved, I think, by all of them without exception. Therefore, we in this House will, I assume, unanimously accept the general principles behind the Bill.</P>
      <P>It does seem to me, however, that this is a Bill which is pre-eminently capable of improvement in such a deliberative body as ours.  I noticed that in the Dáil the whole discussion was contained in two speeches, including that of the Minister, and that the Committee, and all other stages went through in about four and a half minutes.  I feel there are some clauses and some points of general principle which we ought to discuss before we pass this Bill and it is my contention there are some amendments&mdash;not very big ones&mdash;which might nevertheless be made.</P>
      <P>I should like, first, to consider the general principle of a pension.  The general principle behind granting a pension is a recognition of the fact that the salary is not sufficient to save on in order to provide for the old age of the worker concerned.  Therefore, the employer&mdash;in this case the State&mdash; grants, over and above the salary, a pension on retirement.  The point has been made before, in relation to superannuation of local authority servants, that many people accept posts with relatively low salaries because of the advantage they carry with them of having a pension at the end.  That is an understandable attitute of mind&mdash; accepting a post at a relatively low salary because it gives both security of tenure and a pension at the end of it.</P>
      <P>If you ask any of our civil servants why they were content to be civil servants when, in the business world, the commercial world, the world of the professions, they might reasonably, with their training and ability, have expected to earn more, £ for £, outside, I think, some would reply that the pension is a valuable part of the salary.  I think, that is basic, and it is the pension is a valuable part of the salary.  I think that is basic, and it is related to some of the things I want to suggest presently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the salary is not big enough to permit saving for old age, I would argue that, similarly, the pension deriving <Col N="939" /> from such a salary to the retiring civil servant is not big enough to allow him to save for the surviving years of his partner, his wife, his widow.  I think that is clearly demonstrated. The pension itself, being much smaller than the salary, would not be enough to enable him, out of that pension, to provide for whatever remaining years there would be for the surviving partner, or for the dependents, if the retired civil servant dies.  Therefore, the Government has quite rightly decided to introduce this Bill to allow a civil servant to make over, in advance, portion of his pension, which is part of his right, which is part of his salary, which is fully earned by him, which is not a charitable grant made to him by a kindly Government.  He is enabled by this Bill to make over part of that pension to be dependent should he die.</P>
    <P>Basically, I take it that the salary given to a married civil servant is regarded as big enough to support himself, his wife and his family.  I say it is &ldquo;regarded&rdquo; as being sufficient. That might be open to private discussion. Nevertheless, the general assumption is that the salary paid to the married civil servant is big enough to support himself, his wife and family and is intended to cover such expenditure. Therefore, I would contend that the pension is calculated with a view to making it big enough to support the retired pensioner and his wife&mdash;one may assume, perhaps, that the family is self-supporting by that time.</P>
    <P>I would contend that, just as the wife might be taken to have a right to a share of the man's salary, so, too, the wife has a right to a share of his pension.  Although the pension is not paid to her, in common equity and in common justice, the pension right ought to vest in the wife as much as in the husband.  Consequently, I would say there ought to be a continuing right, if the husband dies, in respect of the surviving years of the widow.  I would say that this Bill does not quite recognise that, but recognises at any rate the right of the pensioner to give some of his pension to his widow, should he die.  I cannot help wondering <Col N="940" /> whether that is sufficiently generous. The Minister has made it clear that the State will not lose any money by this measure.  They have worked it all out.  It has been done on an actuarial basis.  The basis is that the civil servant may make over some of his pension rights for the sake of his widow and family, but we are not going to lose a farthing by it; there will be no loss to the State.</P>
    <P>I feel that, although civil servants have requested this Bill, yet if they were not civil servants, shall we say, they might be inclined to say, when both Houses of the Oireachtas, have passed it, &ldquo;Thank you&mdash;for nothing&rdquo;, because what we are giving them is the right to give some of their own money to some of their own family.  I feel, therefore, that this right by itself is not sufficient&mdash;in other words, this giving of the right to a civil servant to provide for his widow out of his own pension rights, sacrificed in advance is not enough.  The idea behind it is good but it is not couched in sufficiently generous terms.  To make quite clear what I mean: I should like to see a widow being granted half the value other deceased husband's pension as an automatic right.  That would cost the State money, of course.  However, I would like to feel that the Minister would be prepared at least to give that proposal some consideration&mdash;the recognition of the right of the widow to some pension in her own right.  I should say that the ordinary expenses of life will be for her at least half what they were when her husband was alive, if she is the surviving partner.</P>
    <P>I should like a Bill which, quite simply, would allow the Government to pay half the civil servant's pension to the surviving partner.  My criticism is not of the basic principle of the Bill, but of its being hedged round with exclusions and exceptions which will be found in the Bill as it is at present framed.  I think it would be unfair to say that the major aim of the farmers of the Bill has been to see to it that the State does not lose anything by it. Nevertheless, one feels that they have not given much away&mdash;by conceding the right to a man on his retiral from the Civil Service to give some of his <Col N="941" /> pension money away to his family.  The State is not giving anything at all. The Minister has told us just now that there will be no loss to the State.</P>
    <P>I should like now, therefore, to examine some of the precautionary clauses with which this Bill is surrounded.  I would refer to Section 3, sub-section 4 (b) which reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;a person shall not be entitled to make a surrender under this Act unless the Minister decides that the person is of sound health.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That means that this surrender has to be made before retirement, and that a civil servant whose health is not first-class will be excluded by the conditions of the Bill.  A civil servant who is not in sound health will not be covered by this Bill!  The Minister has to be satisfied, after medical examination, that the person who wants to make this kind of surrender of his own pension right&mdash;for which he has worked and for which he has made sacrifices in terms of salary&mdash;is in sound health: he will not have the right to give that up if he is not in sound health.</P>
    <P>What civil servants are most likely to be actively and urgently concerned with this right to make provision for their dependents and widows, should they die?  They are those very civil servants who are not in sound health. More, by far, than those who are in good health, those who are not in good health will be worried, will be concerned, and will wish to avail themselves of the power granted by this Bill to provide, out of their own hard-won pensions, for their widows and dependents.  However, by this clause they are excluded.  I feel entitled to call that kind of discrimination and that kind of &ldquo;hedging round&rdquo; ungenerous. Those who will most feel the need of this newly-granted right are automatically deprived of that right by the Bill itself!  I feel that that is a bad principle.</P>
    <P>I notice also, and it is a related objection on my part, that, under Section 3, this surrender right shall be granted to male established civil servants retiring on or after the appointed day &ldquo;otherwise than on the <Col N="942" /> ground of ill-health&rdquo;.  That is another section of the Civil Service to be excluded from the use of this Bill, namely, civil servants who retire, not on reaching the retirement age, but by reason of ill-health.  This may be ill-health contracted in the course of their duties as civil servants.  If they are bound for medical reasons to retire on grounds of ill-health, they will not be allowed to make over any of their pension in this way to any of their dependents or their widow.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I notice that in Section 3, sub-section (4) (f) we find:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a person is required to undergo medical examination under the regulations, the person shall be responsible for payment of the fee for the examination.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister requires that the person shall undergo a medical examination, but the civil servant pays the fee.  That is a very small point and probably only a question of a guinea or two, but I wonder if the basic principle is sound. Who asks for the medical examination? The Minister.  Who pays for it?  The victim, the person being examined.  It may be an unnecessary request; the examination may prove that there was no need for it.  It may be a case of over-caution on the part of the Minister requiring such an examination, but the civil servant is the person who has to pay for it.  Oddly enough, I note under Section 12, sub-section (2) that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...the sums received by the Minister in respect of medical examinations for the purposes of this Act shall be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in such manner as the Minister may direct.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These few odd guineas will go to the Exchequer.  I think that rather odd: I should like to see this Bill giving rights to the Minister to pay for any medical examinations he sees fit to prescribe.</P>
    <P>Furthermore&mdash;and this point is related to this question of the health either of the retired pensioner or of his dependents&mdash;I notice in Section 7, sub-section (2) (c) that, in the case of the substitution of a certain pension <Col N="943" /> grant for another form of grant, the Minister may require the dependent to undergo medical examination and so on.  In paragraph (b), before that, the Bill says that a substitution shall not be made unless the Minister decides that the dependent is in good health. Apparently you are not allowed to make a child, a dependent of yours, the beneficiary of an annuity under this kind of Bill, unless you can show that your child is in good health.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has considered fully the implications of that. Clearly, of course, if the child is suffering from some disease from which it may die before being able to benefit from whatever annuity or pension is made over to it by its father, this clause will protect the child and protect the pensioner; but supposing the child is suffering from a mental affliction. That child may live for very many years; it cannot be said to be &ldquo;in good health&rdquo;; and so the pensioner will be precluded from making any provision for it under the terms of this sub-section.  Again, perhaps the full implications of that have not been considered.</P>
    <P>There is one other point before I ask two questions.  It is in connection with the definition of the dependents. This is in Section 1, sub-section (1), line 15.  The dependents are pretty widely defined.  I am not going to read them out but you will see that almost every legitimate possibility is catered for, every person fairly near to the pensioner.  It includes his father, mother, step-father, step-mother, son, daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law and so on.  I should like to make a plea that two others be added to this list.  I know that the Minister said in the Dáil that the list was made pretty wide, and that it was felt there had to be such a list because it could not be endlessly extended.  I should like to see the addition of the mother-in-law and the father-in-law.  The mother-in-law is regarded as a subject for music hall comedy, but I would suggest that in real life the mother-in-law is the person who is frequently turned to in times of stress.  I could imagine a case of a pensioner who was a widower <Col N="944" /> and whose wife's family&mdash;his father-in law and mother-in-law&mdash;were living with him and whose mother-in-law in fact had been of the greatest assistance to him in the bringing up of his motherless children.  It is quite obvious that in such cases such a mother-in-law and such a father-in-law will be very really dependents, a very close part of the family; yet under this Bill, although such a mother-in-law may, in fact, be the only surviving dependent, in the real sense of the word, the children having grown up, she is not included in this clause, nor is the father-in-law included, and they cannot be beneficiaries under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would stress here that, as Senator Kissane has said, this is an enabling Bill, giving discretionary power. Nobody is forcing the pensioner to give up portion of his pension to his father-in-law or mother-in-law&mdash;or to his father, mother or wife for that matter&mdash;but it enables him to do so. I contend that there would be cases of hardship were the mother-in-law or the father-in-law to be excluded from these clauses, and I should like to see an amendment accepted which would allow them to be included.</P>
    <P>There are just two questions I should like to ask the Minister before sitting down.  One is in relation to Section 4. The Minister has quoted portion of that section and has explained that the pension under this Bill shall be &ldquo;of such value as, on the date of retirement, is actually equivalent&rdquo;, and so on.  I should like a little explanation of that.  I take it that that means the pension will be calculated on the average expectation of life of the pensioner at such and such an age, or of the ordinary average person.  It is stated here that the Minister is having tables drawn up in connection with this problem.  I should like a little more explanation from the Minister as to the basis upon which these tables will be drawn up.  Are they to be average tables relating to a cross-section of the population, or are they to relate to particular professions; or, in other words, how is the expectation of life to be calculated?</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister will these actuarial tables not be upset by <Col N="945" /> the fact that by this Act we shall have excluded from its jurisdiction people in bad health?  I wonder if the Minister has adverted to the fact that the exclusion of civil servants in bad health means that the people to whom the Act will apply are all people presumed to be in good health and who would consequently actuarially be expected to have a longer expectation of life than if the Minister did not, by the terms of the Bill, exclude those who were not in a good risk, who were in poor health.  Will the actuarial tables take that into account?</P>
    <P>My second question relates to Section 9.  I should like to ask whether Section 9 is necessary at all?  It seems to me to be a clumsy section.  Its aim is to see to it that the pensioner does not give up too much or too little.  I do not intend to read the whole section, but I would ask Senators to read it themselves and to ask themselves whether it is not clumsy and whether it is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>One final question I should like to ask in connection with Section 3, sub-section (4), paragraph (e).  I feel this paragraph is not very happily phrased and I would like to know whether it could not be redrafted?  It reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Notice of a surrender shall become null and void if, on a day on which the person wishing to make a surrender under this Act is an established civil servant, either that person or the proposed grantee of the pension under this Act dies,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The meaning of that is, I think, fairly clear: if a person dies before he can fulfil this surrender, the whole thing becomes null and void, but I wonder if that could not be expressed in simpler terms and if the intention could not be more clearly expressed? As I say, I believe this is a good Bill, but hedged around with too many precautionary devices.  I should like to see it slightly more &ldquo;givish&rdquo;, more generous, and I should like to see amendments made along the lines which I have suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I, of course, welcome this Bill It appears to me to be in a form <Col N="946" /> rather similar to what is in most industrial schemes and from such experience as I have had of such schemes, I do not feel the Bill is hedged around with so many difficulties as Senator Sheehy Skeffington has suggested.  Most of the precautions in it are what are ordinarily found necessary in such a scheme.</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), I wonder would it be possible not to make the limitation to one dependent.  One might easily have the case of a civil servant with several young children, and, as I understand it, under this Bill, he could make provision for only one of them. In that connection, I turn to clause 7 which, I think, is a very wise clause. I understand that clause to mean that where there is a minor child, instead of that child receiving a pension for life, which might be quite a small thing, the Minister will have power under certain circumstances to substitute larger payments during the period of the child's youth and education.</P>

I think it is an extremely wise thing that, instead of the child receiving perhaps quite a small pension for the whole of its life, which might not be very much use to it, the Minister has power under that section to make a larger payment.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to clause 3 (e) and commented upon the possible ambiguity of the wording: &ldquo;...on a day on which the person wishing to make a surrender dies&rdquo;, the person being a civil servant.  I wanted to criticise that clause in another way.  It does seem to me that it might be implied from that that if a person was not merely wishing to make the surrender but had actually taken steps in that direction of some kind and were then to die, the benefit might be lost.  That, of course, raises the question of the date on which the person may make these provisions.  It seems to me that it might be a fair thing to say that a person, knowing he would have to provide for his wife, <Col N="947" /> widow and dependents, should be able to make these provisions and that once he does so finally, his death before the date of retirement should not upset these provisions.  I think, as drafted, sub-paragraph (e) is a bit ambiguous and would want to be clarified.  I do not think its meaning is quite clear. There are some minor points on which I should like to amend the Bill such as the deletion of the final bracket of paragraph (c), in sub-section (4) of Section 3.  The printer provides a bracket at the end but forgot there was no bracket at the beginning, but these are minor matters.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I think it is an excellent measure which will be of very great advantage to quite a large section of the community.  There are considerable administrative difficulties, but apparently the Minister is satisfied they can be got over.  I agree with a good deal of what Senator Sheehy Skeffington said as far as the position of a dependent is concerned.  I do feel that the widow should have some definite rights, so far as State pensions are concerned.  In other countries, it is the practice that where a pensioner dies, his widow automatically continues to receive for her life something in the nature of 50 per cent. of the pension.  It would be very desirable if we were able to do that right away in this country and I hope it will be economically possible to do it; but in the meantime I welcome this measure and I regard it as making a very good start in attempting to make better provision for the dependents of pensioners.  It is something for which I feel we have made in many ways inadequate provision in our legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very disappointed with some of the conditions outlined with regard to dependents qualifying.  I look at this whole Bill as something which will enable a man to make provision for his wife and children, if he feels he is not going to be there as the breadwinner. It therefore seems that the whole purpose of the Bill is to some extent defeated, if there are to be these very stringent conditions in regard to <Col N="948" /> medical examinations.  I can remember one case where a man whose health was not in very good condition, elected in the interests of his family not to have a retirement pension so that certain grants or pensions would fall to his dependents in the case of his death.  There was at that time no medical examination.</P>
    <P>I could understand that there should be an inquiry into the man's health and that it should be ascertained if he were physically fit at the time; but putting the whole thing on a medical examination basis as, for example, in the case of an insurance policy, I think entirely defeats the whole idea of the Bill.  Really, it makes the measure of very little value in the case where it would be most needed.  I wonder if the Minister would be prepared to reconsider some of the conditions which he is apparently going to lay down, so far as the medical examination is concerned in regard to the pensioner and his dependents?</P>

      <P>Possibly no member of this Seanad has views more divergent from mine on many matters than has Senator Sheehy Skeffington, but in a democracy one of the things that makes it so pleasant is that one can hold different views from other people and express them vigorously.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington and I have expressed divergent views vigorously on many occasions, but, notwithstanding all that, I am particularly glad to see him back here to-day restored, I hope, to complete good health after his serious illness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Kissane opened the debate and asked me whether it is possible to commute portion of the pension.  The Senator is aware that, under the ordinary superannuation arrangements, a civil servant on retirement gets partly a lump sum gratuity and partly a pension. The lump sum gratuity can be allocated in certain ways.  The pension is what we are dealing with in this Bill and we do not provide in this Bill that any part of the pension can be commuted. <Col N="949" /> It will hardly be necessary to do so, in view of the existence of the lump sum gratuity arrangements.</P>
      <P>Quite frankly, I have not given consideration to whether it will be desirable to extend these terms to the Army or the Garda Síochána.  The usual practice in respect of State servants, taking them in that wider sense and not in the other sense, is that legislative matters will be dealt with in respect of the normal civil servants, first of all, and after legislation has been considered for civil servants, consideration will be given to the question whether it is desirable to extend that to other persons, such as the Senator suggested, the Army and the Garda, who are paid by the State.  The Minister for Defence and the Minister for Justice will not be slow to come at me if the representative bodies in those cases are anxious to consider this problem.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington, I am afraid, completely misconstrues two things&mdash;one in principle and the other in administrative detail.  I do not accept in principle his view in relation to pensions.  I do not think that payment of the amount required is intended to maintain a civil servant, his wife and family.  It is on a slightly different basis&mdash;the basis that at that age the family has grown up.  A contract of service in any business, whether State or anything else, presupposes decisions on certain basic principles on which the quantum of the payment should be made.  A very different quantum would be made if as suggested by Senator Sheehy Skeffington and Senator ffrench O'Carroll the quantum of the payment must provide not merely a pension for the person who is employed, but, in addition, a pension for his widow.  The actuarial difference would be very substantial and would involve a much bigger charge for superannuation on public funds.  The contract does not provide for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that respect, I must make it quite clear beyond question that in the present circumstances I cannot accept at all any suggestion that would mean there would be additional charges on the Exchequer for payments to State <Col N="950" /> servants in the manner suggested by some of the Senators.</P>
    <P>The second point on which I and Senator Sheehy Skeffington differ is this: I do not think the Senator understands the administrative method by which this surrender will take place. We have not got actuarial tables based on experience in the Irish Civil Service, but there are special tables available for our consideration in respect of service based on the British Civil Service and for a scheme similar to this.  Those tables, based in that way, got over the difficulty in relation to what is known in insurance parlance as bad lives.  The whole purpose of the provisions as regards health here is that the actuarial tables are framed on the basis of a person in good health.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, we were not to restrict the application of this Bill to persons of good health, we would be applying for the purposes of this Bill tables suitable for a person of good health but operative for a person not of good health.  One could, I suppose, consider loading the actuarial tables in the same way as life insurance policies are frequently loaded.  That would make a great deal of difference and difficulty in relation to the administrative costs, and I think it would be wise first, whatever about moving on to that at a later stage, if we got this scheme in operation in relation to the ordinary form of administration.</P>
    <P>It is commonplace, of course, in life insurance that a person insures, or more strictly accurately, is anxious to insure, at the actuarial table rates equivalent to a good health even though he is not a good life.  It is for that reason, apart from industrial insurance, that the ordinary company requires a medical examination, but the whole basis upon which this Bill is framed would be lost if it were not for the medical examination, because that and that alone provides the actuarial tables that will be used and, in fact, the actuarial tables correct for the applicant in question.</P>
    <P>There were some other comments on drafting, notably in relation to Section 3, sub-section (4) (e), raised by Senator Sheehy Skeffington and <Col N="951" /> Senator Cox, from different angles.  I think it might be better if we left discussion on that until the Committee Stage.  I must confess I was a little bit started by Senator Sheehy Skeffington's suggesting that, though that paragraph was badly drafted, it was quite clear what it meant.</P>

      <P>If a clause is quite clear when it is read, even four or five times, it is still well drafted.  I am not quite satisfied that it is even so clear as the Senator suggests.  Perhaps that is something lacking in my interpretation of it.  We will consider it between now and the Committee Stage. The point in relation to Section 7 is exactly as set out by Senator Cox.  It is an endeavour to import into this scheme something analogous to the insurance policy that can be taken out to provide for the education of one's children.  It is an endeavour to translate that type of protection into the framework of this allocation of pension scheme.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington indicated that he would wish to move certain amendments, and of course I am absolutely at the disposal of the House for the purpose of considering amendments on the Committee Stage, but if the House would not mind, in that event, I would ask that the Committee Stage be not until this day fortnight as I expect to be engaged in the Dáil during the whole of next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. P. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to extend to the 31st March, 1960, the period within which the erection, enlargement or improvement of a building must be completed in order to qualify for the two-thirds remission of rates for seven years provided by Part II of the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Act, 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part II of the 1954 Act provided for the granting of two-thirds remission of rates for a period of seven years on the valuation of new buildings and on the total increase in valuation of existing <Col N="954" /> buildings that are enlarged or improved, where the work on the construction, enlargement or improvement was begun and completed in the period commencing on 27th July, 1953, and ending on 26th July, 1956.  The remission did not apply to houses erected by local authorities under the Labourers Acts or the Housing of the Working Classes Acts and owned by a local authority, houses in respect of which grants or rates remission were given under the Housing Acts, or under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts, farm buildings receiving relief from rates under Section 14 of the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, or premises in respect of which a local authority has decided to remit rates under Section 9 of the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952.  Subject to these exceptions the remission applies to all buildings including hotels, shops, factories, offices and dwelling houses.  Where a building is enlarged during the prescribed period and in the revised valuation following that enlargement, earlier improvements or additions are taken into account, the remission also applies to those earlier improvements and additions.</P>
    <P>Legislation granting rates remission in respect of new or improved buildings for an initial period after their construction or improvement has been in operation for over 30 years.  In the years 1920 to 1939 all buildings of the type covered by the present Bill received rates remission.  Between the years 1939 and 1953, however, the remission was confined to dwellinghouses. The 1954 Act, which was introduced by my predecessor, restored the concession of rates remission to buildings other than dwellinghouses. Statistics as to the number of buildings which received this remission are not readily available but on a rough estimate, however, it would appear that about 1,500 premises per annum received the benefit of the Act.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, this type of rates remission legislation has never been on a permanent basis but has been continued by Acts whose duration was limited.  The reason for this is that a concession of this nature, which is paid for by the ratepayers, must be <Col N="955" /> subject to review from time to time lest in changing circumstances it might be imposing an unnecessary burden on the ratepayers.  In the course of the debates on the previous Bill many members of the Oireachtas expressed the opinion that its period of application was too short.  My predecessor, in reply, pointed out that the question of an extension could be considered when the period of application of the Bill expired.</P>
    <P>I consider that there is still need for the concession given by the 1954 Act.  I think that from the national point of view the impetus it gives to building projects more than compensates for the extra levy it places on the ratepayers.  I feel, therefore, that this concession should be continued for a further period and, accordingly, I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>

    <P>I have not very much to say about this Bill because, as I have said already, it is a continuing measure.  It proposes to continue the operation of existing legislation for a few more years until 31st March, 1960.  There is no alteration of any kind, as far as I can see, being made in the existing Acts dealing with this question of the remission of rates, and there is to be no departure from Part 2 of the 1954 Act, providing for a grant of two-thirds remission of rates for a period of seven years on the valuation of new buildings and on the total increase in valuation of existing buildings that are enlarged or improved.  I do not know, first of all, before I deal with a few further points I have in mind, how the title of this Bill came to be couched in the terminology that we have before <Col N="956" /> us.  It is called the Local Government (Temporary Reduction of Valuation) Bill.  As far as I can see, it is not a temporary reduction of valuation, but a temporary remission of rates, and the two things are not the same.  They are two different things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Reduction of valuation surely means remission of rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>One is based on the other, so I would advise the Minister to look into the terminology of the title of the Bill.</P>
      <P>As to the two-thirds remission of rates, as we call it, for seven years, there is no improvement and no change.  It is meant to be a continuation of the seven year period.  One would have thought that, having regard to all the difficulties that lie in the way of people who propose to build new houses or reconstruct existing houses, an improvement in the concession of a seven year period might be considered.  As I have said before &mdash;I think, in this House&mdash;the greater the cost of building, the higher the valuation will be in some cases and, generally speaking, the greater the cost of building, the more difficult it is for the person in question to face the task.  That being so, it would be understood if there was a greater encouragement given to such an individual at the present time, but instead we are just continuing what has been in existence for a number of years and taking our stand on legislation that was framed at the time when building did not present the same difficulties as it presents to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand also from the Minister's statement that buildings such as hotels, shops, factories and offices, as well as dwelling houses, are to be covered by this measure.  That also was contained in the 1954 Act.  However, there is one question which I should like to bring before the Minister, namely, the question of valuations.  Senators may remember that, some time ago, an attempt was made to have the valuations in this country revised, because it was believed that in many cases valuations were too high and it was also considered that some valuations were too low.  The reconsideration of <Col N="957" /> valuations is very important because on it depends the striking of rates.  As everybody knows, where certain people get away with very low valuations, the burden has to be borne by people who have high valuations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, feel that this Bill is very desirable.  If we are to encourage and promote building, and particularly to prevent buildings from falling into decay, or encourage schemes of desirable reconstruction of premises, then the Bill is, I think, very appropriate.  I am glad the Minister has seen fit to continue the Bill which the Minister for Local Government brought in in 1954, for a further six <Col N="958" /> years.  If that were not done in these days of high rates and increasing valuations, people who require to build or reconstruct premises would be up against fairly serious financial problems and it would reduce still further the number employed in the building trade.  Even as it is, I feel that under Section 12 of the 1954 Act, where a supplementary grant is paid, valuations may be increased and people may have to pay on a 100 per cent. increased valuation where the valuation officer decides that a revision of the valuation of the premises at that date was out of date and that the Bill would only affect that part of the premises on which reconstruction had taken place.  If that is the position, the Minister should do something to ensure that people will not be restricted to one-third rates for seven years on the increased valuation only.</P>
      <P>The fear that valuations will be increased deters people from carrying out desirable schemes of reconstruction and improvement and they allow premises to fall into disrepair. Whether it is a scheme of decoration or the putting in of a shop window in a business premises, or simply a question of painting a premises.  I feel something should be done to inform the public that, in itself, that will not necessitate an increased valuation of their premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fear that the public feel that to carry out any scheme of decoration or improvement would tend to focus the spotlight of the Valuation Office on their premises and that, for that reason, many people do not make the improvements which are necessary and desirable.  It is something similar to what obtained in the old days before we achieved fixity of tenure and fair rents when the landlord increased the valuation of a tenant's holding when the tenant carried out any improvement.  If that is the case and if, under an Irish Government, we want buildings to improve to the extent to which they should be allowed to improve, the extension of seven years may not be sufficient.  I understood that, under Section 9 of the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, the period is ten years.  I would respectfully <Col N="959" /> ask the Minister to consider, even at this stage, extending the Bill from a seven-year period to a ten-year period on the one-third valuation.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the provisions of this Bill should be made permanent. At present, local government law is a complete labyrinth.  The passing of temporary Bills which are repeated periodically seems only to add to it.  It does not seem to me that this measure is permanent, but rather that it may be taken whenever it is desired to do so.</P>
      <P>As regards the argument about the Bill itself, might I point out that it is really a reduction of valuations, because what the Bill says is that for the purpose of assessing the rate, the valuation is deemed to be reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Minister for bringing in this Bill, but I cannot be too generous in my thanks because I believe that the whole valuation laws of this country are bristling with anomalies.  Any progressive person in any town who does anything feels that injustice will be applied to him by the operation of the Acts which we have on the Statute Book.  That is bad; it is bad for the Government to leave bad laws on the Statute Book.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the bad laws as they apply to valuations. A valuation officer mentioned to me a certain place on which he was going to put an increased valuation.  He said that the place might be let for £6 a week and he was going to put on a valuation accordingly.  I said that there were nearly 100 other houses in that street and I asked him if all the premises could be let for £6.  He said they could not.  &ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;would that be the letting valuation?&rdquo; They apply an arbitrary thing &mdash;because, say, there is a black market in property during a certain period, they apply that as the letting value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that they will have to go back to the original Valuation Act of <Col N="960" /> 1852.  This matter was raised at the meeting of municipal authorities this year and it was discussed at some length.  I believe they will have to go back and relate the valuations of properties in towns to some fixed notion like the related value.  Land was valued by Griffith in the 1850s on what crops it produced, and so on. There ought to be some notional value in regard to property.  In every town in Ireland, you find that 10 per cent. of the property has been valued within the past 15 years and the rest has not been valued for 100 years. That means that 90 per cent. of the people feel they are suffering from an injustice.  When there has been revaluation, what has happened is that the revaluation takes place on the basis of the 1954 Act, or whatever Act it was, and there were the cases of Waterford and that of Buncrana.</P>
    <P>I am not going to develop that any further, as I do not think it is fair, but, in passing, I should mention that the municipal authorities, who come up against this much more than the county councils do, feel that something ought to be done to investigate the position and to try to remedy it.  It is not going to be remedied by a revaluation of the country.  That would only mean that the townspeople would be asked to pay all the rates and then the country men would take no interest in future, as they would be almost completely derated.  That would not be a good solution to the problem.</P>

I think also that the number of years being put on to the remission of rates is not sufficient.

      <P>If it is proper to have an amendment to extend the period beyond 1960, I would be prepared to put down an amendment that that be done.  I am digressing for a moment. Picture the man who builds his own house, which is a bungalow, on land which was virgin soil, whose rateable valuation was only 35/- an acre, going out into undeveloped land; and the next thing is that the valuer comes along and puts £15, £16 or often £20 on very modest houses as valuation.  In most places the rates now are about £2 in the £ valuation.  I think the Minister will have to make up his mind to extend the period, when he is dealing with valuations, and that he will have to extend the remission beyond 1960.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Where the erection, enlargement or improvement of a building is begun and completed during the prescribed period and an increase in the valuation of a tenement including the building or part of the building is made by reason solely or partly of the erection, enlargement or improvement, the valuation of the tenement shall be deemed to be reduced for rating purposes by two-thirds of the increase.&rdquo;</P>

The oft-maligned and many times forgotten old Cumann na nGaedheal Government of 1925 are the people who deserve the credit for the first introduction of a Bill such as this &mdash;not only in 1925 but again in 1927 when a similar Bill was introduced to enable local authorities to make certain remission of rates.  The Act of 1954 was merely a continuation.  These Acts were introduced down through the years.</P>

I think it was Senator Walsh who gave as one of his reasons why there should be a longer period of remission than seven years &ldquo;to ensure that we would not reduce the number of people employed in the building trade&rdquo;. That is an expression being bandied not only around this House and the Oireachtas but around the country generally and it will come as a surprise to Senators to know that the total number of houses being built or reconstructed in this country on 30th September, 1955, was 32,711 and that the total number of houses being built or reconstructed on 30th September, 1956, was 34,129.</P>

My Department is responsible for the paying of the grants and I take it they are correct in the figures they give me and it is unfair for the Senator to say I am misleading this House with figures which are not correct.  I am giving the figures now and I stand over them.  The total number of houses being built and reconstructed by local authorities and by private individuals, on 30th September, 1955, was 32,711 and on 30th September, 1956, was 34,129.  We hear these sweeping statements being made that there is less building now than there was 12 months ago, although the figures contradict those statements.  When we are talking about the building trade generally, £200,000 more was spent on the building of national schools this year than last year and £250,000 more is being spent on the building of vocational schools than was spent last year.</P>

The State then goes further and gives him a loan and not only that but they give him a remission of rates.  I think the State does quite a lot to encourage the building of houses and when I find Senators like Senator Walsh and Senator Burke advocating an extension from seven to 15 years of the remission of rates to increase the rates on the ratepayers in such places as Tipperary and Donegal, I cannot agree with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The health of our live stock is of paramount importance to the national economy.  It is fortunate, therefore, that there is now on the market a very wide range of economical and proven remedies which, under veterinary guidance, can be used very effectively in the treatment of many of the major live-stock diseases present in this country.  That farmers generally are becoming alive to this position and are taking increasing advantage of it is reflected in the marked reduction that has taken place in the losses formerly suffered from such conditions as white scour, contagious abortion and parasitic infestation.  There is much ground still to be made up, however, and one of the essentials to further progress is to put an end to the widespread and persistent abuses in connection with the sale of certain alleged animal remedies which are at their best useless and in many cases can be positively harmful and to encourage instead the use of remedies which have a real medicinal value.  That is the purpose of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The damage caused by these quack medicines goes further than the mere cheating of the purchaser.  People who buy them are led away from applying proper remedies or from calling in expert professional advice in exactly <Col N="968" /> those cases where it may be most necessary. Wrong treatment may mean the death of the animal.  Sometimes the disease can be of a transmissible nature and irreparable damage may be done to other animals on the farm&mdash;perhaps on neighbouring farms&mdash;by the lack of proper medicines and attention.  Furthermore, the farmer who suffers as a result of using a spurious remedy sold to him under the persuasion of an eloquent salesman will be biased against all veterinary medicine, good or bad.</P>
    <P>The existing law does not in practice enable effective measures to be taken to deal with the sale of quack remedies and the present Bill has been drafted accordingly.  The Bill envisages two types of control measures. The first of these (set out in Section 5) requires in the case of every commercial animal remedy that the name of the remedy, its composition, the specific remedial property or properties claimed and the name and address of the manufacturer and the packer be disclosed on the container and on any outer wrapper and that advertisements about the remedy should contain the same information.  (The disclosure of additional particulars may be required by regulations made after consultation with the Consultative Committee provided for in Section 4.)</P>
    <P>The second type of control provided for in Section 7 empowers the Minister, after consultation with the Consultative Committee, to make regulations for the control (including control by licence) of the manufacture, preparation, packing, import or sale of animal remedies.  It is intended that this latter provision would be implemented, on the advice of the Consultative Committee, should Section 5 alone be found in practice not to be a complete deterrent to present abuses.  It is believed, however, that the obligatory disclosure of the composition etc. of animal remedies should go a long way towards putting an end to the sale of quack products because farmers will know what exactly is being offered for the prices charged and sellers of such products who contravene the provisions of the Bill will be liable to proceedings. At the same time, it should be <Col N="969" /> understood that Section 7 will undoubtedly be put into operation if the Minister, in consultation with the Consultative Committee, at any time considers that this is necessary.</P>
    <P>The Consultative Committee provided for in Section 4 has a parallel in the similar committee which functions under the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1932.  It will consist of experienced persons who will be in a position to advise the Minister in the making of regulations.  It is intended that the committee will include representatives of the Veterinary Council, the Pharmaceutical Society, the Department of Health and the farmers.</P>
    <P>Discussions in regard to the proposed legislation have taken place with professional and trade interests concerned and in framing the Bill regard has been had so far as is practicable to their views.</P>

      <P>I am sure that everyone will welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister on introducing it.  It will appeal to farmers and lovers of animals and to those who value the welfare of the nation as a whole.  Its object is to put down quackery and, with it, loss to farmers &mdash;which is obviously something that will command our universal sympathy. But, in eradicating the quack and his quackery, it seems to me that we must be careful not to impose any undue trouble on the respectable purveyors and manufacturers of animal remedies. We cannot, I suppose, apply fully the parable of the wheat and the tares here.  You will remember, Sir, how in that case when a farmer reported that there were tares among the wheat and wanted to pull them out, he was given the highest authority for leaving them alone for fear of damaging the good wheat in taking out the tares.  We cannot do that here and the analogy is not complete&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true but as the Minister will see, I am on his side in what follows.  It is <Col N="970" /> quite clear that we must in that case pull out at least some of the tares, but we must&mdash;and I think the Minister will agree in this&mdash;take care not to damage the good corn in doing so.  I suggest that the Bill may, perhaps, in one or two points, cause inconvenience or perhaps harm to the respectable purveyors and manufacturers of animal remedies.</P>
      <P>I propose, if there is some support for these views, to put down amendments later and deal with the matter on Committee Stage.  But I should like to draw the attention of the House to one or two points at this stage.  In the first section, it says that the Act shall come into operation six months after the passing thereof. It has been suggested to me by some of those respectable purveyors and manufacturers of animal remedies that it would be a little hard for them to have to scrap their existing stocks of labels, which may be extensive and expensive, within six months, and that if the Minister would extend the period to one year, he might save them a good deal of expense without, perhaps, unduly harming the implementation of the Bill.  I do suggest perhaps that six months is a little drastic.  I appreciate that the Bill may not go through very quickly and in that case the manufacturers will have eight, nine or ten months' notice and may not suffer any hardship.  But to have to scrap half a year's labels would be a little hard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rather more important is a point in the second section.  This says&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;advertisement&rsquo; includes any notice, poster, pamphlet, circular, label, wrapper or other like document.&rdquo; As the section stands it might be construed to include wholesalers' catalogues.  If so, it would mean that in these already bulky wholesalers' catalogues there would have to be included fairly elaborate formulae, which might double or treble these already bulky publications.  If the Minister would be good enough to keep that in mind and perhaps make a Government amendment, or accept an amendment from me, to exclude that possibility, I think some people would be grateful. <Col N="971" /> I think it is a reasonable query on this section, the point being that these wholesalers are not in any sense responsible for the formulae and if they have to reprint it in their catalogues it is going to make an enormous publication.</P>
    <P>On Section 5, there is another question which I think is worth considering, although I can see it is a somewhat delicate matter of policy, both of public and of business policy.  Section 5, sub-section 1, clause (a) says that the appropriate commercial common name of the remedy or, if it contains more than one ingredient, of each ingredient, shall be printed on the wrapper.  In many of these remedies there is a passive base which may be water or something else, which is inactive and has no direct action in the remedy and can generally do no harm to the animal.  It is suggested by the manufacturers that to have to include this purely passive ingredient is unnecessary. I wonder&mdash;I am not skilled in these matters&mdash;is that a reasonable suggestion?  If it can be shown that these so-called passive ingredients cannot be harmful, it is a reasonable suggestion.  I think it would serve if we inserted the word &ldquo;active&rdquo; in front of the word &ldquo;ingredient&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In Section 5, sub-section (1) clause (c) there is another matter, and one which may affect our export trade.  It is a fact that some Irish firms manufacture animal remedies for overseas wholesalers.  Those overseas wholesalers would rather not have it known that their remedies are manufactured outside their own countries.  It might be that if they are compelled, under this Bill, to print &ldquo;manufactured in Ireland&rdquo;&mdash;which is virtually what it would amount to&mdash;they might say &ldquo;we will not have it manufactured in Ireland at all, we will go to somebody else&rdquo;.  That, in our present financial situation, would be a pity.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider whether we might think of redrafting this clause.  I would suggest that where a proprietary remedy is manufactured for and on behalf of a proprietor that the name and address of the proprietor only might be stated.  Let me make it <Col N="972" /> quite clear that no one is going to suffer from that.  The proprietor will accept full responsibility for the remedy.  The ingredients of the remedy will be printed on the outside.  It is simply a matter of changing the Bill so that the name of the manufacturer need not also be printed on the label. I suggest that if we alter the Bill in this respect we may save, to a small extent, some of our exports.  There is a risk that some of our exports will be cut off, if British manufacturers are virtually compelled to print on their labels &ldquo;made in Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to put forward.  It is that on the whole of Section 5 as a general principle I hope that the Minister will accept that we do not want to cause the reputable manufacturers and purveyors of animal remedies any undue trouble. If we can save them trouble without doing any harm to the buyers of the remedy and the animals concerned I am sure he will be prepared to meet us.  It would save the manufacturers a certain amount of trouble if he would grant that the provisions of Clause 5 should not arise in the case of a substance or preparation to which monographs are accorded in any of the following publications: <i>The Irish Pharmacopoeia, The British Pharmaceutical Codex and The British Veterinary Codex.</i> Any substance or preparation which appears in these publications is sure not to be a quack medicine.  It is sure to be a respectable preparation.  Possibly the Bill might be drafted so that a reference might be made to the relative page or passage in one of these publications.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if we can save the manufacturers trouble on this point, we should try to do so.  If I receive any support for these matters, I will raise them again on the Committee Stage.  The general principle is that in putting down the quack, we must not inflict any side blow on the honest people who have been providing good and honest remedies for the animals in Ireland for many years.  There is a certain risk in that, in pulling out the tares from the wheat field, we may do some damage to the wheat.  So I ask the Minister to see that the wheat suffers as little as possible.</P>

      <P>As I have said already in Irish, I think we should welcome this Bill because I believe sincerely that it is an effort to overtake certain abuses that have been taking place in the country for some years past, abuses connected with the sale and distribution of animal medicines; but while I welcome the Bill, I find it difficult to understand how these abuses have reached the proportions to which the Minister has referred in his speech, as, candidly, I was not aware that there was such wholesale quackery taking place in the country in this matter.  The difficulty in all these cases is, as Senator Stanford has pointed out, that, in order to detect and catch the evil-doer, sometimes the genuine manufacturer and seller of these compounds has to suffer.  I suppose that, in the nature of things, there is no real remedy for that.</P>
      <P>At the same time, it is only right and proper to point out to the Minister that certain abuses could creep in in connection with the administration of this measure.  Unfortunately, the more controls there are in matters of this kind, the more likely it is that there will be interference with people's legitimate business.  I suppose it would be necessary to have certain inspectors, or supervisors, or whatever one would like to call them, appointed from time to time to administer this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say I am a little confused in <Col N="974" /> my mind about the Minister's observations in the Dáil on this Bill.  For instance, in Volume 160, at column 126, referring to those people who hold out certain remedies for the abolition of abortion in cattle, the Minister said: &ldquo;No &lsquo;cure&rsquo; for these conditions is known to veterinary science.&rdquo;  He was referring to a product which he said &ldquo;was sold at 2/9 per small bottle and was suggested as a cure for abortion and sterility in cattle&rdquo;.  But at a later stage in his speech the Minister made use of these words, at column 127: &ldquo;for example, strain 19 vaccine is a sure preventive of contagious abortion....&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I see.  In any case, this apparent inconsistency aside, we all welcome the Bill, and I hope that it fulfils the desire of the Minister and his Department and of all of us to crush out these abuses by way of quackery that have been taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Professor Fearon Professor Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing that commends this to us is this principle of labelling what we are either getting or giving.  In 1912, a book was published that caused a tremendous sensation.  It was entitled &ldquo;Secret Remedies: What They Cost and What They Contain&rdquo;.  People found in it that many of the remedies they had been taking for a long time and giving to their unfortunate elderly relatives and children were beneficial in that they did not harm, but nothing else. It led to a considerable amount of revision of the attitude people took to these things.  I am extremely glad the Minister has done the same thing for the dumb animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dumb animal's position was not quite the same as that of the human, because, if a worthless remedy was <Col N="975" /> given to a human, he could at least say that it was not making him feel any better or that it was making him worse, whereas, with the farm animal, it might be hours or days before it could be known and the animal could not tell his symptoms to the veterinary surgeon.  To insist that one will know exactly what one is getting by means of the information on the label is a very important step towards general enlightenment.  I should like it extended to many of the things we encounter.  If we knew how much nourishment and calories several of our so-called foodstuffs contain, it might surprise some people.</P>
    <P>There are two points which I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister. The first is that, I am not quite clear why, under Section 3, he leaves out dogs.  He has the escape in the application of the Act that he may apply it to particular animals, but I still am not quite happy as to why the dog should be left out.  An extraordinary number of preparations are advertised for doing all sorts of things to dogs.  I, personally, should like to know what some of them contain.  Short of actually analysing them oneself, I think it would be very desirable to make manufacturers tell why certain preparations are so good for Fido and whether there is anything in the thing at all.</P>
    <P>The second point concerns the most important part of the Bill, namely, this question of the consultative committee in Section 4.  No provision is made for a representative of the veterinary profession or the Irish Veterinary Council on that committee.  Presumably, if such a representative were to be brought in, he would be brought in under sub-section (2): persons whom the Minister considers to have experience or special knowledge in relation to or to be representative of persons engaged in&mdash; what?&mdash;engaged in the manufacture, packing, distribution, sale or use of animal remedies.  I consider it quite conceivable that a member of the veterinary profession might not qualify under &ldquo;sale or use&rdquo;.  The word that is troubling me is &ldquo;use&rdquo;.  We all know the use of aspirins, but only a person <Col N="976" /> who has had medical training knows the effects and knows the dosage and what the effect of giving too much may be.  If it is the intention of the Minister to invoke the technical skill of the profession, I think that would be achieved by substituting for &ldquo;sale or use&rdquo; the expression &ldquo;sale or effects&rdquo; of animal remedies.  Otherwise, I should like to see the sub-section so reworded as to include the actual representative of the profession.  I think he should be statutorily represented.  These are just the two points which I wished to make on this very interesting and progressive measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone appreciates the Minister's paternal regard for the farmers generally in seeking to protect them from the activities of the purveyors of useless remedies.  I think a good deal of his solicitude is unnecessary. I do not think there is any very widespread use or purchase of remedies that are totally worthless or ineffective.  In the main, farmers are a hard-headed type of people and certainly they do not part with their money easily.  Generally, they will not purchase a particular remedy, except on the advice of a veterinary surgeon or a good unofficial local horse or cow doctor.  As a result of long experience, some of those people have acquired a good deal of knowledge which is not without value.  Therefore, I think that, in passing this Bill, the Minister and the House will, to a great extent, be seeking to protect the farmer from something which does not represent a very serious menace.  Anyhow, as the Bill is before the House, I assume it will be accepted.  Its effect will not be very far-reaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the farming community is concerned, and as far as the points raised by Senator Stanford are concerned, the Bill may have a serious effect, unless it is modified in certain ways, upon people who are legitimately manufacturing remedies.  I might say, in passing, that while, in the main, farmers are hard-headed and good business people, they are not likely to be imposed upon to any serious extent. It is rather remarkable that animals such as dogs and cats have been excluded from the operations of this <Col N="977" /> Bill.  I think people who own those animals are often very simple-minded and are more easily imposed upon than the average farmer in regard to his live stock.  It may happen that, if a certain number of people engaged in producing worthless animal remedies are put out of action as a result of this Bill, they may concentrate all their energies upon the unfortunate domestic animals such as dogs and cats which are excluded from this Bill.  For that reason, I am at a loss to know why that exclusion was made.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that those animals have no connection with agriculture or with productive industry generally.  We must remember that at the present time he is endeavouring to secure the enactment of legislation governing the greyhound industry. That is an admission on his part that dogs are of some importance in the national economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be well advised to give some attention to the points raised by Senator Stanford.  In our zeal to protect the user of these remedies, we may inflict hardship on some people who are producing worthwhile remedies.  Here is a point worth considering. It may be that, in animal remedies, a very expensive ingredient is blended with a very considerable quantity of water.  It may be necessary that it should be so blended in order to make a proper mixture or in order to be safe for utilisation or administration. I can see that it might lower the value of that remedy in the eyes of the purchaser if the percentage of water were mentioned.  What should be mentioned, of course, is the exact quantity of the various ingredients, that is to say, so many ounces or so many grains of the particular medicine. If that is mentioned, I think it is sufficient and it is not desirable to obstruct or impede in any way the people who are giving useful service.  I think the Minister will appreciate that.</P>
    <P>As far as the farmers generally are concerned&mdash;and I am speaking as a farmer and as one acquainted with agricultural conditions generally&mdash; there is very little real reliance placed by farmers on proprietary remedies. <Col N="978" /> To a great extent farmers are guided by their local veterinary surgeon, by their local pharmaceutical or veterinary chemist, by the advice from agricultural instructors and by the advice from experienced stock owners, rather than by any showy advertisement or notice in the Press or in some publication.</P>
    <P>This Bill may be necessary and it is acceptable, in the main.  The principle is right, that we should expect purveyors of such remedies to publish the name and the composition of the remedy; but if there are abuses, I think it will be found that the second portion of the Bill&mdash;Section 7, which provides for regulations licensing manufacturers&mdash;might be even more effective than the publication of the composition of the mixture.  I think that would be found as a result of experience.</P>
    <P>There is just one point which strikes me.  The Minister or some members of the House may regard it as amusing. In the past certainly, I have known many people to place a great reliance on alcoholic beverages as animal remedies.  Stout or ale was very frequently recommended for animal diseases.  I do not know how this will be affected by the operation of this Bill.  If they are being purchased as animal remedies, must the ingredients and contents be published on the outside of the bottle?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Stanford has referred to Section 5.  I would suggest there might be a provision in the Bill giving the Minister power to exempt from Section 5 goods intended for export.  I think there is a good deal in what Senator Stanford says, that as the section stands it would apply to manufacturers manufacturing for export and might interfere with their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Section 5 (1) (a), I do not quite understand the wording &ldquo;appropriate commercial common name&rdquo; and &ldquo;appropriate scientific name&rdquo;.  It seems to me that if one said &ldquo;the commercial common name&rdquo;, one would seem to convey as much as if one said &ldquo;the appropriate commercial common name&rdquo;.  I simply do not understand <Col N="979" /> the expression.  The same words are used as regards the scientific name, &ldquo;the appropriate scientific name&rdquo; and there is a definition given of what is meant by that, but there is no definition of the other.</P>

      <P>The real point that occurs to me in connection with it is that if an article had some purely fancy name, if you gave that fancy name, you would be giving the appropriate commercial common name.  I think the Minister ought to consider that.</P>
      <P>In Section 2, the definition of &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; does not relate to something that is neither manufactured nor for use in the State.  It seems to me that the words &ldquo;nor for use in the State&rdquo; are probably intended to mean &ldquo;nor imported into the State&rdquo;.  It raises the question as to what happens in the case of perfectly proper farm publications that may be brought in here in which there are advertisements which do not conform to this Bill.  Are the people who sell these thereupon liable to penalties?  It is only a small point, but it seems to me that it requires some consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to say very much on this Bill. It seems to me to be a very good one. While agreeing with a good deal of what Senator Stanford has said, I should like nevertheless to put a query about two of the points he made in relation to Section 5.  He suggested that perhaps the requirement to state the quantity and the name of the passive ingredient might be unnecessary.  It seems to me that the buyer of these remedies has a right to know how much passive ingredient there is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>And the <Col N="980" /> quantity.  If he is buying something that he regards as a good remedy and finds that 99.9 per cent. of it is water, although that may be necessary, as Senator Cogan says, I think it is an interesting fact and one that he ought to know, no matter how harmless the water may be.  Therefore, I think this provision is a good one.</P>
      <P>Secondly, it was suggested by Senator Stanford also that if the formula already appears and was a reputable formula and appeared in the pharmacopoeia, it should not be necessary to give the formula explicitly on the bottle.  But again, in relation to particulars, I think it is better for the buyer to be able to see clearly on the bottle just what the ingredients are. I do not think there would be enough said by referring to page so and so of the pharmacopoeia, because it might not be available.  It would be, in fact, a way of concealing the simplicity and the cheapness of remedies when a person is paying good money for them.</P>
      <P>In Section 6, I think the Minister is very bold.  He is asking that, in any particulars to be given in relation to the sale of a remedy by way of advertisement and so on, it shall be an offence if such an advertisement is likely to convey a false or misleading indication or impression of the composition&mdash;&ldquo;composition&rdquo; is all right&mdash;or remedial value of such a remedy.  If an advertisement gives you a false impression, or might give a false impression of the remedial value of a remedy, then the person issuing that advertisement is committing an offence under the Act.  In other words, the Minister is actually asking advertisers to tell the truth.</P>
      <P>This is a very new principle to introduce into advertising.  As I say, I think the Minister is very bold.  I wonder if he considered the full implications of making every advertisement of every animal remedy the truth and nothing but the truth, and in not giving a false or misleading impression about their remedial values.  Where, in other words, will this Bill end, if we are to ask that of advertisements?  I take it no such restriction applies to political Party advertisements or savings advertisements.</P>

      <P>I take it that this is an admirably high ideal, but is to be taken more as a distant prospect, as the Minister indicates, rather than as a practical proposition for everyday life?  It would be embarrassing to admit what quantity of a political advertisement was passive inducement, not to be taken at its face value and certainly not doing any good.  Has he thought of applying this to human remedies?  Are advertisements there bound to give a true impression, not a false impression, about their effectiveness?  My impression of such advertisements is that such remedies only do us good if we read and believe the advertisements.  Consequently, it seems to me a very high principle, this insistence that advertisements tell the truth.  I wonder has the Minister considered all its implications. Not long ago the Minister introduced a Bill making it quite clear that if we insisted on the correct date of our eggs being told, it would not be easy to sell them on distant markets and in fact making it easier to conceal their age for distant markets.  He insists on the principle of telling the truth, but I wonder can it be demanded and can the Minister see himself implementing this, that animal remedy advertisements give the truth and nothing but the truth.</P>

      <P>I have nothing much to say on this Bill, except that I was approached by some members of the trade and I understand that all reputable chemists and manufacturers of chemical products for animal feeding in this country very much welcome the Bill.  It seems the most important thing in this Bill is the condition being insisted upon that in future an exact designation be given of a remedy and that the buyer will be in a position to know what the remedy is supposed to do, and what it contains to effect a cure of whatever it purports to cure. Everybody seems to welcome the labelling demanded in this Bill and the trade itself welcome the labelling because reputable people are not afraid to tell the nature of the goods they <Col N="982" /> sell.  It is felt, however, that there are in the Bill some slightly unreasonable requirements which are carried a bit further than is absolutely really necessary. The Minister is a business man himself and he will realise what is really wanted in this case is a reasonable description of the remedy that is being sold, but it should not be necessary to go into finicky detail.  I am informed by the trade that there are one or two little adjustments which could be made to certain sections of the Bill which will avoid unnecessary expense.</P>
      <P>In this matter of labelling of goods, there is a lot of intermixture between the owner of the product and the person who actually makes the product up.  The manufacturing chemists would have a great confusion of labels and be put to great expense and trouble to comply strictly with the letter of the Bill, and I merely say on the Committee Stage I propose to put down one or two amendments.  Actually, the points have already been raised by Senator Stanford and the Minister at that time should favourably consider the recommendations made by the trade, recommendations made in the full spirit of co-operation, and a desire to fulfil all the necessary requirements of the Bill.</P>

      <P>As a farmer, I welcome this Bill, as every farmer in Ireland will welcome it.  I think it is long overdue and that it is a sincere effort to put an end to abuses which are widespread. Senator Kissane says he believes it is not a wise Bill, and, as Senator Cogan believes that this is true, he must have lost contact with the farmers in this country.</P>

      <P>I myself happen to have bought from a salesman a cod-liver oil compound which was supposed to be for pigs and calves.  I paid 35/- per gallon and I found it was 80 per cent. water and less than 20 per cent. cod-liver oil, and while I had paid 35/- a gallon, cod-liver oil itself could be bought at 15/- a gallon.  In connection with this same compound, there were at least ten cases in Mullingar court, and, though the farmers proved the <Col N="983" /> remedy was 80 per cent. water, and though the Justice agreed they were right, the farmers had to pay for it and pay through the nose.</P>
      <P>In another case, a neighbour of mine, a first class farmer, though Senator Cogan may state the people in my county are soft, was offered a compound by a salesman which was supposed to supply mineral deficiencies in cattle, pigs and racehorses.  This neighbour of mine paid the salesman a cheque for £30 for half a ton, and I defy contradiction on this.  Rumours went around and when the compound arrived at Mullingar station, the farmer had it examined and it was found to contain 90 per cent. of fox sand.  It is a well known fact that a certain gentleman in Dublin had samples of this compound and sold them all over the country, even up to Donegal, and there were prosecutions about it, but at the same time the farmers had to pay for it.  I welcome this Bill, because people should be prevented from making exaggerated claims in respect of animal remedies.  No one wants to interfere with a genuine, reputable compounder of medicine who has nothing to fear from this Bill.  The Minister is to be congratulated on introducing this Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with the other Senators in congratulating the Minister.  I am a little perturbed about one point, that is, the omission of dogs from Section 3 of the Bill.  It appears to me that dogs, and if I might also add cats, are domestic animals which are kept by a large portion of the population in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate the spirit in which the Bill has been received by the House and particularly the spirit in which Senator McGuire intervened in the debate.  It is a great help to a Minister when a Deputy or a Senator draws his attention to a certain flaw <Col N="984" /> in the Bill and invites the Minister to repair that omission or flaw.  I should be most grateful to the Senator for his assistance in repairing any error that may seem to be in the text of the Bill.  I imagine that Senator Stanford was really referring to the matters to which Senator McGuire referred and, perhaps, it would assist the Senators if I refer briefly to the points mentioned.</P>
      <P>The only reason there is not a period of 12 months instead of six months in the Bill is that I think the Bill is overdue.  I do not want, if I can help it, to postpone its operation for 12 months.  I consented to postponing its operation for six months to meet the situation of those who had stocks of labelled merchandise on hands, so that they might dispose of this merchandise in conformity with the law.  It is not a matter of principle.  I should prefer to leave the six months in, for, by the time the Bill is through, persons with stocks will have had in effect nine months since the Bill was drafted and I do not apprehend they will be put to any serious inconvenience.</P>
      <P>Secondly, there was the matter relating to the definition section where it was apprehended that a document published by the manufacturers of such remedies might include the whole list addressed exclusively to wholesalers. I am advised it does not and it certainly is not intended to do.  I will have the matter examined by the parliamentary draftsman, and, if anything is necessary, it will be done.  Senators will sympathise with me that the mysteries of the parliamentary drafts-man's office are quite beyond us all. We tell him what we want to do and he very often chooses words to do it whereby he bewilders, but if we seek to simplify his phraseology we often discover to our astonishment that we have done the exact opposite of what we desired to do.  We would all be well advised to accept whatever wording the parliamentary draftsman advises us achieves our purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Stanford that what he calls the passive base of a compound remedy does not require description.  There are many bases other than spring water.  The compound <Col N="985" /> may have a bland and inoffensive base like chalk, but, unfortunately, sometimes unscrupulous manufacturers may employ an inert material which can still be gravely deleterious to a ruminant.  Therefore, I think it is a useful thing to require him to describe it.  I cannot imagine its doing harm to anybody if he has put in an honest base.  Chalk or water will frighten nobody, but the knowledge that he must faithfully describe the base will deter him from using something of doubtful safety.  All this Bill seeks to do is to ensure that the farmer will know what he is buying.</P>
    <P>I do not seek to fix its value.  I was asked to do that in another place and I said I preferred not.  The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that information will be provided, leaving it to the farmer to choose whether he wishes to pay for it or not.  With regard to the point in relation to the manufacture of a proprietary remedy, a firm domiciled abroad which has a small market for the particular product and which does not think the market large enough to set up a plant for themselves like to get another established manufacturer to make it for them and do not want the other manufacturer's name on their product. It is a matter of business pride that they were themselves making it here. I do not think it really matters a fiddle-de-dee but if it is a matter upon which the Senators hold strong views I would be prepared&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I rejoice in Senator McGuire's informed <i>franchise.</i> Even such absurdities as that exist, but if, in the Senators' judgment, that is a foible which we should kick out in a legislative way&mdash;I, like him, have had some experience of business&mdash;I would be much influenced by his views. If the Senator considers this should be done, I would be much influenced by what they would recommend with regard to this section when we come to the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion by Senator Stanford that substances or <Col N="986" /> preparations to which monographs are accorded in the <i>Irish Pharmacopoeia,</i> the <i>British Pharmaceutical Codex</i> or the <i>British Veterinary Codex,</i> should be exempted, if it means anything, which I very much doubt, it really is a proposal that we should exempt the pharmaceutical chemist from the obligation of writing on the label of a bottle he shakes up for a farmer in the shop the description of its constituents whereby the farmer would be invited to judge the value of the mixture.  To that proposition, I would not agree.  I think the pharmaceutical chemist shaking up a bottle <i>ad hoc</i> ought to have the same obligation as a patent medicine manufacturer to write on the label substantially the constituents.  Maybe I am wrong in so interpreting the Bill, but I think that is what it means, and, if anyone can explain it to me better, I shall be much obliged.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox made the point that Section 2 might apply to an important publication.  That is to say, if a publication, printed abroad, offered for sale in Ireland a preparation manufactured here and failed to declare its contents, it would commit an offence.  I think that is so, but the contingency is so remote as to make it almost unnecessary to provide against it.  If the Senator takes a different view, I would have no difficulty in meeting him in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Fearon referred to leaving out dogs and he was followed by Senator Douglas.  I think the matter was also mentioned by Senator Cogan. I should mention that the only reason dogs were left out was that, when we were drafting the Bill, we wanted it to apply to farm animals but we took power under the Bill to include other categories of animals.  However, if Senators Fearon, Douglas and Cogan would feel happier to insert dogs or, indeed, cats in the Statute, by amendment, I would have no objection.</P>
    <P>I can reassure Senator Fearon that even though the wording of the Bill may appear to create an obligation on the Minister to preclude members of the veterinary profession, as I stated in the other House and as I now say in the Seanad it was intended that one member at least of the Advisory <Col N="987" /> Council would be a member of the veterinary profession.  If Senator Fearon considers it desirable to propose an amendment, I would, of course, consider it.</P>
    <P>I think that covers all the points which have been raised, except one raised by Senator Sheehy Skeffington who asked me if I really meant to ask the manufacturers of these drugs to tell the truth and he deplored the fact that politicians did not tell the truth. It suddenly occurred to me while he was speaking that he was also a politician and when I saw him striking his breast and heard him saying that it was a pity that all politicians did not speak the truth, I thought of the man who went up to the temple to pray and I ventured to interrupt him to recall to his mind the distressing story of that most virtuous man.</P>

    <Title>Pigs and Bacon (Amendment) Bill, 1956&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to incorporate in permanent legislation certain powers in connection with the fixing of prices for pigs and certain prohibitions in regard to pigs of a colour other than all white, both of which have hitherto been provided for by Emergency Powers Orders.  It also amends the Pigs and Bacon Acts in a number of respects, most of the amendments being necessitated by the Export Price Guarantee Scheme for Grade A bacon introduced at the end of last April when the Pigs and Bacon Agreement of 1951 expired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the fixing of prices for pigs, the Pigs and Bacon Acts of 1935 and 1937 established a system of fixed prices for all pigs purchased by bacon curers.  Experience showed, however, <Col N="988" /> that this system lacked flexibility and that it was not in the long-term interests of producers, especially those who marketed the best pigs.  In 1943 the system of <i>fixed</i> prices for pigs was suspended by Emergency Powers Order, and instead the Pigs and Bacon Commission was required to prescribe <i>minimum</i> prices for all pigs purchased by curers.  In practice, however, pig prices were allowed to find their own level and that position obtained up to the introduction of the Export Price Guarantee Scheme for Grade A bacon in April last.  In connection with that scheme it was arranged that producers should receive minimum prices of 235/- per cwt. deadweight for Grade A pigs and 230/- per cwt. deadweight for Grade B1 pigs delivered to bacon factories and those minimum prices were fixed by Order.</P>
    <P>The Bill now proposes to continue the power of the Pigs and Bacon Commission to fix minimum prices for pigs purchased by curers on a dead-weight basis.  It also continues the suspension of the system of fixed prices for pigs established by the prewar Pigs and Bacon Acts, but enables the suspension to be removed and reintroduced at any time by Order of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>As regards the prohibitions in connection with pigs of a colour other than all white, only Large White boars have been eligible for licensing in this country since 1936.  In 1951, coloured, that is, black or black and white pigs, which could only have been smuggled or else have been the progeny of pigs smuggled from the Six Counties, were appearing here, and the Pigs (Unsuitable Types) Order, 1951, was made so as to counter the damage that could be done to our pig stocks by those pigs.  Occasional coloured pigs are still being detected and it is necessary to continue the powers provided by the 1951 Order.</P>
    <P>As regards the amendments of the Pigs and Bacon Acts, in connection with the Export Price Guarantee Scheme for Grade A bacon, the Bill provides that the Pigs and Bacon Commission may transfer moneys from its General Fund to its Stabilisation Fund. This is necessary as the scheme is <Col N="989" /> being partly financed by a levy on all pigs used for bacon production.  At present, receipts from such a levy must be paid into the Commission's General Fund, whereas export subsidy may be paid only out of the Stabilisation Fund.  The Bill also requires the commission to pay into the Stabilisation Fund any moneys provided by the Oireachtas towards meeting subsidy on bacon exports.</P>
    <P>It further provides that the commission may by Order require bacon curers to export bacon to any country that may be specified in the Order. At present, there is power to require curers to export bacon but only to markets other than Britain and the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>At my suggestion, the curers have introduced a voluntary arrangement whereby each curer will export a proportion of his production of Grade A bacon.  The curers themselves feel, however, that there should be power to compel any curer who is not prepared to co-operate in this matter to export his due share.  They point out that some exports of Grade A bacon by each curer would spread the burden of competing in the export market and would also have the very desirable result of ensuring continuity of supplies to the export market, an essential factor in the development of a successful export trade.  Another amendment in connection with the export price guarantee scheme is one enabling the Pigs and Bacon Commission to fix a rate of export subsidy on bacon after the date of export of the bacon.  Under the scheme the rate of export subsidy depends on the average prices realised, but as matters stand at present the commission would have to declare the rate of subsidy before the exports took place.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill makes two minor amendments in connection with pork butchers registered under the Pigs and Bacon Acts.  The first of these extends from one month to six months the accounting period in connection with the payment of fees by such butchers, while the second provides for the cancellation of the registration of a pork butcher on the application of the registered person or where the business <Col N="990" /> of pork butcher has not been carried on at the registered premises during the whole of the preceding 12 months. These amendments are designed solely to facilitate administration.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to refer to two important steps taken during the past year in connection with the pigs and bacon industry.  These were, firstly, the introduction of a uniform grading system for pigs and, secondly, the introduction of the Export Price Guarantee Scheme for grade A bacon.  As a result of the grading system pigs are now being marketed at more suitable weights for bacon production and there has been a steady improvement in the proportion of Grade A pigs reaching the factories. In the period August/December, 1955, the proportion of graded pigs in the weight range 1 cwt. 0 qr. 8 lb. to 1 cwt. 2 qr. 0 lb. which qualified for Grade A was 54 per cent. in the quarter ended 31st March, 1956, the proportion was 58 per cent., while in the quarter ended 30th June, and again in the quarter ended 30th September it was 63 per cent.</P>
    <P>Recently there have even been suggestions that some curers have too much Grade A bacon and that in some areas there are shortages of fat bacon. The Export Price Guarantee Scheme for Grade A bacon which was introduced on the expiration of the pigs and bacon agreement of 1951 at the end of April has proved its value recently, when despite reductions in bacon prices on the home and export markets the prices received by producers here were maintained at not less than the fixed minima of 235/- per cwt. for Grade A pigs and 230/- per cwt. for Grade B 1 pigs.  As already announced, the Government intend to continue to guarantee a minimum price for Grade A pigs and producers may, therefore, with confidence increase their output of pigs in the certainty that whatever number they produce there is no danger of the price collapsing provided that the pigs are Grade A pigs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As this Bill appears to provide permanent legislation in substitution for emergency powers regulations, I consider it is desirable in a general way.  I think it is necessary <Col N="991" /> to say that every member of this House, I am sure, appreciates the importance of everything possible being done to promote the pig and bacon industry.  In the production of pigs, and the resulting bacon, there is scope for expansion on a very considerable scale and expansion of agricultural output is one of the things most essential at the present time. Therefore, anything that can possibly be done to promote increased production in pigs and to increase the manufacture of bacon will, I am sure, have the whole-hearted support of every member of this House.</P>
      <P>The pig-raising industry in this country has been a very uneven one. There have been violent fluctuations of prices down through the years and, resulting therefrom, fluctuations of supply.  This, I think has been more marked in recent years.  If we go back to our childhood days, we will remember that there was a fairly steep production of pigs then, mainly because at that time farmers, farmers' employees and the members of farmers' families were more inclined to work, irrespective of whether or not they were paid for their work.  Like other sections of the community, farmers and farm workers are becoming alive to their own interests and rights and they are not prepared to work without remuneration.  This state of affairs has been particularly marked over the past two years.</P>
      <P>It will be remembered that, a little over two years ago, in 1953, prices went as high as 255/- per cwt. dead-weight in October, November and December of that year.  There was a decline after that and, in May, 1954, the price had come back to 239/10d. In June, the price declined to 226/- and, from that until April, 1955, the price remained at a low level.  It was only in May of last year that there was a slight recovery, but the price dropped back again to 219/- in July and the price continued low until the present year.  There has been some increase during the recent summer months when the price rose to 245/- in June and 245/- in July.  Those were the average prices of pigs dead-weight delivered to factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> That reduction in price over the past two years had its effect on supply.  If you look at the picture of supplies of pigs delivered to the factories, you will find that, in October, 1954, 27,000 pigs per week were delivered to the factories.  In 1955, the number was down to 19,000 odd and, in 1956, the present year, the number had fallen to 16,000.  There you have, over the past two years, a very sweeping decline in the number of pigs delivered to the factories.  That decline has kept pace with the decline in price.  It is, therefore, clear that farmers are not the innocent or stupid type of people they were represented to be here this evening when another Bill was going through the House.  They are intelligent enough to see where their interest lies.  If prices and remuneration are not satisfactory, they tend to go out of production.  That is why every Senator will welcome any attempt to stabilise prices at a remunerative level and to give to the producer some assurance that if he goes into production and expands it, he will not have to face a reduction in price, as has happened heretofore.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for the fixing of a minimum price for pigs.  One of the drawbacks I see in connection with it is that that guarantee may be terminated without sufficient notice.  I think the Minister said that the guarantee will remain in operation until March. If we could provide in this legislation that there should be no alteration in price&mdash;no reduction at any rate&mdash;without at least 12 months' notice to the producer, it would, I think, have a very marked effect on production and it would enable producers to expand production with a reasonable hope of getting out safely.</P>
    <P>It costs quite a considerable amount of money to go into pig production.  It costs money not only for the purchase of stock, but for the improvement or erection of houses, for the growing or the purchase of foodstuffs.  There ought to be provided to the producer a reasonable guarantee of price.  The guarantee that is provided under the present Bill is satisfactory enough, except, as I say, for two reasons.  The first is that at the present time the price <Col N="993" /> has been fixed rather low, I think.  The 235/- per cwt. dead-weight for grade A pigs is not quite adequate.  I think the price could be raised.  I would not ask for anything very extravagant, but I think the price could be raised to at least 250/- per cwt.  In addition to that, there should be a guarantee that prices will remain unchanged, that prices will not at least be reduced over a period of 12 months.</P>
    <P>If those two changes were announced by the Minister, they would have a very marked effect on production; and not only that, it would be fair to those engaged in the industry. The people on whom, in the main, we depend for the increased production of pigs are the small farmers who raise pigs with family labour.  If the Minister, in the closing stages of this Bill or when concluding the debate here to-day, could announce that at least a certain period of notice, say, 12 months, would be given to the producers before the price would be reduced, that would have a marked effect and would be an act of justice to a section of the community who have been greatly wronged over the years in regard to their reward for labour.  The producer of pigs has not, except on rare occasions, been adequately rewarded for his work.  It is a rather arduous work, entailing a considerable amount of knowledge, because anyone who tries to go into pig production or to remain in it without a fairly good technical knowledge of what is required in the industry, is going to lose money and lose money heavily&mdash;and would lose money even at the guaranteed price I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the system of grading pigs is to continue.  I have not heard any serious objection from farmers' associations or from any progressive farmers to the idea of pigs being paid for on a graded basis.  I think every intelligent person who is engaged in the agricultural industry realises that it is necessary to provide a first class product, not only for export but for our own home consumers. Therefore, I think that the grading of pigs will be readily accepted by our farmers.  As far as I know, there is substantial co-operation between the <Col N="994" /> farmers and the bacon factories in regard to this matter.  One of the things that always prevented co-operation between farmers and those engaged in the handling of their product was the absence of fair treatment to the farmer. There is no use in expecting the farmer to produce a grade A article, unless there is a specific guarantee that he will be paid for it.</P>
    <P>In the past, there was a variation not only in regard to price: there was also a variation from time to time in regard to the weights of pigs that were sought, the type of pigs that were sought and the grades that were sought by buyers.  While it is true that this legislation does entail a certain amount of regulation&mdash;and, if you like, control in regard to the pig producing industry&mdash;I think that, if the price offered is fair, farmers in the main will accept it.  Very frequently from 1936, when the principal Act, the Pigs and Bacon Act, was passed, there was considerable propaganda circulating amongst farmers against regulation, against control in the marketing of pigs.  Most of that propaganda was propagated by the pig dealers and it was not entirely in the farmers' interests. The producers were told that the Government regulations were killing or had killed the pig industry.  Of course, that never was true and I do not think it will be true in regard to the legislation that we are enacting here to-day.</P>
    <P>What brought pig production down to a very low level was the war years, when no feeding stuffs could be obtained.  The feeding stuff that would otherwise go to pigs, the home-produced feeding stuffs, were required for human consumption.  That reduced very drastically the number of pigs, but it was that factor, not any measure of control or regulation, that brought about the decline in numbers.  As I say, the numbers increased rapidly up to 1954.  A decline set in at that time and has continued for the past few years.  It is hoped, as a result of this legislation and as a result of better prices being offered, that the numbers of pigs will increase.  The Minister will remember that in 1954 his attention was called to the very low prices prevailing for pigs at that time <Col N="995" /> and he announced to a deputation of farmers that he needed time.  &ldquo;Give me time to get my breath and I will take the wobble out of the price of pigs,&rdquo; he said.  Well, the wobble remained quite a long time, or the Minister must have taken a very long and very deep breath, because a very large number of our pigs wobbled completely out of existence.  The pig population fell very rapidly during those years. That was a very great national loss. However, it is hoped that it will be repaired and I think that every member of this House will be anxious to co-operate in repairing it.</P>
    <P>There is provision in this Bill for the payment of a subsidy on the export of bacon.  There was a time when the Minister and others used to denounce the Government that was in power some years ago for subsidising exports, for paying John Bull, they said, to eat our better or to eat our bacon; but anyone who is intelligent and who gives consideration to this matter will realise that if you want to maintain stability of price, you must have some system of export subsidy.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister, when replying, to give a little more detail in regard to the financing of this system. What is the levy per head on all pigs purchased; what is the total amount raised by means of that levy; and how much will it be necessary to pay out in subsidies on exported bacon?  I do not think anyone on this side of the House will accuse the Minister of subsidising or paying John Bull to eat our bacon. We on this side of the House are inclined to take a fair and reasonable view of matters of this kind and anything that can be done to expand or increase output in this important industry will be readily supported.</P>
    <P>As I say, it is a pity that attempts were made to mislead the farmer in regard to the necessity, or desirability, of a certain measure of regulation in regard to the marketing of pigs.  I heard a Deputy expressing a desire to get back to the good old days when there was no fixed price for pigs, no regulations, no control whatever, and when the pig jobbers reigned supreme <Col N="996" /> and lorded it over the unhappy farmer. I have a distinct recollection of those days when pig jobbers, with their close union and complete co-operation amongst themselves, fixed the price for pigs.  They ruled that the pigs be examined in a town at 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning and I remember at that time when the Waterford jobbers ordered that the pigs be laid in the streets, so that the jobbers could handle them more readily.  You can imagine the difficulty the farmers had at that time.  The Leader of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1936 was wise to introduce regulations governing this industry; otherwise, it could not have continued.</P>
    <P>In addition to regulating, marketing and manufacturing here, something should be done to ensure a better system of marketing abroad.  It is necessary and desirable that, since a regulation has been imposed to compel the bacon curers to export a certain quantity of their grade A bacon, that closer co-operation should be arranged between these curers to secure that their bacon would be put on the British market and sold under the best possible conditions.  It is true that Irish bacon in Great Britain fetches 28/- a cwt. less than the best Danish bacon, and that is a condition of affairs which should not continue.  We are capable of producing as good an article as the Danes.  The difficulty is that we have not a sufficient quantity of it on the market and we have not a proper marketing system to get it across to the British people and sell it under the best possible conditions.</P>
    <P>I do not want to quarrel with the Minister in regard to the introduction of the Landrace pig.  That is a matter which should be weighed and carefully considered by the Minister and representatives of the farmers' associations and the Agricultural Production Council, or any other body of farmers with which he is in contact.  One suggestion I should like to make is that if the Minister feels there is a danger of disease following on the introduction of this breed, he would consider the possibility of having a certain number of these pigs bred and kept on one of the Department's farms, completely isolated from the rest of the country, <Col N="997" /> so that the incidence of disease, its effects, and the possibilities of its being spread could be carefully studied.  That would meet the wishes of every reasonable person.  Nobody wants to press the Minister to do something which might possibly be of harm to the whole industry and which it might not be possible to rectify afterwards.  In dealing with hereditary or infectious diseases, one has to be extremely careful.</P>
    <P>There is not any very widespread opposition to the regulations which prohibit coloured pigs.  It is true that some of those breeds were exceptionally unpopular for a time at least. There is no doubt they were very productive and were very efficient converters of food into pork, but, at the same time, they did not produce the quality bacon, and quality bacon is the objective we have got to reach. I do not think the Minister, however, should be unduly severe in dealing with an occasional outbreak of colour amongst pigs, because, if there is anything in progeny, those outbreaks or throw-backs to the black colour will occur for many generations, in spite of anything the breeders can do.</P>
    <P>If we are to put this pig producing industry on a permanent and secure basis, we must be very active in considering the whole question of feeding stuffs.  It is true, and I think it will be accepted as true, that Irish grown barley is second to none as a feeding stuff for pigs.  It is far superior to imported maize and produces a better type of bacon.  Growers of barley should be encouraged not only to increase their acreage but to provide for the storage and utilisation of their grain.  It is not possible for all growers of barley to use all their produce on their own farms in the feeding of their own pigs.  There must be a certain number, particularly of large farmers, who will have a surplus of barley and they should be guaranteed a fair price and security of market.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it is not possible to expect that people who go into pig breeding on a substantial scale relative to the size of their farms, particularly small farmers, can produce sufficient barley on their own farms to feed <Col N="998" /> the number of pigs which it is desirable they should feed.  Therefore, they must purchase the surplus grain of the larger farmers.  For that reason, it is essential that storage accommodation should be provided so that if farmers expand the area under barley they will not find any of it left on their hands or any difficulty in disposing of it after the harvest.  There are some people with old-fashioned ideas who suggest that tillage farmers should take the retrograde step of going back to the old reaper and binder and should scrap the combine harvester.  I do not think any reasonable person will agree to that.  In a climate such as ours, the combine harvester is the logical method of reaping either barley or wheat.  For that reason, any farmer who reaps his crop by that method should be assured that he will have the necessary storage and drying facilities available, as has been done in regard to wheat.</P>

      <P>I have no intention of permitting a wide discussion in regard to tillage methods on a Pigs and Bacon Bill.  So long as the Senator relates his remarks on the growing of barley to the Bill itself, he is in order, but if he wanders outside that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention.  The Bill is intended to expand the pig-producing industry.  I am certainly offering to the Minister, in so far as I can do so, my co-operative support. Instead of telling the pig producers to grow all their own barley, I would say: Grow all the barley you can. Feed as much as you can to the pigs and sell the surplus.  If you are engaged extensively in the pig-producing industry, feed as many pigs as possible with your own barley as far as possible, and what you require in addition to that purchase from your neighbours in any part of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is in this regard also the question of protein and food, and that is an important thing.  If farmers have not a sufficient supply of separated milk on their own farms, they should have ready access to whatever supplies of other proteins, such as wheat and bone meal, are available.  I think the <Col N="999" /> sound policy would be to encourage every farmer to be a maker and mixer of his own compound food.</P>
    <P>A very intelligent and progressive farmer visited Denmark recently.  I asked him if the Danish farmer had any advantage over us in any way.  He said that at least in one way they had, in that most Danish farmers were exceptionally well informed in regard to the mixing of compound foods.  In general, they were better informed than our farmers.  That is a matter that should be attended to, if we are to make the pig producing industry a success.</P>
    <P>As the Bill is, in the main, a continuation of existing legislation, there is not a great deal to be said on it. What is needed is active co-operation between the Department and the farmers in making the Bill a success.  I strongly press the Minister to give the guarantee I asked for, namely, that the price of pigs be not reduced without giving at least 12 months' notice. Our farmers, more than the farmers in some other countries, perhaps, are inclined to change their system of farming from year to year, according as prices and the margin of profits change.  That may be a good thing or a bad thing, but it is a characteristic of our people.</P>
    <P>A short time ago, I was speaking to a farmer with whom I had also been speaking about 12 months ago.  I knew him to be a very extensive pig producer.  I asked him if he was still largely engaged in the pig business. He said: &ldquo;No; I have got out of pigs altogether.  There is no money in them. I am keeping bank clerks instead.&rdquo; He was living near a large town where there was a number of bank clerks.  I met him a short time ago and asked how he was getting on with the bank clerks.  He said: &ldquo;I got out of the bank clerks.  There is no money in them and I have gone back to pigs.&rdquo;  I hope that will not be typical of a good number of our farmers' actions at the present time.  It is undesirable that we should have this changing from pigs to bank clerks and back again from bank clerks to pigs, and changing <Col N="1000" /> from one branch of production to another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We should always welcome permanent legislation which does away with Emergency Powers Orders. I have many reasons to be interested in a Pigs and Bacon Bill.  This is not a very comprehensive measure, but it is designed for the purpose of meeting present-day conditions in industry. Senator Cogan devoted most of his remarks to the question of feeding pigs.  I think the farmers have been more misled by information with regard to the feeding of pigs than by anything else.</P>
      <P>I want to supply a few figures.  One of the most important things we could get in this country is a pig that can convert food economically into bacon. It has been said that under best conditions you can convert 3 lb. of pig feed into 1 lb. of pork, but I think that under average conditions we ought to be able, without any great difficulty, to have all our pigs convert 4 lb. of food into 1 lb. of live weight pork.</P>
      <P>To-day the farmer gets a guaranteed price of 20/- a cwt. for his barley and four cwt. of barley should be sufficient to produce 1 cwt. of pork.  The 4 cwt. of barley would cost £4 and the present live weight price of pork is 170/-.  That would give a considerable profit to any producer who would have any kind of reasonable pigs.  Recently, a large pig feeder who is also a meal miller in a small way told me that he did not know why farmers are so daft as to continually sell their barley to people like himself.  I believe that any farmer would have dried barley meal to-day on his farm at about 25/- per cwt. but what the great majority of the farmers do, before even the combine has cut the rest of the barley and the lorries have taken it away, is to get to the banks as quickly as they can to lodge the cheques.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happens?  Later during the year, they are buying back that same barley from the merchants at about 32/- or 33/- per cwt.  The difference between 25/- and 32/- a cwt. would mean that on the 4 lb. conversion ratio the farmer loses a profit of 28/- per pig by that transaction.  Even if their <Col N="1001" /> bank books would not look so well at Christmas, I suggest that they would be paid well on a profit of 28/- a cwt.</P>
    <P>That information was given to me recently by a man who feeds a considerable number of pigs, but who also buys barley from the farmers.  He said that he could never understand why the farmer does that.  He says that the profit he can get, more than the farmer, by the fact that he can get an extra 28/- per pig profit, is enormous, particularly if he is a man who feeds perhaps 1,000 pigs in a year.  The figures which I have given with regard to conversion are international figures. In Denmark it has been shown that under the best conditions&mdash;these are almost laboratory conditions&mdash;you can produce on live weight, 1 lb. of pork from 3 lb. of pig feed.  I do not expect, under the general up and down conditions of the country, that we ought to expect much less than four.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister that perhaps at some time he would consider providing more facilities to encourage the farmer to keep his feeding stuff in a proper way on his own farm.  I did notice in the other House that one of the things which the Minister said was worrying him was the cost of transporting barley to Sligo, Donegal and other places.  There is a lot of waste of money in carting barley from the farm to the mill.  If the barley was kept at home and the farmers had it ground themselves, it would mean £1 to 30/- a barrel.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in the improved grading of Irish pigs from a little over 50 per cent. to something over 60 per cent. at present.  It means that we have gone, in round figures, from about half Grade A to two-thirds Grade A pigs.  In my experience, the principal fault in the Irish Large White pig is that the shoulder is too heavy.  If the farmer would breed off the pig with the light shoulder, it would improve the position enormously. The reason is&mdash;and I want to say this particularly for the farmers, and I have made a survey of the market conditions in England&mdash;that when a retail merchant in England buys two sides of Irish bacon and cuts <Col N="1002" /> them up, he finds that he has about 1 lb. weight more shoulder on the Irish pig than on the Danish pig.  The shoulder may sell at 2/- and ham at about 4/- and he finds that he has about 1 lb. more of the cut that sells at 2/- and the counterhand is not able to balance his books.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about the Landrace pig.  I have been in most of the progeny testing stations in Denmark with Dr. Halmer Clausen and there is very little difference in the figures between the Landrace and the Large White.  We are often inclined to hope, and the newspapers are responsible for a lot of it, that we can get some sort of panacea which will solve all our problems and that if we can get the Landrace all our problems are solved; but there are difficulties with the Landrace.  It is inclined to throw skinny pigs and if there is any form of bad pig, it is a pig which does not fatten up.  The Landrace throws more &ldquo;culls&rdquo; than the Large White. Another thing, and I have asked several people in Smithfield about it, is the capacity of the Irish Large White to produce the best quality pork. Five or six years ago, the Minister made an agreement with the British Government to take pork, and a good deal of money was made by the people interested in the export of pork.  I believe that the pork from the Irish Large White is much superior to that coming from any other pig and it was another reason why Irish pork got the great reputation which it got at Smithfield. I think that Irish pork in England to-day has a higher reputation than even English pork.</P>
    <P>There has been also the question of marketing.  Marketing is most important, but we must remember that our principal competitors, the Danish, have been on the British market continuously with bacon for nearly a century, with perhaps some little disruption in the war period.  They have always stayed on that market, and have studied it, and they have such a strength on the market to-day that in some measure they are nearly able to dictate the price which will be given for Danish bacon.  I think we have one advantage over the Danish bacon, <Col N="1003" /> and it is in the matter of flavour. There is a flavour on Irish butter, Irish eggs, and Irish bacon, as well as Irish beef, and any American will say that an Irish steak has a particularly good flavour.  The same thing applies to all our produce.</P>
    <P>We ought to advertise that and lay stress on it.  I should like to see some advertising done in Britain in centres where there are large Irish populations. We might advertise in the local papers or there might be scientific advertising done by advertising agents who know their jobs and would do it properly.  We have got to get back into a market in which we have not been for years.  We have the pig and the only thing I see wrong with it is that the shoulders of the Irish Large White are too heavy.  If the farmers decided, for the next year or two, that they will not breed off pigs with heavy shoulders, the necessary improvement could take place as quickly as the farmers were able to make the improvement in the Grade A pigs.  In 12 months, you would see the same improvement with regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I want to refer to another thing.  That is the Minister has initiated consultations between the various groups who are responsible for this industry.  He has encouraged the farmers and the producers of pigs to meet the curers and to discuss the problems that arise to the benefit of both of them.  That has been, and will be of enormous benefit to the bacon trade.  The Grade A scheme will put a bottom under the trade and will give the necessary encouragement and the long-term assurance to pig producers that, even if bad market conditions should intervene, they will get good margins of profit during the periods that are bad.  In a short measure of this kind, it would be wrong for me to go into any more detail except to say that I believe the Minister's approach to the whole question of pig production here is very sound.  I was very glad to see that all this clamour that went on about Landrace pigs did not find him prepared to make any concession, because the pig we have here, <Col N="1004" /> if there is a little done about it, is as good as any in the whole world and probably more suited to Irish conditions and our climatic environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, which proposes to replace emergency powers regulations in this matter, is to be welcomed. Apparently when any Bill of this sort replaces emergency powers, it is welcomed here, but nobody seems to advert to the fact that in the long run emergency powers regulations covering them did a good job of work. We are overfond of discrediting them. That happens in the Dáil on all sides of the House, and here also.  We all seem to forget that they were necessary at the time and did a good job of work.</P>
      <P>The main feature of this Bill, so far as it continues the idea of price stabilisation, is to be welcomed, but, of course, while price fixation and a fixed guaranteed minimum price is a good thing, the quantity of bacon produced will always be regulated, having regard to whether the price fixed is an economic one or not.  If it is not an economic price, the quantity of bacon produced will reduce.  That happens with many agricultural products. We all know that when eggs, which had been dear, got very cheap and fell as low as 2/-, the women of the country started to sell the hens, and that automatically created a scarcity and they got dear again in the winter time.  To an extent, that seems to be the policy also in regard to pigs and the production of bacon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there was a guaranteed minimum price which was an economic one, so long as the production of the pig was efficient, the farmers who were efficiently in production would remain in production and would produce more; but the quantity of production will always be regulated by many other factors, some of which were referred to by Senator Burke and Senator Cogan&mdash;the question of barley or feeding stuffs, the price of feeding stuffs, and their effects on the economics of the production of pigs.  If we had a fixed price for foodstuffs, then the farmer would be in a position to compare and to realise, having regard <Col N="1005" /> to the information he then had, whether it would be economic for him to go into increased production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Provided that the price is economic in the opinion of the farmer, production will rise, and if it is not, in his opinion, he will reduce production and then you will have a reduction in the production of pigs at certain times.  If the Minister is really anxious to have a substantial increase in production, he should set his minimum price at a higher level than 235/- per cwt. for Grade A bacon.  My colleague Senator Cogan has suggested 250/-, but that is a matter that could be argued for a long time.  I do not think that this is the appropriate place where the actual price should be argued out, but I do agree with Senator Cogan that if the Minister really wants a substantial increase in bacon production, his real key is to set a higher minimum price for Grade A bacon and then the quantity will increase, providing feeding stuffs do not make it uneconomic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality, of course, is quite a different matter.  I was surprised to hear the Minister talking about a number, possibly a few, black and white pigs being found in the country.  I do not know how they got into the country, and I am sure that the Minister does not know.  The vast majority of farmers do realise that they are not suitable for our present trade, because, after all, it is the housewife who is buying the rather who really decides <Col N="1006" /> the type of pig, and it is she and not the Minister for Agriculture or the farmer, who makes the decision.  The Minister will agree with me that it is the customer going to buy the finished article who really decides what is required.</P>
    <P>I do not know, however, and I cannot understand, why it is necessary to make a regulation to ensure that black and white pigs do not come into the country.  I cannot understand people bringing them into the country.  I was surprised to hear the Minister say that there is such a risk, and that people are doing it, unless they want to have them for a show piece, perhaps.  I will, however, accept it if the Minister says that a regulation is necessary.</P>
    <P>In regard to quality, the Minister did give us figures here showing that Grade A pigs over a period of some time have risen from 54 per cent. to 63 per cent.  I wonder does the Minister regard that as a satisfactory figure, having regard to the amount of work and money spent on the improvement of pig breeding in this country.  If it is going to take as long to produce the right type of pig as the dual purpose cow&mdash;the policy of the dual purpose cow has been in operation for a very long time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a one-purpose pig, yes.  The dual purpose cow was regarded as the ideal cow, and if it takes as long to produce the ideal pig as it did to produce the dual purpose cow, I do not think the game will be worth the candle.  Is a very serious attempt being made to ensure that only the right type of boar is produced? Those are the factors that regulate the quality of our pigs.  Are the people engaged in production and <Col N="1007" /> the breeding of the right type of boar being paid properly for the work they must do?  Is the price paid by the Department of Agriculture controlling the scheme sufficient to ensure that the right type of boar is being bred in this country?</P>
      <P>I have heard complaints from some people engaged in that branch of agriculture that, having regard to all the difficulties, it is not sufficient to pay them and make it a worthwhile policy. Furthermore, you will have complaints even that the Department do not pay the people who produce boars for breeding purposes as soon as they might.  Maybe, at times, such complaints are well-founded.  If we could ensure that, by progeny testing, only the right type of boar would be bred in this country, we might, in a shorter time than it took us to produce the dual-purpose cow, develop an ideal type of pig that would, in from 150 to 160 days, if reasonably and properly fed, weigh up to 12 stones dead-weight. That would be the ideal position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has been made of the Landrace pig.  Senator Burke talked of food conversion in terms of pounds of bacon.  I am sure he knows a lot <Col N="1008" /> about the marketing aspect of the business since he is interested in it from the business point of view, but not from the farmers' end.  I think his remarks on food conyersion in terms of pounds of bacon could be harmful to the Minister for Agriculture.  He forgot that a pig is not fed on raw barley but on barley meal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned barley meal at 25/- per cwt.  I spoke of four lb. conversion, live-weight.  I think that figures can be produced in this country to show that I erred on the side of generosity towards the pig producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be very sorry to misquote Senator Burke, but I understood him to quote the price of barley at £4 for four cwt. and then to relate the figure of four lb. of food to one lb. of bacon.  That is what I gathered.  I do not think I am wrong, but, if I am wrong in suggesting that Senator Burke said that, I am very sorry.  If he wishes, the Minister may have a more accurate note of what Senator Burke said and can refer to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Burke also talked about marketing conditions.  He referred to the fact that the large Irish White had one lb. extra of the heavier shoulder cut, for which a trader will not get as good a price.  I do not know whether or not Senator Burke is an advocate of the Landrace pig.  I am not.  However, I say that that was the best argument that any man could make either here or anywhere else for the Landrace pig because the characteristic of the Landrace is that he is longer.  Somebody told me that he has more ribs.  I am not sure of that.  I am not an authority of the anatomy of any particular breed.  However, I was told that that was the reason why the Landrace had a longer side and was more economic and yielded a high quality bacon.  I suggest that Senator Burke made the best case that was ever made in favour of the Landrace pig, but I am not prepared to accept his figures, if I understood them correctly. He had no regard to the fact that food other than barley has to be fed to a pig, if you want to produce a quality article.  If you have not <Col N="1009" /> creamery milk, you will have to supplement the food with bone-meal, and so on.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is trying to increase the quality and quantity of the bacon of this country, I will support him as far as I can.  However, the real way to increase production is to ensure that the minimum price is such that the farmer will be sure it is an economic proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because, for the first time in our history, it gives stability to the farmers and to all those engaged in pig production. It should put an end to the violent fluctuations which we have had in the pig industry over the past 20 years.  Those of us who are farmers are avare that, when we had a glut of pigs, the price immediately dropped and that, when pigs became scarce, the price soared sky-high.  Under this Bill, what is considered to be a fair price will be given.  Farmers will not make a fortune out of pigs, but they will get a fair price.  They should increase production immediately, because now they know that, no matter how many pigs they produce, they will get a minimum price of 235/- for Grade A pigs.</P>
      <P>Senator Cogan referred to the drop in pig production in this country during 1954 and 1955: I suppose he was trying to imply that it happened since we were returned to office.  We admit there has been a slight drop in pig production but it is very slight in comparison with the drop that took place between 1931 and 1947.  In 1932, there were 1,227,003 pigs in this country.  In 1948&mdash;and remember that the war was over for three years so that there is no use in saying that there was a war on&mdash;when this inter-Party Government took office, there were only 45,065 pigs in this country, only one-third of the pigs we had in 1932.  Before we went out of office, the inter-Party Government increased the number of pig to almost 800,000.  They almost double the number and I do not think that that was doing too badly.  Our record is more favourable as regards pi production in this country than the record of the Party which Senator Cogan now supports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> I wonder if the Minister is altogether right in banning the Landrace pig. There are many people who claim that our Department of Agriculture is a bit too conservative and lacking in initiative.  I have been given some figures in relation to a firm in the North who have at present between 6,000 and 7,000 pigs.  At present they are crossing the large York with the Landrace boar and they seem with the first cross to be getting very good results, and I think they are getting over 80 per cent. of Grade A pigs.  I think that is much better than ours. With the knowledge and experience they have of pig production, they believe this to be the right thing.  We, too, have been learning a good deal from those people in the North.  It is admitted by everyone that they have vast experience in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is agreed by all that agriculture is our main industry.  As the Minister has often pointed out here, the standard of living of every man, woman and child in this country, whether working in a factory or elsewhere, depends on what the farmers of Ireland are able to get from the land of Ireland and export profitably abroad.  We must have the raw materials to keep the wheels of industry turning and give employment to our own people.  Last year, we had a balance of trade deficit of £95,000,000, and taking everything else into consideration, I think we had a financial deficit at the end of the year of £35,000,000.</P>
    <P>It is agreed by everyone with any knowledge of the pig industry here that we could produce 1,000,000 extra pigs in this country.  If we do it&mdash;we have enough for home consumption at the present time&mdash;those 1,000,000 extra pigs can be sent abroad.  Taking them at an average of £16 or £17 per pig, it would mean that we would gain anything between £16,000,000 and £17,000,000 extra coming into this country each year.  That would go a very long way to balance our trade figures and would help to end the economic problems facing this country at the present time.</P>
    <P>I think we all agree that pigs are the one thing that can be produced <Col N="1011" /> quickly and very quickly.  Any farmer will admit that we could double the production of pigs in anything from 15 to 18 months.  The humble pig could yet be the salvation of this little nation of ours.  We should all appeal to the farmers and to farmers' organisations like Muintir na Tíre, the National Farmers' Association and to our committees of agriculture, to interest the farmers and to appeal to them to increase their production, to go in for growing more barley, to produce more of our feeding stuff here at home in Ireland, to grow it in Ireland.  We could grow it on the land of Ireland.  We should try to get them to produce at least 1,000,000 extra pigs.  If we do that and were able to do that, it would get us over the majority of the difficulties that confront us at the present time.  The farmers saved this country before, during the last war, and I think they could save it again now, if they did that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Seanad for the spirit in which they have received this Bill.  I am grateful to the Seanad for acknowledging so generously the validity of the attempt made by this Government to remove instability from pig prices.  I welcome the recognition by the Seanad that this is an effort made after many long years of waiting.  I think the Seanad is justified in taking this optimistic view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, we would all like to guarantee a higher price for pigs, but I would remind the Seanad that the price guaranteed to-day is a minimum price.  If there is a better price to be got for the bacon derived from Irish pigs anywhere in the world, we will get it.  The purpose of this guarantee is not to pin the price of pigs to 235/- for Grade A: it is to assure the farmers of this country, on the authority of the Government, that, in no circumstances, whatever quantity of Grade A pig is produced, can the price go below 235/-.  It may go above it: at the present time the price is about 245/-.  I think Senators will agree with me that, from the point of view of a <Col N="1012" /> Minister for Agriculture, his prime concern is to see that the producer gets the best possible price he can for his product.  I think Senators are correct in saying that heretofore no Minister for Agriculture has felt himself free to say that, without regard to the volume produced, the price never can go below a certain guaranteed limit.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that there should be a guarantee for 12 months ahead.  Even if I were in a position to do that, I do not know that it would be expedient to do it.  I do not think it would be a bad thing if we were able to give the guarantee for six months; it might be preferable if we were able to do it for nine; but there is no use putting the whole long-term programme in jeopardy by giving undertakings of a character that you may not be able to fulfil.  I think I can say with full confidence, as of to-day, that the minimum price prescribed will not be allowed to decline in any period without at least six months' notice being given to pig producers. If circumstances permit, I would like to make that period even longer.  I think it is safe for pig producers to presume, as of to-day, that there will be no decline in the minimum fixed price without at least six months' notice.</P>
    <P>Senators have referred to the very close and vital connection between the minimum prices guaranteed and the prices at which feeding stuffs can be purchased.  I sometimes think that in regard to pig feeding it would be a blessing if bagged stuff&mdash;that is, pig feeding purchased in bags from millers &mdash;got so dear that the farmers of this country would be forced to grow their own feeding.  The truth of it is that, in the past in this country, the producer of the pigs has handed the bulk of his profit away, to the transport company, to the sack manufacturer, to the miller and to the retail merchant. Now, this is a free country and if people want to go on doing that, it is no part of my duty or my right to interfere with them.</P>
    <P>I want to say, as I have said in public repeatedly before, that I deplore the practice of farmers in this <Col N="1013" /> country growing the best kind of pig feeding that can be bought for money anywhere in the world, reaping that crop, threshing it and then selling it for £1 a cwt.  Whereupon some transport authority carries it to a mill&mdash;it may be a licensed carrier, it may be C.I.E. or it may be the miller's lorry, but somebody pays for the petrol and the lorry, the driver and the helpers time.  It has to be unloaded and carried into the mill.  Mind you, sometimes, a Chathaoirleach, it is not carried into the mill, it is carried to the grain wholesaler's premises and is taken in there.  Then it is held there and there is storage charged on it every week that it lies there.  Then it is sold to the miller and then the miller gets to work on it and grinds it and puts it in a jute bag which he had to buy.  Then it is put in his store and then it is unhoused at 2/6 a ton&mdash; that is for the process of carrying it out of the mill.  It is then loaded in the carrier's truck, brought back to the town where the farmer who grew it lives and sold to a retailer.  Then the retailer unloads it and brings it in and he must pay a man for doing that. He must also pay the man who sells it and, finally, the farmer who sold it in the first case for 20/- buys it back at 31/- or 32/- and then proceeds to feed it to his own pigs.  When he sells a pig for £17 or £18 he must have lost £1 of his profit.</P>

      <P>The relevance of that interjection does not strike me at the moment.  I am describing the burden of charges which fall on the barley when it leaves the growers' hands, passes through various processes and then returns to them.  The alternative is for the armer to keep his own barley and, either get an electric mill, if he has rural electrification and mill it himself or bring it to a neighbour's mill and get it milled.  I think Senator Burke is conservative in his estimate.  The difference as between the farmer who mills his own barley and feeds it to is own pig and the farmer who sells his barley and then buys it back cannot be less than £1 a <Col N="1014" /> pig.  It sometimes makes me despair to see intelligent farmers working hard and then distributing for the benefit of all and sundry this £1 per pig which they ought to have for themselves.</P>
      <P>It may be hard work, but it is time we said in this country that there is no soft living to be got in Ireland, particularly on the land of Ireland; and anyone who is not prepared to work hard on the land of Ireland, the sooner he gets off the land, the better it will be for himself and everybody else.  We might as well face it, there is no soft money to be got on the land of Ireland.</P>

      <P>For those who work hard on the land of Ireland there is a good living in return for hard work, and anyone who is privileged to own part of the land of Ireland has a very solemn duty to work hard, for, if he does not, he betrays not only himself but his country as well.  That is a very vital fact to face at the moment and if the people with land are not prepared to work hard and get the maximum return from it we are all &ldquo;bunched&rdquo; in this country.  A Senator rightly said that there is probably no source through which we can more rapidly expand profitably the output of the land of Ireland than through pigs, and if I could bring home to the farmers this dazzling fact that, through the medium of pigs, we could increase the output of agriculture in this country without importing one pennyworth of the raw material requisite to achieve our objective.  It is doubtful if one can say the same of any other branch of agriculture.  In barley, potatoes and skimmed milk, we have a complete diet and if there is no skimmed milk available, we have an abundance to-day of the necessary proteins in the shape of meat and bone-meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter of such vital importance to us in considering a Bill of this kind that I ask your indulgence, Sir, <Col N="1015" /> to remind Senators of the fundamental change which has taken place in this whole business since 1939, because one of the disastrous characteristics of our mentality is that we get fixed ideas in this country and to change them requires something approximating a revolution.  Pre-1939, we lived in a world of intense competition and with the knowledge that there was available to our competitors in the pig and bacon industry a raw material of the highest quality, but of matchlessly low price, in the form of maize.  The reason for that was that there was not then known a variety of barley in the world which would give a yield per statute acre which made it possible to compete with maize through barley.  Post war, there emerged the new Scandinavian varieties, commonly known as Ymer, Herta, and Frejia and now we have one of our own, Eorna, and their capacity to produce under average Irish conditions yields of from 35 to 55 cwt. of grain per statute acre makes them to-day a cheaper and a better feed than maize ever was.</P>
    <P>It is that development which has opened up this vast potential to our people, if they but avail of it.  We have removed the old hazard of a collapse in prices.  Every farmer has to his hand a means of getting the entire profit for his work, leaving nothing for the middleman, the transport worker or any other who would wish to have their percentage off, and we have the certainty that there is at our hand a market in which we can dispose of more pigs than there is any likelihood of our ever producing in this country.  If we could communicate to our farmers the dazzling potentialities of that situation, I foresee a great prospect for the economy of this country through the medium of this one item, complex as it is, of increased production.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should depart finally from the Second Stage of this Bill without referring to an aspect of this matter that Senator Burke dealt with and which goes to the very heart of the matter, that is, the quality of our pigs and the conversion rate which it is possible to obtain with the <Col N="1016" /> strains of pigs available to us.  We have begun progeny testing of pigs in this country and we have now got the complete returns of the third progeny test&mdash;subject to all the limitations which I have mentioned in Ballyhaise, and conditions that are not of a character which justify claims for scientific perfection for the progeny testing we have done there.  The new progeny testing station in the Munster Institute will, I hope, be completed in March and we can proceed with progeny testing on the same basis as is maintained in Denmark, Holland and the United States.</P>
    <P>We have in the interim conducted three progeny tests in Ballyhaise under tentative conditions and these have provisionally estimated that we have achieved a conversion rate&mdash;the House will remember that Senator Burke spoke of a rate of four to one&mdash; which fluctuates between 33 lb. of meal to 1 lb. of meat gained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am gratified to learn of the Senator's astonishment, but I am bound to add that at the other end of the test we have had pigs whose conversion rate was four.  The average was 3.5 lb. of meal per lb. of meat gained.  That is no mean achievement and amply confirms Senator Burke's belief that, under average good methods of husbandry, it should be possible for any farmer in Ireland to attain to a conversion rate of four to one.  I believe we are well on our way to attaining to an average in the country of 3.6 and, as Senator Burke pointed out, that means a handsome profit, on the basis of barley at its present valuation.</P>
      <P>I think one Senator asked me what was the levy per pig under the scheme of guarantee.  It is 2/- per pig purchased for conversion into bacon or on pigs delivered at bacon factories.  It is impossible to say under this system the rate of bounty because that is regulated by the price realised on the English market.  That is an average. It is on that basis that the rate of bounty is estimated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there was any other <Col N="1017" /> matter raised with which I failed to deal, except perhaps the Landrace pig. I dealt with that in another place. The problem is perfectly simple.  I often wonder do people believe that I exclude the Landrace pig for fun.  No Minister wants to enforce a regulation to the annoyance of any citizen of the State.  The fact that he has to do it would suggest there is some reason why he should do it.  My information is that the Grade A average of the Landrace pig, as delivered to Danish factories, fluctuates between 50 per cent. and, I think, about 76 per cent. That is the Danish Landrace.  We have access not to the Danish Landrace, for they will not permit its export, but to the Swedish Landrace. Generally, my view is to allow a farmer to have access to any type of live stock he thinks best.  I am not forgetting that I seek power to maintain our present policy of excluding coloured pigs.  I do not know whether the House wants me to go into details, but pigs are broadly divided into forest pigs and non-forest pigs. Coloured pigs are derived from types of pigs that originally lived in woodlands and white pigs are derived from pigs who lived elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We have always excluded the coloured pigs and we have avoided the miscellaneous cross which has worked so much to the great detriment of the pig industry in Britain.  Here is the whole problem.  I, first of all, consult my live-stock advisers in respect of any live-stock problem.  Then I consult my veterinary advisers.  My veterinary advisers are unanimous in recommending that we should not admit the Landrace pig because it is a carrier of acute atrophic rhinitis.</P>
    <P>Ordinarily, I would rest on that advice and act upon it, but so ardent did the argument become and so vociferous were those who held the view opposite to mine that I resolved in this case I should look further afield, and I consulted eminent veterinary authorities from two Governments whose circumstances were closely analogous to ours.  In both cases, I was most emphatically advised in no circumstances to admit the Landrace pig, that the disadvantage of the <Col N="1018" /> introduction of this disease far outweighed any possible advantage that might be derived from this breed.  You pay your money and you take your choice but I have got to ask Senators, any one of whom may be Minister for Agriculture in the morning, what would they do?</P>
    <P>Would they take the risk of bringing in that disease?  Remember that it is very easy to bring it in and very difficult to get it out.  With regard to atrophic rhinitis, you can bring in pigs which show no clinical sign of the disease and it is certain that their progeny can show it and transmit it, but it is not at all certain that they cannot beget progeny which show no clinical signs but which themselves bred may in the second generation show the disease.  That that is possible is not proven but that that is impossible is not proven either.  It is suspected that it has happened.</P>
    <P>Lastly, there is this point to be borne in mind.  When you hear vigorous and energetic propaganda in favour of the introduction of a new breed, never forget the uniform history that attends the introduction of a new breed.  Those concerned, for instance, with its introduction publicise and inflate the claims for the excellence of that new breed.  They bring in six sows and a boar.  They hope to have 60 pigs, perhaps they only have 50, from the first mate.  Now they confidently expect to get £500 or £600 apiece for these sows and boars and go on getting it until they become relatively common.  Then, of course, the bottom falls out of the market, but by that time they have made their kitty.</P>
    <P>We must remember that two or three years ago there used to be reports in English papers of Landrace pigs fetching big prices in England and fantastic prices being paid for Landrace boars.  All that is over now, but those who got in on the ground floor made great fortunes.  When you read passionate declarations that there is nothing to compare with the Landrace breed, ask yourself this question&mdash;&ldquo;Do these vociferous proposers contemplate breeding the Landrace?  Have they perhaps made <Col N="1019" /> arrangements, if the restrictions are removed, to turn up the following morning with the brilliant herd, the splendid herd?  I can see the names, nearly, of Landrace pigs which are to be sold at fancy prices to those of our people who are persuaded that they are of incomparable value and when the fortune is made others can keep the Landrace pig and you and I can struggle with the problem of atrophic rhinitis.  If you were Minister for Agriculture would you say&mdash;&ldquo;Here is a breed of pigs capable by selection and testing of improvement from an average of 54 per cent. grade A to an average of 63 per cent. grade A.&rdquo;  If we can do that inside one year, is it not better to go on with this disease free breed that we have and go on improving it, than to take the risks that have been put forward?</P>
    <P>I have examined, and will examine, the possibility of bringing Landrace pigs in under veterinary supervision, but I will not bring them in, as long as I am Minister for Agriculture, if it involves the slightest risk of importing acute atrophic rhinitis into this country.  I have seen some bacon from Landrace pigs marketed in Great Britain as grade A and I do not think that I would be wrong in saying that if it were offered in this country, it would be grade C or grade X.  Distant hills look green.  Samuel Johnson said of us that we were the most honest people in the world for we never spoke well of ourselves.  It is a queer characteristic.</P>
    <P>If the Danes have a pig, it is a dream of a pig; if the Dutch have a cow, it is a miracle of a cow; but the dual purpose Shorthorn&mdash;who would be bothered with that?  The Irish Large White pig, who would be bothered with that, until somebody flies in from America to bring some of them out to America and then I am told he is only one swallow and he does not make a summer.  Well, he is not indicative of mid-winter either. That is what I am driving at.</P>
    <P>I invite Senators to help me by their good counsel to increase the numbers of pigs delivered to the factories by at least one million, confident that when <Col N="1020" /> we have achieved that, our second target will be two million.  I invite Senators who are asked by any of their friends in the country: &ldquo;What then shall we do?&rdquo;  to tell them to send me a postcard asking for the new leaflet on raising pigs.  Tell them that they need not put a stamp on the postcard and tell them I will send the leaflet for nothing.  It contains all they require to know about rearing pigs and feeding pigs and, more important, making a profit on them.</P>

      <P>It has for some time past been accepted as desirable that steps should be taken as expeditiously as possible to dispense with the use of Emergency legislation and in so doing to arrange for the incorporation in permanent legislation of such Emergency Powers as are still required to be utilised or which it is considered prudent to retain in case they may be needed in the future.  It is in pursuance of this policy that this Bill has been introduced.  It will incorporate in the framework of the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Acts, 1935 to 1941, the provisions of seven Emergency Powers Orders relating to dairy produce or the power to make similar Orders under this Bill. It contains no new matters of principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1021" /> Of the seven Emergency Powers Orders to which I refer, five are still in operation and relate to the borrowing powers of the Butter Marketing Committee, the payment out of the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Fund of allowances on creamery butter and other dairy products, the distribution of creamery butter in the Dublin area or any other specified area and the fixing by two Orders the maximum wholesale prices for creamery butter.  The remaining two Emergency Powers Orders which were discontinued a few years ago relate to the restriction on the use of creamery butter other than for household purposes and the fixing of maximum wholesale prices for imported butter.</P>
    <P>The Order relating to the borrowing powers of the Butter Marketing Committee is the Emergency Powers (No. 283) Order, 1943.  The corresponding provisions are contained in Section 9 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Butter Marketing Committee is a central marketing organisation operating under rules approved by the Minister for Agriculture under the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) (Amendment) Act, 1941.  It has for its functions the cold storage of creamery butter for winter use, the supplying of the creamery butter requirements of the Dublin and Bray areas throughout the whole year, and the import and export of creamery butter whenever casual shortages or surpluses arise.</P>
    <P>In connection with the function of arranging for the storage of creamery butter for winter use, the committee borrows from its bankers during the summer months the capital required to purchase the butter and repays the money during the winter months according as it sells the butter.  The Act of 1941 empowers the Minister for Agriculture, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to guarantee the repayment of these borrowings up to the limit of £500,000.  By the year 1943, the position was that, due to the large quantities of butter stored by the committee and the increasing value of the butter, the sum of <Col N="1022" /> £500,000 was not sufficient to enable the committee to finance its purchases of butter for cold storage.  It was therefore found necessary to have recourse to Emergency Powers Order to amend the Act by increasing to £2,000,000 the amount of the borrowings the repayment of which could be guaranteed.  In recent years, the position is that due to further increases in the value of butter, the Committee has found it necessary to obtain temporary bank accommodation in excess of the guaranteed figure of £2,000,000 the extra borrowings being secured by private arrangement between the committee and its bankers.  A higher rate of interest than that applicable to the guaranteed portion of the borrowing is charged on the excess.  As the committee's annual trading losses, which arise out of its cold storage transactions, are made good to the committee each year out of State funds, it is most desirable that the full amount of the committee's bank overdraft should be secured at the most favourable rate of interest obtainable.  It is, therefore, proposed in this Bill to increase from £2,000,000 to £4,000,000 the amount of its borrowings the repayment of which can be guaranteed by the State.</P>
    <P>The power to pay out of the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Fund certain allowances on butter and other dairy products is contained in the Emergency Powers (No. 270) Order, 1943, and that power is now embodied in Section 8 of the Bill in the exact form in which it was contained in the Emergency Powers Order.  Under the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Acts in their original form the Minister for Agriculture was authorised to pay out of the Fund contributions towards any approved scheme for the regulation of the sale of butter or any milk product.  In the year 1943, the amount standing to the credit of the Fund was sufficient to enable the Fund to contribute towards the payment of creamery butter subsidies in the form of allowances on production and on cold storage of the butter which up to that time had been paid in full out of the Exchequer.  To enable such payments <Col N="1023" /> to be made out of the Fund the Acts were suitably amended by the Emergency Powers Order.  Allowances are still being paid on production and cold storage of creamery butter and, in addition, allowances are now being paid on sales of such butter.  As long as subsidisation of creamery butter is continued, whether on its cold storage, its production or its sale, it is desirable that the power should be retained to enable any moneys available in the Fund from time to time to be utilised for that purpose in reduction of the amount which otherwise would have to be provided by the Exchequer.  For this reason the Bill proposes to make permanent the relative amendment of the Acts which has been operated by the Emergency Powers Order since 1943.</P>
    <P>Regulation of the sale of creamery butter in the Dublin area is operated by means of the Emergency Powers Order entitled the Butter (Control in Scheduled Area) Order, 1952.  The provisions of this Order are incorporated in Section 4 of the Bill. During the period of ten years in which the domestic consumption of creamery butter was rationed the supply of butter to the Dublin and Bray areas was, by Emergency Powers Order, canalised through the Butter Marketing Committee.  The reason for this arrangement was that the ordinary rationing regulations which operated smoothly in other parts of the country were not by themselves adequate to deal with the distribution problem in the Dublin and Bray areas where the large concentration of population involved heavy supplies of butter.  When butter rationing was abolished in July, 1952, the then existing functions of the Butter Marketing Committee, including that relating to the supply of creamery butter in the Dublin and Bray areas, were continued.  This arrangement is still working satisfactorily and the Bill proposes to continue it.</P>
    <P>The fixing of maximum wholesale prices for creamery butter has been operated by way of Emergency Powers Orders since the year 1940, new Orders being made from time to time <Col N="1024" /> according as the prices were altered. The Emergency Powers Orders at present in operation are the Creamery Butter and Butter Boxes Order, 1954, and the Roll Butter Order, 1954.  The power to make similar Orders under the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Acts is contained in Section 7 of this Bill.  The power which the Act of 1935 gives to the Minister for Agriculture to prescribe by Order maximum prices at which any specified class of butter may be sold wholesale, restricts such Orders to the prices charged by the manufacturer of the butter.  In the case of creamery butter, therefore, the Act enabled maximum prices to be prescribed only in relation to the sale by a creamery of butter of its own manufacturer.  It did not cover the price at which creameries could sell butter purchased from other creameries or from the Butter Marketing Committee, or the price of creamery butter sold by wholesalers to retailers.</P>
    <P>When it first became necessary in 1940 to control the maximum retail price of creamery butter, it was also necessary to control the profit margins of wholesalers and retailers.  To do this, recourse had to be had to Emergency Powers to prescribe by Order maximum prices for all creamery butter sold by wholesale, whether the sale was effected by creameries to wholesalers, by creameries to retailers or by wholesalers to retailers.  As the maximum retail price of creamery butter is still controlled, the intermediate prices of the butter between the creamery and the retailer must continue to be fixed.  The power to make such detailed prices Orders under the Act is, therefore, being included in the Bill in substitution for the similar powers at present operated by Emergency Powers Orders.</P>
    <P>The Emergency Powers Orders relating to the maximum wholesale prices of creamery butter also contained a provision for the compulsory return of empty butter boxes to creameries, and Section 6 of the Bill gives the Minister for Agriculture the power to make similar provisions by Order under the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Acts.  The enforced return of empty 56 lb. butter boxes to <Col N="1025" /> creameries is inextricably bound up with the butter price structure, wholesalers' and retailers' margins and the permitted re-use under Regulations made under the Dairy Produce Act, 1924, of timber butter boxes for the packing of butter at creameries.</P>
    <P>As regards the butter price structure, what happened was that when provision was first made in 1942 for the re-use by creameries of returned empty butter boxes in which butter had been delivered on sale, the net wholesale butter prices were reduced by 2/- per cwt. and at the same time provision was made in the gross price for rebates of 9/- and 10/- per cwt. on return to the creamery of the two empty 56 lb. boxes.  By this means, butter whole-wholesaler's margins were increased by 1/- per cwt. to compensate them for having to collect the empty boxes from retailers and the retailers' margins were increased by 1/- per cwt. because they were no longer permitted to retain the empty boxes.  This whole arrangement was originally designed to cater for the war-time situation in which timber for butter boxes was in short supply, and enabled boxes to be used perhaps two or three times before they deteriorated so much in quality as to render them no longer suitable for use. Nowadays, while suitable timber is plentiful, to revert to the single use of a timber butter box would increase the cost of packaging butter at creameries. In order to pave the way for terminating eventually the need for using butter boxes more than once, I introduced last year as an alternative to timber boxes the cheaper fibreboard package, which is permitted to be used only once, and I am hopeful that before very long the fibreboard box will completely replace the older type of timber box.  Accordingly, as soon as it is feasible to stop the use by creameries of secondhand boxes (by revoking the relevant regulation under the Dairy Produce Act), the powers contained in Section 6 of the Bill, which are at present still necessary, to make regulations in regard to the return of empty boxes to creameries will no longer be utilised.</P>
    <P>As regards the two Emergency Powers Orders which are no longer in <Col N="1026" /> operation but which are being covered in the Bill, the first is the Imported Butter (Maximum Wholesale Prices) Order, 1954.  The providing of maximum wholesale prices of imported butter had to be effected by way of Emergency Powers Order because the scope of the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Acts was not sufficiently wide to enable maximum wholesale prices for such butter to be prescribed by Order under those Acts.  While I sincerely trust that it may not be necessary in the future to import supplementary supplies of butter, nevertheless it is only prudent that the power to prescribe prices for imported butter should be retained in permanent legislation in case the need for the fixing of such prices should ever again arise.  Section 7 of the Bill contains the necessary power.</P>
    <P>The remaining Emergency Powers Order which is not now in operation but which is being included in the Bill is the Emergency Powers (Restriction on Use of Creamery Butter) Order, 1942.  This Order was in operation from June, 1942 to November, 1954.  It prohibited the buying, selling or use of creamery butter for any purpose other than ordinary household use except under a permit granted by the Minister for Agriculture.  It was originally made for the purpose of conserving stocks of creamery butter when butter rationing was introduced, but in later years was availed of for the purpose of recovering from users of creamery butter for manufacturing purposes the amount of State subsidy involved in the butter so used.</P>
    <P>The method under which this was operated was that on payment of a prescribed fee by the applicants, permits were granted under the Order for the use of specified quantities of creamery butter for the manufacture of fruit cake, confectionery, shortbread, etc.  The fee, which was fixed at a rate per cwt. of butter covered by the permit, was determined by the Minister for Finance under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provision) Act, 1946, and represented the cost to the State of cold storage of the butter together with the amount of the subsidy payable on the production <Col N="1027" /> and sale of the butter by creameries. As it may in the future be found necessary to re-introduce the system of issue of permits authorising the use of creamery butter for manufacturing purposes and to arrange for the collection of permit fees, it is proposed in Section 5 of the Bill to make permanent provision for the making of the necessary restriction Order whenever the need for such an Order would arise.</P>
    <P>There is one other minor provision of the Bill to which I refer.  The opportunity presented by this measure is being taken to make a slight amendment of the Act of 1941 to enable levies to be imposed on stocks of imported butter held by creameries.  The Act already provides for similar levies on butter of all kinds held by butter traders and on stocks of creamery butter held by creameries but it omits to cover imported butter held by creameries. The necessary amendment of the Act is contained in Section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a remarkable similarity between this Bill and the Bill with which we have just been dealing.  Here, again, we are converting temporary legislation into permanent legislation and we are making future provision for the regulation of a very important industry. Here, again, there is implied a considerable amount of control, direction and subsidisation by the State.  I am in favour of all these things, not because I like them, but because they are inevitable.  We cannot run the dairying industry, any more than the pig-producing industry, on absolutely uncontrolled lines, because we have found that, over the past 20 years, or more, the only way to preserve that industry is by a certain amount of price control and State backing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry Senator L'Estrange is not here.  He would probably entertain us by taking us back over the years and dwelling at considerable length on the war years when raw materials were unavailable.  He lives in a dream world.  He seems to think you can maintain an important <Col N="1028" /> industry at full production without essential raw materials, such as fertilisers and machinery and all the other things that are necessary for production.</P>
    <P>On many occasions in the past, when dealing with the parent Bill or the principal Act, the Minister gave to the Dáil and to the country at large eloquent and entertaining orations upon the folly of subsidising the export of butter and of controlling and regulating the dairying industry. I am glad he has repented of those follies and that he now comes here to continue legislation which was introduced by another Minister over 20 years ago.  It speaks highly, to a certain extent, of the wisdom of the Minister who first introduced the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Act that his plans and his methods are being endorsed and continued so many years after they were first introduced.</P>
    <P>This Bill is absolutely essential for the continuance of the dairying industry.  I hope the pig and bacon industry will continue to expand and increase.  We know there is a problem of finding a market.  At the same time, we know there are no means by which you can secure from an acre of Irish land a greater output on the average than through the production of milk and dairy produce.  Dairying gives employment and remuneration to the smaller farmer and to the family working on the farm.  I think everyone here will agree that the industry ought to be protected and safeguarded and, in so far as it is possible for the State to do so, supported in matters of market and price.</P>
    <P>Dairying is probably the only large branch of agriculture that is organised on a co-operative basis.  For that reason, I think everyone hopes that nothing will happen to jeopardise its future.  The local co-operative society is a very important institution and its future ought to be made secure.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill in the Dáil, the Minister referred to the costings investigations in progress in regard to the price of milk.  At that time, his observations were most unwise and mischievous.  He accused <Col N="1029" /> the farmers representing the milk-producing interests on the Costings Commission of having at that time&mdash; the 22nd March&mdash;secured the results of the Costings Commission.  He accused them of having that information in their possession while they were protesting against the long delay of the costings investigation.  I think it is right to say that that accusation was absolutely false.  The actual figures, as produced by the Director of the Costings Commission, did not become available to the producer members for a very considerable time afterwards.</P>
    <P>It is necessary for the future of the dairying industry that confidence should be restored in the goodwill of the Department and of the Minister towards that industry.  The Minister's statement, when he was introducing this Bill in the Dáil, was not calculated to promote that goodwill.  He made it clear that he was in some way in collusion with the technical staff of the Costings Commission.</P>

      <P>Very well.  I will read, then, what the Minister said on that occasion and Senators can draw their own conclusions from it.  This is reported at column 1121, Volume 155:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dillon: Deputy Donnchadh O Briain, with the circumspection which has been referred to in the Scripture and has been likened to a cat walking along the top of a wall covered with glass, made reference to the report of the Costings Commission. He reminded me of the turtle in <i>Alice Through the Looking Glass</i> who said: &lsquo;Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, join the dance?&rsquo; I am told that the members of the commission got a preliminary report on the 1st March, five days before they staged a march in the city, and believe it or not, I am damned if I can get them to give it to me.  I understand by rumour, but this is only unofficial&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then there was an exchange of compliments between the Minister and some members of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Allen: Off the record?</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: Not off the record, I am bound to give the House the best information I have.  I cannot get this commission to give me that preliminary report.  They have their reasons for withholding it but I think they are treating me a little hardly by not giving me whatever information they have got?</P>
      <P>Mr. Allen: What is the rumour?</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: The rumour is that the preliminary report related only to milk produced for consumption in the Dublin and Cork liquid milk areas.</P>
      <P>Donnchadh O Briain: That has been announced by the Government Information Bureau.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: Yes.  The Deputy need not get cross.</P>
      <P>Donnchadh O Briain: I am not getting cross.</P>
      <P>Mr. Dillon: I know Deputy Ó Briain will sympathise with me when he thinks of the members of the commission having the report now for close on three weeks and not having told me what is in it though they paraded the town having it in their pockets.  The rumour&mdash; and let me point out it is no more than a rumour&mdash;which has reached me is that they have been advised by their technical directors that the prime cost of the production of one gallon of milk, including labour and raw material, is 1/3d. per gallon.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No; 1/3¾d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>He is right&mdash;1/3¾d. The report continues:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The farmers' representatives, I understand, claim there ought to be an estimate providing for payment of management and compensation for capital.  According to the <Col N="1031" /> rumour, I understand that the figures they have in mind are 4½d. for the management of the cow and 4½d. for the recruitment of capital invested in the cow.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope I have read sufficient now to show that the Minister indicated to Dáil Eireann at that time that he knew what was going on in the Costings Commission, that he had figures actually from the Costings Commission. Where did he get those figures? Where could he have got them, except from his officials on the Costings Commission? If he got those figures from his officials on the Costings Commission, is it not evident that there was collusion between the Minister and the officials of his Department on that commission, that those officials were going behind the backs of the commission and giving the Minister information on the work that they were doing?</P>
    <P>That is what I meant by saying that the Minister indicated that he was in collusion with certain officials in the Costings Commission and in that way he deliberately undermined any confidence that anyone could have in the impartiality of that commission or of the technical officers who were employed on that commission.  That is the feeling that is widespread now and what the Minister said at that time contributed in a large measure to making it apparent that the Costings Commission was not an impartial body, or, at any rate, that the technical officers of the Department were not allowed to be impartial.  Possibly they were under the threat of what might happen to them at the hands of the head of the Department, if they dared to give a decision which would not be in conformity with the Minister's wishes.  That is exactly what has happened so far.</P>
    <P>I said over six months ago that &ldquo;long churning makes bad butter.&rdquo; The Costings Commission dragged on for over two years from the time the necessary information was collected. As a result of those long deliberations, we have a report presented by the technical officers of the Department which does not command the confidence of anyone.</P>

      <P>Something should be done now by the Minister to restore confidence in the industry.  It is quite clear that the Minister, by his action and by his words, has sabotaged to a great extent the operations of the Costings Commission.  He can come forward now and meet the producers. If nothing can be done, he should meet the producers direct and come to an agreement with them with regard to the future of the industry.  That is probably the best thing to do.  No one will accept now the decision of that discredited&mdash;those discredited technical officers.  I hope the Minister will at a very early date be able to announce an improvement in the price of milk paid to producers.  He gave what appeared to be an indication some months ago that an increase would be made in the price of milk as from June last.  Nothing more was heard of that.  The general feeling amongst farmers was that a small increase in the price of milk was coming at that time.  If it was coming, it has not yet arrived.  Farmers are fair minded people and if we got a clear indication of policy in regard to the price of milk for the coming year, it would be of immense value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1033" /> The creamery industry is expanding and will continue to expand, not only because farmers have available to them increased supplies of raw materials in the form of fertilisers, but because the manufacture of butter on the farms is declining rapidly.  I do not know whether there are firm figures available for the output of country butter, but I think it will be found that the output has declined very rapidly over the past couple of years.  To a great extent, that decrease is being made up by an increase in creamery butter.  Creameries are extending their area of collection far out into areas which formerly were not covered by the creameries.  More and more people are coming to depend upon the creamery industry as a source of income on their farms, as a source of supply of by-products.  This industry ought to be stabilised and made secure and it is in the power of the Minister to do a good deal towards that end.  He should, either, on his own, announce an improvement in the price, or meet the producers and settle definite terms for the future of the industry.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing the Minister could do, or should do, under this Bill, that is to promote an increased consumption of dairy produce in this State.  I do not think we as a nation are as large consumers of milk as we should be, and there are large sections of the community who do not use as much milk in their homes as they should.  I do not know whether the Minister has power to do this, but he certainly has considerable powers under the Bill.  He is introducing permanent legislation which will give him very considerable powers in regard to the making of Orders and regulations. I hope, in considering some of those Orders and regulations, he will do whatever is possible to stimulate and encourage the consumption of milk, and that the market will be larger, making us less dependent on the export of our surplus dairy produce.  An increased consumption of milk could be offset by a reduction of imported foodstuffs.  It could be a good substitute for quite a number of imported goods and I think that would <Col N="1034" /> be desirable in the long term interest of the dairy industry.</P>

The Irish people have neglected the making of a variety of cheeses and the Minister would do a service to the nation if he could encourage us to become more conscious of the various types.

I first tried to get that done seven years ago and I could not get a creamery in Ireland to do it.  I am not without hope that they will not.  I would value the Opinion of the Seanad on this: how far should we go in restricting people's access to a bit of what they fancy, bearing in mind that this is the thing which does them good?

There is not a single scintilla of truth in Senator Cogan's allegations and I deprecate the practice of Senators, or Deputies, in other places, referring to technical officers of my Department and to public servants in that way.  I am here to answer for the officers of my Department on the administrative or technical side.  The law and custom of this country forbids them doing it.  Allegations of anything improper between public servants and myself reflect no credit on the House in which they are made and if Senator Cogan has any complaint to make he can call on me to answer for it in this <Col N="1037" /> House.  I want to say for the record that there is not a scientilla of truth in all the raiméis that Senator Cogan talked here about the Milk Costings Commission, and the attendant circumstances, which seemed to me to have very little relevance to the Bill, which I commend to the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill, as set out in the explanatory memorandum which I have circulated to Senators, is to confirm ten Orders made by the Government under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the Schedule to this Bill the first five Orders are Revocation Orders.  With the exception of the duty on catgut which is not now being made here the duties which were revoked had been suspended since the emergency and their retention was no longer necessary.  The Order relating to manuscript books merely confirms the rate of duty imposed by an Order made under the Supplies and Services Act.</P>
      <P>The increase in the duty on rosaries and the extension of the scope of the duty was necessary to protect the Irish manufacturers against imports of rosaries from the Far East at low prices which bore no comparison to normal costs of production.</P>
      <P>The manufacture of firebacks and cheeks for domestic fireplaces commenced in Cappoquin in 1954 and the duty was imposed in order to afford a measure of protection for the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in the duty on saws and the extension of the scope of the duty was necessary to enable the Irish firm producing these articles to procure a sufficient share of the home <Col N="1038" /> market for economic production. Notwithstanding the existence of the duty, traders had continued to buy imported saws because of a deeprooted preference for saws produced by external firms who were long established on the Irish market.  There were also imports of low priced saws from the Continent.  Moreover, the duty was being evaded by imports of saw blanks which were, in effect, finished saws except for the cutting of the teeth.  Comparative tests between the Irish made saws and imported saws were carried out by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and these tests revealed that the Irish saws were equal to the imported saws in all essential respects.</P>
    <P>The production of furnishing fabrics of the tapestry type used in the upholstery of furniture and for curtains commenced recently at Drogheda and Nenagh and the duty was imposed to afford a measure of protection for this new industry.  The import control on mattress ticken was being evaded by imports from the Continent of ticken which was designed specifically to evade the import regulations and this problem was also dealt with in the Order made to protect the manufacture of furnishing fabric.</P>

    <P>We on this side of the House naturally support the policy of giving all the necessary encouragement that should be given to our native industries. That has been the policy adopted by this State for a number of years.  That being so, I for one am in agreement that whatever duties are necessary on the articles mentioned here should be imposed.  At the same time, I think it would be a good thing if, while introducing a measure of this kind, the Minister would give us an indication of the employment position regarding these industries that are <Col N="1039" /> being protected at a rather high rate of duty.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned Cappoquin, where one of these industries is being carried on, but we got no indication of where the other industries are being carried on.  Take, for instance, No. 7, the imposition of duties on rosaries. The increase here is a fairly steep one and, perhaps, it would not be out of place to inquire where these rosaries are being manufactured in this country or does that industry come under the aegis of Gaeltarra Éireann?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The two firms which make rosaries are located in Dublin. I should say one of the firms which had to close down because of the imports employed at the time it closed its factory 200 indoor workers and 20 outdoor workers.</P>
      <P>With regard to the fireback industry in Cappoquin, before the duty was imposed, the firm there employed from five to six workers.  Employment has now increased to seven full-time workers and seven part-time workers. This duty was only recently imposed and the firm expect that employment will be extended further.  It has never been the custom to give this information, but if the Senator will be patient with me, I will go through&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister has any doubt that this information which I am seeking would in any way prejudice the success of these industrial efforts, I will not press for the information.  I am in support of the policy of giving whatever protection is necessary for keeping alive our native industries and I would say that perhaps there would be other cases where the Minister would be justified in having the position reconsidered in order to ensure that the workers <Col N="1040" /> would be kept in employment.  That should be the aim of every good Irishman and Irishwoman.</P>

      <P>Arising out of Senator Kissane's remarks, I should like to ask the Minister if he permits, pending the full production of the firms to which the Minister has referred, these firms to import, under licence, these articles on which duty is being imposed?  I understand that in some cases before a factory is in a position to go into full production, the Department of Industry and Commerce give licences to that firm to import and if that state of affairs continues for too long a period, it may be possible that the consumer may be suffering.  For instance, I understand in connection with the manufacture of yarns, that a considerable time elapsed before the firms were in a position to produce the various types of yarn and in the meantime these firms were allowed to import substantial quantities.  That may be of assistance to them in order to produce economically, but there may be times when undue preference is given in cases such as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Order, Senators will have noticed, does not deal with yarns as such, but they may take it that so far as the Department is concerned licences are not as a rule given to the manufacturer.  A person cannot, except in very unusual circumstances, be given a permit to import a commodity he is himself manufacturing. The abuses which would flow from such a practice are obvious.  Licences are given to the trade where we are satisfied that the home manufacturer is not producing.  It is only when a case for granting a licence has been <Col N="1041" /> established by reference to what the home industry is producing that consideration is given to the question of issuing a licence to the customer who wants something other than that produced by the Irish firm.</P>
      <P>The House will have noticed that five of these Orders are Revocation Orders.  The Orders are being made only after consultation with the industries and firms concerned indicated that they no longer desire the continuance of the duties.  I think I have given Senator Kissane all the information that I have available, except in the case of saws.  In that instance, I have indicated the reasons for the firm desiring to have its protection increased, mainly to enable it to compete on the home market with outside firms which are well organised in this market, have considerable capital resources and have a long connection with the market.  As a result of additional protection afforded it here, it is anticipated that the firm will give employment to an additional 20 workers and when they secure a greater portion of the market, it is quite possible that the cost of the Irish made saws will be reduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he is aware that there is a practice among certain manufacturers to refuse to admit in writing that they are unable to make certain articles required by traders for their customers.  It may be something of importance which is required by customers and traders and the manufacturer, although he cannot make it, and groups of manufacturers, while admitting they cannot make it, will not give the necessary letter in writing admitting that they are unable to do so.  I know that the retail trade is very anxious that that should be known.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>In cases where it is proved necessary to impose duties of this type, would it not be practicable to insist that the actual duty payable, as distinct from the retail price, should be made known to the public?  It is the practice elsewhere and it should at least be tried in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator is under a misapprehension in that respect.  Many of these firms which operate under the protection of a 50 per cent. duty in fact sell their goods at the same price as the British goods can be sold at here, and in some cases slightly more.  The fact that there is a 50 per cent. duty is to keep the foreign articles out.  In respect of all these goods on which tariffs are imposed from time to time the Department of Industry and Commerce takes care to check the price situation and to keep the profits in every tariffed industry under consideration. If there is any evidence that a firm is making money unduly, that it is engaged in excessive profit taking, the firm is told: &ldquo;You are being protected on the Irish market and you will have to pull down your prices in return for that protection&rdquo;.  The device which the Senator mentions would not work, therefore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not brought to my personal notice any case of the kind to which Senator McGuire refers. If there is any case with regard to which he has details, I will be glad to have particulars of the matter and I will undertake to have it investigated. I recognise at once that if we grant protection to industries here to make commodities and our traders have to refer to them from time to time to ascertain whether they can supply a particular commodity, there is an obligation on the Irish manufacturer to co-operate with the customer, the trader here, and to clear the question as to whether that article or a suitable substitute can be made by the Irish-owned industry.  If it cannot be made here and there is no suitable <Col N="1043" /> substitute, the Irish manufacturer ought to co-operate with the customer here in clearing the matter.  If there is any case the Senator has in mind and he brings it to my notice, I will personally undertake to have it investigated.</P>

      <P>Section 4 (2) of the Control of Imports Act, 1934, provides that any Quota Order made under the Act and any Order similarly made amending a Quota Order shall cease to have effect on the expiration of six months from the date on which it was made unless it is approved by each House of the Oireachtas by resolution passed before the expiration of the said six months.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1044" /> Control of Imports (Quota No. 13) Order, 1935, as amended prohibits the importation of woollen and worsted and certain types of synthetic cloths except under licence.  There was an exemption in the Order for cloths containing metallic yarn, and importers were taking advantage of the exemption to evade the quota restrictions by importing cloth containing metallic yarn only to an extent necessary to qualify it for exemption. This practice was having an adverse effect on the sale of woollen and worsted cloths by the Irish mills.</P>
    <P>There is a growing fashion trend towards the use of a percentage of metallic yarn, known as &ldquo;Lurex&rdquo;, in cloth, particularly for the ladies' trade and seven Irish mills including Gaeltarra Éireann, recently commenced the manufacture of metallic yarn cloth.  It was accordingly decided to remove the exemption for cloths containing metallic yarn, with the exception of lamé cloth, which is a brocaded fabric of a type not made here.</P>
    <P>The amendment of the Order was effected by Control of Imports (Quota No. 13) (Woven Woollen and Synthetic and Artificial Fabrics) (Amendment) Order, 1956, made by the Government on the 17th July, 1956, which came into effect on the 24th July, 1956.</P>
