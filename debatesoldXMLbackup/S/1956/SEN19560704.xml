      <P>It is proposed to take business as on the Order Paper, except that I think it would be desirable if Motion No. 7, in my name, which concerns the Minister for Education, were taken at 7 o'clock.  I do not think it would involve a long interruption of the business.  It is also desirable that we should make an endeavour to clear off the motions on the Order Paper and, if it is so desired, we could meet to-morrow, if necessary, for that purpose.</P>

      <P>Three recommendations have been received.  Recommendation No. 3, in the name of Senator Miss Davidson, is ruled out of order as it proposes what is, in effect, <Col N="372" /> an increase in taxation.  The Senator has been communicated with to that effect.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Seanad should strongly recommend to the Government the need for drastic reform of the whole code of income-tax. It may be suggested that that is something which should have been done long ago.  However, it will be agreed that the position to-day in regard to the development of production is much more serious than it was at any time, for the simple reason that, unless we can get a very great spurt in production during the next few years, and, in fact within the next year, the economic position of the country will be very, very serious.</P>
      <P>It is true that the Minister has decided to have this whole matter investigated, but the reference of a matter of this kind to a commission of investigation involves, very often, a slow process and very often does not give any result.  In many cases, the decision is reached long after it could serve any useful purpose.</P>
      <P>I am not prepared to support the view expressed by some people that income-tax should be completely abolished, but I do think that very drastic changes can and should be made in the code.  In the first place, Irish productive industries should be given special consideration.  It is not very practical to say to people who have money to invest that they should invest it in productive industry here, if, when they proceed so to invest it, either of two things may happen.  They may lose their money, as often happens, in which case nobody will bother about them, or, if they make a profit, the income-tax people begin to bother them very quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Business people who have money to invest and who, as good citizens, are genuinely worried about the condition of the country and, as good neighbours, worried about the need to provide employment in their own town or village, are in many cases anxious to invest money in some productive industry, <Col N="373" /> but are frightened off by the threat that, immediately the project shows a profit, they will be hounded down by the forces of the Revenue Commissioners.  It should be possible to make some far-reaching concession to such enterprise.  A very big concession has been made to those engaged in mineral exploration.  That, if you like, is a bold step in its own way.  Equally, people who are prepared to develop in any direction the latent resources of the country should be considered.</P>
    <P>We have then the position of the salary and wage-earning classes.  In many cases, their incomes are known to everybody, including the revenue authorities, and, if they have a taxable income, they have no escape whatever. Those people in many cases feel aggrieved when they compare their position with people who are on a scale which is in many cases difficult for the revenue people to follow.</P>
    <P>There are many people engaged in business transactions which are never recorded and their incomes can never be very fully or accurately assessed. People with fixed incomes feel a grievance when they compare their position with other people who they know, from their own personal knowledge, have larger incomes than they themselves have.  Perhaps the incomes may not be so secure, but undoubtedly, they are larger.</P>
    <P>I have often felt that some consideration should be given, at least in this respect, to people with fixed incomes and, of course, a suggestion of the kind I suggest would include every other section of the community: that every £ invested in savings certificates or in State institutions each year should be deducted from their income.  That is to say, if a person had an income of which £50 was taxable and if he decided to invest £50 it would be deducted right away from his income and left out of consideration altogether.</P>
    <P>It would be easy to see how substantial a concession of that kind would be and how far-reaching its effect would be in encouraging people to save.  You do not promote savings by merely appealing to people to save, <Col N="374" /> but you do encourage people to save if you offer some very specific and definite inducement.  I think that would be a clear-cut and definite inducement to persons who wish to invest their money in national securities.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of ill-informed opinion as far as income-tax is concerned in regard to farmers.  A lot of ill-informed people, in the City of Dublin in particular, are under the impression that farmers pay no income-tax, or that the amount on which they are assessed is entirely inadequate. These people are completely unaware of the fact that the system of rateable valuation in this country hits the farmer in a way that it does not hit other sections of the community, inasmuch as the rateable valuation of land is much higher, in proportion to land income earning capacity, than is the rateable valuation of other property.</P>
    <P>Thus, a farmer with £100 valuation would have a much lower net income than a person with £100 valuation in any other vocation.  I compliment the Minister for taking up the cudgels on behalf of the farmers in this matter.  I also congratulate his predecessor, Deputy MacEntee, who also defended the farmers' position.  Governments in their wisdom have found out that it would not be equitable to impose income-tax on agricultural land on exactly the same basis as on other property.  They have made this decision mainly, I think, for the reason that the rateable valuation of agricultural land is excessive, having regard to its income producing capacity.</P>
    <P>We hear a good deal about the abatements and concessions made to farmers.  Of course, the abatement only affects valuations under £20.  The abatement in regard to employment can be secured only by incurring very substantial expense.  For example, a farmer will secure an abatement of £17 if he incurs the expense of £250, £260, or £270 in the employment of a worker.  Thus, it will be seen that any large farmer who would come into the income-tax paying class has got to make a very hefty contribution to the public purse by way of rates.</P>
    <P>If he has £100 poor law valuation which is not covered by an employment <Col N="375" /> or primary allowance, the direct tax on that £100 valuation would be at least £158, or it might be, according to the county in which he resided, as high as £200.  That is a hefty and substantial contribution.  It is as much as one could expect from a man in that position.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this question which should be considered when the Minister is considering alternatives to income-tax.  Is it not better to do in regard to city ground sites what is being done in regard to agricultural land?  The farmer is subjected to a heavy direct tax in the form of rates.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am trying to point out is that, just as the farmer gets an abatement for employment on that heavy assessment, in the same way a fairly heavy assessment could be placed on a city site and that tax should be levied regardless of whether the site was developed or not.  I am suggesting that as an alternative to, or as an improvement on, the income-tax code.</P>
      <P>I know this was advocated many years ago as a tax on land valuation and site valuation.  I think it was considered by many legislative assemblies. How far action was taken, I do not know, but certainly if a person owns a valuable site in the city, that site should be subjected to a fairly substantial direct tax regardless of whether he uses it or not.  If he uses it for building purposes, he will be liable at the present time to a high rate.  His valuation will go up immediately.  If he does not use it, the rateable valuation does not rise to the same extent, but I suggest that he should be liable to pay at least some direct tax upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody will agree&mdash;it is now coming to be accepted more widely <Col N="376" /> than it was in the past&mdash;that income-tax is what might be described as a disincentive tax.  It is something that tends to discourage productive effort rather than encourage it.  Taxes should be, in the main, incentive in their action.  Thus, if you tax a building site which is being left unused, you are more or less creating an incentive to use it, whereas if you increase the tax on a man who enlarges or extends his property or enlarges his income, you are more or less acting in a way that will deter him from being progressive and endeavouring to increase his income.  I think it is generally recognised that the man who sets out in a productive way to increase his income is indirectly increasing the income of the State, and the Minister should not take the easy way with regard to this matter, the easy way being to put the whole question into the hands of a commission and then sit down and wait for four, five, six or seven years for its report.  I think he should take some action immediately as an earnest of his goodwill and determination to encourage productive effort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that, through illness, I was unable to speak on the Second Stage of this Bill last week. I should like to take the opportunity, in speaking on this section, briefly to congratulate the Minister on his announcement that there will be a review of the income-tax code.  I think it is a matter of far greater urgency than some Senators, judging by the reports of the debates on the subject last week, appear to realise.  The position of the salaried workers in Ireland at present, those on fixed incomes, is really desperate.  One victim of the gods in Greek mythology was symbolised by a man chained to a rock with a vulture perpetually gnawing on his liver.  I think that figure might stand as a symbol of the fixed-income worker who has no opportunity of evasion and who is on the whole bearing a far greater proportion of income-tax than his fellows.  I suggest that the matter should be speeded up as far as possible.  It took us two and three-quarter years to obtain the report on industrial taxation, and if it takes us as long to get a report on <Col N="377" /> income-tax, quite a number of our salaried workers will have emigrated.</P>
      <P>Those of us who represent graduates of the two universities are particularly conscious of this problem, because the teacher, the civil servant, the engineer, the man on the fixed salary is very often a graduate, and the sense of grievance of such people has, as I think any Government will admit, repercussions far out of proportion to their numbers, so that it behoves any Government who want to remain in power to pay attention to any special grievance of this group.  They are very hard put to it to make ends meet and a speedy revision of the income-tax code is the only thing to meet the situation.</P>
      <P>When I was speaking before on university education, I think I placed the Minister under a misapprehension.  I was talking about the small proportion of Government expenditure that was allocated to university education.  Unfortunately, I omitted the operative word &ldquo;university&rdquo;.  Subsequently when reading the Official Report, I realised my mistake.  I did not think it fair to correct the unrevised report, as the Minister had replied to a speech I made, but which I had not intended to make, on account of the omission of that word.  I would point out that not only are university graduates penalised to a large extent in not being given sufficient funds for training&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What is the Senator at now?  Is this under income-tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerMcHugh" hpid="Dr. McHugh Dr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Many graduates are on fixed salaries and, in addition to being hampered in their training, are also hampered when employed by belonging to a not large but respectable group which is required to bear a disproportionate amount of income-tax. I would say also that horror has been expressed by several Senators and Deputies as to the prospect of applying income-tax to farmers. The horror is very often in direct proportion to the number of farmers in the constituencies of the speakers, but I suggest that that horror does not affect quite a number of us.  If a farmer can produce a roll of notes after selling <Col N="378" /> ten or 12 beasts at a fair, as I have seen, and boast that no income-tax inspector was going to set eyes on that money, something must be wrong, and if there is not, the setting up of a body to investigate such matters might reveal to the general public that there is nothing wrong.  Those on fixed incomes at present do think there is something wrong.  I would urge the Minister to begin now and not to rely on unskilled labour, but to employ as many wholetime experts as possible.  I again congratulate him for having announced that he is prepared, unlike some of his predecessors, to revise the income-tax code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a word in support of what Senator McHugh has said and to add another class of taxpayer which I think deserves very careful consideration by the Minister, and by those who examine the income-tax code.  I refer to the pensioners.  Their plight is particularly unhappy now that, as Senator Fearon told us vividly last week, the pound is crumbling away at the rate of one penny every month. These pensioners are rarely getting any increase in their pensions; yet, they have to pay income-tax at a very high rate.  I would appeal to the Minister and those who may be advising him in the matter, to consider giving special concessions to pensioners, especially those who are pensioners from service with the State.  Those who served the State since 1922 and went on pension in recent years are in a very unhappy position.  I hope that their position may be eased by some kind of income-tax concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the statement made by Senator McHugh with regard to income-tax on farmers. He spoke about a roll of notes at a fair.  If the farmer gets that roll of notes, as Senator Hickey knows, he knows to what purpose every one of those notes must be put, for the farmer is one person who has to budget.  The last person to send on to a farm is the townsman, because when townsmen were put on the land, they were not able to budget and when they got a roll of notes, they &ldquo;blew&rdquo; it.  That is <Col N="379" /> why they were not a success on the land.</P>
      <P>I am living in a town and I rely on the votes of townspeople as a member of the public body, but I think we will have to be realistic about agriculture. The trouble is that there is too much taxation on agriculture in this country, and it is not income-tax, but rates.  As I said here the other day, in one part of Tipperary, I know farmers are paying £3 an acre in rates.  I wonder what bullock made £10 this year, but if it did, £3 was taken off in rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I could usefully add much in this discussion to what I have already said in the Dáil.  We are all inclined to look at any tax as being an unjust and unfair imposition when it hits us, and, when we speak about the necessity for revising that tax, we usually mean trying to ensure that somebody else does the paying.</P>
      <P>I could not at all accept that the situation in regard to income-tax is anything like as simple as Senator Cogan implies.  Income-tax in its existing form is an extremely complicated code and the danger is that the more one would try to simplify the code, the more inequitable it might become.  It is a nice thing to try to balance the equity of the impositions, on the one hand, and the simplification of the code, on the other.  I think that is clearly a task that would require the careful and detailed consideration that a commission would be able to give, rather than that we should endeavour, as we would if we followed the Senator's suggestion, to deal with what is a highly complicated subject on a hit-or-miss basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made my point of view quite clear in relation to farmers and central taxation, as well as local taxation, in the other House.  I do not think I could add anything here to the view I expressed then.  However, in reply to Senator Stanford, I would say that, in the Finance Act of 1951, there is a provision by virtue of which special cognisance is taken of the position of pensioners over 65 years of age with limited means.  The provision was <Col N="380" /> introduced in that year to meet, perhaps, part of the point of view advocated by the Senator.</P>
    <P>The House, I am sure, is also aware that, in relation to the type of building lots to which Senator Cogan referred, there is a provision on the Statute Book by virtue of which, in certain circumstances, building rents are created out of such vacant lots. Income-tax and surtax, if they also be payable, are charged not merely on the rents issuing but on the capitalised value of those rents.  Perhaps the Senator was not fully aware of that when he was speaking.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to deal generally with the whole subject of income-tax on this stage.  I propose just to refer to two points which I think arise on this section.  The first is in relation to life insurance premiums. The present Budget is supposed to be a savings Budget and is supposed to encourage people to save.  On the Second Reading, we discussed the various incentives to saving contained in the Budget.  One form is to encourage people to take out life insurance policies.  Therefore, from the point of view of encouraging saving, I think life insurance policies should, as far as possible, be exempt from tax.  In England, the exemption of such policies from taxation has gone much further than here.  There is a concession in this country but, merely from the point of view of encouraging saving, I suggest that the income-tax concession on insurance premiums might be extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of the matter is that self-employed men nowadays, such as people in the professions and people without pensionable positions, find it difficult to make provision for their old age.  It is only fair that such people should be encouraged in every way to insure by way of endowment policies on which they could purchase annuities at 65 or whatever age they decide <Col N="381" /> they can no longer continue to work. We are rather behind other countries in the encouragement we give in the income-tax code to this type of saving. I would ask the Minister&mdash;apart from the commission because I think it is something which could be dealt with separately on its own merits&mdash;to consider the possibility of giving further concessions in regard to life insurance and endowment policy premiums in the income-tax code.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the same problem&mdash;I know it is a very old question and I know the answer I shall receive, but, at the same time, there is nothing like repeating your application&mdash;is the taxation of annuities.  A great many people consider it very unfair that, when a person purchases and annuity for his old age, the whole of it is subject to income-tax.  There are certain concessions, but, generally speaking, it is correct to say that an annuity is subject to income-tax like any other income.  In these annuities&mdash;it is the reverse of what I was talking about before&mdash;the insured is trying to acquire a capital sum at a critical period of life when, for instance, as a self-employed man, he is not able to earn any more.  I suggest the acquisition of that capital sum should be facilitated by remissions of income-tax.  An annuity, in the opposite way, is a capital sum which is turned into income for old age.  I suggest there might be some facilities to people so as to have the maximum income during their declining years and declining earning capacity and, I am sorry to say, seemingly declining money values.</P>
    <P>This is an old subject of debate.  I think I know the answer I will receive. I shall probably be told that it can be brought before the commission but, in spite of that, I will weary the Minister and the House by repeating this demand for further concessions on insurance premiums and annuities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator O'Brien in his plea for more consideration for those who take out insurance policies, so far as relief from income-tax is concerned.  It is a useful form of saving for the insured person's family, that is, if the money <Col N="382" /> would be kept in the country as far as possible.  However, there is one aspect of the matter which I should like to ask the Minister to consider.  As Senators are aware, some few years ago a former Minister for Finance introduced a differential system on behalf of Irish assurance companies.  The idea behind that step was to provide an incentive to people here to insure their lives with wholly Irish-owned insurance companies.  I do not know whether the differential which was introduced at that time proved to be a sufficient incentive to people to support Irish insurance companies.  If my memory serves me correctly, I think the amount of the differential was something like 1/6&mdash;the difference between 3/6 and 5/-.  I may be wrong in that and I shall have to look it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>1/3, I think&mdash;half rate as against two-third rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the reduced value of money, I am inclined to think that that differential is entirely inadequate for the purpose of making sure that insurance companies in this country will be supported by the general public.</P>
      <P>I listened with a great deal of sympathy to Senator Crowley some few weeks ago when he spoke on the question of insurance.  He referred to the amount of money leaving this country and being taken across the water because a good many people do not insure with Irish-owned insurance companies. This is a matter that requires very careful investigation.  I do not propose to enlarge on the subject at this stage, because there may be several difficulties connected with the matter of which we are not aware at present.  Generally speaking, I think it is only right and proper that whatever inducement is necessary will be given to encourage people to take out insurance policies with Irish insurance companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Brien referred to a comparison between the reliefs given here and those given across the water in respect of insurance premiums.  Broadly speaking, the relief here, on policies now taken out, is in <Col N="383" /> respect of foreign life assurance policies, half of the full taxable rate and, in respect of Irish companies, two-thirds of the full taxable rate. These are substantial reliefs and I think would probably be found to involve something of the order of £650,000 if an exact computation of all the aspects concerned were to be made.</P>
      <P>The Senator stresses very properly the value of life assurance as an element in saving and it is an element we must remember whenever we are considering what is proper and what is good to be done in this respect. While I have sympathy from one point of view with regard to his suggestion about annuities, I must also perhaps make the point fairly to him that, whereas life assurance is an element of saving, annuities are an element of dissaving.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 14, after &ldquo;banks,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or with any company in which the individual is employed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In this section, it is proposed to give to persons investing in savings banks and commercial banks relief to the extent of £25 on the interest on money invested.  The reason I put down this amendment is that I believe we ought to encourage people to invest money in the industries in which they are employed.  I know that it is extremely difficult to get additional working capital in small industries in the country.  If we are to encourage the employees in these industries to start savings groups, we ought to allow them relief on the first £25 of the interest paid.  I think that would be very desirable. There is a great social benefit in having people invest their money in the industries in which they are employed and it would, further, be a great national benefit because it would help struggling industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe a number of small companies are being called on at the <Col N="384" /> moment to reduce their overdrafts. The banks do not lend money in a long term way and these companies must try to find it otherwise to finance their work.  I could see no better way than to get the co-operation of these workers in industry by encouraging them to invest their money where it will give the most benefit.  They could be made to feel that it would be much more beneficial to invest in the industry rather than put it into Post Office savings.  They know that the money put into the Post Office savings can be taken out and put to the building of houses in Donegal or somewhere else. It would seem to be much better to give employment in the places where the money is earned.</P>
    <P>I feel that if there is an argument for giving this remission in the case of investments in Post Office Savings Banks or commercial banks, there is a much more compelling argument for giving it in cases of investment in the industries where the people themselves are employed.  I hope the Minister will, even at a later stage, give consideration to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Burke that it is desirable from every point of view that those employed in an industry should be encouraged to invest in that industry, but I think the method he has suggested is the wrong way of doing it.  I think the best system of investment is in the equity shares of the business.  In this Bill, we are providing inducements in that respect by giving a 20 per cent. remission of income-tax which will arise in respect of certified investments of that type.  I think the method which has been suggested by Senator Burke in the amendment would be nearly impossible to administer and temporary loan capital is not the type of capital that is required by those it is proposed to assist.  It would be highly desirable that employees in an industry should take their share in so far as they are able in the expansion of that industry, with the further employment that it would give, and in making more secure their own employment by some type of shares in the industry being made available to them.  That, I think, is the way it should be done rather than <Col N="385" /> the method suggested by Senator Burke.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain difficulties would arise in that regard here.  There are a number of small private companies in this country that might not wish to have additions of equity capital.  Employees, on the other hand, who might invest in their own industries might wish to take that money out at a time of emergency, or for other purposes, as they can do when they invest it in Post Office savings.  In that case the money would be given to the employers in the nature of a loan at the standard bank rates of interest and these people would then be in a position to take out the money when they wished to do so.  That is why I asked the Minister to consider this point.</P>
      <P>We have a large number of small industries in this country and we have an entirely different industrial situation here from that in Britain.  There is a limited amount of dealings on the stock exchange in this country.  There is not a big amount of buying and selling of stocks and in these circumstances, I think we will have to encourage not alone the commercial community but the industrial community in some way to patronise investments in those industries suited to the type of economy we have in this country.</P>

      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5)  The rate of income-tax payable by a building society in respect of the dividends and interest paid to its shareholders and depositors shall not exceed 50 per cent. of the standard rate of income-tax.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have.  On account of family illness, Senator O'Connell is not able to attend.  As explained on Second Reading, by Senator O'Connell, the interest paid by a building society to its depositors is paid free of income-tax but by an arrangement which seems to have operated since the establishment of these societies in Britain, the building society pays income-tax in one lump sum to the Revenue Commissioners, at a rate which is fixed, with or without agreement with the society and which is less than the standard rate&mdash;this rate has come to be known as the &ldquo;composite rate&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as can be learned this &ldquo;composite rate&rdquo; is computed in the following way: the society supplies to the Revenue Commissioners a list of its shareholders&mdash;their names, addresses and the amount of the shares and/or deposits held by them and the commissioners, then, through their inspectors, make an investigation into the taxable capacity of each of these investors and place them in the following categories: those who are not <Col N="387" /> liable for any tax; those liable at the reduced rates (3/- or 6/- as the case may be); and those liable for the full standard rate.  An average is then struck and this constitutes the composite rate.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the greater the number of investors who are not liable to tax or to the reduced rates, the lower will be the average or composite rate payable.</P>
    <P>The building societies here complain that this rate is inflated by reckoning all those people in Britain who invest in the Irish societies as if they were liable for the full standard rate here, whereas because of the double income-tax agreement between Britain and this country, the Revenue Commissioners are not entitled to demand any tax from residents in Britain who invest money in this country.  These people should then be included among those who are non-liable for tax, thus obtaining a lower and more accurate &ldquo;composite rate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For a long period&mdash;20 years or more &mdash;the composite rate has been fixed at two-fifths or 40 per cent. of the standard rate.  This rate, it is understood, was originally fixed by agreement between the British societies and the British Revenue authorities and applied to the societies here when the change of Government took place.</P>
    <P>This two-fifths rate was in operation up to five years ago when the commissioners here, without consultation with the societies, doubled the rate and since then have demanded from the societies a rate of 80 per cent. of the standard rate, in other words, on every £1 which the societies issue by way of interest to their investors, whether these investors are resident here or in Great Britain, or the Six Counties, the society must pay 6/- to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, this is a very heavy burden.  It prevents the society from building up reserves by way of liquid assets which are necessary to meet its liabilities to its shareholders and hampers considerably the activities and operations of the society.  The real sufferers are the people who are <Col N="388" /> anxious to obtain assistance to build or purchase their houses.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note how the British societies have been and are being treated by their Government. At present, the standard rate of income-tax in Britain is 8/6.  The composite rate demanded by the Revenue Commissioners there is 4/10 or 57 per cent. of the standard rate.  Though our standard rate is 1/- less than the British, the composite rate here is 1/2 more than it is in Britain.  It is because of the considerate and sympathetic treatment given to the societies in Britain that they have been enabled to build up such huge reserves.  If the rate here were 57 per cent. of the standard rate, as it is in Britain, the composite rate would be 4/3 instead of 6/-.</P>
    <P>If allowances were made for the lower average income level here, and the fact that the tax allowances form a higher proportion of the taxpayers' income than in Britain, a more appropriate rate would be 50 per cent. or 3/9, and that is what is asked for in this recommendation.</P>
    <P>Some people consider that these societies must be making huge profits because they charge 6 or 6½ per cent. on loans, or 7 per cent. as has recently been announced.  But it must be remembered that they pay their investors 3¾ per cent. free of tax.  This compares very favourably with the rates payable by the banks, or even by the Post Office Savings Bank.</P>
    <P>The two largest societies in this country have recently issued a statement showing how each £1 earned by them during the year 1955 was expended.</P>

      <Col N="389" /> A profit of 4d. in the £ cannot be considered exorbitant or even sufficient for the proper and efficient working of the society.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, a request that the rate of tax payable on the interest issued to investors should be 50 per cent. instead of the present 80 per cent. is not unreasonable.</P>
    <P>It is understood that the four-fifths rate fixed five years ago is now due for revision and the societies hope that the new rate will be fixed after consultation between their accountants and auditors and the Revenue Commissioners as is done in Britain, and that an opportunity would be given them to see how these calculations are made and to put forward such representations as they consider necessary.  They do not object to paying what is just and reasonable having regard to the nature of the work on which they are engaged, but they do object to being asked to pay a rate which they consider unfair and, because of its method of computation, one that is artificially inflated because of the inclusion of factors which should not be so included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the members of the House are, as I am, sorry that Senator O'Connell is prevented through illness from being here to-day, because it was quite clear from what he said on the Second Reading of the Bill that he had an interest in this matter.  Senator Miss Davidson has given the basis of how the composite rate of tax was calculated.  Broadly, that may be correct, but I think there are certain other aspects of the matter of which the House should be aware.  First of all, if one is going to consider the position of building societies here and building societies across the water, we must remember initially that building societies here are completely exempt from corporation profits tax that building societies across the water have to pay, maybe not the full rate of profits tax, but a rate of profits tax.  Secondly, I think we must remember that the type of person who has money in the building society here and in the building society across the water is slightly <Col N="390" /> different.  It is because of that, perhaps, there is a difference in the arrangement to which the Senator referred.</P>
      <P>The exact basis of law in respect of building societies, as in respect of companies, is that the societies would pay on their dividends, less income-tax and that it would then be left to the individual shareholder to claim a refund, if he was not liable to income-tax on the dividend at the full rate or at a reduced rate.  It is in an effort to ease administration, both from a revenue point of view and more particularly from the building society point of view, that the composite method was evolved.  I do not think there is any doubt whatever that the building societies are very anxious not to go back to the strict method that operates for companies and that would operate for them, if the composite method had not been introduced.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, I am afraid the Senator is wrong when she suggests that the rate was fixed by the British Government. The rate was fixed by us in the year 1935 and was varied in 1951, after consultation, I am told, with the building societies.  In fact, I think it must have been after consultation with the building societies, because it was after the building societies in question had furnished to the revenue authorities a list of those who were receiving interest in the same way as the Senator herself indicated that the rate was fixed.</P>
      <P>What happens, as Senator Miss Davidson suggested, is that the building societies furnish a list showing the shareholders to whom interest is paid.  Out of those shareholders are taken those people who have more than £5,000 on deposit with the society concerned and also companies, because obviously they would be in any event liable to income-tax at the full rate and the society's rate is calculated then on the remaining holders according to the rates of tax to which they are liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no special law in respect of taxation of building societies' interest or dividends, or in respect of building societies' profits themselves.  There is <Col N="391" /> only the general law and this composite arrangement is only entered into as a means of facilitating building societies and the revenue.  The fact is that I understand the building societies are particularly anxious that the composite method should be continued.</P>
    <P>There is perhaps a little difficulty in the line the Senator suggested in respect of people living abroad, but the difficulty there is that the double taxation agreement of 1926 and 1928 lays down certain very strict and specific methods by which the tax arrangements are to be administratively worked out.  I think part of the difficulty arises perhaps because the persons to whom the Senator made reference do not and could not deal with the matter on the basis of the requisite certificates from the appropriate inspector of taxes on the other side.</P>
    <P>The existing arrangement is being carried on for the current year because it may take some considerable time to investigate the results of the returns that are being made available now, but I should like to make it clear that there is no new legislation adversely affecting building societies in any shape or form.  It is a purely periodic fact-finding review and whatever facts emerge from that review, the composite arrangement will be carried on on that basis in the future.</P>
    <P>If it transpires in the fact-finding review that the composite method should not be four-fifths but three-fifths, no change in the law arises and that would be the figure.  One thing we must remember is that the basis of subscription to building societies here is rather different from what it was in the past.  By advertising comparatively high rates free of income-tax, building societies attracted larger subscriptions and larger holdings, and the building societies now are not composed solely, or even mainly, of the type of person of which they were composed some years ago who subscribed a minimum amount for the purpose of being shareholders in the real co-operative sense of the term.  It is largely because of that change in character in the past 20 years or so that the fact-finding inquiry was undertaken and resulted <Col N="392" /> in a new basis for the composite arrangement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I find this section very difficult to interpret.  I cannot find out exactly what it means.  As I understand the section, its effect is that a married couple will only be entitled to a tax rebate on the first £25.  While they were single, each was entitled to a tax-free rebate of £25, making a total of £50.  It seems difficult to understand why they should be penalised when they get married.  Further, if instead of having deposited the amount, they had held securities which come under Section 7, the rebate they receive, either before or after marriage, is the same. If they had been employed before marriage and if they continued in employment after marriage, they would both be entitled to earned income relief, although, in the case of the wife, the earned income relief would be smaller. Personally, I think it would be only fair to increase the £25 to £50, in the case of married couples.  Perhaps, this is a matter that could be dealt with on the Report Stage; if the Minister decides to accede to my request, I do not think that the cost to the Exchequer would be very great and it would certainly encourage savings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty here is the difficulty of preventing what one might term a fake.  If it was to be dealt with on the lines the Senator suggests, then it would mean that a married man who had, shall we say, £50 interest received from the sources in question, he would only have to transfer half of it into his wife's name and then it would be automatically free. What I am trying to do in the section is to provide new and additional incentives to save.  A mere switch or transfer of that sort would not be any addition to the national savings pool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are undoubtedly difficulties in the way that the Senator suggests, but the administrative inconvenience there would be to taxpayers as a whole in having to have separate assessments for husband's and wife's income and <Col N="393" /> having to go back to ascertain the source of the investment of each, would, I think, outweigh the advantages of the case to which the Senator refers.  It is a question of balance&mdash;I quite freely admit that&mdash;but I think on the whole the balance is fairly strongly in favour of the method I have suggested in the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I took it that sub-section (2) referred to where the two spouses have separate incomes.  The words in sub-section (1) are &ldquo;an individual&rdquo; and is it not quite sure that both the husband and the wife would not be treated as an individual under sub-section (1).  Sub-section (2) seems to me to deal with a separate position, but sub-section (1) has the rather unusual word &ldquo;individual&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think sub-section (2) does deal with the question of the separate return, but I took it that Senator Guiness was anxious to refer to a broader aspect than that.  If the position is that when a husband or wife makes separate returns, they have a larger total than the £25, then the obvious thing would be that we would be flooded with these cases of separate returns.  I think the situation, as I understand these two sections, is this: if a person puts in a return on the basis of which he has an income from the source in question of £25 or less, then that £25 is free of tax.  If it is more than £25, he is free of tax up to £25. If that individual is married and he returns, as certain people have to do, his wife's income in addition, then it means, if the total of the two is more than £25, they get between them the concession in respect of interest up to £25 per annum.  If, however, they are in a position that they are unable jointly to make arrangements for the payment of their tax and wish to have their tax individually assessed, so that they will pay it separately, then they can divide the £25 between them in the proportions of their income.  This division is contemplated in cases where people are not making the normal joint married return.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the importance that is attached at the <Col N="394" /> moment to encouraging our people to save, and that must be attached to it in the future, I consider that the concession which the Minister is making in this section a very small contribution indeed.  We have had from the Minister's statement the facts of the review of last year, which he referred to on Second Reading when he pointed out that during the past year there was a reduction of not less than £21,000,000 in our total savings.  Side by side with that, there was a drop in the bank deposits of something over £13,000,000. This is a very serious position and the Minister has pointed out, both here and elsewhere, that if we are to continue with our capital development, if we are to find the moneys to provide employment for our people and develop this country, there is no source open to us except savings.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that last year we had a drop of £21,000,000, does the Minister presume to assure the House that, by this small concession to persons who are investing their money in the Post Office or in the banks we are going to over-balance the £21,000,000 and arrive at the position which we can continue with our capital development programme?  Our very first act here this evening was to give authority to the Revenue Commissioners, for the next 12 months, to collect in income-tax 7/6 in the £1 on income, after making a very small allowance to the earners of these incomes. Having regard to the fact that there was a drop in our savings last year and that on top of last year's position we are now extracting from the people an additional £13,000,000 in taxation&mdash;£7,000,000 odd as the result of the special levies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would suggest to the Minister, that being the picture, that some more active steps must be taken, if we are to encourage our people to save, and I think the <Col N="395" /> first step must be that the Government itself should give a lead by cutting down that expenditure which we were promised would be cut down many years ago.</P>

      <P>This section deals with married men's allowances.  Would the Minister look into a matter which I think is deserving of attention?  Consider the case of a man with children whose wife dies.  Such a man gets a personal allowance for his daughter while she housekeeps for him and as long as the children are under 16 years of age.  However, when the children reach a certain age the personal allowance is cut off for the daughter, although she is still housekeeping for her father.  I regard that as a great injustice.  Would the Minister investigate that position and see that the father will get the personal allowance? I know of many such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very frequently, the girl's chances in life are spoiled.  There might be three children aged 15, 17 and 18 and the girl doing the housekeeping may be just 19 or 20.  She is doing the housekeeping for the family, because the mother has died.  The father gets an allowance for this daughter, who is known as the housekeeper, but the moment the youngest child reaches 16, that personal allowance is cut off.  Will the Minister see if it is possible to continue the personal allowance for <Col N="397" /> that man, until such time as somebody does the housekeeping for him?</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the penalties are imposed on the married man.  If they live in sin, they will get £25 each.  If he gets married again, instead of keeping the daughter at home, he will get an allowance for his wife.  A married man, his wife and a couple of children would pay much more income-tax than three or four single people living in the one house. The Minister for Finance has a very heavy burden to shoulder but, sometime or other, I hope he will look into these anomalies.  As Senator Crosbie has said, all the income-tax is against the married man.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to this matter on Section 2 when he said he thought it was very much more helpful in relation to the amendment I put down to Section 2.  This applies only to public companies.  I agree that it is an improvement, because now it will apply to any further capital subscriptions in the companies that have made application under Section 7 of the Finance Act of 1932.  However, it is of no benefit to the vast majority of companies in this country, and, in my opinion, it will not encourage savings in that respect.  Reading Section 7 <i>in toto</i>, I do not think it covers the <Col N="398" /> point I made at all on Section 2.  It might help big business, but it will not be any help at all to the small businesses which are the generality in this small country.</P>

An issue of shares for purposes such as Senator Cox has mentioned would hardly come within that broad scope.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Seanad is entitled to some satisfactory explanation for the increased taxes on cigarettes and tobacco.  Having regard to the protests made in this House and in Dáil Éireann and throughout the country four years ago when the last increases were introduced, it is almost unbelievable that the present Government <Col N="399" /> should contemplate an increase now.</P>
      <P>I do not know by what process of reasoning this increase of 6d on 20 cigarettes, the increase in pipe tobacco and the other levies included in this head can be justified.  The Minister might say that he needs the money, but every Minister for Finance needs money.  I have never known a Minister for Finance at any time to come into the House without being in need of money.  If it was wrong in 1952 to increase the price of 20 cigarettes to 2/5, as it then was, it is surely an even greater wrong to increase the price to 2/10 to-day.  I think there is a very widespread discontent and dissatisfaction in regard to these increases.  Many people may have been prepared to accept a small increase of 1d on an ounce of tobacco or 2d on 20 cigarettes, but I do not think that anybody anticipated that the increase would have been as steep as it is.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that in some respects tobacco is less essential than food, but in the ordinary budget of the worker's household, there could be very seldom much reduction in the consumption of tobacco.  Anybody with any experience of how the people in the small income group budget for their household will know that the price of cigarettes and tobacco is a considerable item.  There is not usually a reduction in the consumption of these commodities when the prices rise, because, generally speaking, there is not much room for reduction.  What actually happens in many cases is that there is no reduction in the consumption of tobacco in the worker's household, but to meet the extra costs, they will cut down on more essential things such as meat and clothing.  That is a most undesirable thing to have happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be interesting to know whether the Minister in imposing this levy was hoping that consumption would continue at the present rate, or whether he was hoping for a reduction in the consumption of tobacco.  The Minister mentioned in his Budget statement that he was influenced in this matter by the fact that tobacco was an imported commodity.  At the <Col N="400" /> same time, he made a fairly generous provision in his Estimate for what he hoped to collect from this tax.  It seems from that that he certainly does not anticipate that there will be a reduction in the consumption of tobacco.</P>
    <P>I think the increase in the duty on cigarettes and tobacco could be perhaps justified, if it were brought in as a general sales or purchase tax, spread over a wide number of luxury commodities, instead of over a small number as in this case.  I think that, in imposing this tax, the Minister has been unjust, and that his Department, influenced in some way by a certain element of laziness, did not bother to explore other avenues by which the money could be raised and decided to follow the easy method by taking the last penny that could be expected from a duty on tobacco.  I think it would have been comparatively easy for the Minister to have avoided this tax altogether, if he had kept expenditure at the level at which it was when he came into office.  I am not suggesting a reduction of expenditure, but I do suggest that if he had kept it at the level it was at when he came into office, it would have been unnecessary for him to impose this increased levy on a commodity used widely by the workers.  It is the manual worker, the man who works in the fields, who enjoys tobacco most, and much more so than the man who works with a pen or his brain.  It is a tax on the manual worker and for that reason it is a tax that could and should have been avoided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cogan is wrong when he says it was clear that I did not budget for a reduction in the consumption of tobacco.  I did.  I had anticipated that there would be a reduction in consumption and I took that reduction in consumption into account when I was preparing the figures which I mentioned in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose at this stage to go into the whole question of the total expenditure in the Budget.  I do not think it would be in order for me to do so, but I do say that given the bill that we had for this year's Budget, it was <Col N="401" /> only right that tobacco, which is a non-essential, should bear its just share of that burden.</P>

      <P>This section proposes to increase the tax on petrol and other oils used in commercial vehicles and it proposes to place a burden on the industrial and agricultural community of this country of no less than £1,795,000. That is the additional amount which the Government proposes to collect in this levy.  That is almost £2,000,000 which is being taken from industry and from a small number of people in agriculture. We must necessarily ask the question as to where the money is to come from.  It is obvious that it is to come from the pockets of the people concerned.  These taxes are going to make their contribution to further increases in the cost of living and are going further to encourage those people, who find themselves in a position to do so, to demand that justice should be done to them and that the increased cost of living should be mitigated by compensation in wages, so that they will be able to meet the new charges and the additional costs arising from this levy.  By doing this, we are making the way very clear for the sixth round of demands for increased wages and if these demands, or portion of them, are justified, some of those who are in a stronger position than others to enforce them will probably succeed in having them granted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>When these demands are granted, as they probably will be, particularly in the case of the stronger unions who will be in a position to enforce them, they will make a further contribution to an increase in the cost of living, and the spiral will go on and on, until we reach the stage at which, when we come to discuss the Finance Bill next year, we will be dealing with a much more difficult position than the one we are in to-day.  In the last few days, we have had evidence of the state of the transport undertaking.  An additional charge on petrol means an additional burden on industry and commerce which must be passed on to the consumer.</P>
      <P>I maintain that this additional taxation of £1,795,000 represents an additional burden on industry and commerce and agriculture and that it is unwise to impose it at this time.  While the opportunity presents itself to the Minister in this House this evening, he should reconsider the whole approach to this matter, particularly in the light of the position the transport undertaking finds itself in at the moment, in order to avert the development of a much more difficult position.  There is nothing that we on this side of the House can do in relation to this Bill, except to draw the Minister's attention to the difficulties it may create and to make whatever recommendations we can.  That, I think, is the recommendation that we would make, that this additional burden that has been placed on the community, of £1,795,000, should be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hawkins on this occasion has discussed the possibilities of a sixth round of wage increases and I trust that, as he has been allowed to refer to that matter, I, too, will be given the same latitude.  Let me be perfectly frank, as that matter has been mentioned.  No country can carry any standard of living, except the standard of living that it gets from its production, and, so far as we are concerned, we are in exactly the same position in that respect as any other country.  The essential thing at the <Col N="403" /> present time is to ensure that we increase our production in such a way that there will be for everyone in the community a larger cake, so that the standard of living can be improved.  It is entirely fallacious to suggest that by any one section or the other merely attempting to increase the slice which they may obtain at the expense of other sections of the community, the national economic life can be improved as a whole and the standard of living of all our people raised.</P>
      <P>I suspect that Senator Hawkins knows that very well indeed and I suspect that he knows, too, the economic damage that might be done to the country as a whole, if there were repercussions of the type he has indicated here, and I believe that he must have raised these matters in that knowledge, because he is as well aware as I am of the national implications that are involved.  I regret that he should have done it on this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because I appreciate the dangers involved in the imposition of these duties and feel they may give rise to the position that I have forecast here that I have drawn the Minister's attention to it.  It was in order that that position might be averted rather than encouraged that I raised the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that he recognises that this country is in exactly the same position as every other country.  I can only say that it is a pity that he and his colleagues did not realise that sooner.  We on this side of the House realised that all along.  It is the people on the other side of the House who tried to lead the Irish people into a fool's paradise, a fool's paradise from which I hope the people will be able to succeed in escaping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increased taxation which is being levied on industry, agriculture and transport in this section will not be very helpful in promoting the increased production which is absolutely essential if this country is to get out of the slough of despond.  Every branch of the economic life of the nation depends in a large measure on <Col N="404" /> cheap transport.  It is essential that goods should be brought as quickly and as cheaply as possible from the farm to the consumer and from the factory to the consumer.  Anything that raises the cost of transport must inevitably have a detrimental effect on production generally.</P>
    <P>It is admitted, and I think it will be admitted by all Senators, that there is an element of luxury in the consumption of petrol, a certain amount of travelling merely for pleasure, but the greater portion of the petrol used by the public generally is used as part of the economic life of the nation.  It is used in the transport and distribution of goods and in the collection of agricultural produce from the farm.  If this tax involves an increased cost, it will be inevitably passed on to the consumer in the case of industry or, in the case of a farmer, it may be passed back to him.  Usually, the manufacturer is able so to arrange things that the burden of increased cost does not fall back on him, but is passed on to the consumer.  The farmer does not always have the same control and may be called upon to bear part of this impost.</P>
    <P>In addition there is a number of very deserving sections in the community who depend for their livelihood on their cars.  The Minister has not so far indicated that any substantial concession or any concession of any kind will be afforded to these people.  Hackney car owners in the country and taxi owners in the city are a section of the community who are hard hit.  Apart from the increase in taxation they are up against very severe competition. They are up against the fact that the number of cars has increased so much that people are not to the same extent depending on the hackney or taxi driver.  They are also up against a certain amount of what might be described as illegal competition.</P>
    <P>In any case, their task is a difficult one and their living is a precarious one.  I think the Minister will agree that they deserve special consideration. If some direct concessions cannot be made in regard to the price of petrol, I think a concession should be made in some other way, possibly by a readjustment of the road tax on <Col N="405" /> their vehicles.  Certainly, the full impact of this increase in duty should not be passed on to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have considered this matter more carefully before he introduced this very drastic levy.  I know and appreciate that it is an easy tax to collect and there is always a temptation in the Department of Finance to go for money that is easily got.  There ought to be considerations of equity and justice in matters of this kind and there ought also to be consideration for the overall economic position of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there would be some burden to some degree in the way that perhaps Senator Cogan suggested, but let us be clear about this.  That could be discounted to a considerable extent by more rational schemes of distribution.  Apart from that, we must accept that, in our present circumstances, there is a very great deal of non-essential motoring.</P>
      <P>People who have cars naturally like to use them.  That is natural and understandable but, in our present economic circumstances, we must turn for the provision of the revenue that is necessary to carry on the country to less essential types of expenditure. We must all agree, I think, that there is at present a very great deal of non-essential motoring.  In so far as industry is concerned, it might be possible for them to avoid some of the impact by reorganising their methods of distribution. The House will note in particular that heavy diesel oil such as is used in the buses in Dublin was not included for that purpose in the additions.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that there is at the present time in this country a good deal of non-essential motoring.  But I submit, at the same time, that that is no justification for the piling on of taxation on those who acquired their motor vehicles for the carrying on of their own avocations. If there is unnecessary consumption of petrol in this country for pleasure and for unnecessary things, then there is a case to be made for some differentiation between those who use their vehicles for pleasure and <Col N="406" /> those who require their vehicles for business.</P>
      <P>I am surprised then that the Minister would not consider that aspect of the matter.  In emergency days, it was possible to differentiate between the people who required their motor-cars for their business and the people who did not require them for their business and surely the same thing could be done again.</P>

      <P>Let us be frank with ourselves.  The number of cars in the country has increased enormously.  In my own county there are upwards of 1,300 mechanically propelled vehicles in the past year and four months.  Is <Col N="407" /> it not sticking out a mile that that was the place to look for revenue?  We have reached the stage in Ireland where, if one wants to travel a quarter of a mile of the road, one must use a motor-car. It is ridiculous for Senators to try to make political capital out of this matter.  As I said, the number of cars has increased and every street in village and town is lined with them.</P>
      <P>After all, we cannot deny that the two things upon which taxes were imposed were the two things that can bear them.  They are luxuries if you wish.  I will admit that petrol is necessary for a man doing business.  I live 145 miles from Dublin and when I come to Dublin by car, it takes ten gallons to do the journey both ways.  If we are so nationally minded, why does not every member of this House come by train, instead of using his car coming from his residence to Dublin?</P>

      <P>Senator O'Gorman has made a very strong attack, if I may use the word, on himself and his colleagues for the attitude which they took in regard to a lower rate of taxation on petrol and other similar commodities four years ago.  At that time, there was not the mild constructive criticism we are indulging in here to-day, but rather a storm of protest organised amongst every section of the community in so far as it was possible for the members of the then Opposition to organise that protest.  We are, on the other hand, simply pointing out that while the increased burden in 1952 constituted a heavier burden, the added 6d. on top of that now in the present depressed condition of the country is a very much greater burden relatively, and a much more serious thing from the point of view of the welfare of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither Senator O'Gorman nor the Minister has made any attempt to meet the points that have been raised in regard to the deserving sections of the community who depend for their existence upon the use of their cars or vans.  Those sections of the community can be quite easily identified and segregated, and something should be done for them, either by amendment of this section or by some other legislation. Perhaps the easiest way, and the method that would involve the least administrative difficulty, would be to withdraw this section altogether, and leave the rates of taxation at the <Col N="409" /> level at which they were.  There is no doubt whatever that the taxes on petrol were already bringing in an enormous amount of money into the Exchequer. I think it was running at the rate of over £7,000,000 a year.  That is a fairly substantial contribution, but the Minister has gone further and is seeking to extract still more.  While there may be some sections who can bear these charges there are others who cannot, and I think that on the whole the effect of the tax will be detrimental to industry and trade.  One effect which I notice it has had already is that grass is beginning to grow around the petrol pumps containing the top grade petrol.</P>

      <P>I understood the Minister to be sympathetic to increased agricultural production, and I am sure that he realises that this is a considerable tax on agricultural production. If he lived in the country as I do, he would see that almost every farmer now has a car, and, with the car, a trailer to take his stock to the market and to do all his business.  The business heretofore done by horse is now done by motor-car and trailer. This is a considerable tax on agriculture, and the Minister should reconsider <Col N="410" /> it.  He does not, I am sure, want to tax increased agricultural production, and he should give some consideration to ways and means of not taxing agriculture.  Senator O'Gorman was a little bit heated a while ago and said things which I think we did not like on this side of the House, but I am sure he did not mean them.  We will let it go at that.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 11.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 11 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the effects of this section is, as I said on the Second Stage of the Bill, to impose for the first time a tax on fuel used by the railways on their own permanent way. This tax has been imposed on the diesel oil used on the diesel electrics and diesel rail cars which public transport has been encouraged by the State to acquire so as to re-equip itself and avoid using the more expensive coal.  The purpose of this measure, or any section of the Finance Bill, is to collect revenue to meet necessary expenditure.  I have a certain amount of doubt as to whether such a purpose will be achieved by this tax, because it will mean, and can only mean, that, while public transport will have to pay 1d. per gallon in future on diesel oil, the losses will be increased by that extra expenditure and those losses will eventually have to be met by the Minister or somebody after him.  In that way, it seems to me that it is simply putting the money from one pocket to another and is not justifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, maybe the Minister thinks that the extra expenditure should be collected, or could be collected, by increased rates and fares on the railways, by charging the passengers who use the railways more or by charging the merchants and the live-stock traders more for using these services? I hardly think the Minister has that in <Col N="411" /> mind, because I note that he again made the point that he is purposely excluding from any extra taxation under this Budget diesel fuel used by the buses.  The effect of that exemption, it seems to me, is that the heavy diesel consuming road lorries will not have to meet any extra taxation and these are the very vehicles that are tearing up our roads and bringing the maintenance costs of the roads to their present high figure of £213 per mile per annum.  That was the figure in 1954-55 and I am sure that it will be even higher for 1955-56.</P>
    <P>As I remarked on the Second Reading, that expenditure of £213 has to be met to the extent of two-fifths by the ratepayers; in other words, the ratepayers have to pay about £90 a mile per annum for the upkeep of the roads in this part of the country.  I made the point, when we were dealing with the special levy some months ago, that the Minister had excluded from the effects of that levy the lorries being imported, and here again we have special facilities, special recognition for them, while the fuel being used on the railways is, for the first time, being taxed by the Minister for Finance.  I think we should always remember that the roads which these locomotives are using are maintained by the railways themselves, were built by them, and are not partly maintained by the ratepayers.  The railways themselves have, as ratepayers, to meet to some extent the cost of the upkeep of the roads carrying the lorries which are at present practically driving them out of existence.  I think it is fair to say that the Minister in framing his Budget had regard to the necessity for reducing unnecessary imports. He can hardly imagine that, by imposing this extra taxation, less diesel oil will be used on the railways, or that there is room for economy in the use of diesel oil on the railways.</P>
    <P>I wonder does he think now that the programme of conversion from steam to diesel, advocated and backed by the Government by way of backing the loans of C.I.E., should be abandoned and whether C.I.E. should cancel as far as they can, the orders they have <Col N="412" /> for the remaining diesel locos and diesel railcars?  I wonder, on the other hand, does the Minister think that they should now go back to the outdated steam locomotive or whether that is now a Government policy.  That of course is fantastic because the cost of coal imports would be far heavier and more damaging to the economy of the country.</P>
    <P>I would make a very strong appeal to the Minister to look again at the effects of the extra tax on diesel oil and ask him, between this stage and the Report Stage, to consider whether it would not be in the best interests, not alone of public transport but of the whole economy of the country, not to impose this extra taxation.  I have hinted to him that the natural reaction, if he can, by one fell swoop, get £26,000 from the pockets of C.I.E., of the employees of public transport will be to think: &ldquo;Is it as easy as all this to extract this income?  Are we not in as difficult a position as the Minister in trying to get the necessary income? If he can do this, why should we not abandon our thoughts of restraint? Why should we not try to recoup ourselves to some extent?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister in all earnestness to look into the effects of this tax and see if, even at this stage, he can abandon it.  It will not really cost him anything and the ultimate effect of it will be very bad indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of abandoning this proposal would undoubtedly cost the revenue a substantial sum.  Let it be quite clear that the Acts which set up C.I.E. provide that it should so adjust fares that it would operate within its revenue, taken over a period of time.  I do not think this is the time or the place to enter into a general discussion on transport policy.  The Tánaiste indicated the other night in the Dáil that he was giving that matter his attention at present.  It is, of course, primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to bring proposals in that regard to the Government.  We must all appreciate that the facts of the situation are as he outlined them in the Dáil.  Public <Col N="413" /> taste is running in one way while the policy of Governments has been in another direction.</P>
      <P>So far as this section is concerned, this is a tax merely of one penny a gallon&mdash;not a very serious sum per gallon, but in certain instances, where there is the very heavy user, the amount could, and does in certain cases, add up to a very considerable sum; but it is one of the things that is difficult to do administratively, to see where taxation can be placed in the most equitable manner, while at the same time doing the least damage to the community as a whole.</P>
      <P>There are certain users of this oil who can meet the cost involved.  If others find it difficult to meet it, then I have every sympathy with them.  Of course, all legislation, and particularly taxation legislation, must be based on the assumption that the greatest good for the greatest number is what we are all endeavouring to achieve.  I should be very wrong indeed if I held out to Senator Murphy any hope that I could reconsider this section in the light of what he suggested and I should also be very wrong if I allowed the suggestion to go without repudiation that the effect of this is in fact to add to the cost of borrowing.  It is not.  The public transport legislation in that respect and in the manner of meeting revenue and expenditure over a period is clearly laid down.</P>

I think it is correct to say that they import some of the raw materials.  If the raw materials can be obtained in this country, I think they should be used in preference to importing them. Furthermore, I believe the attention of the people who make the matches should be drawn to the fact that if they can produce the raw material within the country they should do so rather than import it.</P>

      <P>This is a tax on table waters.  Here, again, it is necessary to ask if it is really necessary in this State, where there is a very substantial organised movement to promote temperance, to seek by taxation to promote intemperance?  Is it necessary to impose a levy on the member of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, who, spurning the allures of the public-house, contents himself with a modest drink of mineral water? Is the Minister justified in penalising the modest vice of that citizen?  He is already being penalised inasmuch as, avoiding alcoholic excesses, he is, perhaps, able to take his family for a drive in the family car.  He is taxed on his petrol.  Again, avoiding the evils of excessive drinking, he may like to indulge in a cigarette.  He is taxed in that respect.  Now, again, if he feels thirsty&mdash;and even a total abstainer may occasionally feel thirsty &mdash;he finds that his type of drink is also taxed.  In passing, I would say that I might welcome some form of taxation on mineral waters, if it were part of a campaign to encourage the drinking of milk.

      <P>I mentioned on the Second Stage something which seemed to affect this section.  I mentioned then that as the section is drawn it could not be interpreted by anybody except a legal expert.  As I understand it, it seems to me that dances held outside a certain limit&mdash;three miles outside certain centres of population&mdash;are exempt from tax.  The effect of that is that expensive dances which are usually held outside these centres of population, which are not held in towns but which attract a certain clientele and for which there is a charge of anything from one to two guineas, such as hunt balls, will be exempt from the tax.  These dances are usually held in hotels in the country, or, as they are now more commonly called country clubs.  I think it is wrong that these entertainments should be exempt from the taxes.  It is wrong that the proprietors of these country clubs should be placed in a <Col N="417" /> more advantageous position than the dance-hall proprietors in the towns or those within the three mile limit.  It might be desirable or understandable if the dances were cheap dances, but it is neither desirable nor understandable when it comes to expensive dances.  I submit that it is undesirable that these dances should be exempt from tax and I hope the Minister will deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Senator Murphy has stated and what he has pointed out is to a large extent the reason why this dance tax was discontinued some years ago.  It is right and proper, I think, that dances in rural areas should be exempt from taxation, but the question of defining a rural area is somewhat difficult.  I think it has been defined in the Bill as being three miles from areas with certain populations.  The exemption from taxation some years ago led to the establishment of large commercial dance-halls outside the three miles limit prescribed and that, in itself, was an evil.  It was very undesirable that these dance-halls should have been able to compete unfairly with the halls in the towns.</P>
      <P>As we all know, present-day transport even with the increase in petrol tax, makes three miles a very short distance.  I think the whole effect of this tax is vexatious and Senator Murphy is right in stressing that point, but the Minister, I suppose, and the Government to a certain extent, are committed to the tax by reason of the song and dance they made about it when it was withdrawn some years ago.  I do not think the tax will be any real benefit to the National Exchequer, or that it will be easily administered in a fair and equitable way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Murphy's plea for a revision of this duty on dance-halls, or rather an extension of it.  The recommendation which I had tabled and which was ruled out of order was intended to equalise the application of the entertainments duty in so far as it applies to dances.  Senator Murphy has already stated that a large number <Col N="418" /> of dances are held with high admission fees in areas where they would be exempt from the tax, areas which might be described as &ldquo;free areas&rdquo;, to which the tax does not apply.  I think it is only reasonable that the people who can attend these expensive functions should contribute to the revenue of the country.  I would ask the Minister to keep the matter in mind and in future legislation to apply the higher rate of tax where the cost of admission, excluding duty, exceeds 5/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I am very much in sympathy with the point of view expressed by Senators Murphy and Miss Davidson, because I do realise that these expensive dances are held on a large scale outside the territorial limit and the people attending those dances are being put in a much more advantageous position than the poorer people living within the territorial limits described in the Bill.  If there is to be any legislation in connection with this now or in the future, it should be applicable to all sections of the community in the same way.</P>
      <P>I submit that if there is to be any exception or any discrimination, it should be in favour of those people who hold what they call ceilidhes because the people who organise these ceilidhes are promoting the cultural interests of the country. For that reason alone, they should be entitled to some concession in the matter of this entertainment duty.  So many questions have been raised here and elsewhere in connection with this section which purports to reimpose the entertainments duty on dances that I think the Minister should reconsider it and see whether it is worth his while having the section there at all.</P>

      <P>I should just like to enter a word of protest against the idea that there should be some class discrimination made outside the three-mile limit as between, say, those who attend balls, as they are called, that is, big dances, and what are called the ordinary people.  That is a wrong way of looking at things here.  If there are hunt balls, big balls, and big dances, outside the three-mile limit, the <Col N="419" /> people who attend them pay their own tax in their own way.  We have just been talking about the motor tax.  Are not the people going in cars to these big dances paying motor tax?  Is there not a certain amount of wines and spirits&mdash;in fact, quite a large amount &mdash;and minerals as well consumed at these dances, on which they pay a very fine tax?</P>
      <P>There is too much talk about luxury in a broad way.  A lot of things that are called luxuries are employment-giving things.  If you take all the luxuries out of the life of this country, there will be far more people going to England.  At these dances, expensive dresses are worn.  Ladies' hair-styles have to be made up.  At the so-called ordinary man's dance, they walk in as they are and pay whatever little tax they have to pay.  Give credit where it is due.  There should not be any discrimination between rich and poor, especially when the rich are paying in every form their share of taxation in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bergin</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to dance tax&mdash;that is what he said&mdash;between the rich and the poor.  So far as I know, what the section was meant to do was to acquire money for the country, in the first instance, by taxing the dance-halls and the dance-hall proprietors, but it was recognised that it was necessarily a little difficult to keep dance-halls going in rural areas where the population would be largely poorer and scarcer.  For that reason, the Minister made an exception of rural dance-halls, which I think was quite justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator Murphy and Senator Miss Davidson in this point of view, that when the people from the towns have sufficient money to go out <Col N="420" /> into the very pleasant surroundings of the big hotels and hold their hunt balls and dances, they are in a position to contribute more to the revenue of this country which needs it so badly.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire points out and with truth, that such dances do give employment in various ways.  The people who manufacture the dresses do give employment and the people who go there with the very nice hair styles do give employment; but employmentgiving is no justification.  The man who drives recklessly down O'Connell Street gives plenty of employment. The fact that a person gives employment does not justify the things he does.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire points out that people who go to dances drink wines and have a very high time.  If I have not been understanding incorrectly the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the other leaders of the Government, what we need at the moment is a little less luxury spending and a little more spending on production.</P>
    <P>I could not agree with Senator McGuire's point of view.  I do agree with the other point of view.  I think the Minister ought to make it a collectable tax by making these people who are well off and who live in the towns pay just the same tax as the people who are a little less rich and who pay the full dance tax at their local dance-halls.  It is not a difference in taxation between rich and poor.  No matter how rich or how poor the person may be who lives in the town, he will pay the full dance tax when he goes to the dance-hall and the man with a car and a lady friend with an expensive hair style, a man who can buy expensive wines at the dance, ought to pay the full dance tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The origin of the exemption for the rural areas in this dance tax is quite simple.  First of all, it was because we all felt that it was desirable to do what we can to increase the amenities in rural Ireland so as to prevent the drift to the towns and cities.  I think every Party on every side of the House is agreed that it is essential that we should do what we <Col N="421" /> can to stop that drift and to reverse it, if humanly possible.  We can only do something in that way by facilitating the amenities that there are in the rural areas.  That was the first point.</P>
      <P>The second point is that the administration of the dance tax, if we are to go out into the rural areas, becomes much more expensive than it is in the cities and in the towns.  In the cities and towns, it is not an expensive tax to collect.  The cost of administration is not out of the way in relation to the revenue it brings in, no matter what anybody may say to the contrary.</P>
      <P>I do think, however, that I must say this&mdash;I should look with disfavour on any move to try to transfer entertainments from towns or cities just outside what Senator Kissane referred to as the territorial limit.  I always had the intention, when I was introducing this section again, that I would allow the year to run, to see how it was working and, if there was any type of deliberate transfer such as has been indicated, arising in particular areas, then I would have to consider the exemption limit&mdash;not reconsider the imposition of the tax, because I think the tax is a good one and, when money has to be obtained, should be retained. I should then have to reconsider the exemption limit and, if that situation does arrive, that I have to reconsider it, I shall bear in mind what has been said by Senators on all sides of the House, without permitting myself to make any comment on the manner in which ladies might dress their hair.</P>

    <P>This is a section which is, I take it, designed to encourage the use of the Irish language in films in this country. That, of course, is a very desirable step to take because a good many of us who are interested in the revival of <Col N="422" /> the Irish language always held that, until such time as we would bring it before the people through the medium of the film and in other attractive ways, it would be difficult for the language movement to achieve the success that we would all like it to achieve.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister, in connection with this section, whether it is necessary to have the sound track in connection with the film entirely in the Irish language or whether, say, in the case of a film where Irish is used in part of it and English in the other part, that would qualify for the concession being given.  Will it be enough to prove that the Irish language was used.</P>

      <P>It must be altogether in Irish.  This section is brought in specifically for an enterprising scheme that I hope will come to fruition for certain Irish films, and it is specifically to aid that worthy object that the section is introduced.  I understand from those associated with that enterprise that they are satisfied the section will cover their intentions in that respect, but the film must be continuously in Irish.  They feel that, if it was partly an Irish and partly an English film, it would not achieve the objects they have in mind.</P>

      <P>Some time ago, we passed a Gaming and Lotteries Act and this section of the Finance Bill now proposes to empower the Revenue Commissioners to issue licences.  It is in that connection that I should like to have from the Minister some more definite information.  In Section 15, upon which we have just had a discussion in relation to dance-halls, and the tax on dance-halls, there is a provision which, I think, should also be incorporated in this section.  I am referring to the population provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister suggests that the cost <Col N="423" /> of the licence, if the period does not exceed three months, should be £10. The issue of that licence for a period of three months at £10 might be in respect of an area where the population is 20,000, whereas, in relation to another applicant, it could be applicable to a population of 500, 600 or something under 1,000.  Some levelling up is necessary here.  It should be related to density of population, as otherwise we would be treating some applicants unjustly, and the cost of the licence would be rather high.</P>

      <P>What the Senator suggests is that we should have one licence fee for one centre of population and another for another centre.  I think that would cause more heart burnings than benefits.  So far as I can ascertain in relation to the Gaming Act and its operations, the person who is running the type of gaming visualised here in any area does not consider the charge excessive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the import levies.  I think that the Minister should at this stage review the effects of those levies and see how far they are achieving the purpose he stated he had in mind when they were imposed.  The Minister indicated, when imposing these levies, that the purpose was to restrict unnecessary imports. He must now be in a position to indicate whether that result has been achieved.  Has there been any substantial reduction in imports, or has the adverse trade position improved as a result of those levies, or are they merely bringing in additional revenue to the Exchequer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be highly undesirable that they should have only the effect of bringing in additional revenue.  It would be more desirable to ensure that our external trade position was improved. <Col N="424" /> The Minister should also be now in a position to state whether those taxes have resulted in unemployment in any sectors of our economic life and, if so, to what extent.  This is his opportunity, now when they are being confirmed, to take the House into his confidence and tell us how they have operated so far.</P>
    <P>I know the period has not been very long, but in matters of this kind action taken can have fairly substantial results, either beneficial or otherwise, and the Minister must have gathered a considerable amount of information from the trend of events.  I know that some of the duties imposed have led to very strong protests.  In particular, the duties on newsprint have very adversely affected some publications and have led to very strong protests.  How far the effect generally has been detrimental to the printing and publishing business, I am not in a position to know, but I think it is true to say that some publications have suffered severely.</P>
    <P>The Minister should tell the House how those measures are operating. There was general agreement that some action should be taken at the time it was taken; there was general agreement that something should be done to rectify the adverse trade balance which had assumed somewhat alarming proportions; but whether that should have been done by a levy on imports or by physical control in the nature of an embargo on certain commodities is a question which should be considered.  The Minister ought now to be in a position to express some opinion as to how those duties have operated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The special import duty, as Senators are aware, was imposed only on 13th March and, frankly, in the circumstances, having regard to the time-lag in the publication of detailed import and export figures, I am not in a position at the moment to state whether or not it is working out exactly as anticipated, whether it is sufficient, or whether, as I have already indicated, if it is not sufficient, I should have to consider further measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the House to understand that I keep the matter under constant <Col N="425" /> review, but, as I say, there is a very big time-lag between the conclusion of the month's trading and the detailed figures being available, apart from the total figures.  I can, however, say that, so far as the duty content is concerned, Senators will remember that I estimated that the special import levy would yield in a full year £3,000,000. In the first three months of the year, the yield was approximately £750,000, which is a rate of £3,000,000 per annum.  But one could argue two ways in respect of that figure.  One could very well argue that, during the first three months, you would expect to receive more than the appropriate rate, because of goods that were on flow, on order.  Equally, you could argue that, in respect of the first three months, you could expect to receive less than the annual rate, because people were using up their stocks. Frankly, until I have got some further figures, which I hope to receive soon, I would not like to offer a final opinion as to whether it has worked exactly according to plan or not.</P>
    <P>I want to say, as it has been mentioned, however, that I fully realise that it must cause some inconvenience. The fact is that it is not possible to cut back on imports and so redress the adverse balance of trade, without causing some inconvenience.  Like other things we have been discussing to-day, it is a question of where the balance lies, and the Government is clear that the balance must be weighted in favour of taking appropriate steps to redress the adverse balance of trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme, 1956, made by the Minister for Education, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, be confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this motion with all the greater goodwill because I was at one time a secondary teacher, and either a superannuation <Col N="426" /> scheme or an increment would have been regarded by teachers at that time as an unrealisable dream.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="Minister for Education (General Mulcahy) Richard (General) Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that Senators who have seen superannuation schemes put up to them before will know that they need not be as puzzled by the look of this as the normal person is. The simple purpose of this scheme, which has been arrived at at conciliation level between the Department and the secondary teachers, is to provide an extension of the time under which secondary teachers who are not yet members of the scheme, or secondary teachers who are members of the scheme but have not covered themselves under the scheme back to the earliest date in their service, will have an opportunity of doing so.</P>
      <P>I should like to say that the first superannuation scheme for secondary teachers was introduced in 1929.  Under that, a pension was payable at 60, or a disability pension earlier, and the members of the scheme had to pay 4 per cent. of their annual salary. Those who voluntarily retired before reaching the pensionable age were refunded their contributions.  In the case of those who died, their contributions paid were refunded plus 3 per cent. compound interest.  In 1951, retiring gratuities, disablement gratuities and marriage gratuities were added to the scheme, but, because of these additional facilities in the scheme, the 4 per cent. of annual salary was increased to 5 per cent.</P>
      <P>Now the position under this scheme is that those who are not yet members and those who are in the scheme but have not been in it from the earliest possible date may, by payment of arrears of contribution, provided they did so within the next six months, come in under the scheme, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under certain circumstances, where a member of the scheme had a ten-year break in his past service, he was not allowed to include it for pension purposes for the earlier period.  That ten-year break is, in respect of past teachers, being wiped out, so that, if there are teachers with a ten-year break that would not be included for pension purposes in the earlier part <Col N="427" /> of the period, they can, by fulfilling whatever conditions are necessary here, include their earlier period of service for pension purposes.  But the scheme does not provide that in the future persons who have a ten-year break will be able to retain it in the scheme for the earlier period of their pension.</P>
    <P>Senators will probably remember that service in industrial schools was not regarded as pensionable.  Service on primary work in industrial schools was not regarded for pensionable purposes as service for national teachers until comparatively recently.  Now it is.  This provides that where a man or a woman who was a national teacher and is now transferred to secondary teaching did part of the national teaching in industrial schools, the period of service in an industrial or a reformatory school can be covered for pension purposes.</P>
    <P>The salaries upon which secondary teachers' pensions were fixed are based on a basic portion paid by the schools and an incremental portion paid by the Department of Education.  There was a difference between the minimum basic salary paid to a man and to a woman.  Now, for the purpose of the pension scheme, the basic salary for a man or a woman is regarded as £200. Part of the contribution made to the pension fund is paid by the schools on the £200 salary.  They paid at 2½ per cent. on the £200.  The schools are now asked to pay 5 per cent. into the pension fund from the part of the salary they are paid.</P>
    <P>The main part of the scheme has been arrived at at conciliation level, in conciliation talks between the Department and representatives of the teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is the section which confirms the Orders made under the special import levy. <Col N="428" /> The Minister, in replying to a question put to him by Senator Cogan, said that the time since the levies were put on has been rather short, and that it would not be possible to gauge whether or not they were achieving the purpose for which they were put on.  That may be so, but we have seen from statements published that the position has not improved considerably since the levies were put on.  However, I suppose we will have to wait for the full period of the financial year before we are in a position to judge their justification or not.</P>
      <P>That, however, is not the matter that brought me to my feet.  When important decisions such as these have to be made&mdash;and we have seen now over the past 12 years, or over a period of years, that any action that a Government takes has many ramifications and is likely to lead to so many dislocations, some serious and others not so serious&mdash;careful consideration is required and such consideration is necessary when steps are taken to impose levies, to make restrictions or remove assistance, by way of subsidies or otherwise.  We have had experience over the past 12 months, first in relation to the removal of the subsidy on biscuits, but I will not go into that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had the position of the restrictions in relation to cars and car parts which have had very serious repercussions for a number of employees in this industry.  We have seen, within a very short time&mdash; I should say, within a few weeks&mdash;of the order being made, the Minister for Industry and Commerce compelled to amend it.  I do not altogether find fault with that, I think it is better when you find you have made a mistake and that something you have done is having an undesirable effect, to take steps to rectify the position, rather than let it continue, in case that action might be wrongly interpreted; but it does bring us to the necessity for very careful consideration and I doubt if that consideration was <Col N="429" /> given in the case in the making of a number of these Orders.</P>
      <P>We have had three or four of them amended in a very short time when their bad effects were noticed. Probably these effects would not have been as serious as they were if the ultimate modification of the Order had been made at first.  When you take steps to curtail the importation of certain commodities, you are bound to affect people engaged in production and distribution.  Therefore it is a very serious matter and the difficulty with questions of this kind, particularly when they relate to persons who are qualified in particular trades or handicrafts, as the people in the motor industry are&mdash;or in the building trade, as we saw at another time&mdash;is that these people will not be satisfied with going to the labour exchanges for doles, no matter how attractive they may be.</P>
      <P>They are people who were in receipt of good remuneration over a period of years, and, immediately any small slump occurs, even for a short time, they at once take the next boat across the water, particularly because of the conditions that exist over there, and if possible try to get employment there.  It is because of these facts that we should be very slow to make Orders, and then only when they are absolutely essential, and after having given careful consideration to their ultimate effects, particularly as we have being crying out over the years for persons with technical training. When we take any steps that will upset people of that sort in their employment and create a feeling that they have not got permanency, then we will lose these people.  Their loss at this time is one that should be carefully considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We recognise that something had to be done, and whether the results will be achieved in this way or not, I do say that, before we take any steps which may curtail employment in any field, we should try to assure ourselves that we have given the matter every consideration.  It is only in cases of national necessity that we should take such steps, no matter what inducement there may be to the Minister for <Col N="430" /> Finance or to the Department of Finance from the point of view of getting in revenue.  Getting a large sum of money into the revenue pool should not be the chief consideration. The chief consideration should be what effect it will have on our people, and particularly on keeping people in employment here, instead of creating a position of rising unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>These special duties were not imposed for the purpose of creating revenue.  The Minister made it quite clear when he said they were being imposed as a deterrent and the revenue is to be put into a special fund for capital expenditure and not to be used as part of the current revenue.  Before the Minister was attacked for not moving quickly and now he is attacked for moving quickly.  When he does do something, he is bound to be wrong and told that he moved too quickly without sufficient consideration.</P>
      <P>One of the results of imposing a blanket Order of this kind is that there are cases which have not been adverted to and perhaps which are very small in their own way, but which are serious to the people concerned. There are two matters which I happen to be interested in.  One is the imposition of duties on works of art coming into the country.  I think that is very undesirable and should be avoided. There is no duty on the works of artists going into Britain.  The amount coming here is very small and the amount coming from the Six Counties is very small, and there may be no danger of retaliation.  All the same, there should be exemption, and if possible the free interchange of matters of that kind which have a cultural value, as well as having a considerable financial value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point is that the imposition of tax on foreign newspapers has had a rather unusual effect on one rather enterprising newsagent who happens to be living near me.  He was stocking French, Italian, Spanish and German newspapers and journals and built up a special trade.  I think he was the only person in the State who had such an extensive stock.  It is very valuable from several points of <Col N="431" /> view.  We should get, as much as possible, the European angle upon things rather than the purely British and, secondly, from the point of view of students his shop was very valuable indeed in supplying examples of journalism in modern languages which are generally studied at universities.  He had built up a very special trade in this matter, getting a very considerable amount of books, newspapers and periodicals.  He had a good business for which he worked very hard and, apart from his business concern, he was doing excellent cultural work. Under these duties, these papers now cost more.  In fact, they cost more to the extent that it may be cheaper to order them direct from the publisher. If that were done, a certain amount of Irish work and Irish profit would be cut out.</P>
    <P>It is one of my hobbies, here, to study the way in which Ministers resemble one another, no matter what their Party may be.  Every Minister for Finance will tell you that once you make an Order and begin to exempt certain things you find that first you exempt A, then you exempt B, then C and then your Order is undermined. However, in relation to imports of foreign papers, there is one loophole. You can get an educational paper in free of duty.  It is very difficult to determine, for example, that <i>Le Figaro</i>, a Paris newspaper, is educational!  It is not.  At the same time, it is a high-class French journal and the kind of person who wants to read it should be able to get it.  It is an advantage to us that that kind of paper and similar papers from Italy, Germany and Spain, should come in.  I suggest that, if at all possible, the tax on non-English language papers and the tax on works of art should be removed. These are the two points I happen to be interested in myself from various angles.  If possible, these taxes should be removed.</P>

      <P>I support what Senator Hayes has just said on the subject of taxes on works of art.  I had intended to make the point if he had not made it.  It seems to me very <Col N="432" /> regrettable that paintings, sculptures, and so forth, should be taxed in this way.  It is regrettable for one reason in that it breaks a unity which does exist in our country.  The artists of Ireland work fairly closely together and in harmony with one another.  We are now imposing a stronger barrier between the two.  There has been a good deal of outcry in at least one of the national newspapers on this subject. I appeal to the Minister to make a special exception in the case of works of art.  It may seem perhaps over-specious pleading but I suggest to him as Minister for Finance and not as Minister for Fine Arts, that a way to prevent inflation is to encourage people to spend money on works of this kind.  They are not consumer goods. If anything, they gain in value, if carefully chosen.  I suggest to him that he is not preventing inflation in any way or really doing much to restore the balance of payments by taxing these works of art in this way. I strongly support Senator Hayes's appeal.</P>

      <P>So far as the comments made by Senator Hawkins are concerned, Senator Hayes has dealt with some of them and dealt with them very effectively.  I was criticised from the Senator's side of the House for not moving quickly or stringently enough and now he says I should not move too quickly or be so stringent. If works of art are being brought in here for a non-profit exhibition then, even though they are sold at such an exhibition within the country, they still are not chargeable with the levy. I can appreciate anxieties in that respect, but, in a situation of the difficulty that has arisen, it is very difficult indeed if not impossible to take steps to rectify the situation without affecting some interests: in fact, it is quite impossible, I am afraid, to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the papers Senator Hayes mentioned are concerned, there is an exemption for daily newspapers not having a circulation of more than 1,000 within this State.  I should be very surprised indeed if more than 1,000 copies of <i>Le Figaro</i> were sold here. That was put in for the purpose of enabling what one might call perhaps <Col N="433" /> student-reading of that type of foreign newspaper that would be desirable.</P>
    <P>The levy is bound to cause some inconvenience, if nothing more, but the balance of payments situation which we found after the publication of the February trade returns was such that I am afraid that inconvenience was unavoidable.</P>
    <P>I trust the House will forgive me if I go to register my vote in the Lower House.  I shall be back as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the duty on the import of newsprint.  I should like to ask if the Minister would consider a similar concession in respect of small papers which are published within the State.  They have to pay this 5 per cent. duty.  I understand that the levy was originally imposed because of the enormous consumption of newsprint here, but it has had a very bad effect on weekly papers and periodicals and technical and scientific journals.  There are a few of these types in this country and I think we should not discourage them by this levy.  It is quite possible that the Minister might frame a scheme whereby, say, the first 100 tons of newsprint might be allowed free of duty. That would mean that most of the smaller papers and periodicals would be free of duty.  Maybe the Minister's secretaries would bring this matter to his attention.  The position is very serious for a number of these smaller papers by reason of the imposition of this duty.  If it cannot be considered this year, maybe we might have a concession in this respect next year.</P>
      <P>About two or three months ago I read that the president, I think, of the provincial newspapers in Britain said he feared that most of these small papers would be driven out of existence by high wages and the cost of capital re-equipment.  We have the same trouble here in the provincial papers.  The 5 per cent. duty will make the position worse for many of these small papers and periodicals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the point made by the Senator is met by the terms of the Order which includes periodicals which are trade, craft, <Col N="434" /> trade union, scientific, religious or educational.  I take it that the Senator is thinking of other small papers and I will see that his point is brought to the Minister's attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Burke is referring to publications printed within the State and which, as such, do not get any relief under the levy. As the Senator said&mdash;quite rightly, I think&mdash;the Minister revived this levy. It was a duty that was originally imposed by a previous Minister for Finance and was suspended in actual operation as at that time it was felt it imposed an unnecessary burden on publishers in this country and did not give a worth-while tax revenue.  There was, of course, at the time of this original imposition, a great difference in the world price of newsprint.  When the duty was first imposed, the world price of newsprint was in the neighbourhood of £10 to £12 a ton and, of course, a levy of 5 per cent. on the total importation of newsprint into Ireland at that time would not give a very worth-while revenue.  It was for that, reason, I think, that the then Minister for Finance, who originally imposed this duty, subsequently suspended its operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the revenue point of view to-day, of course, the picture is a very different one, because the current price of newsprint is between £58 and £60 per ton.  Naturally enough, the 5 per cent. duty on that gives a rather different revenue yield.  I would support Senator Burke, however, on this question, if it were a matter of the balance of payments position which caused the Minister to revive this levy on newsprint, and if it was for the purpose of curtailing or checking the extravagant use of imported newspapers. Apart from the revenue yield, I feel that the Minister might find other ways in which to curtail the newsprint users.  For instance, during the war and for some years after the war, there was a system of newsprint rationing.  During the war, of course, it was purely a rationing system, but in the years immediately subsequent to the war, the newspapers, at the request of the then Minister for Supplies, the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="435" /> and the Minister for Finance, imposed on themselves certain restrictions in newsprint user.</P>
    <P>I feel that perhaps if those of us who are, so to speak, in the trade had been consulted about this and if the Minister's objective was to restrict newsprint user rather than obtain revenue, we could probably have helped him by imposing on ourselves a form of rationing to restrict the user of newsprint.  We could have instituted greater economies by reinstituting the old system which we used voluntarily for quite a number of years after the war by not taking returns from news agents.  We could possibly have come to an agreement to curtail the size of our publications and in that way might have helped him to achieve his objective of reducing the user of imported newsprint in this country and, at the same time, have avoided the financial hardships that this duty must, of necessity, impose on smaller publications and smaller printing concerns throughout the country.  That is the type of publication to which Senator Burke has referred.</P>

Sub-section (1) says: &ldquo;So long as Section 7 of the Finance Act of 1932 would apply.&rdquo;  I think that means to say as long as a certificate is granted by the Minister under that section, so long as that is in force, because presumably the section refers to the relevant point of the certificate being in force.  I just wish to draw the Minister's attention to that section, because there is an implication that the person <Col N="436" /> concerned must himself be living in the country, whereas Section 7 of the Finance Act contains the implication of citizenship.

      <P>Senator Burke has just made a very definite statement about this section and I would ask the Minister to clarify it.  Senator Burke said that the shares, stocks and securities referred to in this section are only those appertaining to public companies. In other words, it is the shares and securities which are on the open stock market.  Am I to take it from the Minister that that is correct and that the relief granted under this section by way of death duties does not apply to the ordinary Irish business companies who have not got a public issue of their shares?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the point raised by Senator Crosbie is concerned, this section deals only with such public companies as have made public issues or public offers for sale. The reason for the necessity of restricting the operation of the section to that type of company is, of course, obvious.  Otherwise, it would be quite impossible to administer, and it was companies of that type that it was originally intended to provide for in the section.  The section in the earlier part of this Bill, so far as income-tax is concerned, provided primarily for these shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as death duties are concerned, it has two aims, first, in so far as past issues are concerned, to make them more marketable, to provide that there will be a stream of purchasers, of people who are thinking of having to render their final account and who, on that basis, are setting their house in order.  That will mean that there will be a demand for shares of the type in question.  Secondly, so far as inducement in the future is concerned, I hope that if public issues are made, it will in the same way add some inducement and act as an incentive to people to apply for shares in public companies and thereby enable the proper financing of public companies to be made, rather than that they should rely permanently on bank credit.  This, <Col N="437" /> I hope, will ease the situation in which they can get ultimately into the appropriate type of equity share capital.</P>
    <P>So far as I understand the point raised by Senator Cox&mdash;and I have some little difficulty, the Senator will appreciate, in that respect&mdash;not having heard the whole of his remarks&mdash;it is that this section refers to a person being domiciled.  The reason is this: the liability for income-tax is determined by residence and if the Senator looks at Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1932, he will find that it commences, &ldquo;Where an individual who is resident in Saorstát Éireann and is not resident elsewhere....&rdquo;  Income-tax depends on residence.  If the concession were given without advertence to residence, then the concession would be available to somebody, for example, resident in Great Britain and, under the double taxation agreement, the effect of that would be that the benefit of a section like this would go, not to the individual himself, but to the British Exchequer.  That was why the income-tax end of the concession was restricted to residence.</P>
    <P>So far as death duties are concerned, there the basis of determination of liability is not residence but domicile, and, as for income-tax, so for death duties: if we did not provide that the concession was to apply solely to persons domiciled in this country, the effect of it could very well be, under the double taxation agreement, that the benefit would go to the British Exchequer rather than to the estate of the deceased person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>While paying full tribute to the very great service which the Minister is rendering under this section, as regards both death duties and income-tax, I still must express disappointment that as far as death duties are concerned he is confining the concessions to public companies, because I do feel that the great bulk of commercial and, indeed, industrial, enterprise and the backbone of commercial enterprise in this country, is the old-established family business. There is no inducement being given under this section to people to reinvest <Col N="438" /> their earnings or profits in these old-established family businesses. There is now an inducement being given, and a very proper inducement, to invest in Irish industries through public companies, but I maintain that these old businesses, which are the backbone of commercial enterprise in this country, are equally deserving of consideration.  It is a pity that no inducement is being held out to these people who are engaged in such family enterprises of one nature or another to plough back their earnings and profits and expand their businesses further.</P>

      <P>I want to support Senator Crosbie in the plea he has made and I ask the Minister for Finance to examine it.  When a project is mooted for the establishment of an industry in a country town, it usually means that three or four people get together and form a private company. Very often there is 100 per cent.  Irish capital, 100 per cent.  Irish directorate and 100 per cent.  Irish labour involved. Is not the type of employment given in that type of industry the type that we should encourage?  While I want to give the Minister all credit for introducing this section, I ask him to examine it and to consider that this country generally has small industries. This is a small country and with a population of 3,000,000 that will be the type and pattern of industry rather than the big public company.</P>
      <P>I wish again to stress the great social and economic benefits and the great amount of stability that will accure to our whole economy by making this section wider in its application in the way in which Senator Crosbie has indicated.</P>

      <P>When speaking on the Second Reading, I suggested that the corporation profits tax should be levied only on that part of the company's profits distributed by way of dividends, the object being to encourage <Col N="439" /> the conservation of profits which companies have earned, so that they would be able to extend and replace their plant and equipment as it became necessary.  I recognise that no alteration can be made this year, but I should like to ask the Minister to bear that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been suggestions from time to time that the corporation profits tax should be utilised in rather the same manner as the profits tax is utilised in Britain, for the purpose of stressing economically the balance either against distributed profits and in favour of undistributed profits or equalising them more, as the case might be.  Frankly, when I was considering the proposals for the Budget this year, initially, I was doing so before the Industrial Taxation Committee's report came to hand, and I did anticipate at the time that there might be some wider examination of this problem in that report than in fact proved to be the case.  The Industrial Taxation Committee did touch on this subject in referring to the question of taxes being remitted for pure export purposes and, as the members of the House are no doubt aware, ultimately advised against that.  That committee, not having dealt with the problem raised by Senator Guinness in any very great detail, having only just touched on it in the respect I have mentioned, it will be a matter for us to consider at a later stage.</P>
      <P>There are points that could be made in favour of the point of view raised by Senator Guinness, and there are points that could be raised against it.  The argument in favour has been put up by the Senator and is clear enough. It would assist companies in a policy of consolidating and building up reserves. There is a matter to balance against that, that is, whether, in our peculiar circumstances, we have as yet sufficient experience of industrial profit-making to be able to ensure that there will be the interest in future issues and the interest in the capitalisation of future industry, if there is not sufficient play given in the interval to corporation profits tax being subdivided as between distributed and undistributed profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" /> Apart from that, apart from the actual policy involved, there would also be the question of a substantial change in the yield, if the rates of tax on distributed profits were left as they are and the tax on undistributed profits reduced.  I am not quite clear whether the Senator was advocating dealing with it in that way, or whether he was thinking of it from the overall angle that whatever sum it was decided to provide from corporation profits tax should be provided more by a tax on the distributed profits rather than upon undistributed profits.  The members of the House will find the exact reference in the Report of the Committee on Industrial Taxation at paragraph 170 on page 64.  In that paragraph, the committee appreciated that it was part of a wider field and one which, perhaps, should be examined in the future, either departmentally by the Minister for Finance or, perhaps, by the commission to which I have already made reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only one observation to make in regard to corporation profits tax.  It sometimes causes hardship to a company.  In connection with corporation profits tax, there is no tax paid on the first £2,500, and in the case of a company losing £7,500 one year and making £5,000 the next, they pay corporation profits tax on £2,500 in the second year, although they made a considerable loss over the two years.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 23 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 23 provides for the initial allowances.  This, I take it, is based on the report of the committee inquiring into industrial taxation.  While it is good as far as it goes, I do not think it goes far enough. The committee as a whole recommend initial allowances in regard to buildings, as well as in regard to plant. They also recommend an additional allowance in regard to wear and tear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not gone as far as the committee and I want to draw particular attention to one of the reservations to the report of the committee&mdash;Reservation <Col N="441" /> No. 6 by Mr. Patrick Lynch, in which he advocates a rather more radical change in the depreciation allowances than is recommended by the committee itself.  I do not propose to read the whole of this reservation.  I refer the Seanad to page 92 of the report where it will be found.</P>
    <P>The main point about it is that the present depreciation allowances are conventional and arbitrary.  They are laid down by a series of judgments by the Revenue Commissioners which on the whole are satisfactory, but, at the same time, they are rather rigid, rather inflexible and certainly do not always correspond to the real life of the capital which is being depreciated.  The point in this reservation by Mr. Lynch is that if we really sincerely desire to increase industrial investment, we should relate the depreciation to the real life of the asset, and that business people should be allowed to state themselves the rate of wear and tear at which the depreciation should be reckoned.  The matter is argued in the reservation and I do not propose to read it.</P>
    <P>The main point is that, at a time of rapid change in technology, business people may be very slow to install new machinery, especially of an experimental kind if the depreciation is written over a long conventional period which has no relation to its real life, and that they should be allowed to shorten the life of the depreciation period in such a way as to write it off quickly, if it was not a success.  That would make the depreciation allowances more realistic than they are and would remove an element of arbitrariness, conventionality and unreality from the tax system.</P>
    <P>There is another point about it which is not made in the reservation&mdash; I think it is relevant&mdash;and that is that at a period of rapidly rising prices, if the period of depreciation could be shortened, as it would be, not in every case but in many cases, the great difficulty of deciding between cost value and replacement value would be partially eliminated.  The great difficulty between cost value and replacement value in regard to capital assets <Col N="442" /> largely arises owing to the length of depreciation period.  If the depreciation period were shortened, the difference between the two would become less and, therefore, the problem of solving this practical difficulty might possibly become less.  I just want to draw the attention of the House to this reservation, so that it will not pass unnoticed in the discussion here and in the further discussion which I know will take place in the future on this question of depreciation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an observation to make on line 28 in Section 23.  It says &ldquo;new machinery and new plant.&rdquo;  In the past, I think the depreciation allowances were given on all plant and machinery installed.  I should like to ask the Minister to examine the position obtaining here.  I know of a firm which is at the moment negotiating the purchase of a second-hand stove-enamelling plant.  The reason they are buying this second-hand plant is that someone who has a very much larger business is selling the plant.  The plant is not being imported.  There must be any number of cases where small factories in Ireland are buying plant from factories in Britain which have 20 times the output.</P>
      <P>A friend of mine recently bought a bottle-washing plant which is a wonderful machine in perfect condition. It was in some big bottling factory in England that wished to install a machine having four or five times the output of the older machine. The machine could be bought at one-fifth the cost of a new machine, but it would get no initial allowance here according to this section.  If people can pick up capital machinery that fits the purpose in Ireland at one-fifth the cost of new machinery, is that not the type of intelligent operation in regard to industry that should be encouraged here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the question of new plant and new machinery.  He should strike out the word &ldquo;new&rdquo; in each instance.  I do not think he would be doing any harm and neither do I think there would be any juggling.  I do not think there was any in the past.  An inventory is kept of the machinery and an account <Col N="443" /> submitted to the Revenue Commissioners. I do not see how there could be any loss to the revenue.  Certainly it would be an advantage to the country to encourage industrialists to buy plant and machinery at a cheap rate, either in Britain or other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that the Federation of Irish Manufacturers have for many years been advocating initial allowances.  The only allowance covered by this is in respect of goods purchased at 6th April last.  You would be a long time as Minister, and we would be a long time members of the Seanad, before you see an allowance on articles purchased since 6th April, because it is far too recent. We felt that if the Minister could possibly make the date ten or 20 years old, it could help us a bit.  I must say, that having listened to Senator O'Brien mentioning Mr. Lynch's suggestion, I entirely agree with him on it.  While we were glad to see an initial allowance made by the Minister, and it is very welcome, it is far too recent a date.  We do not see any claim whatsoever for a long time while it is for goods or machinery purchased since 6th April of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to act as an incentive, an inducement, to industrialists so to modernise and equip their industries that industry in Ireland will be enabled to take its proper place and produce goods efficiently.  If I were, for example, to go back before the commencement of this financial year, I would be doing away completely with the incentive.  There would be no incentive in giving to an industrialist a concession of this sort when he had already bought his machinery.  The purpose is to induce people, by giving them this acceleration of wear and tear, to purchase new machinery, to modernise, and, with that modernisation, to be able to produce their goods more efficiently.  Representations were made to me that we should go back beyond 6th April last, for different periods.  If one went back at all, <Col N="444" /> there would be no reason why one would not go right back, say, to 1922, but to do so would be to give an uncovenanted benefit, and completely destroy the incentive intentions of the section.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Brien mentioned the fact that I did not deal with other recommendations in the taxation committee's report.  That is quite true.  I received the report only a very short time indeed before the date fixed for the Budget, and it was far from possible to have all the implications of the many recommendations involved in it fully and completely examined in that time. I should have thought, frankly, that far from there being criticism that I had not implemented all the recommendations this year, there would have been commendation on the fact that I had moved so quickly in respect of one of the main recommendations included in the committee's report.</P>
      <P>As I have said already, other recommendations will be examined home, and when we have seen the full implications of them, we will be in a better position to judge.</P>
      <P>I should, perhaps, also mention, when speaking of the date of implementation, that, in Britain, what the Chancellor did was to announce that he was going to introduce an initial allowance in 1944, but he did not bring it in in his Finance Bill until 1945. This made it operative from the date of its announcement.  I am doing announcement and legislative enactment in the same year, which is the same in practice but more speedy in operation than what was adopted in Britain ten or 11 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I differ entirely, I am afraid, from Senator Burke.  I want to see the most modern machinery that can be got being obtained for this country.  I want to make certain that every inducement and assistance is given to people who are prepared to purchase the most modern machinery.  I appreciate that at times it may happen that second-hand machinery may be obtained that is good and is suitable for the purpose, but I think it would be entirely wrong that I should stress the possibility of purchasing second-hand machinery to <Col N="445" /> that extent by including second-hand machinery in this section.  We must face the fact that there have been cases here, a good many cases, where people have got second-hand machinery. We had it sometimes that people came over as a subsidiary of another firm and the establishment of the Irish factory was availed of for the purpose of off-loading out-of-date machinery.  I do not think we should do anything in any way at all that would open the possibility of that being done, while, at the same time, securing a tax advantage.  I feel very strongly indeed that what we want in this case is to give the maximum incentive towards the provision of the most modern machinery that can be obtained.</P>
    <P>People can still obtain other machinery, if they wish, but if they do that, they do not get this accelerated allowance.  The purpose of the accelerated allowance, as provided in the section, is to assist people who want to get the most modern new machinery to get it by means of providing a quick write-off for them when they get it.</P>
    <P>I can assure Senator O'Donnell that in respect of this section there will be very substantial amounts indeed writen-off from tax revenue next year. It will operate in the assessment year 1957-58, because industry is assessed under Schedule D on the profits of the preceding year, and there will be a very considerable concession arising in respect of this concession in the 1957-58 revenue accounts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree thoroughly with the Minister's point of view in this matter, there are still one or two questions which need clarification. Quite recently, we had applications to various countries seeking the establishment of industries here.  We have seen in the public Press, and heard, that there are possibilities of the transfer of some industries from the Continent.  These industries, I understand, are taking up roots completely from their former places and being transferred here.  Whether we could classify the machinery as second-hand, or it would come, by stretching the definition, as new, to benefit under these proposals, gives rise to a question <Col N="446" /> which should receive consideration, because it is possibly one of the questions that will come up in the near future.</P>
      <P>I have in mind now an industry proposed to be established in our own city, and while we are anxious to give every facility and concession and encouragement, that question should be clarified, that we have not encouraged and held out all the potentialities that are here to those people who have made a decision to take up their plant and transfer their business entirely to this country.  It would not be a question of putting over any third-rate machinery.  It would be a question of taking up the most modern machines and transferring them here.  In matters of that kind, there should be more broadening of this definition, so that cases such as that would be provided for.</P>

      <P>This section provides a concession for persons who propose to set up or buy industrial sites for industries.  We had a few years ago a great outcry against foreigners coming here and steps were taken whereby a 25 per cent. stamp duty was imposed in cases of that kind.

    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on this section, because I have had experience myself of the great difficulty which arises in the establishment of new industries with people having to pay this heavy rate of stamp duty.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he has considered two other points which arise: <Col N="447" /> one is the imposition on a company of the liability for stamp duty at 25 per cent., if it subsequently advances in a mortgage or a debenture in respect of capital commitments outside this country.  I can quite see that the reason why that section was thought of was to deal with one particular way of dodging the stamp duty but on the other hand, it has had the effect, in a number of cases, of preventing companies from obtaining finance which otherwise they might be able to obtain. It cannot be done on this Bill, but I think it is a matter which should be looked into.</P>
      <P>I should also like to mention&mdash;I think the Minister is already aware of this&mdash;the possibility that arises that when a company which has obtained exemption originally on the grounds that it is lawfully carrying on a business under the Control of Manufactures Act, ceases temporarily, the full value of the stamp duty would come back. I think these are two points under the Finance Act 1947 which could be looked into.  I am very glad to see the advances that have been made to relieve the effects of the tax in two cases, in particular the case of new industries.</P>

      <P>The whole legislation is very complicated and there is a great deal of legislation by reference to sections in other Acts which I am afraid I have not read.  As far as I can understand it, it seems that people are going to pay what is practically a penal tax, if they come to this country to buy agricultural land. They will be exempt from this tax, provided they have not got more than five acres or carry on business other than agriculture.  Everybody is agreed about one thing in this country, and it is about the only thing on which we are all agreed, that is, that a great improvement in agricultural methods is absolutely necessary from the point of view of our balance of payments. As that is so, it seems to me to be a retrograde step to prevent outside people from coming and conducting agricultural operations here.  I know that they are not prevented, but there is simply a penal tax on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="448" /> In the history of Ireland, there were many cases where farming has been improved by immigrants, who have shown us improved methods and processes; and demonstration is much more telling than mere preaching.  I should like to know how far this penal tax is consistent with the Government's policy of improving agricultural production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an extremely technical section, I agree.  I think in relation to the points raised by Senator Cox the case of a company purchasing property and then at a subsequent date obtaining finance by mortgage to carry out its operations is now dealt with in sub-section (2) of the section.  I take it the Senator is referring to the type of case covered by Section 26 of the Finance Act, 1949.  Sub-section (2) of this section amends that provision.  So far as the other point mentioned by him is concerned, I am not quite clear as to exactly what he means.  Is he making the case that it is in relation to the Control of Manufactures Act exemption in Section 13 of the Finance Act, 1947, the point is, or is it the date of the conveyance, or perhaps some other point that I have not quite got that is involved?</P>
      <P>It is a somewhat technical section. I used to know a great deal more about this section when I was on the poachers' side but now I am on the gamekeepers' side.  If there is a point in relation to it which does not seem to have been met by sub-section (2), I certainly will look at it during the course of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Brien made a point, and Senator Hawkins touched on the same thing, that if we want agriculturists or industrialists to come here and assist us in developing our potential industrial output, it is only proper we should limit this penal stamp duty in so far as they are concerned.  It is inevitable in these days that when new industries are being set up the technical know-how has to be taught to our own people.  People just would not come here unless they were enabled to make a home here and to have their own premises.  We met that difficulty in several industries.  That is why we <Col N="449" /> made the remission here in respect of the type of premises they would be occupying.  The whole question of whether it is right in any country that there should be a monopoly of lands reserved to the citizens of the country is a very much wider one than merely the matters covered by this section.  As members of the House are aware, certain countries have a provision that only citizens of that country can own land.  That is because land is different from a factory.  Land is limited in amount.  Agricultural land in this country is limited in amount.  So far as a factory is concerned, a person can erect a factory if he cannot get an existing building.  Therefore, there is not the same monopoly criterion for it as there is in relation to agricultural land.</P>
    <P>The other point as regards user, that was raised by Senator Hawkins, would depend entirely on whether the purpose in question came within the definition of an industry.</P>

      <P>In my opinion, this section is one of the most objectionable sections of the Bill, if not the most objectionable.  It is tantamount to depriving the local authorities of £500,000 which they would require to keep the roads in proper repair.  In recent times, local authorities have been put to the pin of their collar to make provision for all the local services for which they are responsible, including the upkeep of the roads.  Now we find this move by the Minister for Finance and the Government to deprive the local authorities of no less a sum than £500,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that a reprehensible step. The net result will be that next year the local rates will be higher, I am afraid, than they are even this year because it is incumbent on local authorities to keep the roads under their charge in a proper state of maintenance. If they do not, if they find <Col N="450" /> they have not the necessary finances to keep the roads in a proper state of repair and if, through financial stringency, they neglect to do so, the loss to the local authorities and to the people of the country will be much more than is represented here by this figure of £500,000: it will be twice as much, because, when the roads are allowed to fall into a condition of disrepair, everybody knows it takes a lot to bring them back again.  Therefore, I would urge the Minister to reconsider this section.  It is a step in the wrong direction.</P>
    <P>At the present time, there seems to be a tendency on the part of the Government to shift the burden as much as possible to the local authorities.  Not merely is that the case now, but the local authorities are being deprived of the finances to which they are justly entitled as a result of this section.  I, for one, object to this section and I ask the Minister to reconsider it.</P>

    <P>The argument Senator Kissane has just put forward that, if we do not spend this money on upkeep of our roads, it will mean they will deteriorate and that, following such deterioration, we will in fact lose more in the future and have to expend more in the future would be a valid argument if the transfer from this fund in any way affected the amount that went for the maintenance of roads to local authorities.  The position up to this has been that, in relation to main roads, the local authorities have obtained always from the Road Fund a fixed proportion of their maintenance costs.  That situation remains unchanged by this section.  There is no question that the effect of this section will reduce the Road Fund to a level at which it will not be possible for local authorities to obtain the same amount for main road maintenance or, <Col N="451" /> to be more strictly accurate, the same percentage proportion of main road maintenance as they had always received.</P>
    <P>I say &ldquo;proportionate main road maintenance&rdquo; because people might feel that, with costs rising, they might be restricted to a certain amount.  They have always got a percentage of the main road maintenance from the Road Fund and they will continue to get that percentage, the same percentage that has always operated, of their total expenditure on main road maintenance. There never has been any question under any Government of county councils, local authorities of any sort, getting from the Road Fund any grants for county road maintenance. That has never been done since the State was set up.</P>
    <P>In relation to maintenance on both sides, therefore, the position is not going to be changed one iota by this section.  It is not a valid argument to suggest in any shape or form that the effect of this section means that we shall be spending less on the upkeep or maintenance of our roads, main or county.  Neither is it correct to suggest that by this section we are transferring to the local authorities any proportion of main or county road upkeep or maintenance that was formerly borne by the central authority.</P>
    <P>So far as the question of improvements to roads is concerned, that is, bringing them up to a higher standard, there is a considerable difference of opinion between the two sides of the House.  During the past two years we have stepped up substantially the amount we have allocated for county road improvements because we felt it was desirable to press ahead with that type of improvement rather than that the stress should be continued always in favour of the main roads.  The amount, in fact, that is allocated this year for county road improvement is £700,000 more than it was in the last allocation made by our predecessors in office.  So far as main road improvements are concerned, that is, main road new work, it is in our view unchallengable that, where we have, as we <Col N="452" /> have at the present time, a shortage of the capital that can be provided for essential work without recourse to inflationary methods, there are other types of productive enterprise which deserve capital more than what I described in the other House as &ldquo;the polishing of main roads&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is only in respect of main road improvements or new works on main roads that there will be any restrictions at all.  That does not affect the type of work the local authorities have been engaged in, heretofore.  It is to the type of work on our main roads, which at the present time when capital is both scarce and dear could well be deferred for a few years, that the restrictions apply.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear, in case there might be anybody who does not fully understand the position, that there is no question of a raid on the fund for use for the purpose of balancing the Budget.  It is being used for capital purposes because we believe that there are other capital constructive purposes of a higher priority at the present time than the type of arterial, main, trunk road work and improvements that would otherwise be done.  With some of this money, part of which accrues because of the buoyancy of the fund at the moment, these other works of a more urgent nature can be undertaken. Nobody can tell until the end of the financial year what the full resources of the fund will be.  I stress again that it is merely in respect of main road improvement work and of that work only that there will be any restriction arising out of this section of the Bill.  So far as that type of work is concerned, I have no hesitation in recommending that there are very many much more urgent types of capital works which could well be provided for the benefit of the community as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The question in relation to this section is one of principle. When a couple of years ago we had a Bill going through this and the other House providing for an increase in motor taxation, the then Minister for Local Government put forward the reasons, for that increase in taxation. <Col N="453" /> At that time, on behalf of the then Government, he gave a solemn pledge to the members of both Houses and through them, to the people who had to find the tax&mdash;the motor users&mdash;that that money would be used for their benefit.  When that Bill was going through the Houses of the Oireachtas, the members comprising the present Government were the persons who were most vocal in their demand that that pledge should be given by the Minister, that all the additional moneys collected in the increased tax would be utilised in giving a better service to the users of motor transport and that it should not be utilised in the manner in which the Minister now proposes to use it.</P>
      <P>It would have been very easy for the then Minister to have said he was going to create this fund by increasing taxation on motors and that, when he had collected it from the people, he was going to use it for other capital expenditure.  I am sure each and every one of us could then have put forward our own pet schemes.  I, for instance, could have suggested that the money should be used in the provision of housing or some other essential work, but the guarantee was given, and the money was extracted for the sole purpose of improving the roads and removing dangerous corners, thereby giving a greater service to the people contributing the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very plausible on the part of the Minister to say that the county roads are going to be maintained and that other roads will be maintained, too.  We all know that the county councils in dealing with roads have prepared their plans over a number of years and have put them into operation as the finance became available.  A number of county councils, the Galway County Council among them, had made such plans for road improvement.  The Galway County Council had made great headway in that regard and had hoped to speed up the work when the extra money was available to them.  For such works, it was necessary that there should be the most up-to-date machinery, and in expectation that they would get the moneys from this <Col N="454" /> motor taxation fund, the county councils had been going ahead with their works and had purchased that machinery.  Now they find that they will get less out of that fund in proportion to their share of the £500,000 which the Minister is taking out of it.  The machinery which they had been using in excavation work in connection with the construction and reconstruction of roads must now lie idle, until such time as the Minister and the Government change their minds on this matter.</P>
    <P>There is not much use in the Minister saying that the same amount of money is being made available for the upkeep of roads and the improvement of roads as last year.  There have been in the interval increases in wages and the cost of improvement, and the same amount of money will give less employment this year than last year.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with the moneys being expended on roads to which I would like to draw the attention of the Minister.  Last year, a sum of £790,000 was made available for road works under various county councils out of the National Development Fund.  As far as I know, there is no provision of a like sum this year.  That, with the £500,000, brings us to a figure of £1,290,000 less being made available to local authorities for improvement, maintenance and other essential road work.</P>
    <P>We come then to consider the areas that are hardest hit in relation to this matter and we find that in reply to a parliamentary question in the Dáil, the Minister for Local Government gave a table of sums expended on the road service in the various counties.  In the past two years, there was a sum made available in certain areas for the improvement of roads servicing the E.S.B. turf generating stations. Curiously enough, there is no provision being made for this service this year to any of the councils in whose areas these generating stations are being established.  There is no provision being made this year for schemes for the improvement of roads in Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas.  It does seem rather peculiar that on the very day on which the new Department for <Col N="455" /> the Gaeltacht is set up, this announcement is made, through the Minister for Local Government, in relation to the roads in these areas.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the guarantees given by the former Minister, this raiding of the Road Fund is unjust. The Minister should reconsider the matter and should apply the money to the purpose for which it was collected. He should also make available a sum of £790,000 as was provided last year out of the National Development Fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the skill which he has shown in befogging the issue before the House at the moment, that is, should we extract from the Road Fund the sum of £500,000 and apply it to other purposes?  Before we decide on that question, we have to decide what the Road Fund is.  It is a sum of money collected from users of motor vehicles in the form of road tax. That money goes into one common fund.  It is available for both county and main roads.  If £500,000 is extracted from that fund, it is no answer to say that it is extracted only from the main road section of the fund. There is no such segregation.  The fund is a common fund for main and county roads, with the exception, of course, of the 40 per cent. grant for maintenance. As far as improvement is concerned, all of the fund other than that 40 per cent. for the maintenance of main roads, could be applied to county roads.  There is no question whatever about that.</P>
      <P>Wicklow County Council passed a resolution early last year asking that all the moneys made available to us by way of grant from the Road Fund should be used exclusively on county roads and that no grant be made available for main roads, that we were satisfied with the 40 per cent. maintenance grant for main roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, both under the present Government and under the <Col N="456" /> Fianna Fáil Government.  Remember in 1952, when the legislation was introduced increasing the tax on certain types of road vehicles there were strong protests from the then Opposition, and there were demands that the increased revenue secured as a result of the increased taxation should be used exclusively for county roads.  The Minister at that time, Deputy Smith, gave an assurance that, as far as possible, the money would be applied to county roads and, in 1953, and in the provisions for 1954, the grants for county roads were increased proportionately higher than the grants for main roads. So that the trend towards the diversion of the Road Fund to county roads did not begin with the formation of the present Government or the appointment of the present Minister; it has been going on for some years and it is an absolutely justifiable trend, having regard to the figures which were produced in reply to a parliamentary question only last week.</P>
      <P>There are 9,600 miles of main road and 39,500 miles of county roads.  Of the 9,600 miles of main roads, 8,900 miles have been tarred and resurfaced. Of the 39,500 miles of county roads, only 8,200 miles have been tarred and resurfaced.  There are, therefore, 700 miles of main roads awaiting tarring and resurfacing and 31,300 miles of county roads awaiting tarring and resurfacing and those 31,300 miles are in a primitive condition, with waterbound surfaces, and represent an urgent problem demanding immediate attention.  They comprise roads leading to the rural areas, roads leading to farmers' houses.  They are practically all remote country roads.  They urgently require attention and the money is there for the purpose, or would be there if this £500,000 was not unjustifiably extracted from the fund. That £500,000 would reconstruct a very considerable mileage, if applied each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Hawkins has pointed out, there is an important principle involved. When the increased taxation was imposed, there were protests from the then Opposition Parties, and the then Minister gave an assurance that the money would be applied exclusively to road reconstruction, that he would <Col N="457" /> not tolerate, as long as he was Minister, any raids on the Road Fund.  The increase in taxation on motor vehicles was strongly criticised and had to be defended by the then Government.  The very strong defence by the then Government was that the money extracted from the road users would be used exclusively for their benefit, inasmuch as it would be used exclusively for the improvement of road surfaces.</P>
    <P>The case was made that the owner of a lorry or van who had to pay a higher tax would be compensated by having a better road surface on which to run his vehicle.  If it is worked out in pounds, shillings and pence, the probability is that, if that pledge was honoured, the road user would gain because we all know the wear and tear on tyres, springs and cars generally involved in having to drive over unsurfaced roads, so that from every point of view this raid on the fund which should be the property of the road users is entirely unjustifiable.</P>
    <P>There is no use in the Minister saying that the Road Fund is not being raided to meet current expenditure, that it is being raided to meet capital expenditure.  There is no merit whatever in that.  It does not matter for what purpose the fund is raided.  It could be raided for any deserving purpose such as for old age pensions or for anything else, but that is not the question. This levy was imposed for a certain specific purpose, and, in justice to those who pay the levy, it should be utilised for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The work of reconstructing the roads is a work of urgent national importance. It is linked up with the question of making agriculture more productive. If we do not provide the farmer with good roads, we will not help him to get the best out of his land.  The House should strongly recommend to the Minister that this section should be dropped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Government were very wise last year in voting £500,000 extra to the county roads.  I am surprised that Senator Cogan did not know that before he stood up to debate the question.  If there is not <Col N="458" /> the improvement in agriculture that we would like, one of the reasons is that people living miles in from the county roads are unable to get lorries in to remove their stock and produce.  They are unable to make use of modern machinery.</P>
      <P>I think it was a most wise and prudent step to put that extra £500,000 to the county roads.  When we drive to Dublin and other parts of the country we see good agricultural land taken away in order to build autobahns.  That is the purpose for which the land is taken away.  That was the principle enshrined here about 1944 or 1945 when those opposite sent out a team of experts to America to tell us how to build roads like the Americans.  I will not go into the question of the number of people killed on these roads, as we will get an opportunity of dealing with that matter at a later stage.</P>
      <P>It is to the credit of the Government that they spent the money as they did. The Road Fund has been most buoyant and the duty of the Government is to use the money collected in the best way for the common good.  If the money can be spent better for some other purpose, it is all to the good, but the most important principle which should guide the Government is to ensure that the money will be spent to the best advantage of our economy.  If we are spending too much money on the roads, it is much better that some of it should be utilised for really productive purposes.</P>
      <P>Roads are an amenity; they are not truly productive assets.  They are an amenity and the people who would give us the most production are the farmers.  People who speed along the roads at 70 and 80 miles an hour are not going to increase production. Rather will they increase the pleasure speeding craze.  I am surprised that the Minister was criticised for doing the prudent and just thing in relation to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this question, I think we should remember that our roads are as good as, if not better than, the roads in any other country of similar size and wealth in Europe to-day.  When we are speaking <Col N="459" /> about our main roads, I want to say that in 1952 or 1953, we got £35,000 in grants from the central authority to spend on the roads in Westmeath.  We sent a deputation to the Department and the instructions we got were that we were to spend £30,000 on main roads and only £5,000 on county roads.</P>
      <P>We disagreed entirely in County Westmeath with that procedure and with the instructions we got from the Department because we believed at that time that in County Westmeath, we had good main roads and that our county roads were in a deplorable condition. We sent a resolution, passed unanimously by the Westmeath County Council, to the Department but the Department refused to agree to our proposition that we spend £30,000 of the £35,000 on county roads and only £5,000 on the main roads.</P>
      <P>We sent up a deputation and we were again refused.  That was in 1952. Then we had to start a scheme and the scheme was that we were to spend £9,000 per mile on widening and straightening a road between Mullingar and Kilbeggan which before that was good enough for any motorist.  Where there were little dips in the road, we were to build them in and where there were hills, we were told to level them at a cost of over £9,000 per mile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that is a sheer waste of money, especially in a small country like this.  We are not a great empire and we cannot afford to spend money like that.  In my opinion, it is far better for us to stop this squandermania on main roads.  The same thing has taken place on the Dublin-Naas road.  It has been proved that there have been more accidents on that road since it was improved than there were before it was improved.  The same thing has been proved in Germany and in other continental countries.  I should like to remind Deputy Cogan that it was Fianna Fáil who started to raid the Road Fund.  They raided it for eight or ten years.  I believe it is better to use the money from the Road Fund and spend it on projects such as the land rehabilitation scheme, projects under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, forestry, drainage or any <Col N="460" /> scheme that will give value and help to increase production in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBergin" hpid="Mr. Bergin Mr. Bergin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bergin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disheartened by the speakers I heard since I came in.  My mind is borne back to one of the first speeches on this whole question made by Senator Michael Hayes in which he reminded the House that an awful lot of our difficulties in Ireland were psychological and sprang from the fact that the old Sinn Féin Party had split in two, leaving us with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.  Fortunately for me, I belong to a Party that is no offshoot of either of these Parties, but which was there at the same time as Sinn Féin and is the same Party still.</P>
      <P>The reason I say that is that I was amazed, when Senator Cogan was making what I thought was a reasoned enough speech, to hear Deputy Burke chip in with the old political catchcry of &ldquo;you were following our Minister then.&rdquo;  Senator Burke wanted to get for Fine Gael some credit.  Senator L'Estrange followed on the same lines. If Senator L'Estrange were in the Opposition and a Fianna Fáil Minister had not done as this Minister had done, Senator L'Estrange would never mention the dips filled in or the hills levelled in County Westmeath.  The people of this nation are getting completely fed up with this codology.  I think it is time the Parties examined questions on their merits and not on the basis of the old fight that has continued down to the present day between the splintered parts of the Sinn Féin Party.  If they would become more realistic, as we in the Labour Party are used to being realistic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This question of taking £500,000 from the Road Fund and applying it to different works is the question to which we should apply ourselves to-night, as to whether or not it is be used for purposes as good as possible, and, when we have to make up our minds to work within a limited figure, is it good that we should spend the available money on main roads, or apply it to some productive project?  I have here a quotation from <Col N="461" /> Deputy Lemass, who is, I suppose, the leading member, or one of the leading men, in the Fianna Fáil Party, from the Official Report on June 5, 1956, in Volume 157, column 1425.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As regards roads outside Dublin, I think it is true to say that the great majority of our main roads are quite good enough for the traffic on them at the present time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I agree with him, and I agree that, seeing that our roads are now good enough, we should think of the future, if the position was that we had sufficient money to make our roads perfect for all they were likely to carry&mdash;our main roads will have to carry more and faster traffic in the future, and we should plan for that and give all the necessary money if we could afford to do it. But as far as I can read&mdash;and I am reading both Opposition and Government speeches&mdash;there is a general recognition that we have not money to spend on future projects, that we have an immediate problem to settle. Senators should be trying to think themselves into the mind of a Minister for Finance who is faced with a capital project of a productive nature as an alternative to roads to carry future traffic.  I think the Minister was completely justified.  I know that Senator Cogan at our county council meetings in the future may quote this against me, if we run into the position of increasing unemployment on the roads. Carlow is not a county that will, maybe, have a corresponding increase in employment in other spheres.  I do, however, say that roads are not the type of scheme we should spend our money on at the moment.  Each one of us should ask himself the honest question: is it better to keep on improving our roads for traffic they may have to carry in 20, 30 or 50 years' time, or is it more important, in the present state of world affairs, to put this £500,000 into the development of electricity, of our mineral resources, or into agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to the buoyancy of the Road Fund, but I understand that the increased tax on petrol and the levies <Col N="462" /> on motor vehicles were imposed in order to reduce the consumption of petrol and the number of cars imported.  I assume, therefore, that there will be fewer vehicles on the road for the current year, and that there will be a corresponding reduction in the amount of tax paid, and consequently in the amount of revenue going into the Road Fund.  Apart from the fact that there is to be a reduction of £500,000 in the allocations from this fund, there is also to be a reduction of £790,000 from the National Development Fund, which was a supplementary grant payable to local authorities towards the end of the financial year, in previous years.  That means that the amount to be spent on the roads for the current year will be approximately £1,300,000 less this year.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the fact that in my own county, in consequence of the increase in roadworkers' wages by 15/- in three instalments, our county engineer informed us that the amount of the allocation would have to be increased by £47,000 in a year to employ the same amount of labour. The amount the Central Fund put up was two-thirds, and the amount provided by the local authority in previous years was one-third.  Our amount was, therefore, £16,000 and that £16,000 was provided in the estimates for the current year, but the grants from the Department of Local Government were not increased.  Consequently, there will definitely be a considerable reduction in the amount of employment which local authorities can provide on the roads this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, as I said, there is to be a further reduction of £790,000 for the whole country, that will decrease still further the amount of employment available. It is to be expected that the present administrative staff and the present supervisory staff will be retained, and the amount of machinery held by the local authority will also be retained, and consequently those who will suffer will be the ordinary road workers.  For those in the congested districts, casual employment outside their uneconomic holdings is necessary in order to keep body and soul together and to maintain those smallholders and their families, <Col N="463" /> and the only alternative for them is emigration.  If, therefore, this raid is proceeded with, it is inevitable that for the coming year emigration figures will be increased still further.</P>
    <P>I have never been made aware of the capital fund to which this £500,000 is to be devoted.  We are aware that £27,660,000 is to be spent on capital purposes for the current year, but the Minister has never indicated what capital fund this £500,000 is to be devoted to.  Consequently, unless you can get an equivalent amount of employment in the rural areas to the amount of money being taken from the Road Fund, this will be a very serious imposition on those parts of the country. When you consider also that the amount provided for employment under minor employment schemes and the rural improvement schemes is not to be increased, despite the increases in the wages, it must mean that those people will have fewer weeks' work, and consequently the two together will have a very serious effect in the areas with which I am particularly familiar.</P>
    <P>A great deal of discussion has taken place on the fact that this money is not required for main roads, but there are still 700 miles of main roads in the country which have not yet been tarred.  Those roads may not be in the Midlands or convenient to Dublin.  The farther out one goes from the large cities, the worse is the condition of the main roads.  If the ratepayer is now to take the place of the local authority in spending more money on roads, when one considers that already rates are three times what they were pre-war, and that the bottle of Guinness is 10½d. as against 6d. pre-war, then I feel the ratepayer is being mulcted.</P>

      <P>As a member of a local body, I should like to say that I fully appreciate the wisdom of the Minister in transferring this £500,000 from the Road Fund to the Capital Fund and that feeling in the matter is by no means confined to myself.  I have discussed it with several people and they are in thorough agreement with the Minister's action.  They have described it as a wise and praiseworthy action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="464" /> For several years, works of alleged improvement have been carried out on the main roads at a huge cost and in many cases these works were absolutely unnecessary.  Hills were cut through at a cost of thousands of pounds, hollows were filled in, for the purpose of making roads safer, and dangerous bends were cut.  As I stated on the Second Reading, this seemed to make the roads more dangerous.  Many of the accidents which have occurred lately have occurred on the straight parts of the roads and were due to speeding on the straight and smooth stretches.  If the corners which were cut had been left there, speeding would certainly not take place as people negotiated them, and many accidents would not have occurred.</P>
    <P>If the Government have diverted £500,000 from the main roads which are certainly in good condition and can make do as they are for several years, they have been very generous in the provision for county roads, which, as Senator Burke pointed out, are used by the majority of the rate-payers who have to subsidise a lot of this work on main road improvement and maintenance.  I know of no people who object to the diversion of this £500,000, but some overseers and gangers in soft jobs, who would certainly not lose their employment as a result of this class of work being stopped or being put on the long finger until a more suitable time arrived. They could be put on county road work.</P>
    <P>Ample employment is given on the county roads and will be given for a considerable time because in many cases they are not fit to carry the traffic which passes over them.  In so far as machinery is concerned, I think it can be kept in use preparing material for those county roads, the maintenance and upkeep of which will improve them and for which the Government has made very generous provision this year and next year.</P>

      <Col N="465" /> I am rather amused by the efforts being made by so many Senators on the Government side to pretend that this £500,000 is being taken from the main roads and not from the county roads.  We all know that the money is there in one big fund and if it is taken out of the fund it is taken from all the roads.  The county roads are in a most urgent need of repair and it is from the county fund that the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is from the Road Fund that this deduction is being made.  The fund is a common one.  I have already pointed out that there are 31,000 miles of county roads urgently demanding reconstruction and repair, and, if £500,000 is being taken, it is being taken from the work of reconstructing those 31,000 miles of county roads.</P>
      <P>The section itself reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The sum of £500,000 shall be transferred and paid from the Road Fund...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>not from the main road fund,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...to the Capital Fund at such time or times in the financial year ending on the 31st day of March, 1957, and in such manner as the Minister for Finance shall direct.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Knowing that we have 30,000 miles of almost impassable roads, Senators get up and calmly applaud the wisdom of the Minister in taking from the road users that £500,000 which should be used to put surfaces on the county roads which are now wearing out tyres, breaking springs in the cars of the motorists who are paying increased taxation.  We all talk about the buoyancy of the revenue.  Why is the revenue in the Road Fund buoyant?  It is buoyant for two reasons: the volume of traffic has increased and the rates of taxation in many cases were increased some years ago.  Since that is so and since the purpose of the Road Fund is to provide for the maintenance and construction of roads, then there is no justification for this raid on the Road Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator L'Estrange, who is usually original in his ideas, said that Fianna <Col N="466" /> Fáil raided the Road Fund on a number of occasions and that they were right in raiding it.</P>

      <P>Senator Bergin said it was not right to suggest that, in resurfacing roads, we are making roads for the future.  We are making roads for the present day and we are fulfilling an urgent need because these roads should certainly be reconstructed.</P>
      <P>The previous Government utilised a larger portion of the Road Fund for county roads by increasing the allowance for them.  Some years ago, there was no free grant for county roads at all.  It is only of recent development. It is a development brought about by the means of modern travel and it is a development which is very rightly proceeding.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke said I was not aware-that the allocation to the county roads had been increased.  I was so aware.  He may not have been aware that it was increased in the years previous&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Senator Burke did not give the House the impression that he was aware that the Fianna Fáil Government in the last year in which they were in office also increased the grant to county roads.  I agree with Senator Bergin that it does not serve any useful purpose on either side of the House to try to make Party capital out of these matters.  What serves a useful purpose is to bring home to the minds of all Senators that something is being done under this section that <Col N="467" /> is entirely wrong from a national point of view, from the point of view of justice and fair play to road users, and from every point of view.  No matter what Government might be in power, that section would still be wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBergin" hpid="Mr. Bergin Mr. Bergin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bergin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reply to some of Senator Cogan's observations. He implied that he has not read the Book of Estimates at all.  He implies we are taking £500,000 out of the amount allocated to the county roads. He knows that that is not so.  He knows that this year we shall have as much to spend on county roads as last year and that last year we had more than in any other year.  I am disappointed that Senator Cogan should make points that are not altogether correct.</P>
      <P>I agree that the present need is to improve our county roads&mdash;not to make them into the same type of road as our main roads where there are long straight stretches but to make them suitable for the traffic that travels over them.  In my county, the major portion of our traffic would be of an agricultural nature.  The vehicles would be carrying beet to the factory and wheat and barley to the mills.  That is slow traffic which does not need the big straight roads such as the Dublin-Naas road or the road to Cork.  Our present programme in relation to county roads will give us suitable county roads.  I think that if Senator Cogan at a Carlow County Council meeting had to decide whether we should continue improving roads such as the Cork road or whether we should carry out some other work of national development, he would decide to spend it otherwise than on the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be an argument favourable to what Senator Cogan said if at any time there was a regulation that a percentage of the money devoted to roads should go to the main or county roads as the case might be.  As that has never been the case, then it is up to the Government to do what they wish with the amount of money that is there in one big sum. If my memory serves me correctly, free grants for county roads were first introduced by the late Deputy T.J. <Col N="468" /> Murphy when he was Minister for Local Government.  That step was acclaimed all over the country and was welcomed by every member of every local authority, though not perhaps so much by the engineering staffs who preferred to stick to the main roads and make them wider.  However, the Minister of the day gave himself over to the popular demands of both Deputies and councillors and made free grants available for county roads. I would go further in my desire to compliment the Minister and the Government in regard to this £500,000 because there are increased grants towards county roads.  The amount of employment which will be given will entail merely the shifting of the men from the main roads over to the county roads because the sum total of grants in every county will be the same as or greater than last year.</P>
      <P>Had the Government taken three-quarters of the entire Road Fund at the present time when the demand for money is as it is and devoted it to something that would increase production, I think it would be the duty of this House to support them.  Roads are important but they are just luxuries.  We had seven or eight years of war during which the roads deteriorated.  Still the people got by and nobody was very much put out. We had heavy traffic on some of our county and main roads and still the roads held up.  At present, we are faced with a financial emergency.  I think that if the Government devoted this money to land improvement, or to some project which would increase production within 12 months, we would be in favour of it and allow the other scheme of road making to wait for a few years.  Senator Cogan pleads ignorance of knowledge that the grant for county roads has been increased&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Walsh asked a question as to what <Col N="469" /> was this Capital Fund.  It was set up under this year's Central Fund Act, Section 4.  The purpose of the Capital Fund to which is being paid special levies imposed under the Central Fund Act and to which will be paid also this year the sum of £500,000 is set out in Section 4, sub-section (4) of the Act.  The fund is to be applied for any purpose for or towards the cost of which public moneys may be provided and which are conducive to the development or improvement of capital resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be vague compared with the difference between main and county roads, but it is not that vague.  I think we all know the purpose to which the money is being put.  I think Senator Bergin put it well when he asked whether it is wiser to use the money in this way or for the purposes for which the Road Fund moneys are used.  I agree with Senator Bergin that it is wiser to use the money in this way.</P>
      <P>As regards county and main roads, I would say that Senator Cogan was trying to prove that black was white when he suggested that this money was taken from the county roads.  This Government made £500,000 extra available last year and are making an additional £200,000 extra available this year for county roads; that represents £700,000 more than in 1953-54. Accordingly, wherever this money comes from it certainly does not come from the county roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, I think I should explain where the money comes from.  It comes from the road users, from the users of motor vehicles.  They pay into the fund.  If the fund has grown&mdash;as it certainly has grown&mdash; during the past couple of years it has grown because the road traffic has increased and because taxation has increased. There is no credit due to the Government because more money was made available last year than the year before.  As a matter of fact, expenditure out of this fund has been stepped up each year for a number of years back and has been stepped up because <Col N="470" /> the fund itself was going up.  Up to the present year, the entire 100 per cent. of the fund went to the maintenance and construction of the roads.</P>
      <P>Now a change is being made by which £500,000 is being taken out of the Road Fund under this section.  If that money were not taken out of the fund it would be spent on the roads&mdash; it does not matter at the moment whether it would be spent on main or on county roads, but we may take it, in view of the general feeling throughout the country, that it would be used on the county roads.  It would be necessary to use it on the county roads because the cost of construction has increased enormously over the last couple of years.  The cost of construction, even of county roads, has increased considerably, so that we would need an additional grant from the Road Fund in order to carry out the prepared programme of county road reconstruction. At the present rate of construction, it will take at least ten years, or even longer, to get the county roads which are now in a very unfit condition into a condition suitable for the needs of modern traffic.</P>

    <P>Section 6 is, of course, the most important <Col N="472" /> section in the Bill.

    <P>&ldquo;(2)  Every person is an Irish citizen if his father or mother was an Irish citizen at the time of that person's birth or becomes an Irish citizen under sub-section (1)....&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the difference between Senator Cox's amendment and the text of the sub-section not that the sub-section gives a person the right to be a citizen if he registers, if he expresses his desire to have citizenship conferred upon him, but, as far as I understand the drafting of Senator Cox's amendment, it would make him a citizen automatically?  I do not think he intends that&mdash;does he?  The intention is to preserve the direct line of blood and, if a person of an Irish father or mother desires to become an Irish citizen, give him the right to become one, but not make him one automatically by the text of the Bill.  Is that not correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>

      <P>There is no question of any option or election there.  The whole point really turns on sub-section (4) of Section 6 which relates back.  Under sub-section (4) of Section 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A person born before the passing of this Act whose father or mother is an Irish citizen under sub-section (2), or would be if alive at its passing, shall be an Irish citizen from the date of its passing.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that to mean that, so to speak, retrospectively, the father or mother is deemed to be an Irish citizen, <Col N="473" /> but then, apparently, one has to read that again in conjunction with sub-section (2) of Section 7 which goes back on sub-sections (2) and (4) of Section 6 and provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Neither sub-section (2) nor (4) of Section 6 shall confer Irish citizenship on a person born outside Ireland if the father or mother through whom he derives citizenship was also born outside Ireland, unless&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that person's birth is registered under Section 27, or</P>

      <P>The whole scheme seems to bring Section 6 and sub-section (2) of Section 7 together.  To understand sub-sections (2) and (4) of Section 6, one has to refer to sub-section (2) of Section 7, which has a direct bearing on it.  I do not know whether my words improve it at all.  At the time I drafted them, I thought they might. I understand that the idea really is that if a person, A, was born in Ireland and emigrated that might carry citizenship to the third generation, but no further.  That is my understanding of it.  If the Minister does not think that my amendment clarifies what is admittedly, I think, an extremely obscure section, naturally, I will not press it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had this amendment very carefully examined.  I presume that Senator Cox's intention was to simplify the drafting and not to make any change of substance.  I would not be agreeable to a change of substance and I am advised that the draft suggested by Senator Cox would not meet the needs of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take an example.  A is born in Dublin in 1930.  He is an Irish citizen.  He emigrates and his son B is born in New York in 1960.  B is a citizen.  In due course B has a son, C, born in New York in, say, 1990.  The intention is that C, being in the direct blood line will be a citizen if he <Col N="474" /> registers.  That is achieved by the first part of sub-section (2) of Section 6 (&ldquo;every person is an Irish citizen if his father or mother was an Irish citizen at the time of C's birth&rdquo;)&mdash;subject to the registration provision in Section 7 (2) which applies to C.  Now, if we substitute Senator Cox's draft, we find that there is no provision under which C could be a citizen otherwise than by naturalisation.</P>
    <P>One of the principles on which this Bill is framed is that people in the direct blood line, even though they are of the second generation born outside Ireland, should be citizens if they voluntarily opt to maintain the connection. We are not imposing citizenship on them but we think they should have a right to citizenship if they wish to assert it.  That is the reason we are unable to accept the Senator's amendment.</P>

I support the amendment because I think it will give a more factual account of Irish history at that time.  I would like to have it on the records of the House again that at that time the Labour Party was opposed to the agreement reached.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the House might permit me to quote from the Official Report dated 16th December, 1925, Volume 6, column 124, where Senator Farren said:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I cannot see that any good purpose would be served by accepting this amendment.  The date in Section 7 (1) of the Bill&mdash;6th December, 1922&mdash;is the date of the coming into operation of the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann, and Irish citizenship, established by Article 3 of that Constitution, is based on domicile in Ireland on 6th December, 1922.  That date is also a determining date for citizenship established under the Act of 1935.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister for Justice may, at his absolute discretion, refuse a <Col N="478" /> certificate, fulfilment of the residence requirement does not by itself mean that the applicant will get a certificate.

      <P>This is the section under which I have suggested that there should be an appeal by a naturalised person to the High Court of Justice from a revocation by the Minister of the grant of naturalisation.  Obviously, if a person has been naturalised, it is a very serious step to cancel his naturalisation and revoke it.  It would appear to me that, in so serious a matter, it should not be left entirely to the discretion of the Minister, but that the person who has been naturalised and now finds it is alleged that he has done something which justifies his being denaturalised and possibly then becoming a stateless person, should have a right of appeal to the court.</P>

      <P>Does not the section improve the position as it is at present, which is that the Minister may give a certificate in his own absolute discretion?  The section makes provision for a committee of inquiry, with a chairman with judicial experience. Is that not a great improvement? Citizenship is a privilege conferred upon people, and I am not too sure that the idea of having a ministerial decision on a matter of this kind appealed, after a committee of inquiry presided over by a person with judicial experience, is a good idea.  The numbers of revocations are very small, and revocations are only operated in pretty serious circumstances.  While there is a good deal to be said in theory for the appeal to the High Court, in practice I doubt if it would prove to be desirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>My submission is that one can hardly imagine anything more serious or any penalty greater than loss of the status of citizenship.  An alien who has come here and presumably lived here for a very long time, behaving well, had been thought worthy to be naturalised, and it seems a very great penalty to lose his naturalisation and, so to speak, be <Col N="480" /> expelled from the country and have no status thereafter, without having an opportunity of going to the court. After all, the smallest sentence of imprisonment is a matter for a court, and one can scarcely imagine anything more serious than to be deprived of one's nationality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but suppose we look at the facts.  Over the past 21 years, 1,500 persons have taken out citizenship papers and the only revocations have been cases of persons who were more than seven years in residence abroad and intended to have their permanent residence outside the State.  Therefore, in 21 years, there has been no case of citizenship being taken from a person in circumstances where he would appeal to the court.  I do not know whether Senator Cox knows of any country where you can appeal to the High Court of the country from a ministerial decree that your citizenship is revoked.  I think the section the Minister has now put into the Bill, with the committee and a chairman of judicial experience, is better than the circumstances that apply in most countries.  I doubt if this amendment should be put in.  It purports to meet a case which in 21 years has never occurred and is very unlikely to occur.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>Before making a decision on this amendment, perhaps if we had a little more information it might help the House to clarify its mind.  As Senator Cox very rightly points out, to deprive a person of nationality that you have given him, who, before you gave it, has satisfied certain conditions of residence, proof of character and so on, and to deprive him of right of appeal to the High Court or the Supreme Court, if necessary, seems to me at this stage at any rate, for lack of information, to be rather strange.  In what circumstances does the Minister visualise that such action would be taken?  Past history does not help us, because in 21 years no cases have arisen.  Why is the Minister taking to himself this power? In what circumstances?</P>

      <P>I know that.  What particular set of circumstances does the Minister perceive would make it necessary to use this power?  There are other countries where there are certain things definitely laid down that will deprive you of your citizenship. For instance, a citizen of the United States who resides in a country other than the United States automatically loses citizenship, if he votes at an election there.  I do not think we can apply that rule here, in view of what some of our citizens are doing at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support this amendment.  The case which Senator Cox makes seems to me to be a very good one, and it is reinforced by Senator Crosbie.  I must say that I feel that the very fact that no case has arisen is not an argument against having a right of appeal to the courts of law.  It is really a point in its favour.  The thing apparently has not happened at all before and probably will be a very rare occurrence.  I feel that that is all the more reason why an appeal should lie to the court, because I feel that nowadays there is too much side-stepping of the law courts.  I feel it is a very bad feature of our modern state that, in the name of speed and expediency, the Minister's convenience, and so on, we are more and more getting away from the citizen's right of appeal to the courts. I feel this is a glaring case where there should be the right of appeal to the courts, instead of to an <i>ad hoc</i> committee.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Minister may revoke a certificate of naturalisation if he is satisfied:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that the issue of the certificate was procured by fraud, misrepresentation whether innocent or fraudulent, or concealment of material facts or circumstances, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  that the person to whom it was granted has, by any overt act, shown himself to have failed in his duty of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State or, (c) that (except in the case of a certificate <Col N="482" /> of naturalisation which is issued to a person of Irish descent or associations) the person to whom it is granted has been ordinarily resident outside Ireland (otherwise than in the public service) for a continuous period of seven years and has not during that period registered annually in the prescribed manner his name and a declaration of his intention to retain Irish citizenship with an Irish diplomatic mission or consular office or with the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Before the Minister can revoke a certificate of naturalisation, he must give due notice and the person concerned can claim to have an inquiry.  There may be circumstances in which a person may be undesirable after some years by reason of his want of loyalty to the State.  You may have the right to remove such a person, subject to his right of going before the committee.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment applies to the case of a naturalised person who has left this country and has been abroad and has applied for a new certificate.  I suggest that the words &ldquo;without reasonable excuse&rdquo; should be inserted. I can easily visualise the case of a person who has been naturalised and who possibly goes abroad for health reasons, finding himself in difficulty and perhaps failing to report.  I have a case in mind of an Austrian who lived here for a number of years and was naturalised.  He had to go abroad to a warmer climate for health reasons and he is terrified by the idea that if one remains for seven years outside the country, one might find oneself denaturalised and becoming a <Col N="483" /> Stateless person and perhaps referred back to a State to which one does not want to belong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the words would improve the matter.  The opening section says that the Minister must be satisfied before he revokes a certificate of naturalisation.

      <P>I am not in the least impressed by this commission of inquiry presided over by some person of judicial experience. &ldquo;Judicial experience&rdquo; is a very wide term.  It may be great judicial experience or very little judicial experience.  A commission of inquiry is not quite the same as one of our courts.  We do not know who the other members of the commission would be; we do not know whether this commission is to sit in public, whether it will be open to the public, to the Press, and so on and so forth. For all we know, it is little better than a Star Chamber Court.  It is the kind of set-up that, where the rights of an individual are concerned, I must oppose with all the vehemence at my disposal.  I think it is a very undesirable practice.  I hope that, between now and the Report Stage, the Minister and his officials will give it further consideration.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Senator Cox, Senator Crosbie and other Senators in appealing to the Minister to reconsider this section. The Constitution provides that the courts are one of the protections which an ordinary citizen has.  If a citizen, whether a naturalised citizen or otherwise, is to be deprived of that right, then it is a serious infringement on his liberty.  As Senator Cox has stated, <Col N="485" /> the revocation of citizenship is a most serious act and when one considers that, in the case of even the smallest fine in the District Court, a defendant has a right to appeal to the Circuit Court, I fail to see why this committee, of whose composition we were not informed, should have the final say in this matter.  All we know about this committee is that the chairman will be a person of judicial experience.  That may be interpreted as a defendant in a court.  At any rate, a chairman in such a capacity is extremely different from a judge of the High Court or the Circuit Court in the sense that he is not independent under the Courts of Justice Act.  The judges appointed by the Government are independent and therefore can look at a matter much more objectively and with much greater freedom.  A judge of the High Court who has practised for many years at the Bar and has qualified and sat at the High Court for possibly some time will be in a better position to adjudicate on a case of appeal against the decision of a committee which has been set up by a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know that, under the present Minister and probably under the Ministers we have had so far in our State, this committee would probably give a fair and square deal to somebody who is being deprived of his citizenship.  I would point out, however, that this is permanent legislation.  I think this may be all right in the right hands, but it could be very dangerous in the wrong hands. We have seen this kind of legislation used in countries in Europe.  I know that in Poland existing laws were used by the wrong people to perpetuate injustices of the most flagrant and violent nature on citizens.  In the future, this committee might not be all right and it would be very unsafe to give such powers for the future.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to think again about this matter before the Report Stage and perhaps give the right of appeal to the High Court.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (3), line 19, to delete &ldquo;of an alien&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;of parents both of whom are aliens&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This sub-section relates to a child born in the State of parents one of whom is an alien and not entitled to diplomatic immunity in the State, but who is then a duly appointed consular or other officer of another country, or an official of an international organisation on official mission to the State.  The parent or guardian of that child may renounce Irish citizenship on his behalf under sub-section (1) of this section in the same manner as that person himself could, if he were of full age, and notwithstanding that he is resident in the State.  My amendment is moved because I think that this provision should not apply unless both parents are aliens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the section stands, apparently it could happen that if one of the parents was an alien holding one of these positions, whether the father or the mother, that person could renounce for the child, for ever, Irish nationality, even though the other parent might not be a party to it.  I can quite understand that we are dealing here not so much with people with diplomatic immunity as with people who have very close ties to the foreign country when they come here.  It is to be remembered that in this case it might be a woman official who might be involved.  She might marry an Irish husband or a man official might marry an Irishwoman.  I do not quite see why, in that case, one should give power to one parent to renounce for <Col N="487" /> ever Irish citizenship on behalf of the child.  It does not seem to be necessary. Therefore, I put forward this amendment so that the sub-section will apply only if both parents are aliens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most unlikely that where one of the parents&mdash;the mother, presumably&mdash;is Irish, the other parent, being a foreign official, would renounce the Irish citizenship of the child without very good reason and unless it is in the child's interest to do so.  If, however, he does wish to renounce it, I think that the special position of foreign consular officers, etc., must be recognised and that he should have the right to do so, no matter what his reasons may be.  People of that kind stand in a special relationship to their own government and to their own country.  Therefore, I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 28 of the Bill as it stands, a person who claims to be an Irish citizen may apply to the Minister or, if resident outside Ireland, to any Irish diplomatic officer or consular officer, for a certificate of his nationality, but that does not apply to a naturalised citizen.  It seems to <Col N="488" /> me that there might be circumstances in which a naturalised Irish citizen might be abroad and might not have with him his certificate of naturalisation and, possibly, in time of war, perhaps, a serious question might arise. I was thinking that he should have the right, just as much as a citizen by birth, to apply for a certificate to the Irish Minister there, so that he could show that he was an Irish citizen.  It might be very important in certain circumstances and I find it very difficult to understand why he should not be given that right.</P>

As a matter of fact, the curious point about it is that the naturalised Irish citizen has a certificate that we have not got at all.  He is better off than we are from the point of view of certificates.</P>

      <P>Yes, but I should like to put the case that such a naturalised citizen, supposing he was abroad, supposing he had gone to Italy on holiday, might not have brought his certificate of naturalisation with him.  Supposing war breaks out in which Italy is involved and we are neutral.  He may have no ready means of proving straight away that he is an Irish citizen.</P>

      <P>I find it very difficult to see why he should not be entitled to go to the Irish Minister in Rome, or wherever he might be, and obtain a certificate of naturalisation.  It is the sort of thing that might arise in some emergency.</P>

      <P>The Minister would have no means of finding out in that case.  How could he know?  What could he do, particularly in a state of war?  I presume that I would not have much difficulty in convincing an Irish Minister somewhere that I was an Irish citizen.</P>

      <P>My friend here suggests that I might.  That is presumably because I have not got a Cork accent, but, even if I have not, how could a naturalised Irish citizen, say, a Slav, prove in Rome that he was a naturalised Irish citizen if he had no documents with him?  As other matters are being considered on Report Stage, perhaps this could be considered also.</P>
