      <P>It is with feelings of the deepest regret that I have to announce the death of our friend and colleague, Senator Fred Hawkins.  His death, which came as a great shock to all of us this morning, was sudden and most unexpected as it was only a few short days ago I had a conversation with him here in Leinster House when he appeared to be in his usual good health.</P>
      <P>The late Senator was one of the most industrious members of the Seanad and a competent and versatile debater.  He was a frequent and forceful speaker with varied experience and a considerable knowledge, especially of local government.  He was a man of firm and strong political views, but however vigorously he spoke it was with restraint and he never gave personal offence to those with whom he was in disagreement.  His personality and his sense of humour made him popular with all members of the House, irrespective of their political ties.</P>
      <P>From his early manhood, Senator Hawkins was imbued with a deep love of his native land and he was prominently identified with the national movement.  As a result of his activities during the War of Independence, he served many terms of imprisonment in various jails throughout the country.</P>
      <P>He was first elected to Seanad Éireann in 1938 and remained a member to 1944.  He was again elected in 1946 and at each subsequent election. As a member of the Seanad, he attended to his duties most assiduously and rarely missed a meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the widow and children of the late Senator, I shall convey, on your <Col N="790" /> behalf and on my own, our deepest sympathy and appreciation.  Solás Dé le na anam.</P>

      <P>Fuaireamar an droch-scéal eile ar maidin go raibh Diarmuid Ó Duibhir tar éis bháis.  Bhí sé ar feadh níos mó ná 30 bliain ag obair don Oireachtas is ar feadh dhá bhlian bhí sé ina Chléireach sa tSeanad.  Fear caoin séimh cúntach do b'ea é arbh' fhuirist caint a dhéanamh leis nó comhairle d'iarraidh air. Maidir le gnó na Dála nó gnó an tSeanaid, ní raibh aon duine ba mhó eolas ná ba ghéire tuiscint ná é.  Bhí caidreamh dlúth agam féin leis nuair a bhíos im Cheann Comhairle is dá mhéid aithne chuireas air sin mar ba mhó mo mheas air agus sin mar do b'fhearr a thuigeas na deá thréithe a bhí ann.  Tá a fhios agam gur mhaith le gach Seanadóir anseo comhbhrón ó chroí a dhéanamh lena mhnaoí is lena mhuintir uile.</P>
      <P>Senators will have learned with regret the sad news of the death of Mr. Dermot O'Dwyer, Clerk of the Dáil and lately Clerk of this House, who passed away this morning.  Go ndeana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
      <P>It is more than 30 years since Mr. O'Dwyer entered the service of the Oireachtas from a Christian Brothers' school by competitive examination.  In recent months he had reached the highest post open to him&mdash;the Clerkship of Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>As Ceann Comhairle I was, for many years, in intimate and daily contact with Mr. O'Dwyer and I learnt to admire the qualities of his mind, his judgment and his unfailing courtesy. He was deeply interested in parliamentary procedure.  He read widely and he gave the fruits of his knowledge and his own independent advice to his superiors, whether to the Ceann Comhhairle of Dáil Éireann or to the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1954, he became Clerk of the Seanad and in that capacity many members here met him and learned to <Col N="791" /> appreciate his easy manner and his helpfulness.  On the death of the Clerk of the Dáil, Mort Ó Conaill, Mr. O'Dwyer's talents and record of service were such that he was recommended by the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister for Finance to the Taoiseach for appointment as Clerk of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Dwyer was an example of the good public servant, hardworking, alert, efficient and whole-heartedly devoted to the work of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I would ask you, Sir, to have an expression of our regret recorded in the Journal of the House and to convey to his widow and family the sympathy of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>When the House adjourned last night, I was referring to the Minister's speech and to the Government's call for the participation of all citizens in the solution of the situation which confronts the nation at the moment.  The Taoiseach, speaking in Cork yesterday, stressed the seriousness of the situation and the need for the co-operation of the people as a whole in order to solve our problems.  That was the theme I was debating when the House adjourned last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One speaker yesterday evening painted a very optimistic picture of the financial situation.  Naturally, we are always very glad to be treated to a little optimism, but I venture to suggest that at the present time it is <Col N="792" /> much more important that we should hearken to the Minister for Finance, who speaks on behalf of the Government and with full responsibility for what he says.  It is all very well to be optimistic at the right time and in the right place; at the moment I do not think there is any reason for over-optimism until such time as we are a little further out of the wood.</P>
    <P>That being so, I propose now to make a contribution to this debate to-day which may be slightly unusual inasmuch as one very seldom hears the side of business and industry, and the creation of capital coupled with the task of producing those goods and services for which the Minister calls. I make one appeal: I ask that anything I say here to-day will be received as a constructive effort divorced from any semblance of an attempt to hurt or harm anybody.  I ask that anything I say be taken in that spirit.</P>
    <P>Before the House adjourned last night, I said that I was glad to see that the Government was itself giving a lead in the present situation; the Minister has promised to cut down State expenditure this year by approximately £5,000,000&mdash;perhaps more.  We all know that practice is better than precept and this is the right sort of lead to have from the Government, a Government which is asking the citizens to follow suit, each in his own particular way.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last night that a number of citizens have already given some indications that they do not seem to think that anything is called for from them in particular.  There is the idea that the problem is one for somebody else and already some groups are laying down impossible and unrealistic conditions precedent to their participation in the national effort.  For example, public statements have been made since this situation arose by trade union leaders stipulating that, unless the Government controls prices and profits&mdash;we all know that both prices and profits are already controlled by several Government bodies&mdash;there will be no relaxation of wage demands.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="793" /> Sometimes it seems to me that the least co-operation with the Government's efforts and the most criticism of the Government comes from certain persons who are nominally supposed to be supporters of the Government. Speaking in the Dáil at column 1604 of Volume 159 the Minister for Finance said, and he also said it here yesterday when introducing this Bill:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Another round of increases in money incomes on top of those gained last year would be certain to price many of our products completely out of foreign markets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a direction from the Minister for Finance on the subject of wage increases.  Now, in order to justify wage demands almost in advance, certain individuals to whom I have referred are already charging the Government with not keeping down the cost of living.  It is clear to many people that, apart from outside causes over which the Government has no control, wages are the direct domestic cause of higher prices; in many cases, they are the only cause. The implications in these charges, therefore, is that it is profits that are responsible for higher prices.  The fact is that profits are dangerously low in this country.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, there is a lot of talk about profits but we never hear about the companies which make no profits and which never pay dividends to the shareholders from one year to another. As I mentioned before, I myself and friends of mine had the unhappy experience of investing quite large sums of money in Irish industry which were lost completely.  Not a single penny was got by way of a return on them.</P>
    <P>Profits in this country are dangerously low and, as a consequence, sufficient capital is not being built up or attracted to our economy.  Again, I want to mention the Ibec Report because this report was commissioned by our own Government.  We ought to have regard to it.  On this very matter of profits, the Ibec Report says on page 84, paragraph 2:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Profits from manufacturing enterprises in Ireland in general <Col N="794" /> have not been sufficiently high to attract domestic private investment upon a scale consistent with a vigorous industrial development in its initial stages, or to encourage the thorough modernisation of existing equipment needed to make Irish manufacturing genuinely competitive.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The profits have not been sufficiently high here to attract capital.  That fact is referred to in the Ibec Report.  Yet in spite of that, some elements are still proposing more restrictions, more taxation and more penalties of all kinds on industry and capital.  The main reason I refer to this and that the Minister is asking for more production, both in agriculture and in industry, as a solution of our balance of payments problem and, in fact, of our whole inflationary situation.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand the mentality of some elements in Labour which continuously and consistently attempt to damage, discourage and discredit industry&mdash;the very industry upon which they depend for their livelihood and prosperity, the very industry which the community needs so badly.  They are like people who are continually boring holes in the bottom of the ship in which they travel.  Proposals to tax industry and profits are made in an attempt to justify wage demands. Rather than weaken the source of employment, would it not be far wiser for Labour in the long run to help build up a strong and healthy industry from which high wages could be justifiably expected and demanded rather than try to drag down the machine upon which they are depending for a living?</P>
    <P>We will never get more production from industry and we will never get more money invested when an atmosphere which is antagonistic to profits prevails.  When the Tánaiste went to U.S.A. last year, he found it necessary to stress the advantages and profits that would be available to American capital, if invested in Ireland.  I fear that American businessmen will need more than words to convince them that this country offers a fair return for capital invested, especially in face of the Ibec Report which is the first thing <Col N="795" /> that anybody who is going to invest money here will read.</P>
    <P>How different is the outlook of American Labour which, while demanding the highest wages and best conditions of employment in the world, at the same time advocates and assists in every way in the making of high profits consistent with good value.  I have heard the representatives of American Labour speak at the I.L.O. in Geneva.  They know that it is only from good profits that good industries can be built which will produce good goods in large quantities.  They know that those industries will pay the highest wages and give the highest standard of living to all concerned.</P>
    <P>That is an enlightened outlook.  In other words, build up the machine you are travelling in, provided always that it is not done at the expense of the community.  That can be achieved. These misconceived anti-profits attacks will sabotage our whole industrial economy and national prosperity in the future.  It is not surprising that there has been little or no response from American capital to the appeal by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who invited American businessmen to invest their money in Ireland, when American businessmen know that Irish Labour leaders condemn and resist good profits, regardless of whether they are made through efficiency or profiteering.</P>
    <P>The issues are confused.  The Ibec Report also points out that.  There seems to be an idea that there is something immoral in the making of good profits.  That, of course, is wrong. Very often the best profits are made by the most efficient industry which gives the best value to the public.  Very often an industry making no profits gives very bad service and is really a menace to the community, since it also gives very bad conditions in regard to employment.</P>
    <P>An Irish Labour Minister for Industry and Commerce was, in fact, an ideal ambassador for us to send to the United States in the hope of getting capital for investment here, but I cannot help feeling that it was his <Col N="796" /> own adherents who did not give him the right goods to sell.  That is what happened.  It would be a very good idea for workers here to invest their own savings in industry and commerce, including the banks&mdash;savings out of their own weekly pay packets and not, as is often advocated by some social thinkers, shares allocated to them for which they do not pay any real money, because, if they pay their money for their shares, money which they have saved in the hard way, they will realise the money value of these shares and how hard it was to find the money originally to start all companies and banks as well.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the funds of trade unions similarly invested.  There would then be an appreciation of the need for profits and a realisation of the inadequacy of present-day profits as a reward for savings invested in Ireland. There would also be an appreciation of who really owns businesses and banks and who finances both industries and banks in the country.  This would in turn bring about the realisation that such institutions are private property and, as such, are not available to be controlled, used and abused at the behest of the State, as is often advocated.</P>
    <P>We do not want our whole industrial economy to be like that of C.I.E. If C.I.E. were a profit-making concern, it would provide good and safe employment. Somebody said yesterday that it would not give good, safe, employment.  At present it is a profitless company providing uncertain employment.  It should give fixed steady employment without requiring all sorts of legislation to ensure its existence.  Surely we do not want an economy like that?</P>
    <P>It is often stated that private enterprise failed in regard to C.I.E. and that C.I.E. had to be taken over.  It did not fail.  When the G.S.R. was taken over originally, I made a speech on the subject, and pointed out that, private enterprise was never allowed to work since 1914 and the railways were practically taken over by the Government and a railway tribunal set up.  Ever since that time, economic laws were not allowed to work on the <Col N="797" /> railways.  The railways were not allowed to translate their costs into prices.  We would have nothing but C.I.E.s in the country if some of these people got their way.</P>
    <P>Private enterprise starved of capital could not be a success at present.  All the capital is going to State bodies and there is practically none left for private enterprise.  There is too high taxation and the profits are too low. How could a private enterprise economy work on no capital, too high taxes and low profits?  The only way you can build up capital is out of profits and there is no provision made in our taxation laws to allow anybody to build up capital because every liquid penny that any company has in hands is taken either by the collector of taxes or in wages.  As I said, the same tactics that broke C.I.E. and destroyed private enterprise in C.I.E. can very well do the same in the little degree of private enterprise which we have in this country.</P>
    <P>In the present situation, we are also being told that, no matter how difficult times are, the standard of living must be maintained.  One would think that all one had to do was to say: &ldquo;The standard of living must be maintained&rdquo; and that it could be done by magic.  It cannot.  That is a very laudable and desirable aim and wish and one that is not confined to any one section of the community.  There is no section of the community that does not want to maintain their standards of living and to increase them and to make them better, if possible. In fact, that is what the Government itself is trying to do to-day and is determined to do by the very action that is being taken at the moment.  It is to restore our economy and to maintain our standards of living and to improve them.  That will not be done for the State as a whole if only one group of the community are to keep all the best living standards for themselves, regardless of other elements in the community.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there is also prevalent throughout the country a kind of idea on this point that the situation has nothing to do with certain people.  They have an idea that everything can be <Col N="798" /> solved in one of three ways.  First, the banks&mdash;some people think that the solution to everything is in the banks. Others think there is a solution in the external assets that are always there and that will bolster us up, for ever in fact, and finally, that industry and commerce and business can absorb all sorts of costs and all sorts of impositions and still carry the baby and pay taxation and keep the whole thing going.</P>
    <P>As I happen to be a director of a bank, I do not want to say anything here to-day as regards the banks that would seem to be using either inside knowledge or my position, but I do think that certain things should be said and, therefore, I shall avail of the Minister's own remarks in regard to the banks to show that the banks cannot be relied upon to get us out of our troubles to-day.  They have already done their utmost in the matter and they have been left in a very difficult position.</P>
    <P>The Minister in Volume 159, No. 10, column 1600 of the Dáil Debates, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not, I think, appreciated that, as a direct consequence of the balance of payments deficit, the commercial banks have lost nearly £50,000,000, or two-fifths, of their net external assets since January, 1955. It is essential, therefore, that any further sales of sterling securities, whether by departmental funds or by the banking system, in order to finance public capital outlay, should be avoided or at least kept to a minimum.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At column 1604, of the same Volume, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While there has been some increase in small savings, deposits with the commercial banks have continued to fall.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, you have the position at the moment that the external assets of the commercial banks have fallen by £50,000,000, that the deposits are falling&mdash;and these are the stock-in-trade of the banks&mdash;and, therefore, the position of the banks is deteriorating all the time.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the Minister also mentioned <Col N="799" /> in the Dáil the other day, in reply to Deputy MacBride, that the banks' investment in Ireland now has reached 70 per cent.  So, if the banks have 70 per cent. invested in Ireland and their deposits are falling and their external assets have fallen by £50,000,000, we cannot look to the banks for any more help in this situation. I might add that it is frequently forgotten and not realised that the Irish commercial banks are privately-owned companies.  They are owned by thousands of shareholders, big and small, communities and bodies of all kinds, institutions and small individuals. I happen to know that the vast majority are in the last category, that is, they are mostly small people holding small numbers of shares.  In fact, anybody who examines the shares list of the Irish banks will be astonished to see how small the holdings are.</P>
    <P>In the same way, the deposits in the banks are all the resources of small people, religious communities, institutions and individuals, and they run into many, many hundreds of thousands of people.  So that, on the one hand, the owners of the banks are small people, holding in large numbers, and the deposits, that is, the stock of the banks, are held also by a similar kind of people.  Therefore, for the State to do anything with the banks or to interfere with them in any way would really be raiding private property just the same as a house or any other property.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the moral aspect of getting tough with the banks, it is most dangerous that there should be any talk like that because it can only result in frightening off depositors and, if depositors are frightened off and the banks are left short of deposits, the whole banking system, upon which we depend so much, can collapse.</P>
    <P>As regards the assets, which some people seem to think we can lean on so heavily and for so long, the Minister, at column 1600, Volume 159, No. 10, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...most of these holdings (of external assets) belong to private individuals and institutions and are no more available for public capital <Col N="800" /> purposes or for covering balance of payments deficits than houses or other private property.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Unless we turn ourselves into a communist or, at least, a very advanced socialist State, we have no right or reason to confiscate the property of private citizens to solve our public problems.  The Minister was quite right when he said that many people believed that this situation would right itself.  I might add that many people believe it can right itself without any effort on their part and, in some cases, in spite of their determination to avoid shouldering their fair share of the burden and, even at the present time, we still have people calling out for higher expenditure on social services, higher capital outlay and more impositions on this, that and the other. Somebody mentioned a capital levy on incomes of £500 and £700 a year.  It sounds like somebody living in Cuckooland.</P>
    <P>Year after year, in this debate, I have almost become boring on the subject of stressing the necessity for a national basic policy on the creation of wealth and a strong economy on which to build the prosperity of our country.  I was looking at the Ibec Report again last night and it also makes this very point, that we seem to have no long-term policy or no long-term philosophy as to whether we are a socialist or a private enterprise State.  One says we are the one and the other says we are the other, and we do not seem to know where we are going.  The policy that has been pursued year after year of taking 6d. off the income-tax and putting 6d. back on the income-tax, of having investigations into prices here, there and everywhere, is not a policy.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest that we are confused in other ways.  We have very strong nationalism here and a very strong degree of a sort of socialism and socialist thinking.  On the one hand, the nationalist streak is very much against the importation of foreigners or foreign capital or anything into the country.  I suggest that that is wrong, that while we must protect our nationals to the full, we should be always open, ready and <Col N="801" /> willing to bring foreigners in, for the know-how and for what they can give us and for their money, because we will never be able to have enough money to develop the country as we should, quickly enough anyway.  On the other hand, we have the socialist mentality, a sort of envious mentality, which is prevalent in the country and which is preventing our own nationals from setting up and becoming strong and rich.  Between the nationalists preventing people coming in and helping us and the socialists inside preventing our own people from becoming strong, we are between the devil and the deep blue sea.</P>
    <P>We had a great opportunity of developing when we got self-government here after the Treaty.  We all thought, in the Sinn Féin days, that we could develop something in Ireland that nobody ever saw before.  Our idealists believed that we could develop an economy here that would be in conformity with our national philosophy and our Christian philosophy and our own particular needs.  Unfortunately, it is only true to say that we have built up an economy that really consists of secondhand ideas from all over the world, particularly from England, with very little philosophy of our own apparent, economic or any other.</P>
    <P>Critics of the inter-Party Government assert it is impossible to build up a satisfactory philosophy and a satisfactory economy with a Government composed of such mixed and diverse elements as those which compose this Government.  This is particularly thought by the Labour side.  They say: &ldquo;How can you build with Fine Gael?&rdquo;  On the other hand, certain supporters of Fine Gael feel: &ldquo;How can you do it with Labour included?&rdquo; I think that is wrong.  I believe that, from a Government composed of all elements of the community, we can get something solid and strong and lasting.  If we could get such a thing within a Government, it would not be subject to the stresses and strains of a policy devised and set up by a strong party of one particular school of thought.  I think such a thing could <Col N="802" /> be done and that the Labour Ministers in this Government are in a position in which Labour may not find themselves again for a long time to come.</P>
    <P>There is a wonderful opportunity for the Labour Party to sit down and work out a form of philosophy which will take into consideration the really deep problems of the nation in building up capital strength and money, and not influenced by the misguided ideas of socialists in other countries.  I have met many people in the Labour movement, both in this country and abroad, and publicly and privately.  Speaking to them privately, they are sensible about profits and so forth, but, when talking <i>en masse</i>, there seems to be a mass hysteria which follows Labour and socialists in other countries.  I suggest that Ireland could build up a Labour Party that would be fully Labour in every possible way and have a sense of responsibility to our new economy in the light of our needs.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes forgotten by the critics that there are four Labour Ministers in this Government.  Anything said by the Minister for Finance in his speech in this debate is also their voice.  It is not a Fine Gael or a Farmers' voice; it is an inter-Party voice in which they are just as committed as anybody else.  In loyalty to the pledge given when this Government was set up, it is only right that they should back up the Minister for Finance in everything he is asking for on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The Government has very clearly stated through the Minister&mdash;and the Taoiseach reinforced it, as did other Ministers&mdash;that our very existence as a State depends upon our building up savings in every possible way and by every citizen.  It is from earnings that we can make our savings and it must be from work well done that we receive our earnings and profits.  We want better work, better earnings, better profits and better savings.  That should be a national slogan now and always and, in it, everybody is catered for. To achieve these objects, it must be made profitable and admirable to save. It must be recognised that those who work hard and save are more <Col N="803" /> important than those who talk and spend.  The concern of our public men in the future and of politicians and statesment must be for the thrifty and hard-working citizens.  The voices of the thriftless are still to be heard loud and strong calling for the moon from the State.  They must not be needed, I suggest.  In future, rather must we cater for the hard-working and saving citizens upon whom our whole prosperity depends.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made the position which faces us clear.  He pointed out the road we should follow in order to put ourselves in the position of attaining prosperity for our country.  I suggest that everybody should read and not only read but digest and act upon the request and admonitions of the Minister. What we need in this country is efficiency and hard work in agriculture and industry, coupled with savings all round&mdash;in a word, production and saving.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a very long discussion on these two Bills and my contribution will be brief.  However, I feel obliged to offer one or two comments on what we have been debating.</P>
      <P>Unlike some of the previous speakers, I do not think the Minister either expects or desires to be congratulated on what he has been obliged to do so far as the introduction of the measures which we have been debating for the past two days is concerned. Certainly he is to be complimented on taking these steps in the light of the circumstances which face us.  I have not the slightest doubt in the world that he should be fully and earnestly supported in his consistent and determined effort to grapple with the present serious position in which we find the economics of our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say also that I do not share the convictions expressed by some speakers that the imposition of these new import levies will, of itself, be sufficient to secure the necessary redress of our adverse balance of trade.  I rather share the views and some of the fears that have been voiced by some Senators, particularly <Col N="804" /> Senator O'Brien and Senator O' Buachalla, that the very measures to which we are compelled to resort in this legislation may of themselves create even more serious problems for us here by way either of increased prices or unemployment, or even a deterioration of conditions in the economy of our country within the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The Minister admitted that these measures will undoubtedly reduce the real value of personal incomes and will inevitably result at least in a temporary reduction in our existing standard of living.  He warns us, too&mdash; I think, quite rightly&mdash;that these measures will be rendered absolutely useless if there is any appreciable movement to secure or seek compensation for that reduction by way of a higher level of either wages or salaries. I suggest, despite what the previous speaker has said, that inevitably the same result will flow from any tendency towards a higher margin of profit in industry generally or on the part of those who control the normal means either of production or distribution within the country.</P>
    <P>For that very reason, I was rather shocked to hear it suggested here last evening that the distributors of imported goods&mdash;goods which will now be subjected to these levies&mdash;should be entitled to charge a profit margin calculated on the import cost of these goods and, in addition, on the rate of import levy charged on these goods when they come into the country.  That seems to me to postulate a fantastic theory.  I suggest that, if there is any substance whatever behind that suggestion, a very grave responsibility will rest on the Government to make absolutely certain that these new levies will not be used to provide an additional source of profit for just one section of the community.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that, if there is any substance behind that suggestion, the Government should take steps immediately to freeze all existing prices of commodities subject to these levies.  That has been done in more countries than one and we ought to take serious notice of what is happening outside our own shores and <Col N="805" /> what people are trying to do elsewhere to deal with the same problem.  Certainly there should be some prohibition on any attempt to increase prices at least until such time as there has been a prior examination by some competent authority like the Prices Advisory Body as to whether increases would or could be justified.  The Government should also take steps to convince the people generally that these levies are necessary, and no more effective means of convincing the people that there is no other way out would be to see that the actual amount of levy charged on these imports from here on is actually shown, together with the actual price of the commodity when it is being retailed.</P>
    <P>While it may be necessary to take these measures in dealing with imported goods, something like the same type of prohibition against increased prices should be imposed on home produced commodities.  While goods coming into the country have a heavy rate of duty on them, the temptation will remain for those inside the country to take advantage of that position in respect of goods manufactured here and to increase their prices, if for no other reason than the scarcity that will arise from the imposition of these levies.  I suggest that this is a matter which needs very careful study and very definite action from the Government.</P>
    <P>It is, to my mind, a very reasonable contention that, if wage and salary earners in all industries are expected to exercise restraint in their demands, either for improved conditions or even for the maintenance of their present conditions, that class in the community are entitled to a specific assurance that the sacrifices expected of them will be shared by other sections of the community, including distributors of imported goods, or, for that matter, producers and distributors of home-manufactured goods.  I would go so far as to say that, if such an assurance is not forthcoming in respect of the people generally, then I fear we shall face an even worse disaster than anything this country has experienced so far.  I cannot see wage or salary earners, or any other section of the <Col N="806" /> community being content to accept a reduced standard of living, while other sections of the community are to be permitted, if they are to be permitted, to go on merrily making more and more profits, either from production or distribution.</P>
    <P>Turning to the wider and more general aspects of the situation we have been discussing, I should like to remind the House that during the debate on the Finance Bill, I made a specific allusion to the export from Ireland every year of a sum of roughly £10,000,000 by way of insurance premiums.  At a time like the present, I may perhaps be pardoned for referring to that aspect of our economy again, and I should like to urge the Minister in the immediate or near future, to have a closer look at the conditions in which that specific amount of money is being sent out of the country every year.  Without going into any great detail about it, I should like to point out that its use is lost to this country not alone for one year but for a very long period of years.  I submit that there is something faulty or missing in a system which permits that type of thing to go unchecked.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion I should like to advance for the Minister's consideration, with a view perhaps to helping generally in the present situation, is in connection with the fact that we have not here at home any facilities for what is known in the insurance business as a re-insurance pool.  There must be a very substantial amount of money leaving the country every year for re-insurance abroad and, unless I am very much mistaken, I think there was provision made under the 1936 Insurance Act for the setting up inside the country of a re-insurance pool of our own.  I submit that in the present circumstances it might be opportune and timely to examine the practicability or otherwise of setting up some type of permanent re-insurance pool at home.  It would enable us to make a satisfactory contribution towards correcting any adverse trend in our balance of payments.  I may say of course I do not expect the Minister to deal now, any more than I did during the debate on the Finance Bill, in any <Col N="807" /> great detail with any of these suggestions I have made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be glad to hear what the Minister has to say.  I know many of the people engaged in the industry would like to be satisfied that this aspect of their problem was being dealt with.  Finally, I should like to compliment the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the appeal which he voiced, I think, in the Dáil some weeks ago and which he repeated in Cork last night for something in the nature of a political truce&mdash;I think that was how he described it&mdash;between all Parties and all sections of the community, so that the community generally as a nation, together and united, could face up to the realities of the present situation and seek practical means of dealing with it.  The Tánaiste and the Government are entitled to the fullest support of all sensible and responsible citizens and they are entitled not alone to our congratulations, but to our complete co-operation in dealing with the present problems which undoubtedly are very serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterLynch" hpid="Mr. P. Lynch Mr. P. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with the Minister and the speakers on the other side of the House that the principal and biggest drive for increased production must come from agriculture, but the experiences of the farmer have made him a very discouraged person because of the uncertain conditions prevailing in agriculture.  He sees that everything he buys has been increased in price, while the prices of the things he has to sell have fallen.  For his wheat he gets a lower price than he did a year ago, although he must pay higher wages to his labourers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does anyone think that is a true way to set about getting higher production from the soil?  I often think of the many wrongs that were done to the Irish farmers, but the greatest wrong <Col N="808" /> ever imposed on them was that of appointing to the job of Minister for Agriculture a man who has no love for anything that is Irish and who has always so proclaimed himself.</P>
    <P>The problem of unemployment is a very serious one at the present time. Having a knowledge of the congested areas of Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon, I know that in the past year and a half, many small land owners on the sides of mountains have been forced to lock up their houses and leave.  Large tracts of mountain sides have been cleared of these people; the people are gone and the land is waste.</P>
    <P>To add to the farmers' difficulties, the Minister for Finance this year robbed the Road Fund of £500,000 which would give occasional employment to many of the people living in the poorer districts.  Local grants will now be reduced with a resultant loss of employment.  How can the Labour Party, and the other members of the Government who claim to represent that class of people, remain quiet and silent while those difficulties are inflicted on the small farmers and the labouring people of the congested districts?</P>
    <P>We have been asked to stay quiet now because of the mess the Government have got the country into. Senator L'Estrange would like us to have gone down to Cork to support the members of the Government, to slap them on the back for the stand they have taken to clear up the mess in which they find themselves.  We are asked now to forget the attitude of those people from 1951 to 1954 when we had them going through the streets of Dublin with a row of pitchforks and the Minister for Finance going round the country with a packet of cigarettes talking about the taxes.  We are to forget those things now and help the Government to clap themselves on the back because of the mess they got themselves into.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Government to talk; many of them do not know the sufferings and the unemployment that exist throughout the country.  They will not go out now and ask the unemployed of Dublin to throw themselves on the streets opposite Leinster House, although there is more <Col N="809" /> unemployment now than there was then.  There is more destitution in Dublin now than there was from 1951 to 1954 when the present Government were carrying on the dishonest campaign against the Government of that time.  I hope the people will forget that dishonest campaign and give the extra production the Government is asking for to get the country out of this mess.</P>

      <P>Firstly, I should like to congratulate the Minister on the able and lucid statement he gave in the Dáil when introducing the Estimate for his Department.  I agree with Senator McGuire that it would be an excellent thing if everyone in the country interested himself in that statement. A limited number do recognise the dangers of the situation, but there are a large number who do not.  If they read that statement, they would appreciate the difficulties and the dangers in which we find ourselves and I feel sure they would do their best to assist us out of that position.  I think the present situation was probably inevitable.  It had to occur at some stage, and I must sympathise with the Minister that he happened to be in office when the crisis arose.  As far as I am personally concerned, I am delighted to see that he is there.  I am afraid that is a contradiction, but I do think that he is an excellent person for the job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of wearying the Seanad, I should like to refer briefly to the balance of trade figures over the past 23 years, which I shall divide into three periods.  Perhaps 23 years is too long a period because I believe that in pre-war years there were no official accounts kept.  Taking the first period before the war, it is, I think, the general impression that the balance of payments was adverse. There is, I think, support for this view because the banks' sterling surplus fell by £3,000,000 per annum from 1933 to 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next period is, of course, the war period, which lasted from 1940 to <Col N="810" /> 1946.  The trend was exactly the reverse during that period, and we accumulated a total balance of £162,000,000, an average of £23,000,000 per annum.  The reasons are obvious. Our agricultural exports continued, though probably at a reduced scale.  On the other hand, imports were virtually unobtainable and the surplus was forced on us, whether we liked it or not.</P>
    <P>The next period was the nine years period following 1946.  During that period, our adverse balance has been £208,000,000.  That is an average of £23,000,000 a year.  It is a strange coincidence that while we were in our heyday we accumulated exactly that sum of £23,000,000 a year of favourable yearly balances.  The reasons for the adverse balance since the war are various.  I think the first effect after the war was that, since imports had been unobtainable for a number of years, there was naturally a rush to acquire them when they became available. There were also schemes which had been made impossible during the war.</P>
    <P>Another factor which influenced the position was that, shortly after the end of the war, the so-called social welfare state was introduced in England.  That had the effect of increasing the standard of living.  Individual savings, which earlier had to be contributed to provide for illness, pensions and so forth, were released and were available to the individuals to purchase other things, consequently improving the standard of living.  We here, because of our proximity to England, because of the common language, because of emigration, tried to maintain a standard which was approximately the same as that in England.  As a matter of interest, I looked up the figures and found from the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> for 1955 that, in 1954, 857,000 people travelled to Britain from here and that 822,000 returned.  It is clear that we have always a large number of people in this country who are fully aware of conditions in England.</P>
    <P>I think further factors were emigration, the measure of unemployment and the natural desire to raise the standard of living which led to the expenditure <Col N="811" /> of a certain amount of capital on certain things which, by themselves, were not immediately productive, such as houses and hospitals. Those are two examples and there are others which one could think of.  The effect, of course, of this was that we placed a further strain on the balance of payments.  Had we not been in the sterling area, our currency would have been under pressure and the red light would have been showing. We have got a barometer and that barometer is the banks' surplus sterling assets.  Since 1947, I am afraid, it has shown a downward trend, although it did show two upward movements. Since the Spring of 1955, the barometer has fallen down practically in a straight line.  Now I am afraid it is standing at &ldquo;stormy&rdquo;.  The effect on our sterling assets is that we are now reduced to the position where they are slightly higher than they were pre-war. The pre-war purchasing power, however, was greater than it is to-day. Relatively, I might say our position is worse than it was in 1939.</P>
    <P>I am sorry for worrying the Seanad with this account of the past and I wish I could suggest a cure for the present position.  Naturally I agree that an increase in production is necessary, but, on the other hand, I feel that we will not get any material increase for some considerable time. I think the measures which the Minister has taken should materially assist the position not only in regard to revenue expenditure, but also in regard to capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to remind the Seanad that when I was speaking here before, I mentioned that I thought that we as a poor country were trying to maintain a higher standard of living than we could afford.  I am afraid that we will have to be prepared to accept a lower standard of living before we emerge from our present position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance said in this House in Volume 46 column 366 of the Official Reports:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In regard to the economic situation in general, Senator Walsh, I noted yesterday, said that I had <Col N="812" /> delayed far too long in dealing with that situation.  Other Senators on that side of the House complained violently about the method with which I had dealt with it, and that I had been much too severe. Senator Hawkins, I think, particularly took that line.  It would be very much easier for the country to understand where Senators on the other side of the House stood if they would deal with the matter with a united voice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>After listening to contributions made by Senator McGuire and Senator Murphy, I can well imagine the diversity of opinions, even though they are on the Minister's side of the House.  Senator McGuire mentioned to-day the question of C.I.E. and the financial position which existed more than 30 years ago.  I suggest that no comparison can be made between the position 30 years ago and the position which obtains to-day, in view of the fact that practically no transport competition existed in those days, as against the very severe transport competition, from private haulage and private cars, which exists to-day.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator McGuire, however, that if semi-Government Departments are competing against private industry, they are doing so unfairly. The private individual has to pay substantial death duties, income-tax and surtax and the income from these duties is partly used for social welfare purposes and for subsidising the industries which are competing against them.  This is the position as far as Gaeltarra Éireann is concerned.  They are producing against private enterprise. Recently I, as an executor, have had to pay death duties which amounted to well over £20,000.  Most of that money came out of a private family business and the effect on that business will be extremely severe.  It will reduce their capital to such an extent that it will be very difficult for them to carry on.  Senator Crosbie has already referred to that type of thing in another debate.</P>
    <P>I think it was unfortunate that only public companies were entitled to the concessions which the Minister allowed in his Budget.  I do not quite understand <Col N="813" /> why the Minister was not in a position to give that advantage to private industries.  The profit motive is undoubtedly one of the greatest methods of getting efficiency, getting hard work and getting returns, and I would respectfully suggest that it is on private economy that the future of this State must rest.  We all know that there is an extraordinary amount of waste in connection with any semi-Government industry.  The Administration must be indicated for its failure to take timely and effective steps to head off the economic difficulties in which we are now placed.  These difficulties have been threatening us for some years past and have now overtaken us. Steps should have been taken earlier to organise production.  There are many industries which would be able to supply, from the home sources, many of the items which now appear on the import list and which are adding to our economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister asked Senator Ó Buachalla what type of commercial industries he had in mind. I think the previous Coalition Government planned too much for the production of electricity from oil and coal and that the result is that our bogs are not being allowed to be developed to the extent to which it was previously intended, owing to the fact that the demand for electricity has not come up to the level which the E.S.B. and the Ministers at the time had anticipated.</P>

      <P>I fail to see how it can be much cheaper.  I understood that water was cheaper and came before <Col N="814" /> coal.  At any rate, I think the Government have failed to put forward any scheme or plan by which the standard of living of the people may soon be brought back to a reasonable level and confidence restored in trade, industry and finance.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy referred yesterday to the fact that we still have £500,000,000 in foreign assets.  Senator Murphy is an excellent man with statistics, but I did not hear him state how that £500,000,000 was made up. He certainly did not refer to the fact that over two-thirds of that is in liabilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree he did state the liabilities but the attention of the House was not drawn to that.  I am merely complaining that, when he gave these figures, he should have given the other figures also.  The Minister stated in answer to a parliamentary question, as reported in Volume 159, column 1583 that the net amount the commercial banks had invested abroad was £75,000,000, while the total assets were £281,000,000 and that there was a sum of £150,000,000 invested in this country. For that reason, and because of the fact that the Central Bank has apparently only £70,000,000 invested abroad, it is difficult to see how the extra amount was made up.  I realise that individuals have a considerable amount of money invested in various commercial concerns and I can see the extraordinary difficulty any Government would have in taking control of all those assets and having them brought back, but I doubt very much if they would realise anything like the difference required to make up the amount of £500,000,000 to which Senator Murphy referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that the levies introduced by the Minister in March last have not had the desired effect.  The <Col N="815" /> Minister has admitted it and many Senators have admitted it during the course of this debate.  It is, therefore, necessary, in my opinion&mdash;as the Minister has quite rightly done&mdash;to impose further restrictions to discourage imports of non-essential, consumable goods, particularly in view of the balance of trade position as shown over the past six months.  We cannot continue to import practically twice the amount of goods we are exporting at the present time.  To retrieve, however, the enviable position in which we were placed in 1954 when our deficit of payments was brought down to £5,500,000, a greater amount of saving and more efficient and better production are necessary.  This is particularly so when we compare our output from both land and industry with that of other countries throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in this House on 28th June last, as reported in Volume 46, column 367, that the problem which Deputy MacEntee had to deal with in 1951 when he took over again the Department of Finance was even worse than the problem which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That was the case because the adverse trade balance, as the Minister was aware, in 1951 was £61.6 million.  It was £30.2 million in 1950, and to have brought down the figure to £8.9 million in 1952, to £7,000,000 in 1953 and to £5.5 million in 1954 was certainly no mean achievement.

      <P>In the Dáil.  I feel, however, that the Minister has made an honest appraisal of the position and it is to be deplored that other Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries have not been so candid in their public statements.  The Minister for Finance said that our economic independence is at stake and our resources which represent the forced savings of two world wars have been largely wasted. This is set out in the Dáil Debates, Volume 159, column 1592.  Furthermore, he said that, without a radical change, we cannot enjoy much longer the artificial standards to which we have become accustomed since the external reserves to which we owe these standards are steadily running out.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that members of the Coalition Parties, when they were campaigning in 1954, did not accept this economic principle.  The electorate were then advised to vote Fine Gael for reduced prices, reduced taxation and a better standard of living.  Have these better times now arrived?  The Labour Party promised they would not increase the tax on imported commodities, such as tobacco; they promised that there would be no increase.  The fact that in the last four by-elections which have been fought since the general election there has been an overall majority of over 1,500 against the Coalition Government surely indicates that the people have become disillusioned.  As long as expenditure could be financed from public borrowing, the Government did not require to worry unduly, but now that it is apparently impossible to find the necessary money for all capital development, the public must be informed that the end of the road has been reached.  They must be told the true position.  We have to pay now for the improvidence of past years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> The gross charges for debt services have been doubled over the past five years and the increased yield from taxes for the current year is estimated at £5.3 million.  This does not include the income from the levies, which would amount to about an extra £5,000,000.  Deputy MacBride in the debate in the Dáil on 26th July last referred to the fact that the Central Bank now had £70,000,000 invested in Great Britain.  It is not inopportune to point out that, in March, 1948, the total amount which the Central Bank had invested abroad was £43,900,000 and that in the third year of the Coalition Government, these assets invested abroad amounted to £80,600,000.</P>
    <P>Is is not a fact that on 11th June, 1948, the Coalition Government decided they would not seek Marshall Aid?  However, six members of the Government crossed to London a few days afterwards and, following a meeting with the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, it was decided that the Government should apply for 128,200,000 dollars.  Deputy MacBride was a member of the deputation which crossed to London at that time.  These dollars were sold to the Bank of England for sterling.  Reference was made to the expenditure of this Marshall Aid Loan by the Fianna Fáil Government.  The Coalition Government spent £1,000,000 per month for 18 months before they left office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister will remember that all these capital projects were approved by the previous Government and incorporated in Deputy McGilligan's Budget statement of 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present financial position is certainly <Col N="819" /> difficult, but if the people face up to it with fortitude, under wise and able leadership, and with the courage and resolution which sustained them during the perils and hardships of the emergency years, I believe we will pull through.  However, sacrifices will require to be made by all of us.  If selfish interests, as Senator McGuire has already suggested, are to predominate, then the future is a grim one.  If more organised sections of the community are to take more out of the national pool, then other sections will have to take less and our exports will be still further reduced, with dreadful consequences to all of us.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already referred to the increased costs of goods for export, and the further we increase those costs, the less chance we have of selling those goods in the world market. High import levies, restrictions on trade, increased taxation, a rising cost of living, deterioration in markets, serious balances in trade, serious balances of payments, high unemployment, a high rate of emigration with a falling population, low agricultural output, low savings and a practically non-existent production&mdash;these certainly constitute a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire referred already to high interest rates and the little incentive in the form of reasonable rates on capital in many sections of our industry and commerce and to the dissatisfied dairying and agricultural community.  Import levies in themselves, as Senator Crowley stated, will not prove an effective solution to our problem.  Senator Murphy referred last night to the rather high amount being spent per mile on roads.  I should like to point out to Senator Murphy that most of that money is coming from the motorist in the form of road tax.</P>

      <P>In my county only one-third is being provided by the ratepayers. Senator Murphy should remember the fact that the buses and the railway lorries, which are fast-moving, <Col N="820" /> heavy traffic, are responsible for a fair amount of deterioration in the roads, particularly in county roads on bog foundations.</P>
      <P>I should also like to refer to the fact that the wages of road workers have increased in at least the same proportion as the increase in expenditure referred to by the Senator.  The Senator stated it was 3¼ per annum. I would refer the Senator to the fact that, in 1938, the road workers' wages in Donegal and many other counties was 26/- per week and in some counties it was 28/-.  In 1939, it was 30/-, and the road workers' wages in Donegal to-day is £5 per week.  In addition, an application is at present being considered by the Labour Court for a further 15/- or £1 on those wages.  I think the Senator will agree that the wages are not out of proportion with the expenditure on roads.</P>
      <P>The Senator should also remember that the cost of tar and the cost of machinery has probably increased in the same proportion.</P>

I would refer Senator Murphy to the fact that in a considerable portion of my county there is no railway and ratepayers and taxpayers have now to keep the roads substituted for the permanent rail line that formerly existed.</P>

      <P>If the Chair would allow me, on a point of order?  I have <Col N="821" /> the reference for which the Senator was looking earlier.  It is the Seanad; not the Dáil.  It is at column 366 of volume 46:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I certainly mentioned in the other House but I cannot remember whether I mentioned it before in this House, that we might make a comparison with what Deputy MacEntee as Minister for Finance suggested was his problem in 1951.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I then went on to quote the other sentence that the Senator has quoted. It is quite clear that what I was doing was quoting Deputy MacEntee's suggestion and not my own opinion.  The Senator will accept that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister here yesterday and in the Dáil last week laid great stress on the importance of reducing consumption of the less essential goods and of increasing sales. Every member of this House and of the Dáil appreciates the problems which the Minister is facing and which gave rise to that statement in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In the Dáil, when he was referring to the purchasing power of money incomes, the Minister said at column 1592 of Volume 159:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are, moreover, spending so much of these incomes to satisfy our immediate wants and desires that all too little is being set aside for the productive investment on which our future standards depend.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At column 1591 he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Both in March and in the Budget and on various occasions since, it was made quite clear that further action would have to be taken if an adequate improvement did not take place.  Stress was laid on how much that improvement depended on individual decisions to produce more and to defer unnecessary consumption so as to increase savings.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully appreciate, and I think every member of this House appreciates, the problems which the Minister is facing and I admire the courageous way in which he has presented the facts; but we must not overlook the fact that, apart from the new issue of savings <Col N="822" /> certificates, very little incentive to save for investment or other purposes has been provided by either the present or the previous Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh, and recently, too, Senator Crosbie, referred to the high death duties and the deterrent they may impose on wealthier members of the community who might save for investment purposes.  I join with these Senators in hoping that the Minister will in the near future introduce some alleviation of the heavy penalties imposed by death duties in order to encourage people who save to invest for long-term purposes.  When a worker in the lower income group reaches 70 years of age and is entitled to an old age pension, he finds that, if he has worked and lived frugally and saved money, the savings which he has accumulated over a long period count against him when he applies for pension. If we wish to encourage savings amongst our lower income groups, such savings, if they are invested either in State funds or private enterprise, should not count against an individual when he applies for his old age pension.</P>
    <P>Many people in the higher income groups are losing interest in life insurance. In one or two cases, people have actually disposed of their life policies, the feeling being that a great deal of the money saved in such policies only goes to the State on death and such a policy no longer affords to the family the security it afforded in the past.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh referred to the question of family businesses.  I agree with the Senator that the future of this country lies in private enterprise. Private enterprise in the past has been the backbone of industry.  Now one of the difficulties in private business and in a private limited company is&mdash;here I speak subject to correction by the Minister&mdash;that where a majority of the shares is held by an individual member of the family, the shares so held are liable to full death duties.  Indeed, one of the difficulties inherent in family business nowadays is the problem of meeting death duties out of capital.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the importance of increasing exports.  That was <Col N="823" /> also referred to by the Taoiseach, both in the Dáil and recently in Cork.  I think its importance is appreciated by all responsible citizens.  The Minister, however, when referring to underwriting of the proposed national loan did not give much encouragement to farmers or exporters when he said at column 1600 of Volume 159:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The normal arrangements for the flotation of a national loan mean that Government funds and the commercial banks, as underwriters, have to be prepared to supply any deficiency in public subscriptions.  For Government funds&mdash;and, indeed also for the banks in present circumstances&mdash;the fulfilment of underwriting commitments would involve further sales of sterling securities.  Neither the Minister for Finance nor the banks could regard this as a welcome prospect. It would reduce the already limited reserves held by departmental funds, leaving them less able to support the State capital programme in the future, but what is even more serious, it might necessitate in the case of the banks a contraction of credit facilities in other directions in order to safeguard their liquidity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have heard that statement referred to by many people outside and both farmers and manufacturers will be nervous of trying to increase their production for export, if they are working in continual fear of a contraction of their existing credit facilities.  It is seldom possible, as most manufacturers know, to obtain prompt payment for exports.  It is essential that producers should feel reasonably confident that, if they plan ahead to the maximum of their available resources, they will not find themselves suddenly in financial difficulties, due to a contraction of their credit facilities with the banks.  I have heard a number of criticisms of the report of that section of the Minister's speech which appeared in the Press and I was indeed glad to find that, as far as the actual Dáil Reports are concerned, it was not quite as serious as one or two of the newspapers suggested.  I think, however, that the Minister should make some further statement on this question.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="824" /> I want to refer now to the actual list of goods affected by the levies, more for clarification purposes than anything else.  In the first list of goods liable to levy, item 44 referred to prepared fruit juices and item 45 referred to prepared vegetable juices.  As far as I can make out, since the first levy, tins of unsweetened fruit juices have not been liable to any levy duty and they have been imported freely, but I find that under the new levy in Part 2, Section 16, we have &ldquo;fruit (other than pulp), fresh, chilled or frozen, excluding apples, plums, pears, hothouse grapes and fresh strawberries&rdquo;.  I should like the Minister to clarify whether or not tins of unsweetened fruit juices are now liable to levy.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion, when we were discussing the first levy, I asked the Minister whether oranges would be liable to levy.  In the first statement he said &ldquo;No&rdquo;, but I find that in the new levy, under Section 16, oranges are not mentioned.  Are they liable to the second levy?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I forgot that it was done by way of an exclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Another item which is now liable to levy and which I, as a draper, should welcome but about which I heard a certain amount of criticism, is that the levy is now being applied to sewing machines for household use.  If we are endeavouring to encourage a reduction in the standard of living, we ought to encourage people to make their own clothes, but this levy is a contradiction of that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now turn to the Appropriation Bill.  There are a few small comments <Col N="825" /> and suggestions I should like to make under that heading.  First of all, may I take Vote 54 which is for the expenses of the Department of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs?  I wonder why this country has not made more use of postage stamps as a source of revenue for the State?  It has been suggested that it is immoral to take money from stamp collectors.  I cannot see it is any more immoral to take money from stamp collectors who, if they do not spend it on Irish stamps, will spend it on other stamps, than it is to take money from foreigners who invest in our sweepstake.</P>
    <P>Stamps are a convenient method of prepaying postal rates.  That was their prime purpose.  If that is their prime purpose, I should point out to the Minister that under our present postal rates it is impossible to buy a single stamp to frank a 2-lb. parcel. We have no stamp of the value of 1/2. A registered letter to a foreign State is also 1/2.  I suggest to the Minister that a considerable income could be derived from issuing a new series of stamps which would include values to frank our present postage.</P>
    <P>In 1954 the Israeli Government made £13,000,000 from the issue of their stamps.  The British Government has never disclosed the figures of the sales of their stamps in the Crown Colonies; but they have disclosed that the Crown agents in London earmark over 50 per cent. of the total issue of stamps for the collectors.  That means that half the stamps are not used for postal purposes, but go into collections all over the world.  I hope the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will seriously consider this source of income.</P>
    <P>Under Vote 51, there is mention of expenditure for certain transport services and grants for harbours.  I would ask the Minister concerned if he would seriously consider, under this heading, providing a small sum to repair the landing stage at Glengarriff. I mention this landing stage, because there is a large cruising vessel calling there this afternoon.  It brings a great deal of tourist money&mdash;invisible exports, if you like&mdash;into this country.</P>
    <P>About three weeks ago I landed at <Col N="826" /> Glengarriff by sea.  It was at half-tide and it was with the greatest difficulty that I managed to get on to the wooden slip.  When I was trying to return to my ship, it was low tide and it was quite impossible to bring a launch alongside the rickety old wooden steps and the only way I could get into the launch was by going down an iron ladder.  When almost half way down, I was told that the remainder of the rungs were missing and I had to jump.</P>
    <P>Glengarriff is visited every year by this cruising vessel and I understand that there is a possibility that some other English lines may visit Glengarriff also.  Surely, it would be worth spending a small sum to provide a suitable landing stage.  It would not cost a lot and the work could be done without much difficulty.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to make on the Appropriation Bill, but I do not know which Vote it comes under.  My point is in connection with our naval service.  I mentioned in this House some months ago the fact that many of our navigational charts are out of date and a survey even of a moderate character of our Irish coastal waters is long overdue.  I wonder whether it would be possible to have one or two of our naval vessels undertake this survey around the coast. In England it is done by a section of the naval service.  I should think there would be very little difficulty in arranging for one or two of our officers to be trained in survey work.  It would be a valuable asset and I understand that the existing electro-plates would be available from the British Admiralty.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like once again to pay a tribute to the Minister for the able way in which he has tackled this financial problem with which our country is faced.  I think that every citizen of this country, regardless of his political affiliations, appreciates and recognises the courageous manner in which the Minister has placed the situation before the public and I believe he has the respect of every citizen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Professor Fearon Professor Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make a few comments on the levies?  I think <Col N="827" /> it is generally agreed that these levies are necessary, desirable and preferable to quotas.  I think it would be desirable if some kind of an escape clause could be included in a Bill such as this just to avert some unexpected or harmful consequences that might arise in regard to the levies.</P>
      <P>We know that when the photographic films came under a levy, radio-graphers and people like that in hospitals who used films were very much alarmed and something had to be done.  In this Bill there are, from the point of view of the ordinary laboratory worker, two or three things that could easily cause considerable alarm, for instance, the levy on plastic materials.  We use a great deal of plastic material in hospital laboratories and in ordinary educational laboratories.  I suppose we will be hit by the levy, unless something can be done.  Could not some kind of an escape clause be inserted where the article is required for educational or medical purposes?  Something like that ought to be incorporated in the Bill.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Douglas about the prepared fruit juices, is it possible to have canned or bottled fruit juices that have not been prepared?  I should have thought it would have fermented in a bottle.  Bottled fruit juice, if it did not explode, would have remarkable consequences on the temperance consumer. Anything in the nature of fruit juice in a bottle or can would have to be processed or prepared by either pasteurisation or the inclusion of an antiseptic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, it does not say &ldquo;unprepared&rdquo; fruit juice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Professor Fearon Professor Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wonder how is it unprepared.  I am very doubtful if it is actually unprepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice in the list waxes and polishing materials, beeswax and other insect waxes and then polishing preparations of all kinds.  Does that mean that polishes in general will increase in cost as, if there is a levy put on the beeswax and insect wax and vegetable wax and a levy on <Col N="828" /> polishing preparations of all kinds, how will polishes be made?  Is that a roundabout way of taxing polishes or does the Minister intend to exclude paraffin wax in that particular case?</P>
    <P>The next point in regard to the levies that occurred to me is, of course, the duration.  The Minister has told us explicitly that they are not to be considered as permanent, but many things that we do not think will be permanent are apt to be permanent. An imposition of levies is very often a one way street.  In fact, in order to impose these levies, the Minister is availing himself of the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932.  Many of the duties imposed 24 years ago, I believe, are still in operation.  It is sometimes much easier to institute a levy than it is to remove it, as so many things can happen.  An alternative for the levied product may be made locally and then an industry will be established, growing up under the sheltering branches of the levy and, then if you remove the levy, the industry will suffer.  We must keep in mind the possibility that levies are apt to remain put.</P>
    <P>Another thing that occurred to me in connection with certain of these levies is this: is the effect not going to be annulled by the operation of hire purchase?  Where you get a levy on sewing machines, for example, such as the ordinary domestic user is buying, we will say, on five years purchase at so much a week, it will simply mean that, instead of a five years purchase, it will be a ten-years purchase and it probably will not affect him very much immediately at all.  Where a hire-purchase scheme is operating with regard to an article subject to a levy, the effect of a levy may be so dissipated through time as to lose its immediate value.</P>
    <P>As to the actual consequences of the levy, first of all, it will provide the Government with valuable money, but I wonder how it will affect the public. The Minister may remember in his school days that when bulls eyes went up, we shifted to liquorice strap.  I do not think that the argument that the levies will encourage saving is a convincing argument.  Probably, the <Col N="829" /> people who can afford will pay more for the levied article and, if not, will find some other way of spending the money.</P>
    <P>Lastly, of course, there is the exploitation danger.  Whenever a levied article goes up in price, a local rival product, out of sympathy, is apt to go up in price and I am not sure how we can protect the community against the indirect reaction effect of the levy in one way or another.</P>
    <P>Ink is being restricted.  I presume that that will increase our production of local ink.  I do not think we make very much ink.  We make some very extraordinary inks and we make some very good ones, but I would not be surprised if the price of our locally manufactured ink goes up purely out of sympathy, in that strange way that things happen.</P>
    <P>I suppose it would be unjust to submerge without referring to the appropriations. In referring to the appropriations, of course, one feels, as anyone must feel who sat through the debates here, that we continually oscillate between realities and nebulous sentiment and the number of times on which we have been told to produce more and to save more during these two debates has been very impressive. I think we almost had a record of it. Produce more!  This most remarkably valuable statistical survey now made available to us contains material that I have not really had an opportunity of discussing with my economist friends, but which to me is very unsettling indeed.  I take Table 2, page 6&mdash;national income and gross national expenditure&mdash;and I take the deficit and I find that the national income increases and the expenditure increases and, if I divide the increase in expenditure by the national income, I find that the proportion is about one-fifth&mdash;between one-fifth and one-sixth, which means that, as fast as we increase our national income, we are going to increase national expenditure. A certain fraction of our national income seems to be at the moment in equilibrium with that expenditure, about one-fifth.  That surely means that our general pattern of national <Col N="830" /> production is wrong in some way.  We are producing things that are requiring more and more imports to keep them being produced.  When the Government surveys its own expenditure and its own economy, a wide survey of our national production in reference to the things needed for that production also requires to be made because I feel, that with that significant danger fraction, there is something wrong in the general overall pattern of national production.</P>
    <P>We have had reference to the battle of the balance of payments, the battle of the bulge.  It appears to me that the battle is costing something like a million of money and even the sums expected to be raised by the Minister as a result of the levies are not going anywhere near removing the bulge.  I was very comforted by Senator Murphy's cheering remarks yesterday, but, on thinking them over last night, I was not quite so cheered and I feel that, if there is anything in figures, the situation is very bad indeed.</P>

      <P>I wish to speak mainly on the first item, which is really a feature of the credit squeeze, the imposition of duties.  It has been apparent during the course of this debate that there is a good deal of agreement on both sides of the House about the credit squeeze.  Senator after Senator on this side of the House has congratulated the Minister upon being bloody, bold and resolute and in walking the tight-rope over the precipice and Senators on the other side of the House have repeatedly congratulated themselves on their own charity in not hurling rocks at him, thereby starting an avalanche.  Perhaps it may be bold of me to suggest that the precipice really need not have been there at all or, if there, need not have been the victim of a tight-rope experiment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The big Parties are undoubtedly <Col N="831" /> united on the need for the credit squeeze and it is inevitable, if you believe in our present financial policy. I do not.  I believe that that policy has not been sufficiently challenged. Senator McGuire has drawn an alarming picture of all the &ldquo;Reds&rdquo; and socialists and people of ill-disposition and revolutionaries who are impugning the banks and our present financial policy, but no less a conservative than Lord Packenham not so long ago in Dublin spoke very definitely, if in a very polite way, on the need for devising some new financial policy suited to the needs of this country.  He was quite definite on the necessity for that and that argues that since 1922 we have not devised a financial policy appropriate to the needs of this country.</P>
    <P>We have professional economists on both sides of the House&mdash;Senator O'Brien has spoken on one side and Senator Ó Buachalla on the other&mdash;but they have not contributed any new idea to this nation which at this moment, in the midst of this alleged crisis, certainly needs new ideas and new methods, not simply the old multiplied by 100.  The country is looking for new methods and new ideas, particularly with regard to finance.  More and more people are talking about the necessity for devising a financial policy which will not be simply geared up to English financial policy, which will not manifest itself in such ways as the automatic raising of the bank rate if England raises her bank rate.  These economists on both sides of the House have not provided us with anything except a desert.  When they are told it is a desert, they utter platitudes such as that many hands make light work, that the more production there is the better and that if everybody behaved well, there would be no necessity for the police.  They lament the circumstances of this unfortunate nation, and so on.  To my mind, that is not the way to face up to a crisis, if there is a crisis.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire quoted at some length from the Ibec Technical Services Corporation Report.  That report was invited during the period of office of one Government and published <Col N="832" /> during the period of office of the subsequent Government.  It was published in 1952, four years ago.  Just before the part from which Senator McGuire quoted, there is a section called &ldquo;Overcoming Handicaps to Manufacturing&rdquo;.  The compilers of the report deal with the major handicaps to manufacturing.  They say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The analysis that has been presented of Irish manufacturing industry shows that it has been subject to the following major limitations and competitive disadvantages:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Its materials costs have been unduly high.</P>
    <P>(b)  It has been unduly concentrated upon activities that add relatively little, through processing and fabricating steps, to the value of the materials handled.</P>
    <P>(c)  Its productivity per person employed has been relatively and absolutely low, in part probably, because of inefficiencies in management and labour usages, but importantly because of low plant and equipment investment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Inefficiency in management is one of the things for which the comparative backwardness of our manufacturing industry is blamed.  I suggest that some of our semi-State companies need better technical management.  That is true even of C.I.E.; the workers are all right but they are badly managed at the top.  If Córas Tráchtála were properly managed, American firms seeking business would not now deliberately by-pass this concern.  I have known a number of them to do it.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to discuss the factor of low investment.  That seems to the compilers of the report to be one of the major factors militating against the Irish economy.  On page 92 of the report we read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We return, at the end, to a theme that has run like a chain of linked traffic signals throughout our analysis of the Irish economy&mdash;the degree of Ireland's economic linkage to the United Kingdom which is inconsistent with its passionate commitment to political independence.  The effectiveness of political sovereignty <Col N="833" /> will continue to be vitiated while the Irish economy remains so decisively dependent upon the United Kingdom as a market for its exports, as the purveyor of its shipping services, as its major source of import supply, and in its financial and fiscal services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on as if to emphasise the need of a new financial policy for this country:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The influence of this status of economic dependency dominates the design and colour of Ireland's economic life in myriad ways that rob it of independent initiative.  Her currency is tied to sterling, and sterling crises affect Ireland by the inevitable process of infusion.  Ireland's investment funds both public and private have flowed to the United Kingdom in the absence of a developed and active market for home investment. She is almost entirely dependent upon Britain for dollar exchange. She is forced to buy an important part of her processing materials upon terms that are competitively disadvantageous, and to sell an important part of her output in a form that serves the convenience and interest of England's economy rather than her own.  Almost every decision and bargain with respect to Ireland's foreign trade is conditioned by the stern necessity of accepting the best terms that Britain will offer, since no tenable alternatives have been fashioned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I submit that these passages from a report which, presumably, is a respectable and conservative report, or otherwise it would not have been quoted by Senator McGuire, may interest us because there is a very drastic need for a new financial policy which will not admit of the current crisis with which we are faced.  The credit squeeze in its present form presents certain anomalies.  It is obvious that England can, in some respects, afford a credit squeeze.  She is suffering almost from over-employment. We are suffering from chronic under-unemployment.  We are suffering from the collapse of small businesses as a result of the credit squeeze.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> With regard to the savings campaign, there are two things left out of count that are deterrents to saving. The first is the continuous depreciation of the pound sterling.  I know several people who said: &ldquo;I will never save again in my life.  I had £1,000 invested in 1938 or 1939.  That money is now worth only £600 or £700. It would be much better to take out £100 a year and spend it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire says the banks are private property.  If that is so, why are they not engaged in ordinary competitive business?  They will give you the same miserable interest on your deposit, if you have one, and they will charge you the same high rate of interest on a loan, if you can get one without a sermon.  These private companies seem altogether too much concerned with issuing pastorals and sermons hectoring the Irish people on their unfortunate addiction to spending.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the speech of Senator Woods yesterday.  I want to apologise to him for interrupting him.  I did so completely under the misapprehension that we were speaking purely on Item 2 of yesterday's agenda and not on Items 2 and 3 together.  I should also like to say to the Minister, without any animosity whatever, that he had no right to usurp the functions of the Chair in reproving me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Having explained the situation now, I am sure Senator Woods will appreciate it, being a gentlemanly sort of person.  He made an extremely good speech.  He talked about afforestation and emigration. He spoke almost entirely in terms of his own county, but, even surveying the problems of that county, one could not proceed to solve them without some new financial policy.  It is not by niggling little reforms that you can solve, say, the problem of afforestation in one county.  It has got to be tackled as a national concern.  It is not by tackling one county here and another there that you will solve emigration.  It is only by large scale capital investment in production that you will solve it.  This can only be undertaken by a resolute Government with a new financial policy.  A new financial policy is imperative at this time.</P>
      <P>To sum up, these are the two points I make: Firstly, there must be a new financial policy; and secondly, this policy should be knit up with a planned economic output.  There has been a certain amount of unity on both sides of the House.  If I can make myself heard above the Minister and Senator Hayes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I should like to say the two big Parties should be urged to come together, as they were recently by Deputy MacBride.  The argument has been made that then there would be no Opposition and that, in a democracy, there is need for a healthy Opposition.  I agree with that, but I should like to point out in all sincerity to those who use that argument that it is a healthy Opposition who oppose on grounds of disagreement, but it would be an unhealthy Opposition who would oppose on grounds which were agreed grounds.  Here we <Col N="836" /> have something agreed: it is agreed that there is a necessity for a new financial policy and for better economic planning.  I would appeal to both of the big Parties to come together on this matter.  I believe that the post civil war generation would regard it as a step forward and would follow resolutely behind any such unity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>All speakers in this debate, both on this side of the House and on the other, have been adamant that one thing is necessary&mdash;the necessity of bringing home to every individual in the country the seriousness of the present financial situation.  I feel that, while agreeing with this necessity, it is not always so easy to do it, because, of course, of necessity, Ministers for Finance and economists talk in terms of high finance, in amounts running into millions of pounds.</P>
      <P>I think it has been a pity that, so far, no particular effort appears to have been made by Government Departments to simplify the position, to reduce the position to the level of a simple sum that is easily understandable by even the simplest people.  I throw that suggestion in for future use, perhaps at a later stage when the Minister and his officials are initiating a savings campaign.  For instance, it might be possible to handle it on these lines: what does our adverse balance of payments of £36,000,000 amount to?</P>
      <P>It could be compared with the fact that one million of our population spent on foreign goods £36 per head or, alternatively, that each individual in our nation spent somewhat over £12 a head on foreign produced articles more than we had earned by our exports. It could, perhaps, be explained that this situation, if we got a universal effort by everybody doing something about it, could easily be changed.  An investment of £10 per head of the population in savings would, for instance, make a very big difference.  I throw out that idea for what it is worth to the Minister and his officials for use at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question, of course, we are all aware that our principal export&mdash;the export by which we have lived up to the present&mdash;has been agricultural <Col N="837" /> produce.  The fact of the matter is that our standard of living has now become so high that our agricultural exports at the present moment are not sufficient to pay for this new standard of living which we have developed.  I am all in favour of a high standard of living; I think it is an excellent thing that the standard of living of our people has grown out of all knowledge of the people old enough to remember the days before World War I.</P>
    <P>I do not think any one of us would like to see our standard of living being lowered.  We would consider that a retrograde step.  On the other hand, as realists, if we are to maintain that standard, we should realise we must pay for it.  Higher agricultural production and a consequent increase in agricultural exports are not, of necessity, things you can do overnight. A change in agricultural methods is, of necessity, a slowish process.  We have got to look then for the alternatives to agricultural production, and I think the next best asset we have, and one which now comes very close to agriculture, is tourism.</P>
    <P>So far, I think we would be justified in saying that, while our tourist industry has made exceedingly good strides and great improvement since the end of the war, we have still scarcely scratched the surface of this potentially large field.  In his connection, I might point out to the Minister a matter in which, I think, a great mistake has been made.  Naturally enough, dollar tourists would be the most valuable tourists we could get at the moment.  By that, I am not implying that other tourists will not also be valuable, but at this moment in world history, Americans happen to have a financial value which is superior to that of other people.</P>
    <P>Now, I think the influx of American tourists into this country would be greatly increased if they were given certain facilities that up to the present moment have been denied them, as a result of deliberate Government policy. What I am referring to is that American-owned aircraft are not able to fly into Dublin Airport.  That has been the deliberate policy of Governments <Col N="838" /> who are afraid of running any risk that Shannon Airport might be by-passed or overlooked.  If Shannon Airport is ever to be by-passed or overlooked, there is absolutely nothing we can do about it; if that position should come about, it would occur as a result of an improvement in aircraft generally and of the extension of their range.</P>
    <P>The American people are realistic people, and when they go to visit a country, they usually like to fly into the capital of that country.  Many American tourists have failed to come to Ireland because there is no direct communication between the United States and the capital of Ireland&mdash; Dublin.  I think in that way we have lost quite a lot of American tourists. I hope it is a matter to which the Government will now give their consideration.</P>
    <P>I join with the other Senators who have congratulated the Minister on his determination to make a saving of £5,000,000 in Government expenditure. I take this opportunity also of making a further suggestion to him.  In addition to making the saving, would it not be good business to hold an investigation into the efficiency of the Government machine?  I do not suppose it would cost very much to have our whole bureaucracy investigated by a modern business efficiency firm and a report made upon it.  The methods used are generally antediluvian and in many instances are calculated to slow matters up and, one might almost think, to interfere with the ordinary flow of trade and commerce.</P>
    <P>I have seen things myself in Government offices and if I or any other businessman were to run our businesses on similar lines, we would not be in business very long.  I shall give two instances.  On one occasion, I had to visit a Department which comes directly under the Minister's own office, that is, the Postal Customs House at Amiens Street.  While I was there for well over an hour waiting to pay a customs duty of 3/6, I saw a young man, an employee of a business firm in the city, who came down to clear some commercial parcels.  He had his invoices, his bills of lading and the <Col N="839" /> money.  He was informed that he had to fill in a certain document, the number of which I cannot recollect at the moment, in triplicate and that this document cost a certain small sum of money.  He produced the money and said: &ldquo;Very well; give me the forms.&rdquo; He was told: &ldquo;No; in order to get this form, you must return to Eason's in O'Connell Street, or to the Government Publication Offices in Henry Street,&rdquo; a distance of over a mile. That kind of thing is a great help in business and commerce.</P>
    <P>Let me give the Minister another instance.  Under the regulations by which he has placed a levy on newsprint, provision is made for a drawback on newsprint which is exported. We all export newsprint, some in larger quantities than others, both to Northern Ireland and to the United Kingdom, because, strangely enough, people in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom read Irish newspapers. Although this levy has been in existence now for over four months not a single penny has been paid back to any Irish newspaper by way of a drawback, the reason being that the officials of the Minister's Department refuse to accept the weights of the firms concerned for the newspapers which are leaving this country.</P>
    <P>If they mistrust us, they apparently mistrust C.I.E. just as much, because they refuse to accept the railway rates. The only weights they will accept are the weights of their own officials which, of course, becomes an unworkable proposition as newspapers invariably have to catch steamers and trains and cannot wait on a quay-side or at a railway station for the convenience of a customs official to weigh them.  The position has been complicated, I understand, by another gentleman who wants to know what difference would the ink make on the paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Ink now has the levy, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  From time to time we are exhorted to export more. Manufacturers are always being exhorted to seek an export market.  It is perfectly right and just that Governments <Col N="840" /> should ask Irish manufacturers to go after export markets.  However, the help given to manufacturers in their search for export markets is not adequate.  Coras Tráchtála is a very admirable organisation as far as it goes, and has done excellent work, but it covers a very limited field.  On the whole, from the point of view of the commercial life of this country, I would say we are getting very bad value indeed from the Department of External Affairs.  This is not a criticism of the Department or its personnel, but I would stress that we have not a sufficient number of commercial representatives in the various places where we have representation. We have Ambassadors and Ministers who are very necessary in certain places, because these places are of great importance to us politically, and so on, but our consuls are not pulling their weight and are drawn from the wrong type of people, as a rule.</P>
      <P>A consul should really be a commercial representative and his only connection with the Department of External Affairs in St. Stephen's Green ought to be to give him a short course in passport and visa control, and the small consular duties.  He should essentially be a commercial expert, a salesman, and I do hope that for the future the Government will try to bring about a change in the administrative policy of our Department of External Affairs which will enable us to build up a commercial organisation in foreign countries.  That is what our friends the Canadians did.  The Canadians are richer than we are and they could afford to do it on a larger scale.  The Canadians always had two services, a diplomatic service and a commercial service, and the commercial service, incidentally, was always regarded by them as being by far the more important.  I hope that, at some time, this will be brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHartney" hpid="Mr. Hartney Mr. Hartney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly necessary to refer again to the fact that the amount for which our approval is sought in this Appropriation Bill is a sum much greater than the people should have to expect.  On the one hand, we have the promises made by the Government <Col N="841" /> in power and against that the declining income of the principal section of the community, namely, the agricultural community.  All Parties have to agree with the Minister that the situation is bad.  One thing which a realisation of the seriousness of the situation might achieve is that it might explode the myth that the resources of the country, and the amount of money which a Government can lay its hands on, are limitless.  If we establish that throughout the length and breadth of the country, it would be a purgatory worth going through.  The point is: will it achieve that objective and will everybody realise it in its true form? A lot of people pretend to believe that the resources of a nation are endless and that there is no limit to the supply of money available to a Government, whenever they want it.  Greater nations have found that that was not so and that was the rock on which they perished, when they found that they had reached the stage when the &ldquo;kitty&rdquo; was empty.  When that happens to great nations it must more readily happen to smaller nations like ours.</P>
      <P>In the present financial year, there are certain large development works which might have been undertaken but which will now probably have to be left in abeyance.  There is the question of a further national loan, and it is a very good thing, probably, in its own way.  If £20,000,000 can be obtained, it will relieve the tension in certain quarters.  It will help the Government to carry on and keep up the pressure which it promised to maintain in relieving the needs of the people.  It will also do something else.  It will increase the national debt and when a national debt exceeds a certain percentage of the national income, it cannot be regarded as a very good position. There is a limit and that limit has to be recognised and taken into account. We cannot get away from that.  There is always a certain distance you can go but there is a halting point, and it is better to see that point ahead than to wait until you crash into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increased production has been referred to by everyone and it is expected that increased production is <Col N="842" /> to come from agriculture, but it is very hard to see how it can come from agriculture.  There has been a fall in cattle prices during the past 12 months, and, even if we were to export more cattle, we would still make less money on them.  That is apparent to anybody who reads the market reports. Even yesterday's market showed a drop.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing to hear that the Minister proposes to cut £5,000,000 off the expenditure of working the State. It is an earnest of his intention to do his part and to blaze a trail for others whom he has asked to save.  I hope he will be successful and will succeed in getting much more off than the £5,000,000 he has promised.  It must also be borne in mind that the agricultural community are tied down very seriously with local rates.  If one refers to 1914, one will find that rates are fifteen times higher to-day&mdash;that is the gross rate.  It is fifteen times higher now in my county, and I think we are rated as low as any county in the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    <P>There is also the very serious question of national transport in which everybody is interested.  A body has been set up recently to go into it.  I, for one, have every confidence in the men selected to compose the commission. They are experienced in various walks of life and I only hope that they will be successful in thinking out something which will save C.I.E. from extinction.  C.I.E., to a great extent, have nobody but themselves to blame.  They turned the people away from them because they were the only carriers in the country and considered that they could not be replaced.  The activities of the great luxury liners have been curtailed because people are now travelling by air.  They were able to be replaced, and, if that can happen to them, there is no reason why steam engines cannot be replaced.</P>
    <P>It is due largely to the bad service they have been given that the people are prepared to support any alternative made available.  A good deal of traffic has been lost through C.I.E.'s own fault.  In my own county, a fair which was one of the best in the country, and which up to 15 or 20 years ago <Col N="843" /> was attended by buyers from Dublin and other centres, was abandoned completely because the purchasers were unable to get their cattle to Dublin on the day of the fair.  It was found that the cattle had to remain somewhere during the night and that, as a result of their undergoing that treatment, the buyer suffered a loss of about £5 per head.</P>
    <P>Everybody is anxious to see a good railway service available and everybody has appealed to the Government from time to time to try to assist the railways because, after all, £26,000,000 of Irish money was invested in them in years gone by.  The idea was to preserve that investment.  Many of the people who had bought railway stocks found themselves possessed only of pieces of paper eventually, but that is now passed and gone.  A serious effort will have to be made, and I hope if a good plan is produced, it will be accepted and if it is accepted by the Government, it should be adopted and worked out by everybody concerned. Meanwhile, I think the people are entitled to support whatever system gives them the best service and the people are anxious to support the railways, if the railways give the service they want.</P>
    <P>Reference was made yesterday to illegal hauliers.  They may be illegal to a certain extent, but they perform a very necessary service.  The monopoly, C.I.E., in the first instance, and also the carriers who have plates, will do only the choice jobs.  If I have a job to do and I am not in a locality which they consider is a suitable one from their point of view, they can by-pass me and tell me they cannot do the work.  Therefore, I am very glad to have a neighbour to fall back upon. A neighbour cannot be doing anything terribly wrong in this respect because he has to buy his truck and it represents his bread and butter.  He will work hard and give good service, and without this sort of haulier many people would be left unserved.  The monopoly under legislation passed some years ago will only take the cream of the work available and does not mind the other fellow&mdash;illegal <Col N="844" /> though he may be&mdash;having the remainder of it.  If we were forced to depend on the monopoly to serve our interests in the country, we would be in a very bad situation.</P>
    <P>In Limerick City, Thursday is observed as a half-holiday, but despite that buses come in sometimes barely ten minutes before the shops close. They arrive half-empty carrying only the people who are rich enough to come to see a picture&mdash;and they will not be very many&mdash;from the countryside. They travel up to 40 miles from different centres and they run side by side with trains.  Why should not Thursday be a half-holiday for the men?  The part of the day when they are supposed to work could be devoted to overhauling or cleaning the vehicles and then the half-holiday would coincide with the city half-haliday. It is a dead loss as it is.  The authorities must be aware of this, but apparently they do not take things seriously.  As long as the Government can be induced to subsidise C.I.E. and keep it floating at the expense of the public, there is nothing to worry about; but like all good things, this will come to an end and I think we are very near it now.</P>
    <P>I hope the findings of the committee will be of a practical nature designed to save the transport situation, and that an opportunity will be given to these people who are employed in transport to maintain their livelihood, while at the same time giving a service to the public which they will appreciate.  The public will pay if they get the service they deserve and the people who will ultimately suffer if this service is not given will have no one to blame but themselves.</P>

      <P>I believe it is generally accepted that this measure, the Imposition of Duties Bill, is necessary and also that it is acceptable because of the fact that the increased cost of the type of goods that are liable to the new import levies will not impose a great burden upon the section of the community that can least afford to bear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing that induces me to speak here to-day is the reference made by <Col N="845" /> Senator McGuire to the attitude of the trade union movement and the labour movement generally.  In one part of his speech he referred to the fact that one of the trade unions or one section of the trade union movement had stated that if the Government did not control prices and profits, it would seek further wage increases Later on in the same speech, Senator McGuire said it would appear that the trade union movement did not permit manufacturers or producers to transfer costs to the prices of their commodities.  The one thing that strikes me as peculiar in those two references is that Senator McGuire seems prepared to think that anybody who has a commodity for sale is entitled to take everything into consideration and then seek a price for that commodity, but that wage-earners or those whom the trade unions represent who have only one commodity to sell&mdash;labour&mdash;are not entitled to seek higher prices for their labour.  In other words, he thinks that labour as a commodity is one that is not worthy of the same respect as a manufactured commodity.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire also referred to the fact that the trade union movement was continually demanding that the standard of living be maintained.  That is actually true.  Surely Senator McGuire does not think that the trade union movement or the Labour Party are seeking to maintain the standard of living that Senator McGuire enjoys? The trade union movement is seeking solely to maintain the minimum standard of living, to ensure that a reasonable standard of living is given to those who produce our goods.  Those remarks come at a time when Senator McGuire himself and all the other members of this House were urging that everybody in the country should co-operate to assist in overcoming the so-called crisis that exists at present. At a time when everyone here was hoping that all Parties would cooperate, Senator McGuire decided to take that opportunity to deliver an attack on the trade unions and the working-class community in general.</P>
    <P>He wonders why there are people within the trade union movement who would look with suspicion on the <Col N="846" /> people Senator McGuire speaks for. One reason, perhaps, is that, when these new import levies are collected, the only people who will benefit will be the people on whose behalf Senator McGuire was speaking.  The people who import and sell goods will take into account the levies they have paid, add that to the cost of the commodity and put on their usual percentage of profit.  In fact, they will derive a benefit from these new levies.  Of course, they will make the case that it is only a fair return for the capital involved in the transaction; nevertheless, they will not be at any loss but will gain by the levy.  If they were selling an article at a price not taking the levy into account, they would have a certain percentage of profit, but now when they sell an article with the levy on, they have the percentage of profit on the article and the percentage of profit from the amount they have paid in the form of the levy.</P>
    <P>There was a comment that one of the reasons this country was not producing more goods for export was the attitude of certain people in the trade union movement who were prepared to criticise the profit that manufacturers or producers obtain from their businesses.  It should be remembered that most Irish industries have had the benefit of protection since they were founded.  It is not unreasonable to believe that an industry that has the benefit of protection should work, as far as possible, towards ensuring that it produces an exportable surplus. Very few of our Irish industries have really directed themselves to that task, most of them being satisfied to supply solely the home market where they had an assured demand and an assured price because of the protection given them by the State.</P>
    <P>In connection with the credit squeeze and particularly in reference to the banks, I believe that, while it is not desirable that the Minister or the Government should take any steps to alter the existing relationship between the banks and their clients, it is essential that some type of guidance should be given to the banks to ensure that there is some form of selective distribution of credit, particularly <Col N="847" /> under present circumstances.  I know of a case recently of a firm on the east coast employing 200 workers.  Ninety-five per cent. of the production of that firm was exported.  Their bank overdraft was no greater in recent months than it had been on many occasions during the past fewyears.  Yet the bank decided to foreclose on that business. It meant that 200 workers were put out of employment and that the product of that firm was no longer available for export.  In other words, the action of the bank caused the unemployment of 200 people and, as far as the adverse trade balance was concerned, 95 per cent. of the output of that firm, which had previously been exported, was lost to the country.</P>
    <P>I believe it is unfair and wrong at a time like this for anyone to make use of the fact that the trade unions are carrying out their duty to the workers in seeking the highest possible rate of wages they can possibly obtain for them.  It is wrong to use an occasion like this for the purpose of delivering an attack upon trade unions.</P>
    <P>The measures contained in this Imposition of Duties Bill are necessary. Everyone in this country realises that we have to export more, but it would be as well to remember that, as most of us here have said, it is mainly agricultural exports will remedy the defects in our economy.  In that respect, I think it should be said that more firm measures should be taken with the farmers and the agricultural community of this country.  It is my opinion that they have failed, and failed hopelessly, to live up to their responsibility to the State.  They seem to trade upon the fact, which is generally recognised, that they served this country well during the Emergency. But if they did, there are many other people who served this country well&mdash;there are those who joined the Defence Forces, for instance&mdash;and who received far less for their services than the Irish farmers.  The output of agricultural produce in this country is so low that it warrants the serious attention of the Government to ensure that more agricultural goods will be available for export.</P>

      <P>This debate, as was perhaps inevitable since we were taking not merely the Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Order) (No. 2) Bill but also the Appropriation Bill, ranged over a wide series of subjects.  I can appreciate and understand that that was quite inevitable in the circumstances.  Equally, Senators will understand and appreciate that, in relation to certain of the detailed points made during the course of the debate, I might not have readily to hand the material with which to answer those points in as great detail as I, and perhaps the Senators, would wish.</P>
      <P>The Senators concerned came in fully aware of the particular point, or points, they wished to raise and I did not have the advantage they had of familiarising myself with the details before coming in here.  I trust, therefore, that in so far as these detailed points are concerned, Senators will forgive me if I do not refer to them now.  I shall, however, ensure that their observations are considered in the appropriate quarters at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general problems under discussion there was, in some respects, a wide diversity of view.  There was almost a unanimity of view in other respects.  So far as I am concerned, I never object to anybody who differs from my point of view.  On the contrary, I welcome such a difference because it is only through the clash of ideas that one is really able to appreciate and understand fully the importance of what the other fellow has to say.  I think, however, that when people intend to speak on serious subjects, such as the subjects we have discussed here to-day and yesterday, they should make some effort to ensure that their preparation is adequate or, if they are not able to make adequate preparation, they should at least ensure that they do not indulge in merely destructive criticism.  It seems to me that there is an obligation on members of this House, if I may say so with respect, and particularly on those <Col N="849" /> members who are supposed to represent a certain point of view.  Their obligation to put forward a constructive point of view instead of a purely destructive one is much greater.  To accuse others of platitude and to say that we want a completely new policy, without oneself making any effort to avoid platitudinous statements or to produce any constructive policy, merely indicates that the particular speaker taking that line has either not got the ability to argue his views out to their logical conclusion or is not prepared to sit down and devote the necessary effort essential to his purpose.</P>
    <P>There is an old saying that it is better to make sure of what you are going to bring in before you throw out the water that is there.  People who talk about the necessity for a new approach to the problems we are discussing to-day should have some concrete idea of what their new approach will be before paying lipservice to destructive criticism of things as they are.  Other speakers differed violently from the point of view I hold, but I must confess that I was able to appreciate the manner in which they put their criticisms to the House because they were putting forward what was to them an obviously sincere point of view and, though I will answer their criticisms now to the best of my ability, I want it to be understood that, in answering them, I am not challenging in any way their sincerity about the views they expressed.</P>
    <P>I think perhaps in one respect I was a little hard on Senator Louis Walsh when I interrupted him in the middle of his speech, though I had clearly intended, from the sense of my remarks on the previous occasion, to convey to the Heuse that it was Deputy MacEntee's views I was putting, not my own.  At the same time, in fairness to Senator Walsh, I must say I did not make it as clear in the actual words as I might have done, although back earlier in my remarks that day it was clear enough.</P>
    <P>Senator Kissane opened the debate by taking the line that this was not really a trouble arising now, but that it was one which had been going on <Col N="850" /> for a considerable period.  In fact, he blamed it all on the first inter-Party Government.  That seems to be the line that has been put out through certain channels on the far side of the House.  Whether it was following the lead given by Senator Kissane or otherwise, we heard various Fianna Fáil Senators taking the same line at a later stage.</P>
    <P>If they feel that that is the sole cause and taking them at their words for the purpose of this argument, but no further or otherwise, then I cannot understand why, in the three years they were in power, they did not correct the tendencies they saw.  I would suggest to the Senators that they can hardly have it both ways.  Either they were wrong from 1951 to 1954 in not correcting the tendencies or else the tendencies arose in their existing form later than that.</P>
    <P>In fact, of course, we know that what occurred was that there was a world-wide trend of difficulties which hit us here and because of our peculiar circumstances in our own position, we have been, perhaps, more particularly vulnerable than elsewhere.  I want to make it quite clear, however, in that connection that, while there is no doubt in my mind that the force of outside events has materially affected our position, that does not mean to say in any way that it was the sole thing that affected us.  On the contrary, our own circumstances have affected us also and the peculiar circumstances of our trade.  Whether the causes responsible for our present difficulties are internal or external does not matter in the slightest to this extent, that the remedy must be one we must find ourselves and only we ourselves can find.</P>
    <P>There was a certain amount of criticism hinted at rather than more firmly stated by Senator Kissane to the effect that I was relying upon the effect of the levies alone to deal with our balance of payments problem.  Of course, that is not so.  The levies are merely part of the pattern set and only one segment of the measures that have been taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien put his finger on the <Col N="851" /> most important aspect of the whole thing, and that is the psychological aspect.  It is essential our people should realise that, in the ultimate, the decision remains with them and that, though the Government may and will give the leadership necessary and take the measures necessary to deal with this situation, in the last analysis, it is individual decisions that really count, not governmental decisions.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien very properly said that the effect of the various measures being taken were cumulative in character and, therefore, could not be judged singly or apart from each other. It is, of course, clear, again as the Senator said, that the effect of the levies could be actually inflationary in one instance if it were not corrected. We are suffering at present, not so much from internal inflation as from import inflation.  It is because there are not sufficient goods produced here to provide for the purchasing power that is effective at home that we are having to bring in additional goods to meet that gap.  If the effect of the levies was that less goods were brought in and that then, as Senator O'Brien pointed out, the effect was that exactly the same purchasing power was chasing the amount of goods that was in the country, instead of an import inflation, we should have an internal inflation. That is why it is absolutely essential from the point of view of righting the economy that there should be the stress upon savings and that there should be the stress also on a decrease in general consumption, particularly of non-essential goods.</P>
    <P>Certain Senators spoke about the levies as if the sole purpose of them was to get a switch from consumption of goods produced externally to consumption of goods produced internally. That is not the intended effect.  The intended effect undoubtedly is to deter imports.  The deterrent effect is of far greater importance than the revenue yield which will arise from the payment of the duties, if the goods are brought in but it would not be sufficient merely to switch from an imported article to a home-produced article in the same volume because the <Col N="852" /> effect of that would be, as our industries are based, inevitably to drive up imports again, though at a slightly lower scale, in the strata of raw materials.</P>
    <P>One of our difficulties here is that we have so few raw materials and that our industries are based so much on imported raw materials.  In consequence of that, the consumption of even home-produced goods brings in its train an increased import of raw materials.  Unfortunately, in our existing circumstances, therefore, we must clearly set out to ensure that we do not in that way increase our imports in another direction, while decreasing them by the levies in the direction intended by governmental Order.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I found myself in a rather strange position when Senator Cogan was speaking.  Senator Cogan and I are well known for disagreeing with each other, but yesterday I must confess that I found myself agreeing with a lot of what he said.  He said, first of all, that he thought it was very wrong for politicians on either side of the House to detest each other.  I agree with him wholeheartedly.  I hope he will not get into too much trouble with his Leader who indicated in the Dáil last week that he detests the Government.  Senator Cogan also said that he disapproved entirely of the purchase of jet planes at the present moment.  Again, I hope he will not get into too much difficulty with Deputy Traynor, the former Minister for Defence, because it was only while Deputy Traynor was Minister for Defence that these jet planes were ordered.  None has been ordered since the change of Government.  Whether they are wise or unwise, the fact is that when contracts are made by any Government, its successors must honour those contracts, particularly when they are outside the country, and it would be disastrous for our good name if, merely because of a change of Government, a succeeding Government proceeded forthwith to repudiate contracts made by its predecessor.</P>
    <P>Senator Woods, in his maiden speech, dealt particularly with some of the problems with which he is <Col N="853" /> acquainted in the north-eastern corner of Louth.  The Senator did not go on to indicate one other thing that he might have indicated, that is, the extraordinarily efficient production that is carried out there by some of the farmers in that area.  I have not the experience that Senator Woods has of that area, but I have personal experience of seeing the manner in which the farmers in that area produce.  While Senator Woods was painting the industrial picture there rather on the gloomy side, he should at the same time have touched on the other side, the agricultural production which, in that corner of Louth, certainly, is as good as anywhere else in the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy and Senator McGuire seemed to me to get stuck in each other, if I may use that expression, during Senator Murphy's speech, without either of them realising what was in the other's mind.  As regards the levies, at any rate as regards what should happen in relation to the levies and in relation to prices, is quite clear to my mind.  I think, quite candidly, that there would not be very much difference between the points of view of Senator Murphy or Senator McGuire and mine.  It is perfectly clear that, when import levies are imposed, the importer will have to pay the levy and, because of that levy, will have to submit to additional expense. That additional expense cannot come out of the air and I think that was the point that Senator McGuire was making.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it would be very wrong, particularly in our present circumstances, if people were to take advantage of our present circumstances to make a greater profit than they would make in ordinary times. That would be profiteering in the sense that it used to be known and I think that is the point of view, broadly, that Deputy Murphy was putting forward. There is a mean, and I do not think either Senator would disagree with me, and that is, that it would be wrong if an unfair profit was made because of the difficulties of the time.  We must recollect, on the one hand, that to take advantages of a national emergency would be anti-social and anti-national.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="854" /> Equally, on the other hand, we must realise&mdash;and I would commend this particularly to Senator Bohan who said some things with which I do not agree, but, while disagreeing with him, I must confess that he put his point of view quite clearly and quite lucidly in a maiden speech that, for its clarity and lucidity, certainly deserves commendation&mdash;that there is no doubt that the effect of these levies will be that there will be far less goods of the nature involved sold and that, therefore, the first thing that will happen, undoubtedly, is that the people who are in the distributive trades for these imported goods will have their turnover severely restricted.  It is not correct, therefore, for the Senator to suggest that those people could possibly welcome the levies.  They could not.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable, if the levies have the deterrent effect I hope they will have, that there will be a restriction in the turnover of people who are interested in either the importation or the wholesale or retail sale of these articles. One must bear that in mind when considering, for example, their overheads &mdash;how the spread of their overheads has to be taken into consideration in their turnover&mdash;and also the interest, if they have to borrow for the purpose of paying the duty.  There is a mean in these things.  I do not think that either Senator Murphy or Senator McGuire will disagree with me when I put that mean as the correct line to take in our present circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I must take issue with Senator Murphy on another aspect of his speech.  I understand his views, as expressed, are to some degree prevalent and certainly, as was made clear in the Dáil the other day, I feel they must be thrown aside completely.  I may say I am not talking of Senator Murphy personally in this matter.  I sensed a feeling of complacency in his remarks that things would be all right and that we need not be too worried about them.  We must rid ourselves of that idea.  They are not going to come right, unless we take positive and cooperative action to make them right.</P>
    <P>There is no use in our believing that wishful thinking will cure our present <Col N="855" /> ills.  It requires a very much more positive effort in order to get us out of these difficulties.  At the same time, I want to tell Senator Murphy that I appreciate more than I can say the view he expressed&mdash;speaking not merely for himself but for the trade union movement of which he is a prominent member&mdash;that that great movement would give us the fullest co-operation and that he was assuring me of their fullest co-operation in any savings drive.  If we can get that co-operation from all our people in a positive savings drive such as we are initiating now, and particularly if we can get it from the trade union movement, then we can hope that, with that on the one side and with an addition to production on the other side, we shall be able to surmount our difficulties.  At the same time, it would be wrong if I allowed his perhaps too optimistic note to go without the criticism that I have just passed on it.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy also referred, in relation to the Appropriation Bill side of the business before us, to public transport. He is quite correct when he says there are only three things that can be done in relation to public transport. The choices before a country of our size in relation to public transport are difficult and perhaps stark.  Therefore, it is only right and proper that we should be quite clear on all the facts and implications before the country as a whole makes its choice.  I do not think that, as yet, the country appreciates the seriousness of that position either. There are three choices: (1) the virtual abandonment of the rail services at one end of the scale, (2) the complete restriction of private transport at the other end of the scale and (3) somewhere in the middle of the scale lies the choice of permanent subsidisation from the Exchequer.  I need hardly say that the third choice would be anathema not merely to me but to any Minister for Finance in any Government. I do not believe any Government would accept the view that public funds should permanently subsidise public transport.</P>
    <P>Whether or not it will be possible to achieve a bridge between the two ends <Col N="856" /> of the scale to which I have referred, it is impossible to tell at this moment. However, it is quite clear to me, at any rate, that the action the Tánaiste took of setting up a committee to examine this problem as a matter of great urgency was the right way of ensuring that all the facts would be available and that, when they report, we would be able to take a firm decision in the knowledge that the public had the relevant information before them at the time.  The committee in question will have a difficult task.  They will have to see whether the view expressed by Senator Hartney, for example, that the public should get the best possible service, no matter what would result, is justifiable.  The public's view of that service at present perhaps is that they want a door-to-door service.  That has to be reconciled, on the one hand, with the fact that other people feel very strongly that it is absolutely essential that the rail service, as such, should be maintained.  It is clear, however, that our economy cannot support two systems of public transport competing with each other in the manner in which we have seen them competing in recent times.  The economy as a whole must avoid that type of duplication.  If we were to permit such duplication to continue, we should be wasting our resources in a way that would be entirely unjustified.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the restaurant in this building and to the amount that is paid to subsidise it.  The restaurant here has a difficult task inasmuch as it is entirely different from an outside establishment.  In an outside establishment, by and large, approximately the same number of meals are sold every day it is open.  Here, one day there is hardly anybody in the restaurant when neither House is sitting and the next day perhaps there are 200 meals to be served at any one time.  It is impossible to run any business, which has that violent fluctuation, on the ordinary outside commercial scale.  The subvention is to enable the restaurant to carry on.  It is essential that Deputies and Senators who have continuous business in the House should be able to get meals here.  Because of the fluctuations, it is necessary to pay a subvention to the Restaurant Committee. <Col N="857" /> Lest there should be any doubt in the mind of anybody outside, I just want to say that the effect of that subvention is not to make the cost of meals cheaper to Deputies and Senators.  On the contrary, I think that for the meal one gets in the restaurant here, the price is higher than one would have to pay in an equivalent establishment outside.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Buachalla spoke in a serious vein and I think his speech was intended to be helpful.  I must confess, however, I thought I had rarely heard such a series of paradoxes as was put forward by the Senator. His first few words were that he did not approve of the discussion on the levies and on the Appropriation Bill being taken together, but he supported the decision of the Seanad.  He then went on to say that he supported the measures I was taking, but that he did not approve of them.  He said further that he believed in private enterprise, but he had no faith in it.  Then he said he saw the dangers in the measures I was introducing, but apparently he saw no dangers in a continuance of imports surplus to what we could afford to pay for.</P>
    <P>There was a series of such paradoxes and for that reason I found no little difficulty in understanding exactly the point of view the Senator wished to put forward.  I thought I had made it clear before, but apparently I had not made it adequately clear, that these measures that we are taking, like those in relation to imports, are, of course, negative measures.  I made it quite clear, speaking many times over the past four months, that the ultimate approach, the long-term approach, must be to take positive steps for an increase in production, positive steps to make sure that we have greater exports and, with greater exports, that we will be able to pay for our imports.  It will, however, obviously take some considerable time for us to be able to increase our exports to that degree and it is necessary, therefore, in the circumstances, that in the interval we should ensure that we do not import more than we can afford to pay for.  That is the purpose of these measures.</P>
    <P>In relation to the positive increase, <Col N="858" /> I asked Senator Ó Buachalla what he had in mind and he referred to two things, wheat and grass meal.  So far as wheat is concerned&mdash;I do not wish to go over all this again&mdash;we got last year roughly the equivalent of the decision taken by the Fianna Fáil Government on 22nd January, 1954&mdash; 300,000 tons of dried wheat.  We have had a discussion on that again and again and I do not want to weary the House by going into it further at this stage.  However, I want to stress this, lest there be any misapprehension, at the moment, that, in relation to any particular crop, we should not, just by some change in price one way or the other, merely have a switch from one form of agricultural production to another.  A switch is of no avail.  We must have increased production as a whole.  It suddenly occurs to me that I am incurring your displeasure, Sir, by touching on agricultural production having regard to the motion which Senator Cogan has on the Order Paper, so I had better leave that subject.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Buachalla also referred to grass meal.  I would like to have had time to go into the question of grass-meal production at some length, particularly in view of the fact that I was engaged elsewhere on the day it was discussed in the Dáil, when there were some statements made in regard to it which were entirely out of accord with the truth.  The fact in relation to grass-meal production is that the evidence of the directors at that time was that they had not in any way applied their minds to the possibility of an export market and that if there is a possibility of an export market for grass meal, it must be on a really competitive basis.  The only grass meal that can be produced on a really competitive basis is meal produced from grass on some of our mineral soils, not on bog.</P>
    <P>The experiments in progress now at Glenamoy will be of far greater value to the nation as a whole, if they are successful, than any grass meal factory would have been there.  The most that that could have shown would have been that it was possible to produce <Col N="859" /> grass and grass meal from bog.  It is more important to show that we can utilise our bogs for forestry and for agricultural production of a mixed sort, and if the Glenamoy experiments which we have started are successful, that is what we will have shown. Everybody knows that grass meal can be produced without any difficulty from ordinary good soil and if there is the export market that Senator Ó Buachalla thinks there is, then it is easy enough for these existing plants to expand their production to meet that demand.  I trust that they will do so.</P>
    <P>Senator Crowley referred to the drain there was from the country in relation to foreign insurance premiums. Naturally enough, we all have great pride in Irish insurance companies, but it is wrong to speak of the amount of the premium income being paid to foreign insurance companies as being equivalent to a net drain.  It is not. It is not even the amount of the gross premium, less claims, that is the drain, but the amount that there is after taking credit for such of it as is ploughed back here.</P>
    <P>Many foreign insurance companies do give our economy considerable assistance.  Some of them have widespread house purchase schemes.  Some of them have in the past assisted very substantially Dublin Corporation and other local authorities by lending them funds on mortgage and otherwise. Many of them have assisted our national loans in the past and I certainly would go as far as this with Senator Crowley and say that I hope in the future those companies will understand and appreciate that, when they are getting an income here from premiums in that way, they have a responsibility to plough back into our country the amount they are getting, and that they will show how appreciative they are of that responsibility in the future, as many of them have shown in the past&mdash;and I gladly pay tribute to them&mdash;by subscribing to the national loan when it comes along as I forecast in the Dáil the other day.</P>
    <P>Senator Crowley also referred to the question of a re-insurance pool.  There <Col N="860" /> was of course, a provision inserted in the 1936 Insurance Act for a re-insurance corporation.  I think the reason it was never established was that it was found that the spread of the risk in the country here would not be sufficient to achieve what it had been hoped to achieve at that time and that, on the contrary, it might have the effect rather of concentrating the risk in a way that would not be satisfactory. Insurance can only be effective if it is spread over the widest possible field.  There is, however, an arrangement, not made in so many words, not put in any formal scheme to the extent of a re-insurance corporation, that Irish insurance companies would work together to ensure that if one company is not able to take the whole of the risk itself, the first other company which is asked to come in on the risk with it is one of the other Irish companies and in that way without getting the danger of concentration one might get from re-insurance of the type to which the Senator referred, we do achieve the benefit of ensuring that, consistent with the spread of the insurance risks as much as possible, the money is kept amongst the companies carrying on business here.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch accused me of robbing the Road Fund.  I do not know whether &ldquo;robbing&rdquo; is the correct word, but let me say quite categorically that I have no hesitation in standing over the fact that I directed the transfer of £500,000 from the Road Fund to other more productive capital purposes.  I think it was a wise decision of the Government.  It was one which I will defend with the greatest pleasure anywhere throughout the country.  The Government have been very careful to ensure that, in their application of the Road Fund, more money will be spent on county roads.  This transfer, to which effect was given in the Finance Act recently before the House, will cause a change over from main trunk road allocations. At this stage, particularly with the great difficulties in respect to capital at present, I do not think we could possibly afford the type of main road polishing that any of us can see throughout many parts of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="861" /> Senator Guinness referred to our proximity to Britain and the natural effect that has upon our standard of living.  That is so.  Our proximity to Britain does cause difficulties for us. It is inevitable that we should be affected by what we read in the newspapers, most of which report British news so much, and that we should tend sometimes to forget that it is not the standard of living they can afford we can enjoy but the standard of living our production warrants.</P>
    <P>I visited part of the country recently and spoke to a friend of mine who had been doing the pedestrian job of canvassing in a certain area.  He had done a full day's canvassing and had come across 19 cases where people had emigrated from the area in which he was travelling.  That was distressing enough, but the extraordinary thing about it was that, in every single one of the 19 cases, he found the people concerned had left jobs to go to other jobs in England.  That is one of the most difficult things to understand about emigration at the present moment&mdash;not that our people are leaving because they are unable to find work, but that they are leaving jobs here to go and seek other jobs in Britain because of its proximity to us. As Senator Guinness pointed out, the proximity of Britain is the suction that draws our people away.  That is a far more difficult type of thing to deal with than the type we had in earlier years.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I have kept the Seanad a very long time, but there are still a couple of points to which I should like to refer.  Senator Fearon, in particular, suggested I should have put an escape clause in the Bill concerning this Order.  I must confess I disagree with him violently.  If I had put an escape clause in a Bill such as this, the effect of it would be to give the exact opposite impression to what must be created by the imposition of levies.  It is essential in imposing these levies that the Government see that they carry conviction to the people, that their imposition is absolutely necessary, regardless of the inconvenience that may be caused.  The insertion of such a clause as that referred to by Senator Fearon would detract very <Col N="862" /> much from that conviction.  Even though there may be one or two mistakes&mdash;there may be one or two mistakes when an Order covers 68 articles &mdash;it is much better that a genuine mistake should be made by including goods which were not meant to be included, than that anybody should feel there was an escape clause which would undoubtedly detract from the seriousness of the situation in the public mind.</P>
    <P>When speaking on hire purchase, the same Senator seemed to forget that pretty drastic restrictions on hire purchase were included in the series of actions taken by the Government last March, the effect of which undoubtedly is to prevent many of the abuses to which the Senator referred, and particularly the extended period abuse to which he referred, because, in respect of all goods now, there is a maximum period over which a hire purchase operation can continue.</P>
    <P>Other Senators referred to individual matters to which I shall give consideration at a later date in co-operation with the appropriate Ministers.  It so happens that one of the things mentioned by Senator Douglas is already reasonably familiar to me, that is, the sale of stamps for stamp collectors.  In the past, we have not had at all the happy experience that the Senator suggested other countries had.  If we had had that happy experience, I can assure him it would be a form of revenue collection from which I would not be in any way averse.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Seanad for the manner in which they discussed these two Bills, yesterday and to-day.  As I indicated when introducing them yesterday, the first Bill&mdash;the Bill confirming the imposition of levies&mdash;is one that the Government have brought in reluctantly, but which they brought in because they were absolutely determined to take every step that is necessary to preserve our economic independence. We would be lacking in our duty and we would be guilty of grave cowardice as a Government, if we failed to take the steps the situation demanded.</P>
    <P>I hope the steps that we have now <Col N="863" /> taken will be sufficient to maintain that economic independence.  I hope they will be sufficient to ensure that the value of our Irish currency will be maintained, <i>vis-a-vis</i> other currencies. I say that most specifically, in view of certain remarks that were made, not in this House but elsewhere, in the past few days.  I want to make it as clear as I can that I as Minister for Finance&mdash;and I know I have the backing of every single colleague of mine in the Government&mdash;am absolutely determined that any measure that is necessary to uphold the value of the Irish £ will be taken; that we will make certain that, in so far as we can, our economy will be expanded in order to be able to pay for the imports that we require; and that if unfortunately we are not able to pay for essential imports as we would wish, then we will have to restrict those imports, as we have done in this instance, because no matter what may come, no matter what temporary political embarrassment may be caused, this Government is determined that the State will pay its way and that we will put our economy on a sure and safe foundation on which we can maintain, and later improve, the standard of living of our people.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to one or two points that will arise on almost any section of the Bill and we might as well dispose of them now.  The Minister, in his speech a few minutes ago, referred to some remarks of mine and pointed out what he considered to be some paradoxes mentioned by me. Firstly, I want to point out that it is possible to give one's support to a thing and to disapprove of it very much, <Col N="864" /> at the same time.  I pointed out yesterday that I believe that in this measure we were approaching the problem from the wrong end and I suggested that, if I had my way, I would have approached it from a different angle altogether.  The Minister thinks differently and the House approves of what the Minister is doing, although I do not fully approve of it; but once this measure becomes law, as a citizen I will be in duty bound to support it and I will support it, and I give that assurance to the Minister.  There is not much point in splitting hairs in matters of that kind.</P>
      <P>Another thing, and it is important, is the reference to the question of private enterprise versus State projects.  I referred specifically to the difficulties in the West of Ireland.  Our Constitution declares for private enterprise but our Constitution also points out that, where it is necessary, State enterprise should aid private enterprise.  Yesterday I referred to the heavy drain of emigration on the West of Ireland. Private enterprise does not seem to be meeting the needs of the West of Ireland in the provision of employment, and, because of that, I made a case for the State itself taking greater interest in that area than it has been taking so far.  Surely there is no paradox in that?</P>
      <P>With regard to other matters, the question of wheat and so on, I made it clear that I saw difficulties in having a discussion on these things.  There were other points, other industries, which I might have recalled to him as being suitable for consideration, but it would have involved a going back on the activities of other years and that was one thing that I particularly wanted to avoid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope, with regard to his final reference to the Irish pound, that he will succeed in maintaining its value. If he does not, we will all suffer in consequence, but there is no use in our closing our eyes to the fact that the Irish pound has been devalued and has very much deteriorated as a result of the actions which we are taking now. As I said, there is nothing for us to do but to face the truth.  As a result of all these things, we will have money <Col N="865" /> in our hands that we will not be able to spend.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few remarks, because, as the House knows, this Bill gives the Minister power to borrow money over the next 12 months and I notice that during the whole course of the debate we have had, not one single reference was made to this question of borrowing.  It is because I regard this question as being of very great importance that I should like a little clarification from the Minister as to the policy to be pursued in connection with this borrowing.</P>
      <P>I notice that the figure mentioned is £73,093,280.  That appears to me to be a very large sum and I do not know what amount of that sum the Minister has in mind to borrow during the course of the year.  I think the Minister stated in the Dáil that it was his intention to float a loan sometime in the autumn, but, as would be expected, he did not indicate the conditions of the proposed loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing which emerges from the discussion that took place in the Dáil is that certain semi-State bodies who hitherto had the power and authority to borrow money in their own right will not now have it under whatever arrangement the Minister has come to. I, for one, regard that as a very great <Col N="866" /> departure from the traditional method that has been operating over the years and whether the seriousness of the times that presents itself to us justifies that departure is the question.  These semi-State organisations such as the E.S.B., C.I.E., as well as Dublin Corporation, had their autonomy and this appears to me to be a definite step towards depriving them of their autonomy and of the authority they had to regulate their own affairs.  I do not know&mdash;and the Minister has not told us &mdash;if this is to be a permanent feature of legislation for the years to come&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No; I want to know if this policy of the Minister to reserve to himself the sole right of borrowing, taking the right to borrow from the different bodies I have mentioned, is to be a permanent feature of the Government of the country over the years?  I think the Seanad would like a little clarification on that point from the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that, it was the Minister who introduced legislation into this House giving powers to the E.S.B. to borrow in their own right as a corporate body&mdash;powers they did not have before&mdash;in the hope that they might borrow for their own capital expenditure?  Now, after it has floated one successful borrowing, the Minister is, without legal power, I suggest, dictating to the E.S.B. so that they may not borrow without his consent. That is the point involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Senator does not understand the point involved, but that is not it.  Apart from the other consideration, the consideration of legal power is quite simple because the Minister for Finance must guarantee the issues, or would be asked to guarantee the issues of these other bodies and possibly also be <Col N="867" /> asked to underwrite them, and he would have the power that he would exercise in respect of that guarantee or underwriting arrangement.</P>
      <P>I perfectly understand the point made by Senator Kissane now&mdash;I did not understand it at first.  What is done in relation to capital issues at any time must be a matter to be determined by the position of the capital market at the appropriate moment.  If I had been asked last year what I would consider to be the appropriate disposition of the capital flotations for this year, I would have answered in exactly the same way as I am answering now.  It is difficult enough to see ahead for a matter of six or nine months to the end of this financial year, but it would be quite impossible and quite wrong that I should endeavour to suggest to the House that I was able to see the position in the capital market sufficiently clearly to be able to tell what should be done in the next financial year.  All I could do is say what I consider should be done in the circumstances of this financial year as they exist and as far as we can forecast them for the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as Section 2 itself is concerned, the amount that is included there is the aggregate of the appropriations which are summarised in totals on page 9 of the Bill at £114,797,738 less the sum of £36,200,000 that was voted already in the Vote on account and confirmed in the Central Fund Act.  The practice has grown up over the years&mdash;it has always been the same&mdash;that the amount put in Section 2 of the Appropriation Bill is the total of the appropriations, less the amount already voted on account, and there is no further significance in the £73,093,280 that is included in the section than that.  Why exactly the practice grew up like that I cannot say.  I should have to make some searches into history to discover that, but the Senator can be quite happy in the knowledge that I have no intention of borrowing £73,000,000.  It was put in like that originally, I suppose, in case not a penny of revenue came into the Exchequer and it was necessary to cover it.  It then became the pattern that was followed year in, year out. <Col N="868" /> Some time it might be worth while seeing whether it is worth changing it or not.  It is not a thing that does any positive harm, but I can appreciate the Senator not knowing why it was there. I may say I did not know why it was there the first time I brought an Appropriation Bill to the House, but I inquired and that is how I happen to know.</P>

      <P>I do not want to make any speech at all, but the Minister said that the alternative facing us in regard to public transport at the moment was complete curtailment of private transport. I think that was a slip on his part as I do not imagine he is trying to confuse the issue by suggesting that the term was used by anybody, least of all by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

Whether I said &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; or not, does not matter very much, because what I intended to imply was not that we wanted to choose one end or the other, but that they were at either end of the scale, and that it was between the two ends of the scale that we had to endeavour to see where a solution lay that would not be inimical to the national economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, perhaps, appropriate that a motion such as this, which aims at promoting an increase in our agricultural output, should be taken immediately after the Bill which has been debated for the past two days. We have been discussing the advisability of seeking ways and means of improving our external trade balance, and I think it will be accepted that there is no more effective means by which we can accomplish this than by increasing our agricultural output.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's presence here to-day.  I should like to take the opportunity of making a personal apology to him for an incident which happened on the last occasion here.  It will be remembered that the Minister left rather abruptly at the opening of my speech.  He evidently left because of something which he thought I was about to say.  I now sincerely apologise for whatever it was he thought I was about to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who represent the agricultural community listened to-day <Col N="870" /> with some resentment to a statement made on the other side of the House that more stern measures should be taken with the farmers and the agricultural community.  I should imagine that all sections of the community at the present time realise that the farming community&mdash;I mean both farmers and workers&mdash;are doing their best under difficult circumstances, contributing their best to the nation and contributing it for a declining reward. Over the past few months, there has been a persistent campaign to convince public opinion that the farmer is securing an excessive reward for his services to the community and is making an inadequate contribution to the general welfare and to the pool of national output.</P>
    <P>It is right and desirable that that campaign should be nipped in the bud. The latest figures at my disposal&mdash; those for February&mdash;show that, while the agricultural price index stood at 333 in February, 1955, it fell to 311 in February, 1956.  That is a substantial decline in the remuneration of the entire farming community.  When we come up against a campaign of this nature, it is right to point out that there is a grave misconception in regard to the agricultural income and, in particular, to the income of individual farmers.  It is necessary to point this out because we are being told that there is no use in doing anything for farmers, that they are already too well off, and, because they are too well off, they are sitting down and doing nothing.</P>
    <P>I admit it is difficult to secure a really accurate figure of the income of farmers.  There is a total figure&mdash; called in statistics the &ldquo;net income&rdquo;&mdash;of £114,000,000.  This only includes outlay on machinery and fertilisers and does not include labour, so that it is not really the true figure of net income.  Some time ago an investigation was held in Scotland to ascertain the net income in respect of a number of farms.  From the information I have, those farms appear to have been intensively worked.  The investigation was held by the Edinburgh and East Scotland College of Agriculture and it applied to four <Col N="871" /> different types of farms: arable, dairy, pig and poultry holdings and market gardening holdings.</P>
    <P>The significant thing is that this survey shows that, in the arable group of farms, the net income was £9 per acre, and this was in respect of East Scotland where prices are considerably higher than they are here.  In the case of the dairy farms, the average net income was £6 per acre, notwithstanding the fact that the gross output per acre amounted to £34 in the case of the arable group and to £43 in the case of the dairying group.  This showed that, although the farms were reasonably intensively worked, they produced a net income of only £9 per acre in one case and £6 per acre in the other case.  We can gather from those figures what the net income of a 30 or 40 acre farm would be.  It is no harm to have those figures in mind when people are inclined to suggest that the farmers are excessively rewarded for their services.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this debate is to endeavour to establish the urgent need for increased agricultural output.  It will be accepted on every side of the House that an increase in our agricultural output is desirable and it will also be accepted that it is possible.  When a thing is possible and desirable, we ought all to bend our energies towards achieving it.  The average net output of agriculture stood at 112 in 1945; it is 109 to-day.  That means that over a period of ten years, when great efforts were made in every direction to intensify farming, the total net output of agriculture declined by three points.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell too long upon these statistics, nor do I want to go into the points discussed by the Minister elsewhere as to whether those statistics are reliable or not.  We have the figures supplied to us in the <i>Irish Statistical Survey</i> by the Bureau of Statistics and, whether we like them or not, we have got to accept those figures.  The Minister often reminds me of one of those enthusiastic sportsmen who frantically applaud the referee when he gives a decision in favour of the enthusiast's own side, <Col N="872" /> but is quite prepared to boo the referee off the field when he gives a decision in favour of the other side. The Minister has been rather severe upon the manner in which these statistics are compiled, though, on occasion, he has used these statistics in an attempt to show that progress has been made under his administration.</P>
    <P>Now, he cannot have it both ways: he must either disagree completely with the official statistics or he must accept them completely.  I, as a farmer, knowing how these statistics are prepared and everything about them, am not absolutely convinced of their accuracy but I think they are reasonably accurate and that they, at any rate, show existing trends.  The trend they show at the moment is that, over the years since 1945, irrespective of a slight rise or a slight fall, there certainly has not been the significant increase in output that there should have been.  There is no use in quarrelling about one or two points in the index.  What we should be concerned about is the fact that there has not been an increase of 30 per cent., 40 per cent. or 50 per cent. in the total net output, the increase that could have been achieved and that has been achieved in other countries.</P>
    <P>I hope I shall approach this matter in a constructive way and, approaching it in a constructive way, I want to set out now as clearly as possible the suggestions I have to make in order to bring about increased agricultural output.  I will give them in what I consider to be their order of importance. First, we must establish a real agricultural council and not merely a hole-and-corner consultative council which the Minister may convene at his own convenience and which is not generally recognised; secondly, we must increase the use of fertilisers enormously; thirdly, we must ensure that, for the key products in intensive farming, there shall be a secure market and a guaranteed price; fourthly, credit facilities must be very substantially increased and improved for the ordinary farmer; and fifthly, our entire agricultural, educational and research services must be drastically and completely <Col N="873" /> overhauled.  Though I put that last, it is not the least important.</P>
    <P>These are the five points I want the Minister and the House to consider as absolutely essential in order to bring about an increased agricultural output, so essential if we are to preserve our present standard of living and hold even our existing population and prevent the country from becoming the laughing stock of Europe.  In this State, we have 15,000,000 acres of land, 12,000,000 acres of which is good agricultural land.  In other words, we have five acres per head of the population and 25 acres per family of five persons. If this nation, with those resources, were to go bankrupt, we would appear despicable in the eyes of the entire world.  If a member of this House were to meet a farmer on the street who asked him for the price of his supper and who told him that he was a poor man with a wife and three children and 25 acres of land, I wonder would that Senator be moved to compassion.</P>
    <P>If we cannot make a living for our people out of these resources, then we are not fit to enjoy the independence we have.  I suggest that, in setting up an agricultural council, we would be to a considerable extent lifting agriculture out of the more embittered type of Party politics.  I do not hold the view that agricultural policy should not be the function of the Oireachtas.  I do not hold the view that it should not be the duty of the Government to make decisions on agricultural policy and, since it is the duty of the Government to make decisions on agricultural policy, it is essential that such policy should be discussed here and in the Dáil.  We would like, however, to get away from the shallow, barren, futile type of discussion in which one Minister blames another for conditions over which the other Minister had no control and in which one Minister claims credit for achievements with regard to which he had nothing whatever to do.  If we can get away from that type of discussion, we will go a long way towards evolving a better agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>One of the advantages of having a <Col N="874" /> vocationally elected agricultural council is that the people who constitute that council&mdash;representatives of the farmers' associations and representatives of the workers; if organised, the workers would be entitled to representation&mdash;would go in prepared to discuss matters not from the point of view of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, but from the point of view of agriculture.  They might differ and they might have violent discussion, but discussion would not be directed along the lines of purely Party conflict.  In establishing such a council, therefore, we would lift agriculture away from the barren and futile type of discussion which we have so frequently had in relation to agriculture in the past.</P>
    <P>That council would provide for representation of every truly representative vocational agricultural organisation. Tests, of course, would have to be applied, but that would not be an insurmountable difficulty.  Such a council would be an even better way of dealing with this matter rather than following the precedent in Great Britain where the Government meet the representatives of the National Farmers' Union because, on the council I suggest, there would be representation of both the agricultural organisations and the agricultural workers themselves.  Such a council is, of course, only the first step towards the evolving of a better and more effective agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>The second point in the programme which I have outlined is that we must encourage the use of fertilisers.  Increased output in agriculture is like increased output in any other industry. It depends upon the amount of raw materials you put into the industry. The output of a factory depends to a great extent upon the input of raw material.  Fertilisers are one of the essential raw materials of agriculture and a very important essential, because even relatively good land, or what appears to be relatively good land, has shown that it will produce absolutely worthless crops, if some particular chemical element is missing, so that, until all the various chemical elements required are put into the <Col N="875" /> land, we cannot expect to get from the land the output that is desirable.</P>
    <P>In this connection, it is almost startling to realise how low we are on the list of fertiliser-using nations.  It is hard to believe that a nation with our reputation for education and intelligence, with our reputation for producing the best agricultural scientists in the world, could fall so low in regard to the consumption of fertilisers.  I have figures showing the consumption of fertilisers in European countries for the year 1954-55 and the figures I am giving are tons per 1,000 acres of arable land.</P>

      <P>I think this is arable land and I am dealing only with arable land.  I was going to say that the figures are taken from the F.A.O. monthly bulletin of agricultural economics and statistics for April, 1956.  In the Netherlands, the total amount is 76.3 tons per 1,000 acres. The Netherlands is first on the list. Ireland is 14th on the list with 9.1 tons per 1,000 arable acres.  I might add that there are only three countries below Ireland: Spain, Yugoslavia and Greece.  In other words, in the matter of using fertilisers, we are away down the line along with the primitive peasants of the Balkan States, and if that position is to continue, we cannot expect an increased output from our land.</P>
      <P>It is no harm, when considering this matter, to point out that, while we are third lowest in Europe as far as the utilisation of fertilisers is concerned, we are the third highest as far as price is concerned.  I have here a list of prices which shows that the country paying the highest price for fertilisers is Turkey.  The country paying the second highest price is Switzerland and the country paying the third highest price is Ireland.  Turkey pays £90; Switzerland, £89; and Ireland £79.  The lowest prices are in respect of Denmark with £50 which is a long way down on the list and Austria with £41 which is still further down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>No; it is £50.  In any event, in regard to fertilisers, tons and cwts. do not mean very much.  You have got to take the content.  I am simply pointing out the place of Ireland on the price list and Ireland's place appears to be very high.  I am not blaming the Minister or any Government for that.  I think that has been the position for a considerable time. The question is: can anything be done to bring about a reduction in the basic price of fertiliser to this country?  Is there anything we can do?  First of all, we have got to ask ourselves what are the reasons Denmark can purchase these fertilisers so much cheaper than we.  Have they got some special concessions in the producing countries and have they got some special concessions in regard to shipping, or what is the real reason?</P>
      <P>I should like to see a thorough research into that question, but, in addition to that, I should like to see some effort made to ensure that at whatever price the raw materials for fertilisers can be purchased abroad, the margin between that price and the price ultimately charged to the farmers is reduced to the very lowest margin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Irish Sugar Company have done good work in this respect, and they have contributed to a certain extent in bringing down the price of fertilisers, but, unfortunately, they have not been able to do very much.  Our fertiliser prices are still altogether too high.  I may be touching upon what I intend to say later in regard to credit, but, perhaps, it is better to deal with it now.  I wonder could the Government assist in the matter of credit for the farmers or co-operative societies and of securing fertilisers in bulk and storing them?  I know that it would materially aid in bringing down the price of fertilisers, if a certain amount of credit were given to the farmers for the purchase of fertilisers at the season of the year when they are cheapest.  That is one way that would be effective, or partly effective, in this respect.  We know that the storage of <Col N="877" /> fertilisers by merchants costs a considerable amount.  If the farmer could be financed to purchase fertilisers in the summer or autumn rather than in the spring, it would tend to bring down the price.</P>
    <P>It is appalling that we use so little fertilisers.  Our imports are in or about £5,000,000 worth per annum.  That represents less than 10/- per acre.  We cannot expect a substantial increase in production from an outlay of 10/- per acre on agricultural land.</P>
    <P>Could we not have research into the question of the production of nitrogenous manures in this country?  It is a matter for consideration.  We often hear that the requirements of the country are not sufficient to justify the enormous expense involved in setting up a manufacturing plant, but, if we were to think in terms of our requirements if we were using the maximum amount of fertilisers, it might be possible to justify the setting up of a manufacturing industry here.  I will say that the only justification, or the main justification, for setting up such a manufacturing industry would be the provision of fertilisers at a price cheaper than the price at which we can import fertilisers.  If that could not be done, it would not be justified. The matter is worthy of investigation.</P>
    <P>Another matter that is worthy of investigation is the question whether or not it would pay the community in general to subsidise the price of fertilisers, or of certain types of fertilisers, or even the supply of fertilisers to the smaller farmers.  Many of our large farmers, those who are seeking to increase output, use fertilisers very extensively and have no prejudice against the use, of fertilisers, but many small farmers are strongly prejudiced against the use of fertilisers, and a subsidy, even if confined to farmers under a certain valuation, would certainly justify itself, because our main concern in the development of agriculture should be to ensure that our small farmers in particular are producing their maximum as they are the larger number and are the more important.</P>
    <P>It will be remembered that the Government, in 1940, introduced a lime subsidy scheme.  There is no doubt that that scheme grew in popularity.  In <Col N="878" /> 1947, we were expending about £100,000 per annum on that scheme and we are now expending about £700,000 on the subsidisation of lime.  Every penny of that money is well spent.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is here, it would be no harm to correct a false impression which he has in regard to ground limestone. He has stated on a number of occasions that there was no ground limestone produced in this country prior to 1948.  In actual fact, ground limestone was manufactured in County Wicklow on a very large scale from 1941 and in 1943 there was an output of 180 to 200 tons per week.  That was a fairly substantial beginning, but it was only a beginning and, in the main, was only experimental.  Great credit is due to the firm that undertook that experiment.  It is no harm that that false impression should be removed.</P>
    <P>The production of ground limestone was not due to any brain-wave on the part of the Minister.  It took place as a result of research into our agricultural needs and how to meet them.  It was due, in the main, to the enterprise of a progressive business firm.  As far as the subsidisation of ground limestone is concerned, the credit must go in the main to the E.C.A. representative here, Mr. Paul Millar, and that credit should be given to him.  I mention that because a precedent was established in the subsidisation of ground limestone which might be followed, at any rate to a limited extent, in regard to fertilisers generally.</P>
    <P>To the question of fertilisers, there are two or three approaches.  One is to see if it is possible to bring down the price of the raw material or the imported fertiliser.  The second is to provide credit facilities for the purchase of fertilisers.  The third would be subsidisation, if not for all farmers, at least for the smaller farmers.  That might and should lead to an expansion of the use of fertilisers.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that over the past seven or eight years, in one particular branch of agriculture, at any rate, the value of fertilisers has been very clearly established, that is, in regard to the growing of cereals.  It has been proved that by the use of a compound <Col N="879" /> fertiliser good grain crops can be grown&mdash;wheat, barley and oats&mdash;on land which formerly did not yield satisfactory crops.</P>
    <P>I have dwelt on the question of fertilisers because it is on the import of raw materials that we must depend for increased output and we must face up to the need for a very substantial increase in the use of fertilisers.  That may affect our balance of payments in one way, that, instead of spending £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 on the importation of fertilisers, we may have to spend £15,000,000 or £20,000,000, but we can reap a reward in increased output and increased exports which will completely justify that expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is idle to tell the farmer to increase output without showing him how he will benefit not only the country but himself by doing so. Everybody recognises that increased output of agricultural produce will confer an immense benefit on the community. Every farmer knows that increased output does not always confer an immense benefit on himself. There are many farmers farming for low output who secure just as high a net return as if they were farming very intensively.</P>
    <P>Only yesterday I was speaking to one of the most intensive farmers in Wicklow, a man who is getting the last ounce of productivity out of every acre.  He even levelled every fence on his land in order to enlarge the size of his holding and to avail of every scheme for the improvement of his land.  Nevertheless, he told me that, in spite of everything he had done, he doubted if he was making as much money as some of his neighbours who followed the old-fashioned way of permanent pasture, low expenditure and low output.  That is a strange thing, but it is true.  We have to fight against that viewpoint.</P>
    <P>We have to widen the margin between the man who is farming intensively and the man who is farming not so intensively.  We can apply this to business.  A man may own a factory and may be making a net profit of £1,000 a year.  He may enlarge that factory, install new machinery and <Col N="880" /> employ more men.  At the end of all his efforts, he may still get only the same net profit of £1,000 a year.  It is just the same in regard to agriculture. For that reason, I think it is the duty of the State to come down firmly on the side of the farmer who is farming intensively.  There are a number of methods by which that can be done.  One way is by securing the market and the price for certain essential products of intensive farming.  I would say it is not in the power of the State to guarantee a price for such things as cattle or sheep, because, in the main, they are governed by the law of supply and demand.  However, it is in the power of the State to guarantee the price of milk, bacon, pigs, wheat, barley, oats, sugar beet and, perhaps, seed potatoes.</P>
    <P>With regard to milk, at present there is a guaranteed price, but there is widespread discontent in regard to it and it is time that discontent were cleared away completely.  The milk producers&mdash;certainly in Leinster&mdash;are very intensive farmers: every producer should be an intensive farmer.  Security of price for milk is something which put the foundation stone under agriculture. The foundation of good farming is the cow.  On a number of occasions the Minister said he would like to see the number of cows increased.  Unquestionably there is room, from every standpoint, for an increase in the number of cows.  The number has remained more or less stationary at about 1,250,000.  If we were to stock this country properly I think that number could be brought up to at least 2,000,000.</P>
    <P>However, the man who is going to increase the number of his cows is entitled to know what price he will get for his milk not merely in the present year, but for the next three years at least, so that he will have a chance of investing money in a dairy herd, if he is not already in the business.  Furthermore, he will have a certain amount of security in spending money, if necessary, on the improvement of his dairy buildings.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that there should be any wrangling about the price of milk.  I <Col N="881" /> think the Minister should take steps immediately to reach finality on this matter by announcing whatever price he has in mind.  The general forecast is that the price will be increased but, in addition to increasing the price, I think he would do even better if he guaranteed it for at least three years and put the security of the State behind a guarantee to the farmers that if they supplied milk to the creameries, the price and market will be secure for a period of at least three years.  I know there are difficulties in this matter, but difficulties are things that have to be faced.  We cannot have a secure agricultural economy unless we start off with a sound and sufficient dairy herd of about 2,000,000 cows.</P>
    <P>Consider the present dairy herds.  We have 12,000,000 arable acres of land in this country and we have about 1,000,000 cows.  That represents practically a cow to every 12 acres.  It will be agreed that that is not an adequate stocking of land.  I do not want to delay the House now, but I have the figures somewhere of the stocks in Denmark.  They are almost double what we have&mdash;not quite double, but almost so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the stock of cows per 1,000 acres there is greater by 50 per cent. than the number we have here.  They have fewer sheep, but I think we could bring our dairy herd up to 2,000,000 without overstocking the country.  Phrases like &ldquo;one more cow&rdquo; are merely silly, because&mdash;I admit every farmer's circumstances differ&mdash;with the low average stocks in the country, there are some farmers who already have too many cows on their smallholdings, while there are other farmers with too few cows on their holdings.  In the Midlands, you will find farms of say, 200 acres carrying only two cows.  It is futile to tell these farmers to carry &ldquo;one more cow.&rdquo;  There are also a number of people who would like to keep more cows&mdash;and I have met them&mdash;but who find it impossible to raise the capital for that purpose.  It is sad but true that, in our present banking and financial arrangements, there is no real <Col N="882" /> credit for an extension of agriculture in that respect.</P>
      <P>I was rather shocked to hear the Minister say, in regard to the Milk Costings Commission that those who organised the protest against the Minister's failure to increase the price had the costings report in their pockets.  Of course that was not true and it was the kind of statement which would only make for discontent, rancour and ill feeling.  I hope the Minister will avail of this opportunity to correct it.  The whole position in regard to the costings investigation is entirely unsatisfactory and it is a pity that that should have happened, because costings should be the basis of a real and true approach to the improvement of agricultural output.</P>
      <P>There is at present a guaranteed price for pigs, and I welcome that. However, the floor that is being put under pig prices is altogether too low at present production costs.  I would not stress that point too strongly, but the point I should like to stress more particularly is that there is a sort of uncertainty as to the duration of the guarantee.  I have been speaking to people engaged in the pig feeding business and they have not been able to secure any information as to how long the guarantee will last.  The Minister should make a clear statement on that.  I do not know how long in advance it is possible for a Minister to guarantee a price, but, if it were possible, there should be, in regard to milk, a guarantee for at least three years and in regard to pigs for at least 18 months.  That would give the farmer a certain amount of security in the purchase of a sow and in the breeding of pigs for fattening.</P>
      <P>The problem about pigs is, and always has been, that supplies have fluctuated violently from year to year. I have here the figures showing the numbers delivered to factories for the week ended 31st July last and for the corresponding week of the previous two years.  In 1956, the number of pigs supplied during that week to the factories was 17,600; in 1955, it was 22,700; and in 1954, it was 24,500.  The figure for 1956 represents a sharp decline by comparison with the previous two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> The Minister will recall that, immediately upon taking office, he met representatives of the Farmers' Association or Macra na Feirme&mdash;I do not know which&mdash;and he said: &ldquo;Pig prices have taken a bit of a wobble, but give me time and I will straighten it out.&rdquo; The Minister has had two years since then, and the wobble in the price of pigs and in the numbers, at any rate, has continued.  A good many sows, tens of thousands of them, have wobbled away to the nearest bacon factory and that is an entirely unsatisfactory position.  It did not begin, I want to say in fairness to the Minister, when the Minister took office and it did not begin when this State was established.  We have always had this violent fluctuation in price and supply. I hope now that the position will be rectified and that the price of pigs will be guaranteed for a period of at least 18 months.  It may be that the Minister has in mind a longer period.  I do not want to make any excessive demand, but the pig producers are entitled to a guarantee over a period of 18 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I pass from the question of eggs merely with the statement that a reasonable guarantee could have been given to the producers.  I think such a guarantee should be followed by the establishment of a co-operative marketing organisation, as far as possible on national lines.</P>
      <P>I think the price of wheat should be increased to £4 a barrel, with a guarantee.  I hold there is never any necessity to guarantee the price of wheat, or any cereal, for more than a year.  I want to say in this connection that, when I made the case previously for an increase in the price of wheat to £4 a barrel, the Minister left the House rather abruptly and consequently did not hear the case I made. He raised one point then with regard to the price of wheat which deserves to be dealt with.  His case was that if a situation arose in which there appeared to be a likelihood of a surplus, the Government had no alternative but to reduce the price.  I controverted that at the time and I do so again now.  There are a number of alternatives, but the alternative I would recommend is that, if you think the acreage will go too high&mdash;I do not think that is likely&mdash;the alternative would be to raise the price of some other cereal which would have the effect of bringing down the acreage of wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no necessity at all to bring down the price of wheat.  Having regard to our balance of payments position, we import too much wheat. We import about £5,000,000 worth of wheat annually.  We should seriously consider the question of raising the <Col N="887" /> percentage of Irish wheat in our loaf. It has been proved that a 100 per cent. Irish loaf can be used, but, without going so far, it should be possible to use a four-fifths native grist.  For that, we would need a substantial increase in the wheat acreage.</P>
    <P>With regard to barley, I think the Minister fixed the price too low, having regard to the prices of other feeding stuffs imported from abroad.  I believe that a minimum of 45/- would be a fair price.  The Minister's predecessor fixed the minimum price for barley at 48/- per barrel and I think he was wise in doing so.  If the price could be restored to that figure, it would be very desirable, but if we are to have a permanent fixed minimum price, I think 45/- would be fair and reasonable.  In regard to barley, I want to say there should be a clear cut policy in favour of a readily available market, so that it would be possible to dispose of the crop immediately after harvesting.</P>
    <P>Farmers are a little worried in regard to barley, not so much about price, because they can count upon getting a price somewhat in advance of the fixed minimum.  However, there is the question as to whether the crop will be taken off the farmer's hands immediately after threshing.  That is an important consideration which should get full attention.  There is scope for enormous expansion in the acreage under barley.  We imported in the region of £5,000,000 worth of maize last year.  We could have produced enough barley to eliminate the necessity for that importation.  I believe that an annual production of 300,000 acres of feeding barley would not be an excessive target.  One can imagine what the benefits of such a production would be to the farming community and to the State generally.  The acreage under barley has been substantially increased this year; I hope that increase will continue next year.</P>
    <P>With regard to oats, I want to compliment the Minister on promoting last year a scheme for the growing of oats under contract.  The Minister will recall that he and I had a <Col N="888" /> violent quarrel with regard to the price of oats in 1948.  I contended it was possible to guarantee a price for oats by the introduction of a contract system.  That has now been done to a limited extent.  I say &ldquo;limited&rdquo; because I am surprised more publicity is not given to this system.  I have met a number of farmers who are not aware contracts are available.  There are a number of towns where they cannot get this system from the merchants who, in turn, are not aware of its existence. In this connection, I have nothing whatever to say with regard to price. In 1948, I fought for a price of 28/- per barrel, whereas the minimum price under the present system is 40/- &mdash;41/- for oats bushelling 40.  That is a reasonably good price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have finished with the question of prices.  I should like to dwell very briefly on the question of credit facilities.  There is, at the present time, a credit squeeze which affects the farmers rather severely.  Banks are tightening up on credit: the farmer who happens to have an overdraft is reminded of it.  The merchant is also being restricted to a certain extent, with the result that he finds it difficult to extend credit to the farmers. In view of the national position, I am not suggesting that there should be an unlimited loosening up of credit, but I am suggesting that, for certain important objectives, credit should be provided to an increased extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be better credit facilities for the purchase of cows with a view to improving dairy herds, particularly in view of the matter that will come up for discussion on the next motion.  Apart from that, in view of the need to enlarge dairy herds, special credit facilities should be given to any farmer who cannot obtain the necessary money to purchase cows through the banks or the Credit Corporation.  I know several farmers who had to change over to the creamery system of dairying and who consequently wanted to <Col N="889" /> enlarge their dairy herds.  They tried the banks and the Agricultural Credit Corporation, but their applications were rejected, without any reason as far as I can find out.  That is an absurd position which should be remedied.</P>
    <P>All we want is that the Department of Agriculture would step in in regard to certain types of loans, underwrite them or guarantee them, provided they have the necessary safeguards that the loans are for specially desirable purposes.  Those specially desirable purposes, I would say, are the enlargement of dairy herds, the provision of fertilisers and perhaps the provision of good type breeding ewes, because I think our sheep herds should also be improved and increased.  Increases for other proposals could be allowed to take a chance under ordinary commercial conditions.</P>
    <P>The last point to which I propose to refer is that educational and research facilities should be drastically changed and here, in order to be as brief as possible, it would be best to submit to the House with my endorsement, the suggestions made by the joint commission of Macra na Feirme and the National Farmers' Association on the question of the Agricultural Institute.  The commission recommended:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The proposed Agricultural Institute should take over the functions of the Department of Agriculture in connection with the advisory services.</P>
    <P>(2)  The service should continue to operate on a county basis, and the county committees of agriculture should be strengthened by increased co-option of leading farmers, by becoming corporate bodies, and by being given a measure of financial autonomy.</P>
    <P>(3)  The employment of advisers by groups of farmers as in Barryroe and Boherbue should be encouraged, and subsidised, when sufficient advisers are available.  County and specialist services should be available to such groups.</P>
    <P>(4)  We do not approve the Department's &ldquo;Parish Plan&rdquo; in its present <Col N="890" /> form for the reasons outlined in the report.  Two over-lapping public advisory services would only lead to confusion, and a lack of co-ordination.</P>
    <P>These four recommendations are set out very clearly and are self-explanatory. The Minister, I think, has indicated that he is not prepared to accept the first one, to hand over the advisory services of the Department to the Agricultural Institute.  It is difficult to know what is his reason for that decision.  As far as I know, most vocational bodies control the system of education and research in regard to their particular vocations. Why should not agriculture as a vocation control its own system of education and its own system of research and it can control them through the Agricultural Institute on which farmers would have a substantial representation?</P>
    <P>I am quite in agreement that agricultural policy as such should not be handed over to any vocational body and could not be handed over, because it is the function of the Government itself and of Parliament, but advisory services and agricultural education could very properly be handed over to the Agricultural Institute.  I entirely agree with the recommendation in regard to the parish plan.  We all approve of a parish plan in the sense in which it was outlined by Canon Hayes, which is that the parish should have a certain kind of local parliament which could consult with, and help in, the administration not only of agriculture but of other services.  There never seems to be any justification for setting up two separate types of organisation for agricultural education and advice.</P>

      <P>My remarks will now be brought to a finish.  I have said that in my county we have an agricultural instructor for less than 1,000 farmers. We have set up in one district a local district committee representative of the various farmers.  At the same time, we accept the county committee as the governing body for the county.  The local district committee consults with and assists the local agricultural inspector, and that is the better type of organisation rather than disrupting the whole system by having two advisory services cutting across each other and having the agricultural instructor of the county committee crossing the territory of the agricultural instructor of the parish plan.  That is the kind of confusion that makes for bad administration.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Cogan that the delay in presenting the report of the Milk Costings Commission is deplorable and I have made that view known in public, and I have explained to the Dáil, as I now wish to explain to the Seanad, that I am resolved not to abridge the autonomy conferred by my late predecessor on this committee, and therefore do not feel justified in giving it any direction in regard to the performance of its function; but I understand that two members of the committee, Mr. Fehily and Mr. Hill, have recently interviewed the director, and I trust the representations made by them to him in the course of the last fortnight will bear early fruit and that the director will bring his report to the costings committee at an early date.</P>
      <P>There are a few points specifically made by the Senator who proposed this motion to which I would like to refer briefly, before turning to the general subject matter of the motion. At column 678 of Volume 46, No. 8, the Senator refers to the <i>Irish Statistical Survey</i> for 1955 and he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;From a base of 100 in 1938, the manufacture of transportable goods has gone up to almost 200.  On the other hand from a base of 100 in 1938, the volume of agricultural output, both gross and net has increased by only nine points, and this in face of the fact that nearly every comparable European country has increased its output, since the termination of the war, by as much as 50 per cent. and, in some cases, more.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest to the Seanad that it is disingenuous to compare the performance <Col N="893" /> of European countries as from a date immediately after the war with the performance of Irish agriculture as from 1938.  You must compare like with like; but if you want to make the comparison for agricultural output in Ireland to-day with agricultural output in Ireland at the termination of the war, I will submit to the Seanad that an increase in gross output of approximately 32 per cent. has been accomplished by the Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>I circulated for the benefit of Senators a table setting out the gross agricultural output, including and excluding turf, and the net agricultural output, including and excluding turf, for the years 1938, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1954, and 1955.  I believe that the most significant return is that representing the gross output, excluding turf.  I do not regard turf in our circumstances as an agricultural product.  I do not regard net output as a significant figure, because I think, as the Senator pointed out, net output sky-rocketted during the war, and when speaking to-day, he pointed out that if you get a high output from fertilised land, without putting back into the land fertilisers, or feeding stuffs which are converted into dung and thus fertilise the land, you may get a very large output with a small input.  That reveals a very high net output, but that is not a criterion of good farming. That is a criterion of mining your land. If you take everything out of the land and put nothing back, you get a very high net return, but a good farmer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying, that criterion is, in fact, the criterion of the success with which you mine your land and a good farmer getting a similar return from his land and putting in an abundance of fertiliser to replace what is taken out, or providing quantities of feeding stuff for his stock which is converted into manure and returned to the land, might have a very much lower net return but would, in fact, be using his land to real advantage.</P>
      <P>If you take the gross return over a number of years, you get a figure which is not affected, whether the farmer is, in fact, mining his land or not.  You have the certainty that if the farmer is consistently mining his land, there would emerge the figure of diminishing returns.  Therefore, if you take the gross production over a period of years&mdash;and the important thing to remember is that statistics are rarely of any significance, except when taken over a period of years&mdash; you find that, in 1947, to the base 1938-39 of 100, gross agricultural output in Ireland was 87.8.  I am not going to go into the reason why gross agricultural output in 1947 was 87.8 of what it was in 1938-39.</P>

      <P>That was approximately an increase of 32 per cent. on our gross agricultural output, excluding turf, but including annual changes in stocks as between 1947 and 1955.</P>
      <P>That performance, while giving us no grounds for complacency, should, I think, finally dispose of the suggestion that I thought I detected in the Senator's observations, that it was fitting and proper that the farmers of this country should be held up to the ridicule of Europe for their failure to compare with other countries of Europe in the increase in their output. I think, considering the point of departure at which they had to start, bearing in mind the massive assistance that was forthcoming through Marshall Aid to countries like Denmark and Holland as compared with the minuscule assistance available to us from a similar source, that performance of our farmers, in all the circumstances, has not been discreditable.  I confidently hope that it can be improved upon in future, and I will suggest to the Seanad before I sit down that we are, I hope, taking steps to help the farmers to that end.</P>
      <P>The Senator, at column 681 said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am not suggesting for a moment that Parliament should resign its function of having the final decision in regard to policy, and in regard to agricultural policy in particular, but I am suggesting that a truly representative agricultural council should be consulted in the fullest and most serious way, openly and publicly consulted in regard to agricultural policy before it is decided upon.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator said to-day that he did not consider that the existing consultative councils were of any value for that <Col N="896" /> purpose.  I can assure the Seanad that, over and above the consultative councils&mdash;which, I think, have a value &mdash;regular and constant consultation takes place between myself and the N.F.A. and the various committees of the N.F.A., Macra na Feirme and the I.C.A., when they seek an interview with me.  I do not agree with the Senator that it would be of any assistance to conduct these discussions in public.  On the contrary, I believe that free and friendly discussion with such organisations in private, when both the Minister and these organisations can speak openly and freely to one another, are very much more valuable than public disputation between them would be.</P>
    <P>At column 683 the Senator said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If you get down to the root of the matter and you want to ensure that the maximum output is secured from the land, you have to concentrate on encouraging the intensive farmer.  There is no question in this connection of compulsion.  We in Fianna Fáil, as a Party, have never believed in compulsion in regard to agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it is proper to place on record that, in 1948, a general election was fought in this country, and one of the planks in the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party at that time was that compulsory tillage should constitute a permanent feature of our agricultural policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already referred to our gross agricultural production. There are certain other facts in regard to agriculture to which, I think, the attention of the Seanad might properly be directed.  It is not infrequently suggested that the output of the farmers has not increased as might reasonably be expected; but I submit for the information of the Seanad the index number of the volume of gross output&mdash; in this case, including turf, because I have not got it excluding turf&mdash;per male person engaged in agriculture. Taking the base year as 1938, the output per male engaged in agriculture in 1926-27 was 86; in 1947, it was 98; and in 1954, it was 139.  That represents an increased output per male person engaged in agriculture&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of 62 per cent. as compared with 1926-27, which is, of course, an indication of the increasing mechanisation of the agricultural industry and of the fact that, with that increased mechanisation and efficiency of the industry, there has been manifested in this country that which has appeared in every other country in the <Col N="898" /> world&mdash;a drift from the land to the cities.  Remarkably enough, that tendency seems to have been halted here in Ireland, but it is right for the Seanad to remember that it is not peculiar to Ireland.  It is of universal application, and is most dramatically demonstrated in the U.S.A., where, 50 years ago, 60 per cent. of the population lived on the land and 40 per cent. lived in the cities.  To-day 12 per cent. live on the land and 88 per cent. live in the cities.  A similar trend is manifesting itself in every country in Europe and is a source of perplexity to every Government in Europe, where it is regarded as an undesirable development.</P>
      <P>I think Ireland is, perhaps, one of the countries in Europe where that trend of people from the land to the cities shows some signs of being checked; but it will be well for the Seanad to remember that the efficiency of the agricultural industry shows a very substantial increase in the output per male worker engaged, and the result of that has been that those who now get their living on the land are enjoying a higher standard of living than they enjoyed 20 years ago. That is something over which we should greatly rejoice, and it is worth nothing and remembering.</P>
      <P>I want the Seanad to be informed about certain fundamental facts in regard to where the agricultural industry now stands because I think it is a very bad policy to keep up a constant howl of derogation of the farming community, with the implied suggestion that they are inferior to every other farming community in Europe, when that is demonstrably false, if one has regard to the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In last year, 1955, the total output of cattle, including changes in stock, amounted to 1,048,000 head.  That is the highest figure ever recorded since statistics were first kept in this country.  The intake of creamery milk in the first six months of this year amounted to 113,900,000 gallons, which is the highest delivery of milk to creameries in Ireland ever recorded since statistics were first kept.  The export of cattle in the first six months of this year, in all forms, amounted to 364,019 head; last year, it amounted <Col N="899" /> to 403,516.  That is largely accounted for by the fact that, for reasons into which it is unnecessary to go in detail to-night, in the spring months of last year, the price of fat cattle rose to unprecedented and, I think, now admitted to be, fantastic heights, reaching in some cases £9 per cwt. That resulted in quite exceptional exports of cattle on the hoof.</P>
    <P>If we are to compare the export of cattle in the first six months of 1956 with the first six months of 1954, when the price per cwt. was something about the same order, we find that the exports for the first six months of 1956 were 364,019 head and the exports for the first six months of 1954 were 355,581.  That figure, standing alone, would give ground for encouragement: but, when it is taken in association with the fact that the numbers of our cattle have been increased substantially over last year according to the January census, then we have reason to hope that the future exports of live stock can and will be as good as, or better than, those that have taken place in the past.</P>
    <P>I have here some preliminary figures for the month of July.  They are not without encouragement, but they refer only to live cattle which have been exported to Great Britain and the Continent, excluding Northern Ireland and excluding all carcase meat.  Cattle shipped to Great Britain and the Continent in the month of July, 1954, amounted to 31,357; in 1955, 35,518; and in 1956, 45,380.  I think it may be right to remind the Seanad that the figures for the total cattle population in January, 1956, show an increase of 86,500 over the figure for 1955.  As Senator Cogan pointed out, the figures for sheep show an encouraging increase of 195,600.  Pigs have been declining, but I hope to satisfy the Seanad that we are now taking measures to ensure that that decline shall not only be arrested, but reversed.</P>
    <P>With the exception of 1954-1955, which was a very wet year, and 1945-46, I think that the mill intake of wheat constitutes a record.  It is interesting to observe that, though many people <Col N="900" /> believe that our purchases of wheat are increasing, the fact is that the average annual purchase in the period 1945 to 1947 amounted to 2,719,000 cwt.  Our average annual purchase in the period 1948 to 1950, inclusive, amounted to 3,700,000 cwt.  Our average annual imports of wheat in the three-year period 1951 to 1953, inclusive, amounted to 5,344,000 cwt; and our average annual imports in the two-year period 1954 to 1955, inclusive, amounted to 2,349,000 cwt.  I think the Seanad may be glad to know that the acreage of feeding barley this year will constitute, unless I am greatly mistaken, a record for all time.</P>
    <P>Now, what of the future?  I must plead guilty to having a pragmatical mind.  I agree entirely with the proposition that increased agricultural production is essential for the economic wellbeing of this country, inasmuch as our main, if not our only, natural resource is 12,000,000 acres of arable land, and it is on that 12,000,000 acres of arable land that the people live and get their living.  I think if I induce them to increase output, they are entitled to ask me: &ldquo;On what lines do you suggest we should go?&rdquo;  Now, I do not think they are entitled to ask me in detail: &ldquo;What is each one of us to do upon our own holding?&rdquo;  I do not think it is the duty or function of a Minister for Agriculture to pretend that he is competent to give any such detailed advice; but if I am asked, as I think farmers are entitled to ask: &ldquo;On what lines should our increased output go?&rdquo;  I would answer them quite reasonably: &ldquo;If you kept five cows in the past, try to keep seven hereafter: if you kept ten in the past, try to keep 14 hereafter: if you kept 20 in the past, try to keep 28 hereafter.&rdquo;  Farmers hearing that advice are, I think, entitled to ask: &ldquo;How are we to keep seven where we kept five, 14 where we kept ten, and 28 where we kept 20: how will they survive on the same acreage of land?&rdquo;  and to that I am entitled to reply: &ldquo;On 90 per cent. of the holdings of Ireland, there is an increased potential available to every farmer who will realise it&rdquo; and that is on the grassland of his holding.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, we have <Col N="901" /> 12,000,000 acres, of which we might aspire to bring 4,000,000 under tillage in any given year.  That leaves 8,000,000 under grass.  God bestowed upon this country an invaluable asset of an annual average rainfall of 42 inches, equally distributed over the 12 months of the year, a temperate climate, the Gulf Stream and the greatest market for live stock in the world at our backdoor. If we are to exploit these four advantages to the greatest extent, then we should make every acre of grass in this country produce its maximum.</P>
    <P>I have said before in public, and I now wish to repeat it, that I believe the tillage techniques of our farmers compare favourably with those of any farmers in the world, but our exploitation of the potentialities of the grassland of the country falls far short of what it should be.  If I am asked by farmers: &ldquo;Where do we fail?&rdquo;, I am prepared to answer them that they fail in the user of phosphate, potash and lime on their grassland.  And I say to farmers generally it is well within the capacity of the vast majority to undertake the increase in the number of their cattle suggested by me, if they will use adequate quantities of phosphate, potash and lime on their grassland, with the proviso that, within certain limits, reseeding may be necessary.</P>
    <P>If they are in any doubt or ambiguity as to what course it is requisite for them to follow, they may have recourse to the agricultural instructor or parish agent in their own vicinity who will give them clear and certain counsel on what fertilisers they should employ and where the improvement cannot be achieved without recourse to reseeding.</P>
    <P>I would recall to the Seanad that we have at the present time a guaranteed price for wheat, beet, barley, milk, grade &ldquo;A&rdquo; pigs and the guarantee of the trade agreement in respect of store cattle.  Let us face the fact that if the continued influx of beef on the British market continues from the Argentine on the scale at which it is at present arriving, then the prospects of the carcase beef trade and of the fat cattle trade from this country to Great <Col N="902" /> Britain are not at all as hopeful as they were 12 months ago, but happily, under the terms of the trade agreement, our store cattle are closely linked with the price guaranteed to British farmers for fat cattle and, through that link, we have the assurance that there can be no destructive slump in the price of store cattle which is, of course, of such fundamental importance, particularly to the small farmers of this country.  I turn to remind the Seanad of the facts, however, in the context of my request to the farmers that they should increase their number of cows, because, through increased production of milk, the availability to the farmers of increased quantities of skimmed milk and the prudent user of that skimmed milk, I would hope for an arresting and a dramatic increase in the exportable surplus of agricultural produce available at an early date in the shape of pigs, with this added advantage, that with the adequate user of skimmed milk, a complete diet for pigs can be provided by home-grown barley.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to farmers that if they grow their own barley which they now can do and add to every cwt. of barley meal approximately one pound of salt and feed it to pigs with skimmed milk <i>ad lib</i>, they have a complete and adequate diet for pigs, with the assurance now that there is an unlimited market for all the grade &ldquo;A&rdquo; pigs they can deliver to the factory, and no possibility of any violent oscillation in price such as that to which Senator Cogan referred as being a feature of the past.  He said some time ago that I told the farmers I would take the wobble out of the price of pigs.  I think I have fulfilled that undertaking by a guarantee to the farmers.  There is a minimum price of 235/- per cwt. for all the grade &ldquo;A&rdquo; pigs they can deliver to the bacon factories of this country.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I want to interpolate this observation.  There are some people who take a queer kind of delight in denigrating anything we have and comparing it unfavourably with something that somebody else has, but it is a dramatic and significant fact that, over the past 12 months, the <Col N="903" /> percentage of grade &ldquo;A&rdquo; pigs delivered to the bacon factories has increased from 54 per cent. to over 63 per cent. If you take the grade &ldquo;A&rdquo; plus grade &ldquo;B&rdquo;, 86 per cent. of all pigs delivered to the bacon factories in this country fall within these two categories so that there is almost developing here a shortage of the heavy pigs of which we used to have a surplus which are required for conversion into the hard quality of salt bacon popular in certain parts of the West.</P>
    <P>I hope to see 70 per cent. of all our pigs delivered to the factories being grade &ldquo;A&rdquo;.  I would remind the House that if this comes to pass, as we believe it will, then the strain of pigs we have in this country compares favourably with the strain of pigs available in any other country in Europe or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I do not want for one moment to suggest that we can contemplate resting upon our oars in agriculture in this country.  We want to continue the effort, but I regard our past performance as in no way unseemly.  On the contrary, I believe we have done well and we hope we will do better, and to that end I would remind the Seanad that, while it is true that we have not in the past used adequate quantities of fertiliser, there are historical reasons for that into which I do not now propose to go, but all that persuasion can do will be done to bring home to the farmers the advantage of using greater quantities of fertiliser.</P>
    <P>Any Minister for Agriculture would welcome the prospects of being able substantially to subsidise fertilisers and reduce their cost to farmers, but it is to be borne in mind that it is not possible for an agricultural country, depending for its existence on agricultural produce, always to make the same contribution by way of subsidy on the raw materials and on end-product prices to agriculture.  That is possible for an industrial country which derives the bulk of its income from industrial pursuits, such as the United States of America or Great Britain; but we should bear in mind that, by the end of this year, under <Col N="904" /> the land rehabilitation project, we will have 1,000,000 acres of Irish land rehabilitated or in process of rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>I think I am entitled to say that the statistical matter which I have laid before the Seanad is in itself evidence that the policy of investment in the land is beginning to pay dividends.  I would remind the House that the progeny testing of pigs which is proceeding at Ballyhaise, and in other forms in every factory in the country, is, I think, earning dividends in the increasing percentage of grade &ldquo;A&rdquo; pigs appearing in the factories.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Senator Cogan does not agree with my concept of the parish plan, but here again I have the pragmatic approach.  My proposal is to bring within the reach of every farmer in this country adequate facilities to help him to get from his own holding the maximum return.  Where the county committees of agriculture are providing that advice, I am quite content.  Where they are not providing that advice and the people ask me for it, I will provide it.  It is working very well on that basis at the present time.</P>
    <P>I find no conflict; I find no confusion; and I find that farmers welcome the service, wherever it is made available.  Some county committees of agriculture have asked me to send parish agents to their county, notably County Longford, and in that area the two services are operating amicably and reciprocally side by side and I do not doubt that, if any Senator wishes to make inquiries in that area, he will find that the service is greatly appreciated by the farmers for whom it is provided.  I judge by results and I like to test a policy by its results and I find that, after the theorists have finished talking, when the parish agent goes amongst the farmers, he is welcomed and they want to have him, and, when they have the benefit of his advice, they increase their output, they improve their holdings and they make for themselves and their families a better life.  That is the only thing in which I am interested and, so long as that need exists in rural Ireland, I consider <Col N="905" /> it to be one of the primary duties of the Minister for Agriculture, directly or indirectly, to supply it.</P>
    <P>There is one matter on which I think the Senator might with advantage have dwelt at greater length.  He took two hours and in that time I thought he might have touched on this matter because this, I think, is a real lacuna in the general scheme for increased profitable agricultural production and it is a lacuna not easily to be filled, that is, in the marketing of our agricultural surplus abroad.</P>
    <P>I feel&mdash;and I do not mind admitting this to the Seanad&mdash;that in respect of bacon, in respect of carcase meat and in respect of eggs, and probably in respect of fowl, our marketing arrangements are antediluvian and are placing us at a material disadvantage compared with certain of our competitors in foreign markets but there is this difficulty, that there are in existence old-established trade connections between this country and Great Britain and the case can be very energetically made that to disrupt these old-established channels of trade and to substitute therefor an entirely new organisation canalising all trade through one channel is to exchange something of proven and established value for something of speculative value.  I have no doubt that in respect of our continental markets the canalisation of exports is overdue but it is extremely difficult to arrange it on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>I have a profound and instinctive reluctance to pushing people about.  I would much prefer to achieve these objectives through consultation and agreement, but I think it is true that, if that cannot be achieved, statutory authority must be sought to place our export trade in certain products on a basis of competitive equality with other countries catering for the same markets.</P>
    <P>Senators will have noticed that recently Denmark has decided to canalise all its bacon exports through one export channel in Great Britain. We frequently find, when arranging for export quotas of carcase meat into European countries that, at their end, the purchase is canalised through <Col N="906" /> one channel and that the only result of there being a number of competitors for the business from this end is that the single authorised importer on the Continent is in a position to canvass competitive business from a number of independent exporters at this end, resulting in disadvantage not only for the exporters but for the producers here, advantage for the importer, with no corresponding advantage for us.</P>
    <P>I am not without hope that we will be able to overcome this difficulty through the medium of consultation and agreement, but I think it is true that, if we cannot, then it will be my duty as Minister for Agriculture to approach the Oireachtas in the autumn to seek a method whereby, with the approval of the Oireachtas, the necessary measures can be taken, where the national interest requires it, to strengthen the competitive position of our export interests for some commodities to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I know that the world in which we live is much given to elaborate plans drawn out on paper.  I know that we are told that China is going to embark on a five-year plan, that Italy is going to embark on a five-year plan.  Russia has been engaging in five-year plans for the last 20 years.  I wonder do Senators realise that we are always told in great detail at the beginning of a five-year plan of the glorious horizons to which these planners are about to advance but nobody ever tells us at the end of a five-year period what the results have been?  We know that some of them succeeded, but, in the course of achieving the success, the people for whose benefit they were launched died, in some cases, in millions, of famine, of slaughter and of exile to the salt mines of Siberia, all for the common good.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Chinese five-year plan has now collectivised all the farmland of China.  I do not know, and I am in no position to test that claim, but I am also informed that hundreds of thousands of people have perished in the course of the operation. I do not know what the results of all the five-year plans are.  I am not qualified, and I do not believe anybody else is, to set out on paper the destiny of a people and to marshal <Col N="907" /> and drive them, if needs be, into fulfilment of these theoretical objectives.</P>
    <P>We do know what this country needs, and that is increased output from the land.  I do know the general direction in which that output can be increased with a reasonable certainty of our being able to dispose of the surplus for money in foreign markets with the intention of using that money earned to pay for the imports from foreign countries which we require if we are to maintain the kind of standard of living for our people in this country that we desire them to have.  I will agree with Senator Cogan that our objective should be to see upon the land of this country 2,000,000 cows.  I think I mentioned that figure before, and said that I invited the farmers to join with me in a five-year plan, the ultimate objective of which would be the increase of our cow and heifer population from its present level to a figure of 2,000,000.</P>
    <P>I said then that if we were to put our hands constructively to that policy, let those who keep five cows keep seven, those who keep seven keep ten, those who keep ten keep 14, those who keep 14 keep 20 and those who keep 20 keep 28.  I understand that kind of planning, but I do not understand the kind of planning which purports to forecast exactly what every acre of land on every farm in Ireland will be used for during the next ten years&mdash;something approaching to anthill economy which is not consonant, in my judgment, with the dignity of property-owning farmers on their own land.</P>
    <P>Maybe I am wrong and that there is a more modern approach founded on the gospel of efficiency which makes my approach inappropriate to the circumstances in which we find ourselves to-day.  If that be true, I will make way for another person who believes in that approach and secures from the farmers of this country authority to impose it upon them.  But I do not think I am wrong.  I think we have ample evidence before us.  We can get from the farmers of this country an infinitely better return by telling them <Col N="908" /> what it is requisite to do, by offering them the help that they require to achieve their objective and by trusting them to produce the desired results.</P>
    <P>However, I agree that it should be incumbent upon us all, in so far as conscience would allow, to speak with a common voice, and I suggest that there is nothing in the programme of increased production that I have put before you that could be described as controversial or calculated to justify disputation or the instilling of confusion in the public mind.</P>
    <P>I do not know that I have heard from the Senator any suggestion of a new departure&mdash;I say, deliberately, &ldquo;of a new departure&rdquo;&mdash;other than that we should subsidise fertilisers and that we should appoint an agricultural council with which I should take counsel in public.  I wish we had the resources to subsidise fertilisers, but we cannot provide money to rehabilitate the land, to provide grants for farm buildings, which we are doing on a very elaborate scale at the present time, to eradicate tuberculosis from the cattle of the country and to do everything else we would desire.  I do not think we should lose sight of the fact that we are subsidising, very heavily subsidising, one very essential and valuable fertiliser.</P>
    <P>That is ground limestone which, after all, is available to every farmer in the country at 16/- or less per ton delivered to his gate wherever he may be.  I think it is worth nothing that Senator Cogan agrees it was in abundance in County Kilkenny long before 1950 when the existing scheme was initiated.  I think the Senator overlooked a very essential distinction, that the commodity he referred to was available at 30/- per ton, ex quarry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It started at that price and was reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was reduced when ground limestone became available at 16/- per ton delivered to the gate, but of course you may call a rose by any other name and it may smell as sweet. But if one costs 30/- at the pit and the other costs 16/- at the gate, to my <Col N="909" /> way of thinking they are not the same thing, and for the man who is buying by the ton there is a very substantial and significant difference.  I am very well aware that limestone flour, so called, was available at 30/- a ton, ex pit, in 1949.  Ground limestone, as I understand it, at 16/- a ton delivered to the farmer's gate, became available in 1950 and is now being used at an annual rate of 1,000,000 tons.</P>
      <P>I hope the farmers of this country, having experienced the advantage of the use of this valuable fertiliser in great quantities, will believe me, and those others on whose advice they depend, that a corresponding use of phosphates and potash would double, treble or quadruple the results they already have achieved with the limestone alone.  I do not quite know what more effective measures we can take than the measures we are taking now, unless we use compulsion.  I welcome suggestions from anybody for more effective measures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have been at the disposal of the Seanad for a long time to-day and I have tried to treat the Senator's motion with the respect I conceive to be due to any motion presented by the Senator.  I do not think I have said more on the situation than the Senators required.  I was about to conclude when the Senator intervened; I was about to say I do not know what more effective measures we may take. I would welcome any proposal.  I have heard none, with the exception of a suggestion about marketing, about which, discussions are proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="910" /> I think perhaps publicity has failed. I welcome suggestions as to how we could communicate to farmers and carry conviction to them that the key to 90 per cent. of our problems of increased production in this country is phosphate, potash and lime.  But will Senators tell me how can that be done more effectively than I am trying to do it?  Will Senators believe that last week at a meeting of the Kilkenny County Committee of Agriculture a responsible man was heard to say he believed the solution of the problem of the bacon industry would be for the Minister to guarantee a price of 230/- for grade &ldquo;A&rdquo; pigs?  That statement was made by a responsible member of the Kilkenny County Committee of Agriculture, although the Minister had guaranteed a price of 235/- for them three months ago.  How can we carry the knowledge of these things to the people?  If Senators have any suggestions to make, I shall be happy to hear them.  I have appointed an experienced public relations officer of the Department for no other purpose than to try and broadcast these facts. I will accept most cheerfully advice from anybody on more effective measures to promote the expansion of agricultural production.</P>
    <P>I am certain that the expansion of agricultural production is essential. I am proud of the progress Irish farmers have made in the expansion of agricultural production since 1947.  I believe they will continue it.  However, I would remind the Seanad that with the passage of every day, week, month and year the atmosphere in which we trade abroad becomes more and more competitive.  We must take measures to equip ourselves effectively to trade in that atmosphere.  To that end, we hope to improve our marketing methods but, fundamentally, what we must do&mdash; and here is something which all must realise is indispensable&mdash;is to face the task of bringing down our own costs of production by efficiency in our own method.  I would point at once to two spheres in which that can be promptly done.  The first is to ensure in the production of creamery milk the use of phosphate, potash and lime, so that cows kept for the production of creamery milk are fed and maintained <Col N="911" /> on grass, grown as hay and ensilage and the farmer undertakes no outlay on concentrates for his production.  The second is that the right kind of pig be kept in increasing numbers and fed on barley, salt and skimmed milk.  If these two methods are employed they will, in themselves, very substantially contribute to the indispensable necessity for reducing our costs and restoring our competitive capacity in the foreign markets in which we shall be plying.</P>
    <P>Has anybody else any suggestion to make?  A Senator has remarked that time is running out to-night but to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow are all new days and, although I would not dream of unduly trespassing on a Senator's time, I am always at his disposal.  If Senator McHugh has any suggestions to make to me other than those expressed here and if he gives them to me personally or under any other circumstances I will give them every consideration.  If we do not agree we can at least courteously agree to disagree and very often better understand one another.  Perhaps we can devote an hour or half an hour to personal discussion; I am proceeding on the assumption that Senator McHugh wishes that to happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wanted an assurance on that point.  I was rather sorry that the Minister&mdash;perhaps because he was rushed&mdash;was unable to deal with some of the points I raised.  I made five suggestions and the Minister dealt with only three or four of them.  The Minister had no remark whatever to make on the question of credit for agriculture.  It is idle to talk of increasing agricultural production, of increasing the dairy herds of this country, unless somebody is prepared to provide the necessary capital.  It is not there and we know it is not there and no arrangement is made whereby it can be provided.  I was sorry the Minister perhaps overlooked that point and did not comment upon it.</P>
      <P>I suggested that the Department of Agriculture should step in in regard to at least two or three branches of agricultural production&mdash;in regard to the purchase of cows, the purchase of fertilisers, the purchase of breeding ewes&mdash;and guarantee loans where necessary.  Through his Department the Minister could, if necessary, provide a credit advisory service to supplement existing facilities.  It is difficult to explain all this in a matter of five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point the Minister skipped over rather lightly, or in fact did not refer to, is the question of guaranteed prices.  I suggest there should be a <Col N="913" /> period in regard to certain guaranteed prices.  If, for example, the price of milk is guaranteed at a certain figure it should be for a certain specified period, say, at least three years.  However, the Minister avoided any reference to that matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister appealed for suggestions. In addition to those which I have made, there was one which I had intended to make if I had been able to reach it before the time limit expired and that was that there should be in this State an extension of adult education.  As far as the advisory services are concerned, there should be in every parish without exception in every week of the year one night on which a class or a lecture would be held.  I could go into that in more detail if the time were available, but it is necessary to point out how essential it is to the preservation of continuity of contact between the instructors and the farmers.  I hope we shall have some other opportunity of going into this question of advisory services. There is a big field for development, for new ideas and new suggestions which I hope I shall have an opportunity of dealing with later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnSheridan" hpid="Mr. J.D. Sheridan Mr. J.D. Sheridan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.D. Sheridan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann is of the opinion that, unless the scheme for the eradication of bovine T.B. is implemented more expeditiously, our position in the British market will be seriously impaired.</P>
      <P>In moving this motion, I should like to make it clear at the outset that this is in no sense a political motion.  I speak purely as a vocational member of this House, having been nominated by the national executive of the live-stock trade as one of their representatives in this Chamber.  The motion is of vital concern to Irish agriculture which is not only the mainstay of this country but represents the only substantial volume of exports we can count on to-day.</P>
      <P>I need hardly remind the House that at the present time the principal market for our live-stock exports is still Great Britain and that any serious change made in the marketing system of Great Britain must have repercussions here.  It is surely, therefore, a matter of serious concern that Great Britain is well on the way to becoming a fully attested area.  Practically the entire country from Land's End to John O'Groats is now fully attested. As each county becomes fully attested, such county is then officially declared closed and no live stock is permitted to enter that county, unless it is certified as T.B. tested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is this scheme of attestation anyway?  I have seen no directives from the Department of Agriculture explaining to our farmers what is demanded <Col N="915" /> by these new regulations. There seems to be an element of mystery or secrecy about the whole affair which is difficult to understand. Let me, therefore, try to throw some light on the subject.  The scheme first started in Britain on a modest basis about 1945 and was originally confined to the T.B. testing of dairy herds. Beef herds might become attested, but no subsidy was given until shortly after the war.  A complete new scheme was put into operation in 1950, and the attestation scheme for all cattle produced in Great Britain has swept the country from end to end.</P>
    <P>It is with that complete new scheme that we in Ireland are mainly concerned. I presume that those Senators with a farming background understand all about attestation, but, for the benefit of those Senators not so familiar with the facts, I shall endeavour to clarify the position by outlining the mechanics of attestation as practised across the water.  First of all, the owner, at his own expense, has a pilot T.B. test done by his own veterinary surgeon.  If there are any reactors, they must be immediately removed.  Two months afterwards, a further test is held by Government vets and if it is a completely clear test, the cattle are classified then as fully attested.  Should, however, there be one reactor only among as many as 200 cattle the entire test fails.  On the removal of that reactor, at the expiry of a further two months period, a further test is compulsory.  When herds are finally accepted as fully attested, these herds are then tested only once yearly.</P>
    <P>That, in simple language, is the mechanics of attestation and my purpose in explaining that here so minutely is to give Senators an insight into the difficulties that are now arising between the two countries.  I have here a white paper issued by the Agricultural Department in Great Britain only four months ago.  I would ask every member of this House and every farmer in the country to study this paper well for it may sound the death knell of the Irish store cattle trade.  I quote from this paper:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="916" />&ldquo;At the end of 1955 there were over 6,000,000 cattle in attested areas in Great Britain as compared with 5,000,000 at the end of 1954 and only 2,000,000 in October, 1950, when the area plan was introduced. Approximately 62 per cent. of all cattle in Great Britain are now attested: in Scotland, 79 per cent.; in England, 54 per cent.; and in Wales, 84 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These figures are official United Kingdom figures and I quote them in order to demonstrate even to people who are not familiar with the trade that this market is diminishing rapidly week by week.</P>
    <P>In the very near future the whole of Great Britain will be fully attested and our live-stock exports will be closed out.  When that day comes, I can assure you, Sir, that it will be a very sad day for the farmers of Ireland.  For the past six or seven years, I have tried to arouse our Department of Agriculture, under both Governments, to the dangers that lay ahead, but my warnings were unheeded.  In fairness to the last Minister, the late Deputy Walsh, he did realise that there was trouble ahead and that there was some necessity for legislation to try to avert it.  He might have done much had not the then Government been defeated in the last election.  To the present Minister, however, must go the credit for being the first Minister to have the foresight and courage to launch an eradication scheme for Ireland on similar lines to the British scheme.  It is, I regret to say, about ten years too late.  We can hardly hold the Minister responsible for that, but we certainly can hold responsible the advisory officers and permanent officials&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.D. Sheridan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. Personally, I am not concerned with politics, but I am concerned with the cattle trade and the future of our agriculture.  I have no hesitation in saying to this House, with all the emphasis at my command, that with the vast work to be done, I cannot visualise this country, at the present pace, being fully attested in 50 years. In fact, I notice that the <i>Irish Times</i> stated in a leading article on 5th of last month that we had it from the Minister himself that the Irish scheme will take 25 years to complete.  I am not talking about the advisers now; I am talking about what the <i>Irish Times</i> says he said, but I never heard him say it.  In estimating 50 years, I think I am being fairly charitable to our Department.  In any event, I should like to warn the Government, and the country, that Great Britain will definitely be entirely closed inside ten years.  That is the opinion of the leading men, not only on this side, but on the other side, across the Channel.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us what is to happen to our store cattle when the day comes when England is completely closed against us?  I notice that in a reply to a question asked in the Dáil by Deputy Childers on this subject there was a standardised Civil Service reply of five foolscap pages given with a great maze of figures.  It looked very impressive in print.  As I was going to say, but I am barred from saying it, if you give a civil servant pencil and paper, he can make out an answer to anything.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnSheridan" hpid="Mr. J.D. Sheridan Mr. J.D. Sheridan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.D. Sheridan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the Dáil reply and I would like to examine it briefly.  It states that up to June, 1956, 21 per cent. of the total number of herd owners in the country had applied under the scheme; that is to say, they had only applied to have their herds tested, and I have no doubt that a fresh army of clerks and officials will be required to tabulate all these applications for some distant examination. This statement claims that 47,700 herds, or 14 per cent. of all cattle in the country, had been given their first test and 15,200 herds had passed the second test.  As I have explained earlier, a single certificate, although it is useful, is not of much value really. It is only when a herd has passed the second test that it is on its way to full attestation, so that this five pages of verbiage boils down to the bare fact that 15,200 herds passed the second test, after two years of work on the scheme.</P>
      <P>As there is a cattle population of somewhere in the region of 4,500,000, I do not think people will say that this motion is superfluous at this time.  This criticism of the Department is made in no political spirit.  I have no political axe to grind, but I cannot stand by and see the cattle trade being slowly strangled by the inertia of the Department, who are not so much concerned with the future as they are with the present.  I think that most Ministers feel in duty bound to defend their Department, whether it is right or wrong.  It is an old Party custom on both sides of the House.  I am willing to make allowances for that, but I would impress upon the Minister that this is too much a matter of life and death for the Irish farmer that we should have to listen to diatribes from civil servants, or from any other quarter. I would appeal to him, if there is a shadow of doubt about our being able to complete this eradication scheme in time to save the situation, that he should take the country into his confidence and admit, openly and frankly, that it just cannot be done, so that, whilst still hoping for the best, we may yet prepare for the worst.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> In the Dáil last week, the Minister for Finance was very frank and honest with the people about the serious financial position of the country.  The Minister for Finance is to be congratulated on his candour.  The Irish people must know that the economic position of nearly every country in the world is under a cloud.  They have proved their ability to take pronouncements in days gone by.  In fact, it was only when they got a really hard pronouncement that they stood shoulder to shoulder.  I say to the Minister for Agriculture here to-night that we want the simple truth with regard to this attestation scheme.  What is his personal opinion?  If it is too late, how does he propose to get our cattle through a closed door?  If the Minister thinks it will take the Department 20 years to accomplish this scheme, let him say so in plain words to the people.  If it takes that time, then, as I have said, the British market will be completely closed against us, so that, unless his Department is prepared to treble the pace of its work, he might just as well abandon the whole scheme now.</P>
    <P>As one piece of evidence of neglect on the part of the Department, may I point out that in the last few years, our veterinary colleges have turned out veterinary surgeons and no sooner are they qualified than they set sail for England where they get double the salary they could earn here?  It is galling to think that many of those young Irish vets constituted the biggest asset that the British Department of Agriculture had in completing their great scheme.  It is not so much a question of: &ldquo;Can we afford this extra expense?&rdquo;  It is a question of whether this country can afford to do without the cattle trade.  Now, when we are talking about the balance of trade figures, I wonder what the balance of trade figures would be like without live-stock exports?  The Minister is well aware that every producing country in the world to-day&mdash;the Argentine, Australia, New Zealand&mdash;is striving by every means in its power to gain access to the British market.  Can we, who have a hold in that market, afford to lose it?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> In all fairness, I think it only right to say this of the present Minister, that no man in this country has done more to secure and sustain that market than the present Minister, often in the face of great political unpopularity. If this market were lost, can anyone appreciate what it would mean?  The younger generation might not, but I do not think the older generation would have any illusions about it, because I think that the small farmers of the South and the West of Ireland will remember the economic war to the day they die.  As one who has been in constant touch with the live-stock trade for over 50 years, I can assure the House that the British farmers do not want to lose our store cattle. Export connections that took hundreds of years to build up to their present solid state are there, and they are functioning, and while other Ministers are roaming even as far as America in the hope of discovering some new outlet for our exports, we have that established outlet for our cattle.</P>
    <P>Let us therefore guard well what we have.  Please do not try to make us believe that all is well at this moment, when every cattle man and every farmer in the country know that, unless much more and much speedier work is done, and done quickly, it will be too late, and we in our day will witness the passing of an export market greater by far than anything our globe-trotting Ministers can ever hope to establish for this country. Thousands of pounds we can ill afford have been spent sending trade delegations to the far corners of the world in search of some mythical export market, while here at home the greatest export market, one which has stood the test of time and which is worth more than all the others put together, is in danger of extinction.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would impress on the Minister that no matter what his advisers tell him, he is facing the most deadly menace that has ever confronted Irish agriculture and on him will rest responsibility for its failure, if it does fail.  I have heard some commendable talk in this Chamber recently about taking agriculture out of politics.  If any man really means <Col N="921" /> that in his heart, here, then, is a chance to show it.  In heaven's name, let us have done with Party bickering; let us attend to the vital work that lies at our hand and, in doing so, we shall be doing justice to a Seanad as it was intended to be done when the Constitution first sponsored its birth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichealPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding this motion as one of the representatives of the Irish live-stock trade in this House, I want to give expression to the deep concern of myself and my colleagues in the cattle trade for the serious situation which will confront them in the near future if the scheme for the eradication of bovine T.B. is not much more expeditiously implemented.</P>
      <P>As Senator Sheridan has already pointed out, at the present moment almost three-quarters of Great Britain is closed to them, except for attested cattle, and they are finding that their business is gradually slipping away from them.  Some exporters who have spent a lifetime building up connections with markets and with large cattle grazing farmers in Great Britain are now faced with the prospect of their life's work going for nought. They wilt at the thought of what will happen in five or six years' time, when, no doubt, the whole of Great Britain will be closed to all, except attested cattle.  There is no doubt that for these live-stock exporters who, as I say, have spent a lifetime building up their businesses, the future is bleak.  It is not for them alone&mdash;they are only a small section of the community&mdash;that the future looks dark if the scheme is not more speedily implemented, but for the whole country, if we find gone from us the bulwark of our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no desire to be an alarmist, but I want to impress on the Minister the seriousness of this situation and I am sure that he is as much aware of it as I am.  To him must go the credit for the initiation of this scheme.  Unfortunately, as Senator Sheridan pointed out, it is many years too late, but, as the old saying goes: &ldquo;Better late than never.&rdquo;  I am afraid that much of the blame for our present predicament must lie on the shoulders <Col N="922" /> of the previous Government who, through lack of foresight when Britain started seriously on the scheme in 1946, failed to keep in line.  Ten valuable years have been lost.</P>
    <P>It is easy to be critical, but I think a few constructive suggestions for getting us out of our difficulties might be of some value.  I feel that the root of the Minister's difficulty is insufficient veterinary staff.  He mentioned that in reply to a question in the Dáil last week in regard to the eradication scheme.  I have no doubt it is a big problem, but it is not insoluble. We all know that when most of our vets qualify, as Senator Sheridan said, they get the first boat to England.  It is hard to blame them because the salaries paid by the British Ministry of Agriculture are double and, so far as I know, when overtime is included, they are almost treble, what they are getting from the Irish Department of Agriculture.  I understand there is no such thing as overtime for veterinary officers of the Department of Agriculture.  I cannot blame these men if they are not fired with sufficient patriotism to be prepared to do much needed work at home for much less pay.  I should like the Minister to consider the veterinary aspect of the problem in that light and I feel sure that, if he does, we will see the emigrant ship turned the other way, as regards vets anyway.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to raise is that, in my travels and from my inquiries from different sources throughout the country, I find that the co-operation on the part of the farmers with the Department officials working on the scheme is anything but what it should be.  That is a very regrettable situation and one to be deplored by every decent-minded citizen.  I think a lot of farmers may not be aware of the serious effect their lack of co-operation has on the scheme, and I suggest that a bit of propaganda, pointing out how they can co-operate and how necessary co-operation is, if the project is to be a success, should be carried out through the medium of the newspapers and the circulation of leaflets in the areas in which the scheme is now in operation.  Such propaganda would be of great value <Col N="923" /> and I suggest also that there might be a request to the N.F.A., which has a very large membership, to give every help possible.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see from the Minister's reply in the Dáil that he intends to introduce legislation in the near future to give him more power to implement this scheme.  That is a step in the right direction, in the direction of a speedier implementation of the scheme.  The present serious financial situation in which we find ourselves is no doubt a further problem which the Minister must face in implementing the scheme, but the present situation &mdash;and I am sure everyone will agree with me in this&mdash;will be nothing compared with the kettle of fish with which we will be confronted in a few years' time if the British market is closed to our store cattle because the scheme was not more speedily implemented. For that reason, I appeal to the Minister to see to it that there will be no curtailment of the money allocated to the scheme.  I understand that there are several million pounds of Marshall Aid funds put aside for agricultural projects; and, if that is the case, it is my opinion that this scheme should get priority and this should lighten the burden on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>At this late hour, I do not wish to delay the Seanad, but, in concluding, I should like to appeal to the Minister, if he can possibly see his way to do so, to reimburse the exporters who have been, and still are, exporting attested cattle and paying for the attestation themselves.  That would certainly lighten the ever-increasing burden which they are carrying.  I have no doubt that the Minister will accept this motion and it is my sincere hope that, instead of the 20 years he has in mind, we will see the country clear of bovine T.B. within ten years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Far be it from me to suggest to the House that the problem of eradicating bovine T.B. is anything but a very anxious one, but there is no use simply saying some-think will have to be done.  I think it may be a very useful thing at intervals to raise matters of this kind and rebuke a Minister for his failure to act <Col N="924" /> energetically.  At least, it makes him ask himself: &ldquo;Am I doing enough?&rdquo; Of course, if a Minister is to take the Seanad fully into his confidence, he will be charged with being puerile and seeking to defend himself.  Meaning no disrespect to Senator Sheridan.  I do not give a fiddle-dee-dee, because I will do my best, whether I am queried in the Seanad or whether I am not, and I elect to take the risk of having it alleged against me that I proceeded to explain my policy and to pooh-pooh Senator Sheridan's representations.</P>
      <P>Of course, I do not pooh-pooh Senator Sheridan's representations.  I sympathise with his anxiety; I even understand, although I do not approve of, the terms in which he spoke; but accepting his references as being directed exclusively at the Minister for Agriculture for the time being, the plain fact is that we began in 1954 what the British began in 1935.  The British have been at it for 20 years and they are getting results.  We have got to face the fact that, when the Dutch put their hand to it, the U.S.A. stepped in and said: &ldquo;We will pay half the cost, whatever it is.&rdquo;  The more the Dutch spent, the more the U.S. Treasury provided.  We have got to face the fact that the Danes were at it a long time ago, and undoubtedly can claim that they have eradicated the disease in Denmark, but it is to be borne in mind that they started it in 1893.  There is no use in my trying to persuade the Seanad that, having started it in 1954 we can, by waving some magical wand, eliminate the time differential between our campaign and the campaign in Great Britain and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in my withholding from the Seanad the knowledge of the limitations that exist and within which we have to make our best effort. One, is the number of veterinary surgeons available to us; two, is the degree of co-operation that we get from the farmers; and, three, is one that the most experienced live-stock men very frequently overlook&mdash;that is, the question of replacement.  Suppose I had the money and the staff to walk into the County Limerick, the County Cork and the County Tipperary and <Col N="925" /> sort out half the cows, what would become of the live-stock industry in this country?  Half the cows!  Where would I get heifers to replace them? What would the farmers do from whose holdings I take these cattle away?  Let us think on that.</P>

      <P>I have circulated, for the information of Senators, a map of Ireland so that they might see the lines on which we are proceeding.  I think Senators Sheridan and Prendergast overestimate the number of veterinary surgeons who leave this country.  I suppose some of them do. I have an advertisement in the paper to-day for 20 veterinary surgeons.  Now, I cannot take veterinary surgeons by the neck and make them serve in the Department of Agriculture.  Of course, as Senator Prendergast says, if I doubled the salary, that might possibly lure some of them back; but that is not a very practicable proposition and, if I go into competition with the British Treasury, it is manifest who will ultimately win.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to argue that case at this hour of the night.  I am listening to people deploring emigration all over the country.  I am prepared to demonstrate that most of those who emigrate are getting three times as much and, yet, people seem <Col N="926" /> to think it is a crime that they should go.  There is that aspect.  An engineer, or a veterinary surgeon, or any person in a profession in which there is a temporary dearth in Great Britain, or Canada, or the United States of America is liable to be paid very highly and we are in the position that it is difficult to meet that competition. But we are getting as many veterinary surgeons as we can get.  I agree with the Senator that no number would be excessive to resolve this problem and I am bound to say that no requisition made by me on the Minister for Finance to date for funds to meet the cost of this very, very costly operation has been withheld.  I have had no more sympathetic colleague in the task of tackling the eradication of bovine T.B. than the Minister for Finance.  We hope&mdash;and, mark you, in doing this we shall do what no other country in the world has done&mdash;to be in a position to declare the County Sligo a T.B. free area within 12 or 18 months.  So far as I know, no other country in the world, after three years of campaigning on bovine T.B. eradication, was in a position to declare an area T.B. free.</P>
      <P>I assure Senator Sheridan that causes me no sense of complacence and I think I am entitled to say, without departing from the ruling of the Cathaoirleach, that the picture of my presiding over a Department where a doey-eyed indifference to this problem permeates the atmosphere is so fantastic as to be ludicrous.  I have to deal with the problem.  Now, it is desperately easy in the face of a formidable problem for someone to get up and say something will have to be done.  But it is I who have to provide the answer as to what will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators should remember that this country is a democracy and one has to carry the people with one.  I have got to bring the people gradually to a realisation of the character of this problem and secure their adherence to the measures requisite.  I can assure the Senator that if I march out with compulsory powers to roll up this problem in a Draconian way, it is not the problem that would get rolled up. I would get rolled up.  Mark you, I would do no service to the country if, <Col N="927" /> as Minister for Agriculture, I approached this problem in such a way as to antagonise.  If I cannot win the goodwill of the farming community, then no Minister for Agriculture will resolve this problem.</P>
    <P>In that concept, I am very grateful to Senator Sheridan and Senator Prendergast for introducing this motion into the Seanad and for speaking as they did because it helps me to carry home to the minds of the farmers how urgent the problem is.  Senator Sheridan may like to know that, having chosen Sligo owing to the very low incidence of the disease there, I went down to Sligo County Committee of Agriculture and informed them they were to be the first T.B. free area and, therefore, to finish the job in that area, it would be requisite to seek from Oireachtas Éireann compulsory powers to require the 1 per cent. recalcitrants, who would not join the voluntary scheme, to comply; it would be requisite for Oireachtas Éireann to give me power, as Minister for Agriculture, where such recalcitrance existed, to treat T.B. in that area on the same basis as I would treat foot-and-mouth disease.</P>
    <P>Now the Senator should not imagine that I elicited from the County Committee of Agriculture in Sligo anything like an enthusiastic approval of the course proposed.  On the contrary.  I received solemn warnings not to go too fast, and not to try the people too far, and that it might be greatly resented.  I know that those of us who recognise the gravity of the problem are sorely tempted to give way to impatience and say: &ldquo;To hell with these people.  We have got to cope with it.&rdquo;  Thanks be to God, this is a free country, and you cannot do that there here.  Long may this country retain that character. One must convince the people.  One must get their goodwill.  One must carry the people with one.</P>
    <P>So far as Senator Sheridan, by rebuking me for my apparent lethargy, draws the attention of the farmers to the fact that, far from using unnecessary compulsion or stress upon them, I appear to him, long experienced in the <Col N="928" /> trade, to be dragging my feet, I thank him for the motion he has moved here to-night.  Maybe, I thank him for another reason&mdash;that the solemnity of his words and the prudence of his contribution will cause me further to examine my conscience as to whether anything can be done that I have not so far put in train.</P>
    <P>I think it right to tell the Seanad this: I believe we are going on the right lines in the intensive area.  We are now about to sort out every reactor in Sligo.  We are within reasonable prospect of attaining to a position wherein we can sort out every reactor in Clare.  That will give me two sources for replacements in other areas of intensive eradication.  The <i>cordon sanitaire</i> which I have indicated on the map will shortly surround County Sligo.  The aim is to spread the operation down west of the Shannon and into Donegal, thus securing a T.B. free area extending from Donegal to Kerry.</P>
    <P>Then I have the source of replacements, which I must have before I can contemplate an all-out assault on Limerick, Tipperary and Cork; but I do not want Senators to be under the illusion that, in the meantime, these other areas in Ireland, outside the intensive areas, will become abandoned. Nothing could be further from the truth.  I have got to tell the Seanad that the original scheme, initiated by me in 1954 for the non-intensive areas&mdash;areas outside Clare, Sligo and Bansha&mdash;has not yielded the results that I had hoped for and, accordingly, I am in the process of amending that scheme with the veterinary profession, the National Farmers' Association and with the Livestock Consultative Council, under which we propose now to make it possible for individual herds to become attested.</P>
    <P>I do not want to trouble the Seanad by going into the details of that scheme, but where an individual farmer is prepared to get his own herd tested, it will now be possible for him to do so, whereas hitherto in the areas outside the intensive areas there was only a gradual progress, designed to convert an area, without any eradication proceeding, into an area where it was possible to contemplate an intensive <Col N="929" /> approach.  Accordingly, we hope to have in the areas east of the Shannon and in Limerick a growing number of responsible farmers who will clear their own herds in collaboration with the Department.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deceive the Seanad. In view of the limitations to which I have referred, and they are veterinarian, a realistic financial policy, and the possibility of replacement, we have got to face the fact that the eradication of T.B. from this country is a long-term problem.  I myself used the phrase &ldquo;25 years&rdquo;.  Possibly we may do it in less.  I can only give the House the best estimate I have.  I believe we will have one T.B. free area, at least, within two years, two within three years and within five years we will have a substantial area in the West cleaned up.</P>
    <P>Things may go faster.  It may be possible to go faster.  If it is I hope we will but it would not be right for me to mislead the Seanad at this stage.  I think it is a long-term business. Senators will say I did not deal with Senator Sheridan's query: What are you going to do ten years from now?  Now there are twa ends to this problem.  I think the Senator's long experience in the trade has probably led him to the conclusion that they did not buy his cattle for the love of his blue eyes.  They bought them because they wanted them.  Does the Senator follow?</P>
    <P>I quite agree that if this country showed a surly indifference to what they considered to be an indispensable characteristic of the live stock they were prepared to purchase we might push old friends and valued customers into a very unco-operative frame of mind but I can assure the Senator that the contacts between our Department of Agriculture and the Department of Agriculture in Great Britain are close, sympathetic and understanding. I entirely agree with the Senator that unless there was a clear conviction in Great Britain that we were moving towards the complete eradication of T.B. as expeditiously as it was possible for us to do, I would entertain the grave apprehensions he mentioned to <Col N="930" /> the Seanad to-day but inasmuch as I know that the view is rightly held by my professional colleagues, veterinarians in the public service in Great Britain who are the colleagues of the veterinarians in the public service of Ireland, that nothing is being left undone that could be done, I think we will find a way.</P>
    <P>I endorse entirely the sense of urgency that Senators Sheridan and Prendergast desire to impress on the Seanad.  I want to correct the degree of emphasis, which, if uncorrected, might do harm which I know Senator Sheridan would not wish to do.  I do not think the live-stock trade of Ireland is going to vanish in five years, ten years, 20 years or, I hope, in 100 years.  I believe we are moving in the right direction.  I cheerfully accept the precept of Seanad Eireann to move as quickly as it is physically and technically possible to do towards the goal of complete eradication.  I cordially endorse the emphasis the two Senators have thrown on the gravity of this problem and I only mention the reassuring element in this situation lest too despairing a view would cause confusion in the minds of our farming community.</P>
    <P>Let me close on this note.  I agree we must exert ourselves to the limit of our capacity and ability but my belief and confident prophecy is that the fruits of our exertion will be such as to secure the continued and uninterrupted flow of store cattle from this country to our traditional markets in England, Scotland and Wales.</P>

      <P>The hour is late, but I wish to state that I am deeply grateful to the Minister for what he said.  I know he is alive to the situation. I also think he is right in saying that so far as the farmers are concerned he does not want compulsion.  I do not think that anybody in his sane senses wants compulsion.  I also agree with the Minister that there are probably farmers in this country who are not enthusiastic about the testing of cattle, <Col N="931" /> but I think the Minister is right in saying that it is better the opinion should come possibly from outside the Department as it has here to-night because if they do not get on with the job, the compulsion is there.  They are going up against a stumbling block.  I am very grateful to the Leader of the <Col N="932" /> House for permitting the motion to be discussed and to the Cathaoirleach. My only regret is that we have been kept so late, but I do not think I am entirely to blame.</P>
      <P>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
