      <P>I have received notice from Senator McHugh that on the motion for the adjournment of the House to-night, he proposes to raise the question on the following matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To call the attention of An Taoiseach and of the Minister for External Affairs to the fact that Ireland, although a member of the United Nations Organisation, has not yet contributed a contingent to the United Nations Emergency Force at present charged with the task of restoring peace and order in the Middle East.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am accepting that notice and the matter will be taken from 9.30 to 10 p.m., or earlier if the business for the day concludes.</P>

      <P>Before we take up consideration of the Committee Stage of this Bill, I wish to say that I consider recommendation No. 6 to be <Col N="1046" /> out of order because it tends to impose a charge on State funds.  The Senator has been communicated with to that effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 15, before &ldquo;step-father&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;father-in-law, mother-in-law.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not propose to speak at any length on this recommendation.  It deals with the definition, for the purposes of this Bill, of a member of the family in order to make it clear to what particular members of the family a retiring civil servant can make a surrender in order to grant some of his pension to that person.  In this Bill the Minister has, quite rightly, given a limited definition of a member of the family and to a great extent he has given reasonable limits.</P>
      <P>The point I want to make now, and which I made on the Second Stage, is that if the father, mother, step-father, step-mother, are to be included among those to whom the retiring civil servant has a right to grant portion of his pension, then, in all equity, the mother-in-law and the father-in-law should be included.  I mentioned cases of possible hardship where, perhaps, a civil servant might be a widower with a family of children.  He may have been helped by his mother-in-law to bring up those children and she may, in fact, have acted to the motherless children in the capacity of a mother.  All we would do by passing this recommendation is to give such a civil servant the right, if he so desired, to make over portion of his pension to the mother-in-law or the father-in-law. This is simply an enabling clause to give him a right: it does not compel him to do anything.  In view of the possibility of certain cases of that kind, it would be unjust to exclude, as the present Bill does, the mother-in-law and the father-in-law.</P>

      <P>The House should appreciate that this is a Bill to enable an allocation of pension to be made in the case of a <Col N="1047" /> civil servant retiring between the ages of 60 and 65 years.  The number of cases in which a person retiring at that age would have, first of all, young children, such as Senator Sheehy Skeffington visualises, and, secondly, a mother-in-law or a father-in-law surviving would, I think, be very small. It would be hardly worth while extending the classification, particularly when I remember that this is a Bill that has been largely agreed with the people concerned before coming to the House.  I think it would be hardly worth while to extend the classification for the extremely remote contingency that is there.</P>

      <P>I think I must not have made myself clear when I referred to the possibility of a widower with young children.  My suggestion is that such a widower whose young motherless children have been brought up with the assistance of his mother-in-law might, in gratitude, feel later on, when he is retiring, that he might like to leave portion of his pension to a woman who, in fact, has acted in a very close capacity inside his family.  It is true that the number of cases in which it would arise would be small, but no smaller, surely, than the number of cases in which his father or mother would be a beneficiary.  I do not feel the Minister has answered the case because the father-in-law and the mother-in-law are, presumably, in the same generation as the father and mother, both of whom have been included.</P>

I do not accept the view which Senator Sheehy Skeffington has just put forward that there should be provision in this Bill whereby an allocation of pension should be made by way of gratitude.  That is not the intention, in my view, or the reason for this allocation Bill, or the reason for pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I see a distinction here because this present sub-section cannot make it clear that the surrender cannot be made by an established civil servant, if the reason for his retirement is ill-health.  It seems to me that a civil servant might be retired on grounds of relatively minor ill-health, a sort of disability which might make him unfit to continue his work as a civil servant, but <Col N="1049" /> which might in no way reduce his expectation of life.  If we allow this sub-section to stand unchanged, we say that any civil servant who retires on the ground of ill-health cannot make such surrender as this Bill provides for.</P>
      <P>I can imagine a civil servant retiring on grounds of ill-health, such as impaired eyesight or even blindness, which might prevent him doing his work, but which would in no way reduce his expectation of life.  I could imagine a civil servant being retired on grounds of deafness&mdash;I recognise of course that in some Departments it might be regarded as an asset to have a permanent civil servant who would be prepared to turn a deaf ear; nevertheless, if his deafness was such that he could not hear the Minister, one would imagine that that might be sufficient to have him retired on grounds of ill-health but such deafness would not constitute a limit to his life or make his expectation of life less.  I could imagine many cases where a civil servant would suffer injustice if he were to be excluded from the provisions of this Bill on such grounds.  I would go further and say that the civil servant who is forced to retire through ill-health, presuming the ill-health is not his own fault, would find it rather hard that he should be automatically excluded from this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole principle of this Bill is based on an actuarial transfer of the amount of a pension from the civil servant himself to the dependent nominated by him, that is, the actuarial equivalent.  This Bill, as I made it clear on Second Reading, is not a Bill to increase the pensions of civil servants in any way.  It merely enables a civil servant to make what is, according to actuarial tables, a change in a pension payable solely to himself, to a pension payable partly to himself and partly to his dependents by the equivalent in actuarial value of the same value as he has.  Those tables, as I tried to make clear, are prepared on the basis that the civil servant is in good health.  If the tables were not prepared on the basis that the civil servant was in good health, they would have to be made <Col N="1050" /> out on a lesser expectation of life and then the civil servant in good health would be penalised accordingly, because he would be so to speak, brought down to the level of the actuarial table taking bad health into account.  I am sure that none of us wants that and I am quite positive that Senator Sheehy Skeffington does not want it.  That is on the wider issue of ill-health.  The whole principle of the Bill is that the civil servant who is allocating his pension is in good health and accordingly the best possible actuarial table applies to him for his benefit.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington has made a specific case in relation to a person who is overcome by blindness. I am advised that none of those who advise me can recollect any such case happening in their memory in the Civil Service.  The only possible way of considering the case Senator Sheehy Skeffington has made would be specifically to list certain illnesses, if one might call blindness an illness, and to see how those illnesses would affect the actuarial tables of life expectancy.  I do not regard myself as being competent to assess the effect of things like deafness, blindness and other afflictions of that nature on the expectations of life, but the general amendment the Senator has tabled deals with the problem as he has made it now.  It would have to be done on the specific naming of certain illnesses.  If certain illnesses were named, I would have to get much more capable technical advice than I myself am in a position to give on the sub-section, on the principle that it must be the best posisible table for the civil servant.  That is an integral part of this Bill.  If it was not the table produced for people in good health, then the effect of producing a new table would be to drag the civil servant in good health down to the level of the table with the lesser expectation of life, which is something none of us would wish and which certainly is not contemplated and should not be contemplated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the point the Minister makes about the actuarial tables and I notice the tables have not, in fact, been decided yet.  I think the Minister made it clear that <Col N="1051" /> he was &ldquo;going to approve&rdquo; of the tables.  I do see the point that in a &ldquo;bad life&rdquo; the amount of pension accruing from the surrender part would be less, over all, for all civil servants, if you admit the person who has a lesser expectation of life.  I made it clear, however, that some people at least who would be forced to retire on the grounds of ill-health might not have a short life expectancy at all, but they are excluded by this point.  The other point is that the Minister stressed that, if we exclude people who retire from ill-health, we are going to &ldquo;drag down&rdquo; the people who are more healthy.  It is a question of striking an average and one will presume that the big majority will be in good health, despite the overtime they have to work and so on.  The numbers of those in bad health will not be so very big. Therefore, it will be a question of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, a reduced calculated amount deriving from a certain surrender.  I should like to feel that the healthiest civil servants, so far from protesting that they do not want to be &ldquo;dragged down,&rdquo; would be very glad to help their less healthy brothers and sisters in the service and would be glad to share a little part of the risk for the purpose of giving aid to those who may be forced to retire on grounds of ill-health.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not quite the same principle, because previously we dealt with the exclusion from this Bill of any civil servant forced to retire on grounds of ill-health.  In this paragraph, we say that: &ldquo;A person shall not be entitled to make a surrender under this Act unless the Minister decides that the person is of sound health.&rdquo;  In the earlier paragraph, we excluded all civil servants who might be forced by reason of ill-health to retire.  Here we not only do that but exclude all civil servants who are not in moderately good health, or whose health is not 100 per cent. A1.  Here we are excluding <Col N="1053" /> an even larger number of civil servants.  I imagine the Minister will make the same case&mdash;an actuarial case.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that, by leaving this clause as it is we are excluding from the right to assign portion of their pension the civil servants who are most in need of this Bill.  In other words, we are more or less rendering the Bill nugatory if we confine it to people who will be least likely to avail themselves of it.</P>

      <P>I should like to press this recommendation for the reason that, if we leave in this clause, we are excluding the major portion of those civil servants who want to take advantage of the Bill, the very ones who are in poor health, the very ones who are most anxious to <Col N="1054" /> surrender some of their pensions for their dependents or widows.  These are the very ones to whom we are going to say: &ldquo;This Bill is not for you.&rdquo;  The Minister says that the circumstances for which such a surrender will be made will very seldom arise because it is expected the person concerned will survive the widow or dependents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington is making a case on the basis of a person who has a much lower expectation of life where normal health is concerned.  When he says that such a person cannot take advantage of this Bill, I think he is right. This scheme is not intended to cover that type of case.  The type of case that has been worked for with the association is that of the person who is in normal sound health and who wants to provide for a class of dependents.  If what the Senator had in mind were to be put in the Bill, then it would be a different Bill.  What the Senator said is not relevant to this Bill or the scheme before the House in this Bill. What the Senator wants is to do something that the Bill does not provide for.  What he wants to do with regard to people under average expectation of life is to have a separate pension scheme.  I am not going to comment on that, except to say that is not the allocation scheme that has been agreed in respect of this measure.  What the Senator has in mind is a separate scheme altogether, or what should be a separate scheme, unless he is going on the basis that he wants, as I thought he indicated a moment ago, compulsorily to provide that the civil servant in sound health will agree to forfeit half of his allocation moneys for the civil servant in bad health. That may or may not be a good principle, but it is a principle of compulsion on civil servants that I am not going to accept in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I may misunderstand the Bill, but, as I read it, a retiring civil servant who sacrifices, say, a quarter of his pension, does so in order that that quarter&mdash;or its actuarial equivalent&mdash;will be paid after his death to his widow.  I think I am right in saying that should his <Col N="1055" /> wife die before him, he has permanently sacrified portion of his pension to no avail.  I suggest that the number of cases in which that will occur will be greatly increased if we insist that the retiring civil servant shall be &ldquo;in sound health&rdquo; on retirement.  In other words, the fund stands to benefit considerably more in such circumstances than on the ordinary actuarial basis.  It will be benefiting now by the contributions of certain healthy retired civil servants by reason of the fact that its coffers are going to be filled by those surrendered portions of their pensions which will never be paid out, owing to the fact that the grantee will have died before the retiring civil servant, who is required by this clause to be &ldquo;in sound health&rdquo; at the time of his retirement.</P>

I heard informal discussions on this matter, a great many years ago, on civil servants retiring in sound health who desired to hypothecate a certain part of their pensions in case the wife or other dependent lived longer than themselves. This Bill should be regarded as something in the nature of a miracle, because it is really in the nature of a miracle when the Department of Finance agrees with anybody to do anything&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This Bill enables the civil servant in sound health, without expense to the State, to do something with his own money on the best possible terms that can be got.  The civil servant, who, on retiring, allots portion of his pension to his wife, should she survive him, is, in effect, not making a sacrifice, but, putting it in a more colloquial way, is making a bet, and this is what they want.  As the Minister says, if you bring in this question of civil servants' wives having a pension, it is getting into another realm altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> This Bill is intended to get for the civil servant who allocates part of his pension the best possible terms for his dependent, by the exclusion from the process of anybody not in sound and normal health, that is, for his age. Since the civil servants have for a number of years wanted this and since the Minister now agrees to give it to them, without any expense to the Department of Finance, except whatever small allocation for administration is involved, you cannot alter this Bill so as to make it more favourable for people not in sound health.  That is a different question.</P>

      <P>The principles in this Bill are not in the least new.  As far as I know, the same sort of options have been available in the British Civil Service for decades and are available in other superannuation funds also.  I think what Senator Sheehy Skeffington would like to see, and I am in agreement with him on this, is that there should be pensions for the widows and orphans of civil servants.</P>

      <P>That is another thing altogether, and I agree there should be something like that, but I do not think such a pension can be secured under the general terms of this Bill.  I have experience of superannuation funds which provide such an option and I can tell the Senator that the proportion who will avail of the option to spread the risk will be very small indeed. Still, as the Minister has said, it is something that was desired by the representatives of the Civil Service at this stage and I think they are pleased that they have now got this option. They do, I expect, recognise it would be far better if they could have widows' and orphans' pensions, but this Bill does not provide these.  I hope we will some day be discussing such a Bill, but we are not doing so now.</P>

      <P>There is one question on which I should like to have my mind clarified, on the point whether the Bill is best in its present form. Would the Bill not mean in its present form, without acceptance of the amendment, that a civil servant who is <Col N="1057" /> compulsorily retired because the Department wants to get rid of him, is, in effect, in a better position than the civil servant who, through no fault of his own, is in poor health and consequently has to retire?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for the reason that you are going to permit some civil servants to surrender portion of their pensions, which they will consequently not be receiving, which will temporarily increase the Central Fund, and which will permanently increase it if a large proportion of these survive the people for whom theoretically they were making such a surrender, <Col N="1058" /> that is to say, the wife, in most cases.  By insisting, therefore, that the retiring civil servant be himself in 100 per cent. sound health, we are in fact, increasing the chance that a number of these surrendered amounts will never be paid out and, quite logically, quite mathematically and quite actuarilly, you are going unduly to increase the amount in the central superannuation fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole basis of actuarial tables is that they take into account the fact that certain people are going to die before others and the tables are framed on the basis that the fund makes up in one case what it loses in another.  You will have one case of a civil servant who retires at 65 and who has allotted portion of his pension to his widow.  That pensioner dies at 67 and the widow lives on until she is 87, so that the fund in that case obviously loses heavily.  On the other hand, you may have a civil servant who retires at 65 and dies at 66, and his wife also dies at 66, In such a case, the fund will obviously gain.  The words &ldquo;actuarial table&rdquo; mean that they are the best calculation anyone can make, so that the fund does not lose, that it does not gain, and that it keeps in balance.  The Senator's last case&mdash;I understand the case perfectly&mdash;has no logic in it and presupposes a lack of knowledge of the manner in which actuarial tables are complied.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Kissane's point, naturally any association representing the Civil Service would have liked that I would have added something more than an express allocation. I made it quite clear that I was not prepared to give an Exchequer contribution. Taking the basis, therefore, as being one of allocation and not of Exchequer contribution, the association saw the white print of this Bill before it was brought to the Houses of the Oireachtas and raised no point on any of the details before the Seanad to-day.</P>

      <P>I take the blame.  But I had hoped that I had made it clear that we are insisting upon a standard of health for the retiring civil servant, but not for his wife.  Therefore, it is not true to say there is just as much chance of the wife dying before him as of his dying before her.  There is more chance, under the terms of this Bill, of her dying, because the Bill will apply only to healthy civil servants.  There is no question of its applying only to healthy wives.  Therefore, on an average, there is no question but that the Minister is wrong when he suggests that there is just as much chance of a wife surviving a healthy civil servant as there is of her surviving an average civil servant.  We are reducing the possibility&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 4:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (4), to delete paragraph (e).</P>
      <P>I admit I can quite see the arguments against the point which I want to raise.  As the sub-section stands, if a civil servant nominates his wife to receive a portion of his retiring allowance, and nominates her while he is in good health, and subsequently dies before he has retired, in that event, she receives nothing.  I fully understand the arguments against what I am putting forward.  However, it occurs to me that there might quite easily be cases in which a man, having nominated his wife in that way, while he was still in good health, might be under the impression that he had definitely provided for her future.  In such a case, it might be a very great hardship if he were to die unexpectedly and his wife were to be left quite unprovided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully appreciate that, if my suggestion were adopted, it would mean a certain additional burden on the actuarial tables.  However, I am putting forward the point merely for consideration. It is the case of a man in <Col N="1061" /> good health who nominates his wife, believing that he has made some provision for her in that way, and then, through his unexpected death before retiring, leaves the widow without any provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's case depends on the civil servant not understanding what he has done.  I do not think I should like to accept the view that civil servants are all as innocent as that.  There is the reverse side of the Senator's case.  A civil servant gives a notice of allocation to his wife, shall we say, and, before he retires, his wife dies.  If he decided to allocate one-third of his pension to his wife and then if she dies before he retires, that deprivation of the one-third of his pension is void and he gets the whole pension.  Therefore, it works both ways.  You must have some date on which it becomes operative for the purpose of reaching finality and for the purpose of making the computation. I think the date of retiring is as fair a date as you can get, making clear that if there is a case, such as Senator Cox mentioned, that if a person dies before he retires the allocation is void then, equally, if the dependent dies before the date of retirement, the allocation is also void and the civil servant concerned gets the full amount of the pension.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (4) (e), to delete all words after &ldquo;if&rdquo; in line 27 to the end of the paragraph and substitute either the established civil servant making the surrender, or the person benefiting therefrom, should die before the first payment arising from such a surrender becomes due.</P>
      <P>My reason for proposing this recommendation is not to change the purpose of the clause, as I saw it, but to express it in terms that I thought more understandable.  In the Bill the sub-section reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" />&ldquo;Notice of a surrender shall become null and void if, on a day on which the person wishing to make a surrender under this Act is an established civil servant, either that person or the proposed grantee of the pension under this Act dies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that that should read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;notice of a surrender shall become null and void if either the established civil servant making the surrender, or the person benefiting therefrom, should die before the first payment arising from such a surrender becomes due.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that covers the meaning of the other clause.  I said on the Second Stage that, having read it four or five times, I reached that conclusion.  I may be wrong.  At column 951 of Volume 46, No. 11, of the Official Report, the Minister said on the Second Stage debate on this Bill in this House:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am not quite satisfied that it is even so clear as the Senator suggests. Perhaps that is something lacking in my interpretation of it.  We will consider it between now and the Committee Stage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister granted me, therefore, that it was not very clearly worded.  I notice he has not in fact suggested any better wording himself.  I venture to hope that my wording covers the intention and that it will be found to be simpler than the original wording.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (5).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This seems to me to be the least defensible sub-section in the whole Bill. It is rather a long sub-section and I would like the attention of the Seanad for it.  What it amounts to is that, if a retiring civil servant decides to make a surrender on behalf of a certain named dependent and if subsequently the Minister finds out, after the time of the granting of the pension, that the person in question was not a dependent, then the surrender would still be valid, but the grantee of the pension will not get the payment.  In other words, a civil servant will be docked the quarter of the pension which he has given up, but the grantee will not get one penny of it after the time the Minister ascertains that he was not a dependent.  I would suggest that it is the job of the Minister to ascertain that before allowing the surrender. If the Minister fails in his <Col N="1064" /> duty so to ascertain, then I suggest it is monstrous to victimise the civil servant, and the grantee, after taking his money from him and then not allowing the money to be passed on.</P>
    <P>I think it is rather absurd because the definition of &ldquo;dependent&rdquo; in Section 1 is a person wholly or in part dependent on the earnings of such a person &ldquo;wholly or in part&rdquo;&mdash;so that if the civil servant can prove that he was giving say 1/- a week to a particular dependent, then that dependent is in part dependent, and it is a very extraordinary thing that if the Minister should ascertain later that he was not in fact giving him 1/- a week the surrender of portion of the pension will go for nothing, and the dead civil servant will have given up perhaps one-quarter of his pension for nothing. By the terms of this section it can be said later on: &ldquo;We have just discovered that this person was not really a dependent and consequently we are going to keep all the money the dead man sacrificed.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>With respect, no.  I may not have made myself quite clear.  If the Minister at the time of surrender, taking whatever precautions he pleases, has found that the person is a genuine dependent then for the purposes of this Bill the person should be considered a dependent forever; but the Minister is clearly to have it both ways.  He wants to have a person accepted as a dependent, but at the same time, if he discovers, years afterwards, <Col N="1065" /> that a mistake has been made, he wants to preserve the right to deprive the grantee of any portion of this pension, and to claim the right to retain the surrendered portion of the pension.  I think that this is a very bad sub-section and wholly unjust, and is a rather extraordinary way of trying to save the Minister from the effects of his own past mistakes, if he makes any.</P>

      <P>That means, in the case of a dead civil servant, someone will come forward and say that this part-pension should not be paid&mdash;perhaps by reason of not having the right relationship, in which case perhaps you would claim fraud, as the Minister did, using strong language, but perhaps also on the ground that the person was not even &ldquo;partly dependent&rdquo; upon the dead civil servant.  On those grounds, the Minister is asking us to give him the right, after the retired civil servant is dead and gone to stop payment to the wretched grantee in this niggardly way, the grantee who is deriving benefit not from the money of the Exchequer, but from money sacrificed by the retiring pensioner from his own pension.  Therefore, with respect, it still seems to me that this is an attempt to go back and rake up the question as to whether or not the Minister was right originally to accept such and such a person as a dependent. It might of course be a case of fraud, but the Minister has not said &ldquo;fraudulently&rdquo; in the Bill; it might arise not from fraud but from a misapprehension, or it might be that it was no longer possible to prove one thing or another, and it seems to me consequently that the clause as it now stands is, shall we say, singularly ungenerous.</P>

      <P>I have not put down any amendment, but I thought I should mention, and perhaps the Minister might consider, the provision under which a surrender may be made to the <Col N="1068" /> wife or one dependent.  The Minister has inserted in Section 7 an extremely wise provision in aid of children.  It might happen that a civil servant, or a person entitled to superannuation, might have to deal with two or three children.  I fully understand that the provision he has made for each of them would have to be extremely small.  I further see that if this idea were to be adopted, it would mean very many consequential amendments. However, I thought I should mention it, so that the Minister might consider whether it would be possible to give the retired civil servant a right, if there were more than one child, to make provision for both, so that the provisions of Section 7 might be applied to all children.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister this question?  In Section 3 and in several other places in the Bill, it is laid down that, where examination is required, the person who is having the examination shall pay the medical fee.  Will it not be the chief medical officer to the Civil Service who will carry out these medical examinations?  In view of the fact that there is a medical officer who would normally be carrying out these examinations, I wonder why the Minister has inserted that provision, since it is contrary to insurance practice usually for the examinee to pay the fee.  I wonder why the Minister has specified that the fee shall be paid by the person who has to undergo the examination.  Perhaps the Minister could consider that.</P>

      <P>As far as Senator Cox's point is concerned, I can see the Senator's point clearly in relation to Section 7, if I may, with your permission, a Chathaoirleach, slightly anticipate, as it is not possible to deal with Senator Cox's point without making some reference to Section 7. Section 7 is framed on the basis that you have the pension allotted first and then you switch from the pension into what I would call the educational endowment for the children.  You must have the single pension first.  If I were to accede to the case made by Senator Cox, I would have to deal with it in a different way because I <Col N="1069" /> think it would be undesirable to have a number of small pension sums which might not be commuted in the way in which they are in Section 7.</P>
      <P>I can see considerable difficulties in doing it from an administrative point of view on the basis on which the Bill is framed, but I admit quite frankly that the case made by the Senator appeals to me.  Section 7&mdash;containing the method of providing an educational endowment <i>in lieu</i> of a small pension for the whole life of a very young child&mdash;was in fact my own personal child, as I was particularly interested in it.  Between now and Report Stage, I will see if I can meet the Senator's point of view, but I think it would be more properly met on Section 7 than on Section 3 (1). What I have in mind is, if I can do it, in some way to fix the one allocation and divide the allocation afterwards on an educational basis.  That might be better; but I do not know that it would be possible administratively to do it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as Senator ffrench O'Carroll's point is concerned, there will be cases in which fees will be payable which will go into the Exchequer.  That is why the provision is there, which may mean they will have to go out again afterwards perhaps, but there are specific provisions in the terms of <Col N="1070" /> reference for the payment of fees in that way.  It is not a question of my making a profit, if you like, on the transaction.</P>
    <P>When Senator McHugh spoke earlier, he asked me a question on another amendment which I inadvertently forgot to answer.  He referred to the case of the civil servant who is compulsorily discharged.  I think there have been three cases&mdash;and only three &mdash;since the State was established and we hope there will not be any more, but if there are similar cases, we shall have to try to meet them administratively by ensuring that the provision will be available between the moment of decision and the moment of discharge.</P>

      <P>I want to ask a question for the purpose of clarification, as I do not see the matter made clear in the Bill.  It arises out of the provision for the case when the grantee of such a surrender dies before the established civil servant, who has already retired, dies.  It is clear that the surrender then becomes null and void under the terms of this section.  I should like to know if any provision is made for back-payment for refund to the civil servant of the part already surrendered in anticipation of a grant to a person who, in the event, dies before he or she can benefit from that grant?  In other words, he is making a sacrifice of a quarter of his pension.</P>
      <P>I am sorry if I am giving the Minister a headache.  I shall try to make my point clear.  Suppose a man retires at 65 and decides to sacrifice a quarter of his pension for his widow.  When the man is 70, having during those five years sacrificed a quarter of his pension, his wife dies, and, therefore, his surrender becomes null and void.  Is there provision for his getting a refund of the portion of his pension that he has lost for no purpose?</P>

      <P>I can only suggest with great respect that Senator Sheehy <Col N="1071" /> Skeffington should have a talk with an actuary as to how tables are made up.  First of all, the surrender does not become null and void.  The effect of the surrender has been exhausted. It is an entirely different thing.  It becomes null and void if the grantee dies before the civil servant retires. The case mentioned by the Senator is a case where the civil servant is 70 years of age.  He is then retired five years.  The effect of the surrender has become exhausted when the grantee dies after the civil servant has retired for five years.  I am afraid that it may be my deficiency, but I am not going to argue about that.  I am unable to make myself any clearer than I have done already as to the way actuarial tables are built up.  If the Senator still has any doubts on that subject, perhaps he would consult an actuary who would be much more competent than I to explain the basis.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), to delete paragraph (b).</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with recommendations Nos. 8 and 9 together, because recommendation No. 9 is consequential on recommendation No. 8.  My recommendation here is the deletion of paragraph (b) of sub-section 2 of Section 7. I entirely agree with what Senator Cox said about Section 7, that it is an imaginative and useful section.  It was made clear on the Second Stage that it meets a very real need, that in the case of a minor, who is a dependent, the retiring civil servant might like to sacrifice some of his pension but might not like to spread the payments over the whole life cycle of the dependent but would prefer to restrict it to a shorter period, for the purpose of educating the child, for instance.  For that reason, as Senator Cox said, this is an admirable section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But in sub-section 2 of Section 7 we find that there are certain restrictions, <Col N="1072" /> and one of them is the substitution of a more limited period of payment.  Let me read the paragraph.  &ldquo;A substitution shall not be made unless the Minister decides that the dependent is in good health.&rdquo;  This has nothing to do with the expectation of life of the retired civil servant, on pension so far as the superannuation scheme is concerned.  This is a case of ensuring that the dependent child&mdash;this refers only to minors&mdash;shall be &ldquo;in good health.&rdquo;  I could probably see&mdash; although in this I am open to correction&mdash;what was in the minds of the draftsmen who did not want a sacrifice of this kind to be made on behalf of the child who is in a very bad state of health, and might perhaps die before the full amount could be paid, but there are other forms of ill-health, one of them being mental retardment of some kind, which is not necessarily of a serious kind.  It would be possible to imagine a child suffering from some mental affliction which would by no means be reckoned to be a fatal one, and which would yet prevent the Minister deciding under this paragraph that the child was &ldquo;in good health,&rdquo; and, being so prevented, that particular child, suffering from that kind of disability, being precluded from the benefits of this excellent section.  It is for that reason I propose this recommendation and the other which is consequential upon it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had all the arguments here this afternoon about the basis of the tables depending on good health and I do not want to weary the House by repeating them at this stage.  There is one thing I must say, in view of the fact that Senator Sheehy Skeffington has again and again used the word &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo;. There is no question of any sacrifice in this Bill.  A civil servant is not compelled to do anything; he is not compelled to give anything up.  He is given an option or, as Senator Hayes said, he is making a bet.  He is given the option of using his judgment whether it is better for him in certain circumstances to divide the money he will receive for his pension himself in the ordinary way as between himself and another dependent.  How anybody <Col N="1073" /> can logically describe that as a sacrifice is, I am afraid, beyond me. It is an optional matter for the civil servant.  It should not be referred to in that way.  The arguments we have heard from Senator Sheehy Skeffington on this section are exactly the same as those to which I replied earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister claims that nobody can call this a sacrifice, because the civil servant is not &ldquo;compelled&rdquo; to make one.  I do not share the Minister's view that the word &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo; can be legitimately used only if one is forced to the action. On the contrary rather, it cannot be used legitimately if the act of the person involved is compulsory.  I am quite aware that the civil servant is making a voluntary forfeit of part of his pension and I submit that that is a sacrifice, but the other point has not been met by the Minister at all. He did not advert to the fact that this excellent section, which enables a man to substitute for a life annuity a sum calculated over a short period of years, does not operate should the beneficiary minor in question not be in good health.  He has not referred at all to the fact that such a child dependent, as I suggested, might be suffering from some minor mental affliction. The Minister has not justified at all on any actuarial basis, though he likes to throw the word around, that a child suffering from some mental affliction is excluded from the privileges accorded by this excellent section. It is all very well for the Minister to say that an actuary could explain that, but I would ask the Minister if he cannot give us some better justification than he has done for the exclusion from this section of a dependent child who happens to suffer from some mental affliction.</P>

I can only ask the Seanad to assume that if the Minister seeks power to set up a consultative committee under the Bill, he will desire to have on it representatives of all those who can contribute specialised knowledge in respect of any aspect of the trade.  I could not undertake to have everybody who thinks he has special knowledge, but I can reassure the Seanad that anyone who can reasonably be deemed to have special knowledge will be asked to assist in our deliberations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), (a) (i), line 32, before &ldquo;or&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(not being the proprietary name used by the manufacturer or vendor to denote the remedy)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My fear arises from the rather mysterious phrase &ldquo;the appropriate commercial common name&rdquo;.  If I put a preparation on the market called &ldquo;Coxo&rdquo; I do not think it gives very much information to the public, if the name &ldquo;Coxo&rdquo; appears on the label. For that reason, I suggest that the <Col N="1078" /> section should not be satisfied if the appropriate common name is taken as being the proprietary name used by the manufacturer or vendor.  Therefore, my suggestion is that the section should say that the provision as to the name that must appear in addition to the proprietary name would not be satisfied merely by giving the proprietary name.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt the Senator has considered paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) which requires him, in the unlikely event that he has envisaged, not only to give the name &ldquo;Coxo&rdquo; of the remedy, but also to specify the remedial property or properties claimed for &ldquo;Coxo&rdquo;, the name and address of the manufacturer and packer of &ldquo;Coxo&rdquo;, and such other particulars as may be prescribed from time to time by the regulations made by the Minister after consultation with the consultative committee in respect of &ldquo;Coxo&rdquo;.  This, I think, gives a sufficiently wide power to the Minister, in consultation with his consultative council, to requisition from the manufacturer of any specific proprietary remedy the necessary information I think the farmer ought to have if he contemplates purchasing the preparation.</P>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), to delete paragraph (c) and substitute the following new paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c) (i)  in a case where the remedy is imported in bulk and packed in the State, the name and address of the importer and packer of the remedy,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  in a case where the remedy is manufactured in the State for and under the control of a person who manufactures the same remedy or causes it to be manufactured outside the State, the name and address of that person and that the remedy is manufactured in the State for and under the control of that person and the name and <Col N="1079" /> address of the packer of the remedy, or</P>
    <P>(iii)  in any other case, the name and address of the manufacturer and packer of the remedy, and&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment I am offering to the Seanad with the intention of meeting a number of points raised on the Second Stage.  I think it goes a long way to meet most of the points that have been raised.  I should be glad, and it would be of assistance to me, if any Senator, having considered this amendment, would indicate to me if it fails to meet the points raised at an earlier stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is true to say that the Minister has in this amendment met almost fully the wishes of the trade, but there is one word which, if he would consider changing it, would fully meet the wishes of the trade.  In sub-section (2), the word &ldquo;packer&rdquo; appears, and I suggest that it be changed to &ldquo;distributing agent&rdquo;. The reason for that is the Minister for Industry and Commerce some years ago encouraged the setting up in this country of an industry to perform the work covered by this sub-section, that is, the making of remedies by a manufacturer in this country for other outside people, and thereby quite a substantial industry was set up here.  Machinery was bought at great expense and quite a substantial amount of employment has been given.  I am informed that if this word &ldquo;packer&rdquo; must appear, if the packer's name must appear as well as that of the owner of the remedy, this work will not be given here, because in some cases the Irish manufacturer is himself making up a preparation which is in competition with the outside sponsor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the words &ldquo;distributing agent&rdquo; were put in, instead of &ldquo;packer&rdquo;, I am sure this difficulty would be overcome. I quite see the Minister's difficulty.  He may say: &ldquo;If we have only the distributing agent, instead of the packer, we have not such a good mark to come back to, if there is anything wrong in the preparation.&rdquo;  I suggest that, if there is a danger of <Col N="1080" /> that kind, the damage done by keeping the word &ldquo;packer&rdquo; is so much greater that it would be worth taking the risk. Therefore, I would ask the Minister if he could see his way to change the word &ldquo;packer&rdquo; and to make it &ldquo;distributing agent&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points which I should like to raise on the amendment. I notice that in (i) the name of the manufacturer should appear.  That paragraph deals with a remedy which is imported and packed here.  However, all to be put on the label is the name of the importer and the name of the packer.  It would seem that that does not give sufficient information and that the name of the manufacturer &mdash;who, of course, would be a foreign firm&mdash;should appear.  It does not really tell anybody very much to be informed that I have imported this or that I have packed it.  The important thing is that people should know that the remedy was manufactured by some reputable British, German or American firm.  I suggest the Minister should reconsider sub-paragraph (i).</P>
      <P>Sub-paragraph (ii), I think, requires a good deal of reconsideration.  It speaks of a remedy manufactured in the State for and under the control of a person who manufactures the same remedy outside the State.  That at once conveys to my mind the common case of some well-known product&mdash;we will call it Bovril&mdash;which is manufactured in England and which is manufactured here.  However, it would not be manufactured here under the control of the English company.  It would probably be manufactured here almost invariably by some small Irish company that would comply with the Control of Manufactures Act.</P>
      <P>A very important point arises in connection with the trade marks. Where a trade mark is registered, and if the trade mark is to be preserved, the products must be either manufactured or marketed by the person who owns the trade mark.  The section as it is worded seems to me to suggest that it is speaking of goods which are in some strange way being manufactured here under the control of somebody outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> I think it will be found in practice that sub-paragraph (ii) would run contrary to what is necessary for the protection of trade marks and that it would also not convey the real position to the public or the users.  One frequently has cases of proprietary goods manufactured here by an Irish firm and then handed over, let us say, to the English company who distribute them here.  That is very common and very proper.  Normally, in that case, what appears on the label is &ldquo;Manufactured in Ireland by so-and-so. Distributed by so-and-so.&rdquo;  That seems to me to be the kind of thing that ought to appear on these labels.  If the sub-paragraph were to become law as it stands, I think it would tell people to do something which would be contrary to the protection of the trade mark.  Therefore, I think it should be reconsidered.  At the moment, I am not able to suggest the proper wording to adopt.  I suggest it should be wording which indicates always the manufacturer, in the case of imported stuff always the packer, and, in the case of imported stuff, always the name of the foreign firm that manufactures it.  I think these things are essential.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand to what category sub-paragraph (iii) refers.  In sub-paragraph (ii), there is the case of the remedy being manufactured here.  I take it that sub-paragraph (iii) must really refer to the case where small quantities of imported goods arise.  In that event, it might be very difficult to secure compliance. Suppose there is some kind of preparation which is not packed here, which is not manufactured here and which I want to bring into the country for my own use.  It seems to me that it would be difficult to understand exactly in practice how sub-paragraph (iii) would work.  Perhaps that sub-paragraph requires a little further consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with each Senator's point, as raised.  I would ask Senators to see what this amendment seeks to do.  As originally submitted to the Seanad, the section contained one short paragraph (c). That paragraph required the publication on the packet of the name and <Col N="1082" /> address of the manufacturer and packer of the remedy.  Certain representations were made to me on the Second Stage of the Bill in the Seanad that there were certain persons in special circumstances and, if they were required to comply with paragraph (c) as it originally stood, it might operate so far to their detriment that they would cease to operate altogether, with consequential loss of employment and business here.</P>
      <P>The amendment submitted is designed to preserve, in respect of remedies manufactured and packed in Ireland, the substance of the original paragraph.  Sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) of the amendment are designed to meet the special cases that were mentioned.  Sub-paragraph (i) deals with cases where you import a commodity in bulk.  I am informed that the practice of the trade frequently is that they may buy a commodity like bread-soda through a broker.  This is a standardised preparation.  They would buy it according to British pharmacopoeia specifications.  It frequently happens that they do not know who manufactures it and they do not care, so long as the preparation comes up to a recognised international standard.  The same might be true of a commodity like sulphur.  However, there are what are called British pharmacopoeia standards.  The consignee can test the product and, if it does not comply with these standards, he can reject it.  If he does, then he is not interested as to who manufactures it, provided it meets the standard specification in regard to purity and potency.  That is the purpose then of paragraph (i), to facilitate the normal channel of trade so long as we have the guarantee that there is available to the trade the standard practice which removes from the ambit of possibility the substitution of an inferior product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (ii) is designed to meet another case that was pressed upon me by the Seanad on the Second Stage. There may be a firm in Great Britain or elsewhere who have built up a market here for, say, sheep dip, according to their own formula.  The size of the market they have here is not sufficiently big to justify their <Col N="1083" /> setting up their own factory here to manufacture their formula for sheep dip, but nevertheless you may find in certain areas groups of sheep producers who have a special faith in this sheep dip.  This is designed to enable that firm to commission a firm in this country to pack the product on their behalf and to label it as &ldquo;so-and-so's sheep dip.&rdquo;  Then, as the amendment stands, it will have to set out &ldquo;packed by so-and-so in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire pointed out that that may give rise to difficulties because the firm that is packing the sheep dip for the British firm may itself be providing a sheep dip on the market and you might have the embarrassing situation that the sheep dip &ldquo;A.B.&rdquo; was being packed by &ldquo;C.D.&rdquo; who themselves were offering &ldquo;C.D. sheep dip&rdquo; on the Irish market.  I doubt if we can avoid that difficulty, although I would like to meet Senator McGuire who is experienced in these matters, if at all possible, and I will return to that specific point in a moment.</P>
    <P>I should like to satisfy myself that I have made the position clear to Senator Cox.  Paragraph (iii) of the amendment, in effect, reinstates paragraph (c) of the original section, with the qualifications contained in paragraph (i).  That is the position.  The Senator has expressed apprehension that the procedure envisaged under paragraph (ii) of the amendment might conflict with obligations under the Trade Marks Act.  I can only tell the Senator that the paragraph was designed to meet the case of certain persons actually engaged in the trade. My best advice is that it will not have any such unfortunate effect and it is expressly designed to meet the difficulty of persons who would have trade marks in Great Britain and who would wish to preserve and use them on the Irish market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate the Minister's point and I assure him I do not want to be difficult, but I think there is some substance in what I say. In regard to the first paragraph, I accept what he says, that the commodity might normally be a commodity that would be of a certain standard <Col N="1084" /> but there might also be the case of a purely manufactured product.  He has given the case of some well-known substance to which the British pharmacopoeia standards apply coming in. There might also be some sheep dip brought in in bulk now and under paragraph (ii) there is no indication given of the source of manufacture.</P>
      <P>Coming to paragraph (iii), I am still unhappy about it.  I do not understand this case of little groups throughout the country manufacturing, perhaps, some well-known sheep dip. I do not believe that can happen because if the sheep dip is under a proprietary name, an English manufacturer permitting that to happen would be destroying his English trade mark.  I still believe that sub-section (ii) sets up a state of things which would be very difficult to apply and at the same time protect the trade mark of the firm involved.  I think that between now and the Report Stage the matter might be considered. It is merely a question of words on a purely technical point of law.  In the course of a legal practice, one comes across a great deal of this kind of thing, of foreign firms wanting to have on the market here well-known preparations and it is essential to protect, not only in the interest of foreign firms but in the interests of the Irish public, the sanctity of the trade mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that I greatly appreciate the way in which the Minister has attempted, and has succeeded to a very great extent, to grapple with the very great complexities involved in this section?  I may say that I personally have received an insight into those complexities which I hardly thought would have been possible before I thought on this Bill.  I think the point that Senator McGuire has made will meet the requirements of these traders and manufacturers who do not want their particular form of trade to be tied up in a way in which no other form of trade is tied up as yet.  May I make that point clearer?  I think in many ways this is a model Bill, in the sense that similar enactments may be brought in regard to insecticides, fertilisers or weed killers, and if a <Col N="1085" /> clause of this kind already exists, it will tend to be the model for all succeeding Bills.  I think it is worth our while to spend a good deal of time and patience over this section.</P>
      <P>May I say very briefly that I think the representatives of the trade would be better satisfied if the Minister would accept in paragraph (ii) in the last line there, after the word &ldquo;packer&rdquo; of the remedy, the words &ldquo;or sole distributing company in the State&rdquo;?  This, I think, meets the Minister a little better than Senator McGuire's suggestion.  It puts in &ldquo;or sole distributing company in the State&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I see it, the great difficulty is that the packer and the manufacturer may be the same people, so if you make it compulsory to publish the packer's name you are making it compulsory to publish the manufacturer's name, which is giving away certain trade information which might damage the trade.  Some of us may think that it would be of benefit to the customer to know this; but I say that is a shortsighted view.  I would emphasise that the restrictions we are putting on this particular trade here do not hold in any other trade, since this is a new kind of Bill.  Therefore, might I ask the Minister, without making any further efforts to explain the complexities&mdash;I will explain them, if necessary &mdash;if he would accept this suggestion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other two parts of his amendment are entirely satisfactory and much better than anything contained in the amendment I offered, which I withdraw.  Would he consider inserting, three lines from the foot of the page, after the word &ldquo;packer&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;or sole distributing company in the State&rdquo;?  Then, if the manufacturer and the packer are the same, one could put in the distributor's name. The object, I understand, is to have some permanent address that the law can get at if there is a quack remedy. I will not go into it further, but I assure the Minister that he would get just as good an address from the distributing company in the State as he would from the packer.  The Minister has shown an accommodating spirit <Col N="1086" /> up to the moment and I hope he will go on to concede this small alternative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Seanad not to ask me to change the amendment at once, but to accept it as it stands at the moment, on the understanding that, with the more compendious matters raised by Senator Stanford and Senator McGuire, it will be considered, to see if the minimum requirements can be met on the lines suggested by them.  Perhaps that would be agreeable to the Seanad.</P>

    <P>This amendment is simple, to ensure that the provision will not apply to goods that are exported.

      <P>It seems to me that this might be an unwise amendment.  I should like to feel that whatever we require in the way of standards and clarification of goods for sale within the country we might equally require for the export of goods to places abroad.  In other words, I think the good name of the country to some extent depends on the sort of standard that we visibly apply to our own exports.  I do not think any reputable manufacturer would feel it a hardship to have to comply with this section in relation also to goods he is exporting.  It would become almost automatic, and it would seem to me that the good name of our exporters would be enhanced by the observation of a regulation for export goods similar to that required for goods sold here.  Therefore, I think the amendment might be an unwise one.</P>

      <P>The plain fact is that we never meant this Bill to apply to exported merchandise.  This Bill is designed to provide for our own people, in respect of imported or home manufactured animal remedies, certain minimal information to protect our own people from exploitation.  I suppose one could argue that if one were setting out to fix standards of ethical conduct for all and sundry, a great deal might be said for Senator Sheehy Skeffington, but in the limited assignment I set myself and which I believe was set for me for the modest remuneration of £1,525 a year, I think I am doing enough if I look after our own, without looking further afield.</P>

Outside my official duties, I might be tempted to follow into the empyrean of Senator Sheehy Skeffington, but, in the modest scope of my employment, I am prepared to accept the amendment proposed by Senator Cox, because I think he rightly defines the true intended ambit of this Bill and it would not be correct for me to represent to the Seanad that the purpose of the Bill was wider than I intended it to be or that my function under it was more extensive than it will, in fact, be, that is, to protect our own people from exploitation by misrepresentation or inadequate information as to that which they are entitled to buy.</P>

      <P>I should like some suggestion from the proposer of the amendment as to what way it would be vexatious for an exporter of a reputable Irish product to give to the country to which the product was being exported the details which we regard as legitimate to ask from them in relation to goods to be sold here?  In what sense would these regulations be vexatious to him?  I do not think these provisions are vexatious, and I cannot conceive of a reputable manufacturer being unwilling to give these details in respect of any article we would be proud to export.  The Minister says that in this Bill he does not want to follow me into the empyrean but I suggest that it is he who is already there, by the provisions of his Bill.  This amendment is for the purpose of changing a provision that is already in the Bill.  I think the Bill, as it stands, and as he put it before us is a good one, and I would be sorry to see him depart from the high attitude with which he first put the Bill before us.</P>

      <P>I did not put down my amendment with either moral or immoral thoughts.  All that interested me was that when a firm exports to a foreign country, it has to conform with the regulations of the foreign country and has to export under a label such as is acceptable to the people in the foreign country.  If one is to export <Col N="1090" /> successfully to the Malayan market, Hong Kong or South Africa, one has, in the make-up of the goods and the labels, to conform with the regulations of that territory.  An Irish manufacturer has already very great difficulties to meet, but the situation would be far more difficult if he had, in addition, to comply with rather complicated regulations.</P>

      <P>This is a section about which I said something on the Second Stage, and I was rather disappointed to find that the Minister did not apparently consider it worth while to abate somewhat the stringency of the wording of the provisions of this rather short section which asks that: &ldquo;The particulars required by this Act to be given in connection with any sale, importation or advertisement of any animal remedy...shall not be so given by any person as to convey or be likely to convey a false or misleading indication or impression of the composition, remedial value or effectiveness of such remedy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I suggested on the Second Stage, and I still am of the same opinion, that, in asking this, the Minister is asking too much.  It is quite idealistic to desire that there would never be the slightest detail of any advertisement of any remedy conveying, or &ldquo;likely to convey,&rdquo; a false or misleading indication or &ldquo;impression&rdquo; as to remedial value, but if you try to apply that, and try to operate such a stringent clause as that, I think it will be found to be inoperative, because I feel the Minister is asking too much. I am afraid that he is setting, for ordinary human practical purposes, too high a standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the section would be very difficult to apply and, speaking subject to a lawyer's opinion, I suggest it would be very difficult to interpret in the courts.  I think it is quite a worthy ideal, but I do not think in fact it is practical politics. <Col N="1091" /> The Minister told us he is a pragmatic man, but I suggest that this section is not practical politics.  It is generally recognised&mdash;we make allowances for the fact&mdash;that advertisements tend to give a somewhat misleading impression as to the remedial value of certain medicines and so on.</P>
    <P>There is that general tendency and one makes allowances for it, but, when one says that such a thing is &ldquo;the greatest in the country&rdquo;, &ldquo;the greatest in the world&rdquo;, or &ldquo;the greatest in all time&rdquo;, I would not like to feel that a manufacturer inserting such an advertisement was committing an offence under the Act, and would have to prove that it was not misleading. I suggest that the section would be largely nugatory, and that it would be impossible to apply.  We make allowance for tacit recognition of the fact that advertisements do tend to give a misleading impression, though the desire mildly to deceive is not necessarily a corrupt one.  I suggest that political Party advertisements may sometimes give a misleading impression, and may contain to a large degree a quantity of what was referred to on the previous stage as &ldquo;passive ingredients&rdquo;, which could, perhaps, &ldquo;do no harm&rdquo;, but at the same time would do no great good.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister, therefore, not to be too exacting, and not to set a standard which cannot be achieved in practice, when in other fields we are forced to accept lower standards.  The Minister in this connection referred to the parable of the Pharisee and the Publican; and if I understood him correctly he cast himself in the role of the publican &ldquo;that humbleth himself&rdquo;.  I found it very gratifying that he did so, and I feel that it would be a good thing for all Ministers to wield the formidable weapon of humility.  I am not quite sure it is one of the points which would appear in one's ordinary conception of the many virtues of the present Minister. In fact, in relation to this particular Bill, however, I suggest he is not in fact humbling himself at all. Quite on the contrary, he is asking a higher standard from the advertisers of animal remedies than is deemed <Col N="1092" /> possible for advertisements dealing with human remedies, and, perhaps, even political remedies.  I would suggest he modify the wording or, perhaps, drop the section.</P>

      <P>The Senator has raised an interesting point.  In exporting goods to America, one is precluded from using words describing products as &ldquo;the finest&rdquo; or &ldquo;the best&rdquo;.  Maybe the Senator has missed this point.  I think the Minister is covering only what is already done in other countries. Perhaps the Minister is only bringing us into line with other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a very modest ambition.  It is no more than this: if a product is offered to a farmer in this country in a container, that container will not bear upon it words designed to convey, or to be likely to convey, the misleading implication and impression that it is a sure and certain cure for fluke when, in fact, it is a sure and certain cure for nothing.  Because we, the Department of Agriculture, believe that if a farmer is misled into the belief that what he has purchased, paid for, and administered, is a sure and certain cure for fluke, he will be misled into a catastrophic situation, in which, by the time he realises that he has been misled and has had a false impression created upon him, the animal will be beyond curing.  That is all.</P>
      <P>If we seek to circumscribe the liabilities of the vendor of such a preparation, we provide him with limitless loopholes.  If we simply express in the section the obligation on him not to mislead, surely the courts can be trusted to interpret that rationally and to determine equitable as between the State and the individual vendor whether or not the words he has used to commend his product can rightly be described as calculated to convey, or to be likely to convey, a false or misleading impression of the composition, remedial value, or effectiveness of such a remedy.  My apprehension is that, if I seek to qualify these words, I will create a situation in which it will be impossible to bring the most flagrant violator of the whole principle of this Bill to book.</P>

      <Col N="1093" /> I have every reason to hope that in so far as the greater part of these remedies are dispensed or sold by members of a highly reputable and responsible body, the pharmaceutical chemists of this country, the members of this body will see to it that the merchandise presented to them by the wholesalers or manufacturers is described within the terms of the Bill, and that they will draw the attention of the wholesalers or manufacturers to the provisions of this Bill and point out the obligations to give a fair and truthful description of their products.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy with the point made by Senator Sheehy Skeffington. I do think this section is severe and I reinforce that assurance of sympathy by the expression of the hope that in fact the enforcement of the provisions of this Bill by recourse to litigation will be very infrequent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost 80 years have passed since legislation was first introduced, in the interests of public health, to improve the quality and purity of milk sold for human consumption.  In all that time, the constant aim has been to ensure as far as possible that milk reaching the consumer should be of a high standard of quality and free from disease organisms or other contamination harmful to human beings.  To achieve this, it was found essential that strict supervision and control should be exercised at all stages of the production of milk and of its subsequent handling and distribution up to the point of delivery to the consumer. The general system of such control was initiated under the Contagious Diseases of Animals Act, 1878 and was revised and modernised under the Act which is at present in operation, namely the Milk and Dairies Act, 1935.</P>
      <P>While the administration of the latter Act is entrusted to the Ministers for Health and Agriculture, the detailed exercise of the various controls is a function of the local sanitary authorities, and it is a tribute to them that in the 21 years in which they have performed their onerous duties in regard to milk, the quality and wholesomeness of our liquid milk supplies has been greatly improved.</P>
      <P>Although the Act of 1935 has operated smoothly, I think that the time has come when it is necessary to tighten up on the system of control and to further facilitate its operation by removing some administrative difficulties which experience of the day-to-day working of the Act has disclosed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the details of the Bill, I have been glad to arrange for the circulation <Col N="1095" /> to members of this House of a memorandum which explains the provisions of each section.  I trust that Senators will have found the memorandum fully explanatory, but if there are any matters about which they may still be in doubt, I will be only too glad to clarify them further in the course of the discussion on the Bill.  As each section has been formulated for the sole purpose of ensuring that at all times the public milk supply will be of the highest possible quality, I am quite confident that Senators will unanimously endorse the proposals contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to add that the reason I have adopted the procedure of formulating the memorandum at this stage is that the Bill is largely a Bill by reference, and it imposes on Senators a well-nigh intolerable burden if they have to refer to every statute which this Bill purports to amend.  I think it would suit their convenience better if I scheduled all the amendments and the relevant statutes and explained in the memorandum exactly what the effects of each amendment would be.</P>

Tá sé i gceist, áfach, cé an fhaid is ceart dul leis an gcuspóir sin.

    <P>I have not very much to add to what I have already said in Irish on this Bill.  As the Minister has stated, it is largely a Bill of reference to other Acts, chiefly to the Milk and Dairies Act, 1935.  Because it is a measure of reference, it is all the more difficult to grasp the various sections.  It is also rendered more complicated by reason of the fact that two Ministers are involved, if not three&mdash;the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Health, and then we have the local authorities and, by reason of the fact that they enter into it, we can say that the Minister for Local Government has some function.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say at the outset that it is right and proper that the Minister, or both Ministers&mdash;the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Health&mdash;should have the necessary authority to enforce regulations in relation to the sale and distribution of liquid milk, so as to ensure, as far as is humanly possible, that no contamination will arise to the general public from milk which otherwise might be sold and delivered under unhygienic conditions.  Milk is a very important commodity in the dietary of the country, especially for young people.  Everybody knows that milk is highly susceptible to contamination, <Col N="1097" /> unless it is handled properly.  The fundamental consideration in connection with the sale and distribution of milk is cleanliness and every effort should be made to ensure that milk which is for sale and distribution is stored in clean and well-kept containers.</P>
      <P>As I have said in connection with other measures which have come before the Seanad, when setting out to safeguard the public weal, it is necessary sometimes to subject certain sections of the community to some inconvenience. That is the case in relation to the subject of liquid milk.  There are people who would complain, those engaged in the sale and distribution of milk, that even the existing regulations press too heavily upon them&mdash;those who have to register their dairies, say, under existing legislation before they can engage in selling milk to their customers.  I suppose the criterion in all these cases should be that certain sacrifices and certain inconveniences would justify the promotion of the welfare of the community in general.</P>
      <P>There is really no fundamental change being made in this measure in relation to the sale and distribution of milk. There are, however, a few things that may require further elucidation.  In that regard, I should like to draw attention to Sections 11 and 12.  Here there appears to be a departure in the enforcement of the regulations which are envisaged in this measure.  Heretofore, the power of exemption has been of a general nature.  In other words, there was power of general exemption for milk producers who, in times of scarcity, would be engaged in the sale of milk to the amount of two gallons per day and also for creameries that would engage in the sale of milk up to the amount of five gallons per day.  Now it appears that that is being changed and that only in special circumstances will this exemption be granted by the Minister himself, after consultation with the local sanitary authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Really I do not know whether there is any great necessity for that change. It appears to me to be what could be described as an extension of bureaucratic control, giving more power of <Col N="1098" /> intervention to the Minister for Agriculture, whoever he may be for the time being.  Many of us have always been opposed to any extension of bureaucratic control.  The same argument applies to Section 12 in regard to creameries engaging in the pasteurisation of milk.  Hitherto, there was no obligation upon these to register in order to engage in the sale of pasteurised milk, but now again that position is being altered.  It is only if and when special circumstances may arise that this exemption will be granted, and it is the Minister himself, as far as I can judge, who will decide whether these special circumstances justify the exemption.  I regard that as a rather drastic change in the law relating to the sale and distribution of milk.</P>
    <P>The Minister was good enough to circulate an explanatory memorandum to enable members of the Seanad to grasp the meaning of these various sections, but, even with the aid of the memorandum, I must confess that it is a highly technical and involved measure.  As I said at the outset, any measure which involves looking up references to previous Acts is bound to be complicated and difficult to grasp.  However, we shall have time, I take it, between now and the Committee Stage, to give it further and better consideration.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, I am in agreement with the terms of the Bill and with the objects which the Minister is setting out to achieve, namely, to make every effort to ensure that milk is sold and delivered under proper hygienic conditions.  There is nobody in the country who would find fault with that idea.  The only thing, as I said before, is whether the powers which are sought by the Minister in this measure may not be excessive.  I take it, however, that the provisions of this Bill are the results, more or less, of what has been found out by experience over the years and I am satisfied therefore that the House would be justified in approving of this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to start by complimenting the Minister on this memorandum which he has sent out.  It seems to me to set a headline <Col N="1099" /> for similar memoranda issued in connection with other Bills.  It really makes clear what the Bill is intended to do.  Sometimes I get the impression that the explanatory memorandum is not as clear as the Bill itself.  Here, although it is long, if we take the trouble to read the paragraphs, we find precisely what each section is destined to accomplish.  The Bill, as I understand it, but I do not pretend to be an expert, is a good Bill, and represents a tightening up of legislation, a modification in some respects, but on the whole a tightening up of legislation designed to give a better quality of milk to the consumer.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into a lot of detail, but the sort of thing that seems to me to be worthy of praise in the memorandum is, for instance, a note about Section 10, which states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Under Section 24 of the Principal Act it is an offence for a dairyman to sell milk for human consumption unless he is registered under the Act.  Experience of the working of the Act has shown that it is desirable that it should also be made an offence for a registered dairyman to buy milk from an unregistered dairyman&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and so on.  That is an example of something which may seem a small point, but which, in practice, is going to make for a better quality of milk to the consumer.  In relation to Section 11 also, the concession which is now being terminated, and which allowed unregistered dairymen to sell up to two gallons of milk a day, again it is a small point, but it seems to me that that type of concession should indeed be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that the Minister retains power to waive it, and I think the retention of that power is also justified and could be valuable. The note on Section 12 makes it clear that provision had been made under the previous Act &ldquo;that suppliers of milk to creameries holding licences to pasteurise milk for sale for liquid consumption <Col N="1100" /> were exempted from registration as dairymen with the local sanitary authority, and from the scope of the regulations under the Principal Act governing the hygienic production and handling of milk, that these exemptions were terminable by Order of the Minister&rdquo; and so on.  That is to be changed.  An increasing number of creameries is to be brought under the ordinary application of the Act.  Again, I welcome that as an important added safeguard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will recall the undertaking which I gave to the House on the question of temporary legislation. I undertook that such legislation would be carefully examined to see the extent to which it is still required and that, where it was necessary to retain certain powers, permanent legislation would be introduced to replace the temporary provisions. This is the permanent legislation relating to the production and price of flour and wheatenmeal.</P>
      <P>This Bill seeks to give extended life to Orders which, in the normal way, would lapse with the expiry of the Supplies and Services Act.  The Orders under which the controls are at present exercised are the Flour and Wheatenmeal Order, 1955, and the Flour and Wheatenmeal Order, 1955 (Amendment) Order, 1956.  The main provisions of these Orders are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  When wheat is being cleaned preparatory to milling not more than 2½ per cent. of the wheat may be removed as screenings.</P>
      <P>(b)  Millers may not make or sell any flour or wheatenmeal other than &ldquo;straight run&rdquo; flour and standard wheatenmeal.</P>
      <P>(c)  Flour and wheatenmeal of different kinds may not be sold in excess of fixed maximum prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1101" /> (d)  Flour and wheatenmeal may not be sieved by bakers and others who use flour and wheatenmeal for the purposes of their business.</P>
    <P>(e)  Wheatenmeal and flour other than flour of a certain extraction may not be used in the manufacture of biscuits and confectionery.  This restriction makes it illegal to use subsidised flour for the manufacture of biscuits and confectionery.</P>
    <P>(f)  The Minister may, by permit, give relief from any of the prohibitions contained in the Orders and may attach to the permits such conditions as he thinks fit.</P>
    <P>A difference (but not a difference in principle) between the provisions of the Bill and the provisions of the Orders which will be allowed to expire is that the prices for &ldquo;straight run&rdquo; flour and standard wheatenmeal are specified in the Orders, while the Bill provides that the Minister may make regulations to prescribe the prices which may be charged.</P>
    <P>It has been the practice, in administering the flour subsidy, to settle the proportions of native and imported wheat to be contained in the grist which is milled into flour and to prescribe the extraction rates at which the grist is to be milled, that is to say, how much of the products of the milling is to be taken off as flour and how much to be taken off as offal.  It is proposed in the Bill to take power to prescribe these matters.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions are ancillary to the main provisions I have indicated.  As well as the usual clauses relating to enforcement, the Bill provides that any regulations which may be made shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either House within the next 21 sitting days the regulation shall be annualled, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>This Bill is doing in a permanent way what is at present done by Orders under the Supplies and Services Act, which is normally due to expire in March next.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is very much that I can usefully say on this measure. As the Minister stated, he is now putting an end to certain Emergency Powers Orders and having them enacted in the form of permanent legislation.  That, I think, is a step in the right direction, especially as regards such an important matter as flour and wheatenmeal.</P>
      <P>There is one point I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister.  It arises in connection with Section 6 of the Bill, the regulation and control of flour and wheatenmeal.  Some time ago we had a short discussion in the Seanad as to whether it was absolutely necessary to continue the mixture of foreign wheat with home grown wheat to produce a satisfactory loaf of bread. Senators will remember, when that discussion took place, the Minister for Agriculture was present and made certain observations which I should like to recall to the House.</P>
      <P>At that time I gave expression to the opinion that the time had come when steps should be taken to ascertain once and for all time whether it was in fact necessary to have this mixture of foreign flour, of imported wheat, for the manufacture of a satisfactory loaf here.  I referred to the opinion, a scientific opinion that was given by certain Swedish experts, but the Minister for Agriculture told the House that he would not for one depend on any views that would come from outside, that it was better to have the matter decided here at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With a view to having that done, he said the matter was being referred to the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards.  It is almost 12 months since the Minister for Agriculture made that statement, and while I am <Col N="1103" /> not one who would expect any hasty decision in an important matter of this kind, still the Minister for Industry and Commerce may be in a position to give some indication as to what progress has been made in having this very important matter resolved.</P>
    <P>It is of fundamental importance, in my opinion, because it affects very closely the position of the adverse balance of payments.  If it could be established beyond all doubt, and if certain prejudices could be removed in connection with the whole matter, it would be a great step forward.  I would ask the Minister if he has any knowledge of what has taken place or what progress has been made in connection with this matter.</P>

I am not sure, however, whether that comes under it, or whether it is under the regulations which are being superseded by this Bill that the Minister was enabled to reduce the size of the loaf in order to avoid increasing the price.</P>

I assume that, apart from the price of bread, it may be possible that it is under this Bill that the Minister regulates the size of the loaf.  The Minister does have power under this Bill to regulate the price of flour and to regulate the percentage of extraction of screenings that may be removed from the wheat.  For one not an expert in milling it is intriguing to note that not more than 2½ per cent. screenings may be extracted.  If wheat is of very poor quality and includes a very large percentage of seeds and other matter, I do not know how it is going to be <Col N="1104" /> dealt with.  That is a matter of detail, I suppose, but it does strike one that a limit of 2½ per cent. might create difficulties if the wheat was of very poor quality.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister under this Bill has very wide powers of regulation and control and I hope those powers will be used, in the main, not only to ensure a better loaf for our people, and possibly a bigger loaf, but also to ensure that a higher and still higher percentage of our bread grist is of home production.  I think that investigations have shown that we can increase the percentage of home grain very considerably, almost to 100 per cent.  I hold that view in face of an expert's opinion which was supplied some time ago and which with your permission, Sir, I would like to quote. It is in Volume 106, column 2049:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When the time came in the spring of this year when our people were no longer able to get Canadian wheat for the first time since the emergency, we had the enthralling, stimulating and surprising experience of eating bread made out of Irish wheat.  Before you ate it you had to hold it out in your hands, squeeze the water out of it, then tease it out and make up your mind whether it was a handful of boot-polish or bread.  If it was boot-polish, you put it on your boots or shoes. If it was bread, you tried to masticate it if you were fit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the &ldquo;expert&rdquo; opinion on Irish wheat.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Minister's duty to ensure a higher quality production and, notwithstanding the stated opinion of one of the Minister's colleagues, I believe it is possible to produce first class flour and first class <Col N="1105" /> bread out of native wheat.  In this connection, however, it will be the duty of the Minister, or whoever occupies the Minister's position in the future, to see that the millers make some reasonable attempt to co-operate with the farmers. It is appalling to find that the policy of our millers generally is one of hostility to the native wheat grower, and every obstacle that can be placed in the way of the wheat grower is placed in his way, and every difficulty that can be created is created not only for the grower but for the miller's own agents who are trying to facilitate the growers and take the wheat from them.</P>
      <P>That is something into which the Minister will have to look very carefully, because I have known instances where millers have deliberately held up the collection and drying of grain, with the apparent purpose of ensuring that it would go bad on the farmer's hands.  We have a very difficult climate for grain growing here, a climate which will require the maximum efficiency and co-operation between the grower, the merchant and the miller, to ensure that in the comparatively short period between the time the grain is cut and when it is got to the miller's loft, it is not allowed to go bad.  Any difficulties or deterioration found in regard to Irish bread have been in the main due to some neglect along the line.  It may not be the farmer's fault.  In many cases it is the fault of either the merchant or the miller, and the elimination of that should be a most important function of the Government Department in regard to this industry.</P>
      <P>Once wheat heats, becomes mouldy or otherwise deteriorates, it becomes unfit for human consumption, and for that reason we would like to see greater co-operation on the part of the millers with those who are providing the raw material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has power to fix the prices of flour under this Bill.  In my opinion, he should also take power to fix the prices of wheat offals.  The milling industry is a very big one in our national economy.  It is, as we know, fairly heavily subsidised, and under this legislation and emergency powers, it is fairly rigidly controlled. For that reason, it is not desirable that the milling industry should be <Col N="1106" /> allowed to inflict serious injury upon, for example, the pig raising industry, by drastically raising the prices of offals.  The Minister has a right to say that he has no power under existing legislation to fix the price of milled offals, but he has a right, if he so desires, to take legislative power under this Bill, or under some similar legislation.  It is desirable and necessary that he should take that power so as to ensure that the prices of raw materials of the pig raising and poultry raising industries are not unduly increased upon the producers.  He could, in that way, afford protection to these two important branches of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>It is true, it must be confessed, that in raising the prices of milled offals, the millers, as far as I know, do not make additional profits for themselves. What they really do is to save something of the amount they would otherwise receive by way of subsidy.  That, I would say, is all the more reason why the State should take an active part not only in fixing the prices of flour but also in fixing the prices of wheat offals.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that a careful survey should be kept of the supply position in regard to wheat.  If, as was said some years ago, and, I think, untruly said, there appeared to be a danger of a surplus, the Minister should always have the right and the power to vary not only the extraction rate of offals, but also the rate at which foreign wheat would be included.  In that way, it would be possible to ensure that no matter how high wheat acreage might go in this country, it would be possible always to avoid a surplus.  There would never be any need, therefore, to reduce the price of wheat in order to keep down the supply.  If the Minister uses his powers wisely and in the national interests, he can ensure that wheat growing will expand, that the quality of wheat delivered to the millers will improve, and that the quality of our flour and our bread will also improve.</P>
    <P>I would like again to stress the necessity of ensuring that our millers are vigilant and active in stretching a helping hand to the growers particularly <Col N="1107" /> during a bad harvest when there is excessive rainfall.  It is true to say that many of our millers, and some of the biggest of them, do not want Irish wheat.  They would prefer to see it abolished, and to depend entirely on importd wheat.  There is prejudice and hostility there which it is the duty of any and every Government to overcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We all here welcome a Bill of this sort because it removes Emergency Powers Orders and brings in in a more permanent way what the Government wishes to do.  During the past couple of years, many of the things that were done by Emergency Powers have been done under permanent legislation.  There is not much to be said on this Bill, except to welcome it and thank the Minister for bringing it in.</P>
      <P>I always feel that it is a pity that wheat is the sport of politics in Ireland.  We ought to have a balanced policy with regard to wheat, and each year whoever is charged with the responsibility in Government for dealing with the matter&mdash;the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;in my opinion, will have to look at the situation of Ireland with regard to the best utilisation of its land.</P>
      <P>If it is profitable and valuable, in the national economic interest, to grow a large amount of wheat in this country, I believe the emphasis should be directed towards the growing of a large amount.  On the other hand, it would be sheer folly if a large portion of our 12,000,000 acres were devoted to growing all of that crop for our needs while we could produce other crops and other products off that land which would command a much higher price on the world market.  That is why I say we must have a balanced outlook with regard to wheat.  If someone suggests we should grow less wheat, we must not assume that he is unpatriotic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the mills.  I live in an area that sends in a large amount of grain to the various mills.  There are three large mills there.  There were surprisingly few complaints this autumn, with regard to the treatment that was meted out by the millers.  In two of the largest mills, I did not hear of any complaints: I did, with regard to one mill.  I understand that the Minister for Agriculture told the directors of that mill that if they were refusing to take Irish wheat, he would consider having their quota of foreign wheat reduced because it was possible that that mill would prefer to deal with the manufacture of flour and wheatenmeal from imported corn rather than from Irish corn.</P>
      <P>There is little else to say, except that whoever is in charge in Government will have to consider what quantity of grain is produced for the production of flour and wheatenmeal, considering the wide national interest. It is very satisfactory that our people have developed a seed that will now produce a far better wheat and a far better grain and flour than when we started growing flour here extensively about 25 years ago.  I presume that our technicians and our technical experts in Glasnevin, and such places, will be able to improve that.  Maybe the request which Senator Kissane made some six or eight months ago to the Minister for Agriculture to have the matter investigated by our Bureau of Industrial Research and Standards at Ballymun will have the result that they will be able to report favourably on Irish wheat.  I think it would be a wonderful achievement if we reached a stage where we could produce an article for our own needs that would give us a satisfactory flour and wheatenmeal.  I welcome this Bill particularly as a piece of permanent legislation dealing with a matter of this nature.</P>

I thought that issue was rapidly receding into the limbo of the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will let the Senator have that out with the Minister when he returns to discuss another Bill.</P>
      <P>The question of the appropriate grist to use has been raised by bakers and millers and has been the subject of public discussion in the Press.  We can bake any kind of loaf we want to bake, so long as we are satisfied to eat it ourselves.  We can have an all-Irish loaf or a 90 per cent.  Irish loaf, or we can balance the grist in any way we like.  We have to satisfy only two conditions. The first condition is that whatever grist we adopt is palatable to our people or that they can be induced to eat it, either by perseverence or national necessity.  The second condition is that we ought to have regard to the possibilities of producing here a loaf which will satisfy our own requirements by utilising the corn which can be grown on Irish land.  You can have a 100 per cent.  Irish loaf or a grist balance as between Irish and foreign wheat.  The question at issue is what is the best balance to strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago, the millers asked, because of the damp season this year and because they felt that the Irish wheat was very moist this year, that we should produce a grist of 60 per cent. imported and 40 per cent. Irish wheat.  I did not agree to that but, for the time being, I said they could produce a grist based on 50 per cent. imported and 50 per cent. native wheat.  At the same time, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards was asked to examine this matter with the view to seeing what was the best advice they could tender, having regard to all the technical problems which required examination around that question.  They have had this matter before them for about six or eight months.  Speaking from recollection, I think they found they needed <Col N="1110" /> a technical officer to undertake the researches which were necessary.  I think they have advertised for him, but, whether or not they have succeeded in getting him, I cannot say. We asked them, about three weeks ago, to expedite the issue of the report to us so that we could use it for the purpose of our subsequent discussions with the millers and the Institute know we are anxious to get that report without any avoidable delay.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the millers' request for a 60-40 grist or a 50-50 grist has also been referred to the Institute to see what they think of that question. They could, of course, make an interim report on that issue if that course commends itself to them.</P>
    <P>Senator Cogan raised the question of the price of offal.  I do not think that that is the function of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  At the moment, the price of offal is not fixed.  I do not say that you can easily fix it, nor do I think that it is advantageous to the stock-raising community that it should be fixed.  The likelihood is that it might be fixed at a level which they would regard as uneconomic from the point of view of raising live stock.  I think that approximately 50 per cent. of animal feeding stuffs come into this country. It is not, therefore, easy to see in what way you can fix the price of Irish-produced offal.  The general claim of the farming community has been that they should get their feeding stuffs as cheaply as possible.  To-day, they have access to the markets of the world in order to get them at the lowest possible price.  The price of Irish offal is allowed to reach its own level on the home market and that level is approximately the level at which the imported offal is landed here.  We have to take into consideration the price of the imported offal when fixing the subsidy because, unless we get from the miller what he gets for the offal, we should lose considerably on subsidy if we were to fix the price low for offal while, in fact, the miller or the distributor of the offal was getting a higher price for it.  If Senator Cogan reflects on the fact that we import 50 per cent. of our offal, he will see the difficulty of fixing an Irish price and see the dangers of <Col N="1111" /> it from the point of view of those who want to feed their stocks in the most economical way.  I think that covers all the points which were raised.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment, I was speaking on some points dealing with the details of this Bill and which are made clear for us by this memorandum.  I was dealing with what the memorandum and the Bill say about Section 12, in which certain creameries are brought within the provisions of the Act, and which I think is a good thing.  I notice, and I am quoting here from the paragraph dealing with Section 12 in the memorandum, that creameries will now be &ldquo;required to obtain from registered producers that portion of their milk intake which is utilised for the liquid trade.&rdquo;  There is a distinction, and creameries will still be permitted, apparently, if they want to, to take some of their milk for making butter from unregistered producers.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear the Minister's comment on that.  I am not quite sure what the implication is, whether it is felt that the disadvantages of certain unregistered producers' premises are not so important when the milk they are producing is for making butter.  I should like to know the implications of making this apply only to the portion of their intake utilised for the liquid trade.</P>
      <P>The other point I want to make relates to Section 1 of Section 3 and it refers to Section 26, sub-section (8) of the Principal Act, on the first page of this memorandum and which reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Section 26 (8) of the Principal Act made it obligatory on the sanitary authority to cancel the registration of a dairyman who is convicted three times within a period of five years for offences under <Col N="1112" /> that Act or under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister is asking under this Bill that that regulation shall be changed because it operated &ldquo;unduly harshly&rdquo; in some cases.  I am not entirely convinced of that fact.  Admittedly he makes a point about a retailer, but even so if a retailer is &ldquo;convicted three times within five years&rdquo; for the same offence, it does not seem unduly harsh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The offence can be technical, and although the explanation might be adequate, a conviction must be recorded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>It does depend&mdash;and I am satisfied with the Minister's explanation&mdash;on the Minister's consent, and I think we can be satisfied, therefore, that sufficient safeguard is still maintained.  Having praised some of the details of the Bill, and I think I could give many other examples, it does nevertheless give me the impression of being a slightly patchwork Bill.  It does tighten up a number of things and inserts good new legislation.  It seals off certain loopholes, and makes flexible laws which were previously perhaps too harsh.  All of that I think is good, but what it does not do in any way is to present an overall plan, amending the original Act, although it is an Amendment Bill.  I should have preferred it, if it had been found possible, to implement more fully, in a more general way, most of the recommendations of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the milk supply which brought out its report in December, 1946.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1945-46 they made a very detailed inquiry into the whole milk position in the Dublin sale district, and they made a number of excellent recommendations. I should like to hear the Minister's view, or intended policy, in regard to these recommendations.  I am a little disappointed that he has not taken the opportunity which this Bill offered to bring in something like an overall plan such as was recommended by the Tribunal.  They suggested the establishment of &ldquo;a milk board with adequate powers to organise and direct milk production <Col N="1113" /> and distribution&rdquo;.  They gave details of the composition of the board and suggested that there should be a committee which would have representatives of the producers, distributors, consumers and the departmental and other experts.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that that recommendation was a very sound one, and most of us would feel happier if it had been enshrined in this Bill, in order to plan more effectively the overall pattern.  One of their recommendations has been partly implemented through the efforts of the present Minister, and more actively still in recent months, that was in regard to bovine tuberculosis.  The recommendation in 1946 was that the &ldquo;planned eradication of bovine tuberculosis&rdquo; should be set about, and the measures to be taken should be &ldquo;such as to achieve appreciable results in not more than ten years&rdquo;.  I cannot help feeling that if these recommendations had been seriously implemented in 1947, 1948, 1949, and so on we would be in a happier position to-day with regard to bovine tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>I notice also that there is no reference in the present suggested amendments, to the fact that with regard to various diseases they recommend that the penicillin, the sulphinanomides, and so on, used for treatment should be provided free in order to eradicate the disease as quickly as possible. They deal also&mdash;and I do not think any of the provisions in this Bill are adequate to deal with it&mdash;with the question of overlapping of services for the distribution of milk in Dublin. They contend that a board set up would be able to deal with that in a way which cannot be done just by legislation as it now stands.</P>
    <P>The last point I wish to mention is that they felt it was wrong that milk from cows which have passed only the preliminary tuberculin tests should be sold as highest grade milk.  I do not, in this amending legislation, see that that is prevented.  I may be ignorant on the point, and possibly some other measure has re-defined &ldquo;highest grade milk&rdquo; so as to preclude the inclusion in it of milk from cows which have only passed a preliminary test.  If that is <Col N="1114" /> so, I should like the Minister's assurance on that point.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when the Minister was setting about amending the milk and Dairies Act, I should have welcomed something a little more radical, a Bill that would have enabled the production, sale and distribution of milk to be more generally planned.  I notice, for instance, that in the Bill, in Section 50, the Minister, the Minister for Agriculture, the sanitary authority or a dairyman may submit samples of milk in accordance with the regulations &ldquo;under Section 49 of this Act&rdquo;.  I think that is a very good section.  I notice the same authority for the submission of milk samples is confined&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry. I misdirected the Minister.  It is of course Section 25.  The number 50 is in leaded type in this Bill.  It is not &ldquo;Section 50&rdquo;.  This paragraph is headed &ldquo;50&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The submission of milk samples for testing and analysis, as I understand it, by that particular section, is confined&mdash;the right to submit them&mdash;to the Minister, the Minister for Agriculture, a sanitary authority or a dairyman.  I should like to see that right extended to consumers.  It would be a good thing if it were possible for the ordinary consumer to have a given sample of milk tested in that way and I do not think it could possibly do any harm, and it might well do a lot of good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore in the main I welcome this Bill.  I think what it does is good.  I <Col N="1115" /> do not think I have criticised it very much in detail, and what I have criticised is mainly on the ground that it does not present an overall plan, but is content to patch up the existing legislation and above all, that it does not seriously attempt to carry out the recommendations of the 1946 Milk Inquiry Tribunal Report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the provisions of this Bill will still further improve the quality of milk being produced and will tend to make milk still cleaner.  However, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the lack of liquid milk in certain districts along the western seaboard.  For instance, in West Donegal, with which district I am very familiar, the milk supply is particularly scarce during the winter months.  I am aware that milk has to be transported for distances up to 20 miles to serve some of the villagers in that area.  It is not a milk producing county; although there is one organisation in Letterkenny which takes a fair amount of milk, apart from that, there are very few dairies in the county. During the winter months, there is a great scarcity of milk and it is often a compliment to obtain a supply during certain months of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the fact that this Bill will inconvenience those who obtain supplies, it will result, in my opinion, in people who require milk being deprived of it because of the fact that they will not register.  For instance, I know a person who is a very lawabiding citizen, who lives in a village which has over 200 of a population which apparently is referred to in Section 11 of the Bill.  Consequently, in my opinion, he would be committing an offence by purchasing milk from an individual who supplies only that particular customer.  Naturally, persons such as this will not go to the expense, although the house or the byre in which the cows are kept is comparatively clean, in comparison with many other holders in the locality.  I am also aware of the position that vendors of milk during those winter months have to obtain a certain quantity from other neighbours and that is not permitted under this Bill.  I feel that apparently <Col N="1116" /> the Minister will not be in a position to give a licence to people who sell milk to be consumed in those villages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I made provision for that, that in places of scarcity such as the Senator describes, I retain a power to exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the Minister could only do that in a rural area where the population of the village is under 200.  I refer the Minister to Section 11, sub-section (1) (b) (iii). At any rate, it is obvious that the quantity of milk produced in that area is not sufficient and if the regulations are enforced, as they can be enforced when the Bill is passed, there certainly will be less milk available for the consuming public.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider setting out in the Bill certain areas. He could make inquiries as to those areas in the country in which the supply is not sufficient.  Perhaps he could schedule those areas, even though one may be a village with a population to which the Bill might refer.</P>

I was in Belfast last year and went to see a pasteurisation plant.  I learned from inquiries there that they give at least twopence per gallon more to the man who supplies clean milk, as against the man who supplies dirty milk.

I heard Father Coyne, Chairman of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, saying at the opening of a new creamery yesterday, that it was estimated that £38 million worth of live stock were lost through disease and that the single largest cause of that is skim milk.</P>

      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington apparently has overlooked the fact that, as far as the large Cities of Dublin and Cork are concerned, there are Milk Boards already in operation.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to answer that question, as I am not exactly sure of the constitution of the Milk Board at the moment.  I thought there was such representation.  Anyhow, they have done very useful work.  As the Minister says, this Bill is a further tightening up of the law in relation to milk production and sale.  Most people will welcome that.  As the Minister <Col N="1119" /> says, it is not possible within the law to supply dirty milk to anybody in this State.  There is nothing wrong with that, but it is rather an extraordinary thing that if you want to consume dirty milk, the only way you can do it is by keeping your own cows.  If you keep your own cows you can drink the milk as dirty as you please.  There again, I do not see very much wrong with that.  I do not think the State should go so far as to seek to protect a man from himself, so to speak; but it is the duty and right of the State to protect the community.  In addition to that, no matter how unhygienic the methods may be on the farm, I doubt if contamination of milk on the farm could be as great as might occur in a city.  The number and variety of bacteria in circulation in the atmosphere in the city would in all probability be much greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be greater than could possibly exist on a farm, but I doubt if there would be the variety. Anyhow, I am not against either the principle of this Bill in general or the principle that fairly stringent measures should be adopted to protect the public; but there is no real necessity yet to extend those measures to the farm itself where the farmer is producing for his own use.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Senator Sheehy Skeffington raised an interesting point, that if milk is supplied to a creamery for manufacture into butter, it is not necessary to comply with the high standards laid down for liquid milk. I can readily understand the reasons for this.</P>
      <P>It would be extremely difficult to impose the same high standard rapidly, at any rate, for milk supplied to creameries.  The number of farms affected and the quantity involved is very great.  It might be desirable to step up gradually the standard of cleanliness of milk supplied to creameries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection, an investigation should be carried out into the cheapest <Col N="1120" /> methods of doing this.  It was thought at one time that cow byres for example, should be modernised to a very high standard and sufficiently large to hold every cow on the farm. I think experience has shown that a small milking parlour, to provide for the milking of two cows at a time, which is brought up to a high standard of cleanliness and hygiene generally, would meet the problem and the cows would probably be cleaner and healthier in an open shed where the regulations of this Bill would not need to be enforced. That is something which ought to be studied, with a view to ensuring that a high standard of cleanliness can be provided, but provided at the minimum cost to the producer.  This Bill will add very considerably to the cost of milk production.  It will, therefore, render still more out of place the figures which the Minister produced recently in the Dáil as milk production costs, figures which he produced without authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit, Sir, it is open to me to suggest that the effect of this Bill will be to increase the cost of production to the producers generally. That is not something which can be contested, and while I am not opposing the Bill, nor do I think the farming community generally oppose the Bill, I should like the Minister to say if, before introducing this Bill, he discussed it with the consultative council. If he did that, I am quite sure, as far as I know from discussions with farmers generally, they would be favourable to it.</P>
      <P>There is a strong feeling in the country among farmers in favour of having their products of the highest standard and quality.  That is a very welcome development.  It is a harsh thing to say perhaps, but I rather welcome Senator Walsh's statement that there is a lack of milk in the West of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Our feeling in Leinster is that we are in danger of saturation. I should like to see more and more outlets for milk consumption and I should like to see those outlets supplied as efficiently as possible.  This Bill is perhaps rendered particularly necessary by reason of the recent development of the bottling of milk on a very considerable scale.  Most people will agree that milk sold in bottles is less liable to contamination than when it is sold loose, but everyone will acknowledge that the process of bottling milk provides opportunities for contamination on a very considerable scale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The premises in which the bottling is carried out, the bottles and everything connected with the bottling process must be clean and it would be better not to have this process carried out at all, if it is not done in a perfectly clean manner.  That is why most people will welcome the provisions of this Bill which govern the process of bottling.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister has power in this Bill&mdash;I should like to see it developed further&mdash;to promote a larger consumption of liquid milk.  There are provisions in this Bill governing restaurants and other places where milk is sold for consumption.  I should like to see those regulations framed in such a way as to encourage people to put up milk in every form that is as palatable as possible to the consumer. I should not like to see any provision in the Bill placing an obstacle in the way of rendering milk more palatable. I should like to make it more palatable for the consumer and in that way to increase consumption.  That is a matter that will always have to be kept in mind.  We cannot allow dilution of milk, unless the exact quantity of the dilution is specified but at the same time a certain amount of development should take place with a view to putting up milk in the most attractive way to the consumer and ensuring that this nation's relatively low milk consumption be stepped up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consumption of milk both by adults and children in this State is altogether too low, having regard to <Col N="1122" /> the fact that we are a milk producing country and that everything in regard to our climate and soil is conducive to milk production.  If we could step up the consumption of milk and milk products, we might then be able to cut down on some other commodities which we import and that would be of great benefit to our national economy.</P>

      <P>A number of Senators have said that we in this country have a particularly good milk supply from the public health point of view.  In my opinion, nothing could be further from the truth.  There is a very great difference between clean milk and milk which is satisfactory from the point of view of health.  The Milk and Dairies Act, 1935, in so far as it went, was an excellent piece of legislation.  If it had been fully implemented, there would have been enormous advances made, but I would ask the Minister, when replying, to give us some idea as to what percentage of the milk is pasteurised.  I think that should give us a very clear idea of how much healthy and how much unhealthy milk we have.</P>
      <P>We have, looking at it purely from a public health point of view, made very poor progress in regard to the quantity of milk which we pasteurise and the eradication of tuberculosis amongst the cattle in this country. Bovine tuberculosis is declining in this country.  It is declining not because of the veterinary improvements but because of the successful vaccination by B.C.G. of the children.</P>
      <P>We have had to tackle the T.B. problem in this country without getting the real co-operation we should in eradicating one of the greatest sources of T.B., that is, the infected milk.  In many other countries, they go even further than pasteurisation. They actually produced sterilised milk. I think, quite frankly, that on account of the strong representation which the agricultural community must have in the Oireachtas, we have not gone far enough at all.  We have been much too slow to set a really satisfactory standard in regard to milk from the public health point of view.</P>

I sympathis with the anxiety of anybody, particularly a doctor, about the quality of the milk supplied.  Upon my word, I think he is a bit pessimistic.  I would say that more than 90 per cent. of the milk supply of Dublin is pasteurised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming round the mountain.  Let me start in Dublin and Dún Laoghaire.  That is an interesting thing, too.  Half the time I am talking about the whole people fleeing into Dublin and, when I point out that we provide the migrants into the city with a safe milk supply, they say that they do not count and that they are only a minority.  Now, I look with a very curious eye at Senator Hickey.  When he was speaking, I was constrained to interpolate &ldquo;<i>Et tu, Brute</i>&rdquo;.  I agree the Cork milk supply left much to be desired, but I do think I am entitled to ask the informed Senators from Cork City: who thrust pasteurised milk upon them&mdash;after a fight 40 could join in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And it took me a long hard battle in the course of which I went out of office and came back again before I could get it done.  I think the charming interlocutor on my right must consider that there is now available to her in Cork City a pasteurised bottled milk supply sufficient to meet any demands made upon it and I hope the Senators from Cork City will not think me unduly demanding in asking their co-operation to stimulate a demand amongst their neighbours for this excellent commodity which I am now in a position to tell them is there in a quality and quantity sufficient to supply all.  When we look at Cork and then at Dublin, we have reason for increasing satisfaction, in that I am able to say to her it is now for the citizens themselves to make the Cork milk supply 100 per cent. pasteurised &mdash;that the means to do it are there.  I <Col N="1124" /> could not have said that two years ago and then I would have felt vulnerable to Senator ffrench O'Carroll's rebuke about it.  There is a pasteurised milk supply in Waterford, in Wexford, in Galway and, I think, in Limerick and I think we are not doing too badly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are passing into the rural areas.  When we are dealing with the sale and supply of liquid milk, we have got to face the fact that in a predominantly agricultural country the pasteurisation of milk must of its nature be mainly an urban operation because everybody in the country has his own milk.  I think Deputy Cogan rightly says there are lengths beyond which the Minister for Agriculture should not go.  We have a right to inform a farmer, even to stress upon him, his grave obligation to his own family to see that their health is not impaired by the consumption of unsuitable milk, but have I the right to go in and constrain him?  I think not.  I do not think I have the right to cross the threshold of any family in Ireland and indicate to them how to look after their own children.</P>
      <P>I used very strong language in the Seanad in connection with the Cork milk supply years ago, about people who offered unpasteurised tubercular milk to families in Cork, placing the lives of the children in jeopardy.  I would use strong language to any parent who was so careless.  I think I have a right in the public interest to intervene in Cork and secure that pasteurised milk will be made available, but I doubt if I have that right in every household in Ireland. If Dáil Éireann thrusts that duty on me, I decline it.  I do not think any Government has a right to come between a parent and his children.  We have a right to exhort them to educate them, to explain and so forth, but we cannot go beyond that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are areas in Ireland where the incidence of tuberculosis amongst cattle is high.  If we were to examine the percentage of reactors detected, and I think Senator ffrench O'Carroll <Col N="1125" /> will agree with me, over 80 per cent. of all reactors never show any sign of clinical tuberculosis and of the remaining 20 per cent. not 10 per cent. have tuberculosis of the udder which would constitute a formidable danger of contaminated milk through tubercle bacilli.  Even bearing that in mind, I would remind Senators that in a county like Sligo, where we have the testing facilities, the incidence of tuberculosis is down to about 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>I have never asked the Oireachtas to close its eyes to the fact that in some of the dairying counties the incidence is shockingly high, though no higher than in other dairy countries when they first began to eliminate it, but the bulk of that milk is going to the creameries.  Of the reactors, 80 per cent. will never show evidence of clinical tuberculosis, and, of the 20 per cent. who will not 10 per cent. will give tubercular milk.  It is quite a mistake to equate in their minds the incidence of reactors and the tubercular condition in cows which is calculated to introduce tubercle bacilli contamination into milk.</P>
    <P>I know there are people enthusiastic for T.T. milk and grade A milk.  I got into trouble for saying this in public before, but I want to say it again with the fullest realisation of my responsibility in this matter, that excellent as T.T. milk may be, excellent as grade A milk may be, in urban surroundings, I would give my child properly pasteurised milk with a very greater sense of security than I would T.T. milk or grade A milk.  That is no reflection on those who keep grade A herds and T.T. herds, but the fact is that I can issue a certificate in perfectly good faith to a T.T. herd on 1st January and yet there may be two reactors in that herd on 8th January. The herd is not tested again until 1st July.</P>
    <P>I have known cases in which valuable T.T. herds have been certified to be tuberculosis free on the first day of the year and to contain 50 per cent. reactors on 1st July.  That is a dramatic and rare occurrence.  It is called the breakdown of a herd and the explanation is not fully known, but it has happened.  That is no reflection on those who have the cattle and take <Col N="1126" /> all the trouble to produce milk, under those conditions, but the fact is that properly pasteurised milk, in whatever condition it comes into the bottling plant, is rendered innocuous by the operation of pasteurisation.  The bottling operation is carefully supervised and you are as certain as it is humanly possible to be that when the bottle of milk is put on your threshold it is free from contamination.</P>
    <P>What happens to it afterwards is not my business and I am not prepared to pursue it across the threshold of the door.  So I would ask Senator ffrench O'Carroll to think again before he accepts the general principle that the milk supply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in the rear, coming up with this Bill.  Let us keep to milk.  This is my bailiwick, and no one walks in my bailiwick unrebuked.  I look after milk, and here I am as busy as a bee to ensure, with the help of the Seanad, that the highest criteria will apply to our liquid milk supply.  If they are to be applied, I ask the Seanad to help me to arrange it, and I ask the Senator, when he feels constrained to say again that the milk supply in this country is highly unsatisfactory, to pause and ask himself whether that is still true.  I do not think it is still true.  I think, by and large, that the milk supply in this country now is good, and this Bill closes the remaining gaps which do exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> I am faced with the fact, however, in respect of which I find myself in agreement with Senator Walsh, that it is not yet possible for me to make these precautionary measures watertight in every area, because there is undoubtedly the problem of milk supply in places like the Rosses or Gweedore.  The Senator will remember that I tried to remedy that with the Kerry cow scheme, by introducing the Kerry cow into the Rosses and Gweedore, because I felt that that was a breed from which we might expect a pretty consistent all the year round milk supply.  I think other considerations operated to persuade the people there to cross the cows pretty liberally with shorthorn or Aberdeen Angus, and we are up against that problem&mdash; that they are largely concerned with the production of a saleable calf, and so over a period the milk quality of the Kerry heifer has tended to be merged in the Aberdeen Angus or Hereford cross which the local people use.  If you could get them to cross them with good white shorthorn, as they do in parts of Kerry, the milking capacity of the cattle would be greatly improved.  This remains a problem, and until it is resolved, I cannot promise Senator ffrench O'Carroll that the last lacunae in our precautionary measures with regard to the milk supply of rural Ireland can be effectively closed.</P>
    <P>I can console Senator Cogan, who wondered whether I discussed this Bill with the Agricultural Consultative Council.  I did better; I went even closer to the heart of the matter, and discussed it yesterday with the dairy industry sub-committee, which I understand is representative of all interests here involved.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke spoke of compelling the creameries to pasteurise skim milk.  This Bill deals with milk for liquid consumption.  Therefore, pasteurisation of skim is not strictly relevant.  Subject to that, I would say to Senator Burke that, following my customary procedure, I am forbearing from compulsion, and am seeking to persuade, and prepared to give a grant of 50 per cent. of the total cost to any <Col N="1128" /> creamery in Ireland that will install machinery to pasteurise skim milk prior to returning it to the farmer.  I am obliged to confess that if these methods of inducement do not ultimately achieve our purpose, it is conceivable that I might reluctantly be forced to return to the Oireachtas to seek powers of compulsion; but so high is my confidence in the capacity of the farmers to do their job better than anybody else, given the opportunity, that I prefer as yet to rest on my powers of persuasion and inducement, in the belief that in that way I can get the skim milk supply fully dealt with.</P>
    <P>The next Senator about whose observations I have a note is Senator Hickey.  I shall confine myself to looking at him and raising one eyebrow. But I think I am entitled to say that the pasteurised milk supply of Cork City compares very favourably with the pasteurised milk supply of Belfast City.</P>

      <P>Go down and look at the people of Cork as compared with Belfast.  I recommend the citizens of Belfast to take a fornight's holiday in Cork now.  I might not have done so with such confidence five years ago, but now if they want to go, they will return invigorated to their gloomier surroundings.</P>
      <P>I dealt, I think, <i>en passant</i>, with the factors mentioned by Senator Louis Walsh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington thought that the Bill should be more radical. I like to think that he and I both believe ourselves to be radical liberals, whatever each of us believes the other to be.  That is quite another matter. But I think really what his heart yearned for was a codifying measure, that is to say, a measure which would be comprehensive and would contain the law between two covers where it would be easy for all to read.  This Bill taken with the existing law is a pretty comprehensive code.  I agree that it is not codified, but before you codify, you must amend.  What we propose to do is to work this legislation with this amending Act and after <Col N="1129" /> a period to determine if all the creaks and awkwardnesses have been overcome, and if they have been, to submit a codifying Bill to the Oireachtas so as to bring this Bill and prior legislation into one compendious Act.</P>
    <P>The Senator seemed troubled by the fact that it appeared from this Bill and previous Acts that there were two different standards&mdash;one for the production of liquid milk for human consumption, and the other for milk for conversion into creamery butter. There are.  That is true.  A higher standard is required for a byre in which milk for liquid consumption is to be produced, but that is not to say that the law permits anyone to bring dirty milk to a creamery.  On the contrary, my Department's peripatetic inspectors have, as one of their first duties, regular inspection of creameries, and Senators from rural areas, I think, will inform Senator Sheehy Skeffington that it sometimes causes complaint against me that I prosecute farmers for having delivered dirty milk at a creamery or for having delivered milk in a dirty churn to a creamery; and in the event of such being detected, the farmer is prosecuted, and the creamery. Were the creamery to persist in the reception of such milk, its licence would be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>But I do not concede that, for a good reason, a higher standard is imposed in respect of liquid milk for human consumption because manufacturing milk for conversion into butter undergoes processing when it reaches the creamery.  Butter is manufactured from cream.  Cream is extracted from the milk by a process of separation. Therefore, you may reasonably assume that, in the raw material of butter, no gross dirt can remain because the process of separation will discard that with the skimmed milk, even if it were present.  That operation having been performed, the separated cream, in case there should be any bacilliary contamination, is pasteurised before being converted into butter.  Therefore, the necessity for the higher standard in regard to manufacturing milk is not as urgent because, when the milk comes in for pasteurisation and distribution for liquid consumption, there is no separation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1130" /> The Senator will have observed that provision is made in this Bill that, where a creamery is going into the business of pasteurising milk for distribution for liquid consumption, it must follow an entirely different procedure in regard to the milk which it purchases for subsequent pasteurisation and distribution in final form and it must at all times be kept separate from the milk which is to be manufactured into butter.  If the creamery has a surplus of the milk which it has taken in for consumption in liquid form it may transfer that surplus to the creamery but if it should have brought in more milk than it actually wishes to convert into butter in any given day to the creamery it may not transfer that to the premises reserved for liquid milk.</P>
    <P>I think that covers all the points that have been raised by Senators and, accordingly, I commend this Bill to their favourable consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann considers that, in the light of the Report of the Inquiry into the proposal to terminate the three Common Services provided by the G.N.R. Board, these lines should not be closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion refers to three of the four common service lines scheduled in the 1953 Act dealing with the G.N.R. Board.  In order to consider the matter, I think it would be desirable to give the Seanad a background to the developments which have now brought us to the present position.  The proposal to close these three secondary lines was made some 12 months ago by the Minister of Commerce in Northern Ireland and a proposal was made in accordance with the legislation to the Minister for Industry and Commerce here.  The services concerned were part of three common services as defined in the Act.  They were Omagh-Enniskillen-Newtownbutler, Portadown-Armagh-Tyan and Bundoran Junction-Beleek. The proposals, as we know, were not accepted by the Minisster here who felt that, as an alternative to the closure of these railways, the dieselisation and modernisation programme proposed by the Joint Board of the G.N.R. should be accepted and implemented and the railways given a chance when modernised. In this respect, it might be proper to remark that these proposals <Col N="1132" /> were originally drawn up by a sub-committee of the board and, I understand, were unanimously accepted by the board, a joint board appointed in equal numbers by the Minister here and the Minister in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It has been made plain, in the meantime, that the Government here were prepared to accept that modernisation programme and, in fact, urged the Minister in the North to accept it likewise in order to modernise the railways, cut the losses and prevent closures.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister in the North, Lord Glentoran, was adamant that these lines would have to close as it appears that his Government were no longer prepared to finance these cross-Border lines.  The next step was in accordance with the legislation, that is, because the Ministers could not agree, the proposal had then to be remitted to the Chairman of the Transport Tribunal in the Republic and the Chairman of the Transport Tribunal in Northern Ireland for their joint advice and report.</P>
    <P>Public hearings were held in Dublin and Belfast in April and May of this year.  At those public hearings, submissions were made by public representatives, by trade unions, by Chambers of Commerce, by county councils, by urban district councils, by the live-stock trade and by other interested parties.  I want to make the point that all the submissions and all the representations made to the two Chairmen of the Transport Tribunals were against the proposal to close these lines, irrespective of whether the people or the chambers of commerce or the county councils came from one side of the Border or the other.  There certainly was unanimity and opposition on both sides of the Border on the part of the public concerned to the closure of these lines. The position was complicated in the meantime by a statement by the then Minister of Finance in Northern Ireland which intimated that, irrespective of what the Chairmen of the Tribunals would say, his Government were going to close these cross-Border lines and, furthermore were closing one of the two railway lines between <Col N="1133" /> Belfast and Derry.  If you look at a map, you see that one of those lines from Belfast to Derry is what is known as the old N.C.C., the Northern Counties Committee of the old L.M.S., which goes through Northern Ireland territory.  The other is the G.N.R. line via Portadown, Omagh and on to Strabane and Derry, and part of it is a common line scheduled in the 1953 Act.  It is understood that Lord Glentoran told the Minister here that the Northern Government had not yet decided which of these lines it would close, but asked, if it was the Great Northern, would the Minister for Industry and Commerce here give his agreement.</P>
    <P>I think the position is that, in accordance with previous decisions, such agreement would not be forthcoming. There has been in the meantime nothing but silence in Northern Ireland on the proposals to close one of the two lines between Belfast and Derry, but I think it is fair to say that, judging from the statements made by responsible Ministers in Northern Ireland, the attitude of the Government there is that it is still its policy to close one of these two railway lines and that, in fact, the proposal has not been abandoned but simply kept in abeyance, pending a final decision on these three secondary lines of the Great Northern.</P>
    <P>I think we should endeavour to assess the mind of the Northern Ireland Government in regard to these railway lines.  I feel they are still determined to close the G.N. line from Portadown to Derry, but are awaiting a decision on the three secondary lines.  I would like the Seanad to note that if the Northern Ireland Government are allowed to close these three secondary lines, they can then proceed to close the Portadown-Derry line. Part of this line is not a scheduled service, is not a common service&mdash;the part running from Portadown to Omagh&mdash;and can be closed without any reference whatever to the Government or the Minister in the Republic. If then, in the meantime, these three secondary lines are closed, the Government in Northern Ireland may allow &mdash;I emphasise &ldquo;may allow&rdquo;&mdash;the Government here to keep open the <Col N="1134" /> line from Portadown to Derry by taking it over&mdash;but it is only &ldquo;may allow&rdquo;.  The special provisions in regard to common services is that these common services can be kept open by either Minister, if he wishes to exercise his right under the 1953 Act.</P>
    <P>If the Government here abandon their stand on these three secondary lines and if they then thought it was desirable or essential to maintain rail communications between Donegal and the rest of the Republic, they could only do so by the grace of the Northern Ireland Government.  They would not have, as they now have, in dealing with these three lines, the right to keep open these services.  I think we need only look at the map to realise that the Government in Northern Ireland, if they wanted the Government here to take over some of their railway lines, would prefer them to take over the line from Portadown to Omagh than the line, say, up through Enniskillen.</P>
    <P>We now have the reports of the two chairmen and as could be expected the chairmen of the two transport tribunals differ in their recommendations to the Minister.  The report of the chairman for Northern Ireland draws attention to the fact that he had been furnished with a report of a joint committee of the Ulster Transport Authority and the G.N. and that that committee was composed of three representatives of the Ulster Transport Authority and one representative of the G.N.R. Sir Anthony Babington, chairman of the tribunal, devoted one-third of his report to the recommendations which, as Dr. Beddy, chairman for the Republic, points out were not submitted in evidence, were not subjected to any examination, and apparently were just passed to the chairman of the Transport Tribunal for their information.</P>
    <P>That joint report, funnily enough referred to as the &ldquo;Green Book&rdquo;, proposed the closure of these three secondary lines as well as other railway lines proper in Northern Ireland. The savings which would result from such closures were estimated but&mdash;and here is a point&mdash;those estimates were <Col N="1135" /> not now acceptable to the joint board of the G.N.R. who pointed out that experience since then, in actual closings of railway lines in Northern Ireland, showed that the estimated loss of contributed receipts would be far higher, so, in fact, the proposals which were designed to save about £220,000 per annum on these three secondary lines would now, in the estimate of the Great Northern, save only £14,000 per annum.  On the other hand, if the lines were modernised and diesel traction substituted for steam, instead of the saving of £14,000 per annum, there would be a loss in profits of £58,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>However, the Chairman of the Northern Ireland Tribunal sets aside the considered estimates of the Joint Board of the G.N.R. in regard to savings which would result from the closures.  Our own chairman, Dr. Beddy, admits that these are only estimates, but he says that there is no reason to suppose that the fact that they are estimates and are not definite would invalidate the argument as to what the general savings would be, or the loss of profits, if dieselised, by the closure of these lines.</P>
    <P>The chairman in Northern Ireland appropriately sets out his difficulty, that is, that he is chairman of the Northern Ireland Tribunal.  He understands, as he says, that his Government's policy is to close all the railway lines in Northern Ireland, except those running between large centres of population, and to concentrate on the roads. He says he is compelled to accept his predicament and to view the proposal from the Northern Ireland standpoint, as evidenced by statements in Stormont and elsewhere.  I do not think it would be unfair in the least to summarise Sir Anthony Babington's report as simply an acceptance of what he gathers is his Government's policy and, because of this, a setting aside of the evidence given in support of the objections and a dependence instead on figures prepared by a joint committee some years ago, which figures are now proved to be ill-based.</P>
    <P>We have our own report, that of the chairman of the Transport Tribunal <Col N="1136" /> here.  That report is much shorter, but it is quite unambiguous in rejecting the proposal to close and, to my mind, it is convincing in its argument.  To start with, the report questioned the legality of the proposals made by the Minister in the North, in that the Act provides for schedules, sets out common services and provides for proposals to be made for the closure of common services.  The proposals made in fact were not for the closure of common services, but for the closure of sections of common services.  Dr. Beddy also raises a question which I have touched on already, that is, the Northern Ireland Government's intention in regard to the line from Portadown to Derry.  He points out quite truly that these proposals affect one-third of the G.N.R.&mdash;which is simply not a proposal to close one or two or three unremunerative branch lines but is in fact a proposal to close one-third of a railway system.  It is a proposal based mainly on financial considerations.  Dr. Beddy points out that the figures furnished relate to operating results on sections of lines and not results of operating common service between two territories.  The apparent loss I mentioned, of £220,000 per annum on these sections is, according to Dr. Beddy, not a reliable guide as to the saving which would result.  the figure I have quoted of what the actual saving might be, of £14,000, was mentioned by him and also the loss of profits of £58,000, if in fact the lines were dieselised.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Government here have three choices.  The first is to allow the closure of what is known as the Irish North, that is, the whole railway system radiating west from Dundalk, serving Counties Monaghan, Cavan and the counties across the Border and also Donegal.  The second choice is to allow the sections of those lines in Northern Ireland to close and retain what I would term, if Senators would pardon me, the stamp lines remaining in the Republic, that is, the lines going up to the Border, stopping there and going no further.  The third choice is the choice that I hope the Government would favour, that is, to maintain their opposition to the closure of these three secondary lines of the Great Northern.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> I think we should consider what the effect would be of the closure of the railway going west from Dundalk.  As I have said already, it would involve the abandonment of one-third of the Great Northern railway, which three years ago the two Governments combined to buy from the shareholders. It would mean the loss of employment for a considerable number of workers. Probably over 400 Great Northern employees in the Republic would be out of works, 150 of them in the Dundalk workshops.  Some 120 would lose their employment on the Great Northern in Northern Ireland, but as well it would involve the closure of the Sligo-Leitrim railway, employing a total of 141, I believe&mdash;106 of whom are in the Republic and 35 in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, might I remind Senators that we have had questions previously about the Sligo-Leitrim railway, the railway running in the two territories.  It was for a considerable time kept open by annual grants from both Governments.  Eventually, the Northern Ireland Government decided that they did not see the joke of paying for this railway.  They did not see any particular merit or any benefit to them in it.  I think they were wrong, but, infact, the Government here undertook to pay the necessary grant themselves in order to keep this line open.  There would also be involved in this the closure of the County Donegal railway, employing some couple of hundred people in that county.</P>
    <P>The County Donegal railway depends for a connection with the Great Northern at Strabane.  If the North of Ireland Government go ahead with their policy, the line up to Derry would also be closed and the County Donegal railways will be left with no railway connection with the rest of the Republic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally.  The ultimate effect of these proposals to close is that a substantial chunk of this island will be left without any rail services <Col N="1138" /> whatever.  The report of Dr. Beddy points to the resulting disruption of trade and travel.  It points to the fact that it will mean the eventual elimination of livestock exports from the West and the North-West which at present go to the Scottish and North of England markets through the ports of Belfast and Derry.  I leave it to the livestock representatives to express better the difficulties which would result, but the viewpoint is put forward in the report that that trade could not be taken through the port of Dublin and it would mean a big disruption of the livestock trade from the West and the North-West.</P>
      <P>I think Dr. Beddy sums up the position best of all.  He says that it raises problems of magnitude, importance and complexity.  To my mind, if these closures take place, it will mean that we co-operate in the creation of an economic no-man's land running through all the Border counties.  In that respect, you might know that the Northern Ireland Government likes to refer to its territory as Ulster.  I was taught at school that Ulster comprised nine counties and not six, but, strangely enough, their policy in regard to rail closures does affects nine counties and not six. It affects the three Ulster counties of the Republic, Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan.</P>
      <P>I think we have a responsibility to maintain proper communications and proper rail services through to our three Ulster counties.  If, in doing so, we help or assist communication with other Ulster counties, not on our side of the Border, that is not a matter for regret.  If the Government here decides to keep open these lines, in effect, it means that they will take into the Great Northern system part of the lines running through Northern Ireland territory.  It would mean that, instead of purchasing the Great Northern line wholly within our territory, we would now take under our wing other sections of the Great Northern which happen to run in from Northern Ireland territory, but because of the importance of parts of the Republic, it is necessary for us to maintain those rail connections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make the point that if the <Col N="1139" /> Great Northern were modernised, if there was a conversion to modern traction, apart altogether from the resulting increase in traffic, there would be a surplus in regard to the operation of the Great Northern in the Republic and that resulting surplus would be more than adequate to meet any losses on the portions we would take from the Northern Ireland Government.</P>
    <P>I think there is a danger of taking extreme views when considering this problem.  One of those extreme views might be summed up by the question as to why should we subsidise the transport of Orangemen.  Another extreme view, equally to be set aside in my opinion, is the view that we should keep those lines open in order to humiliate the Northern Ireland Government.  I hope we will consider this matter calmly and in the best interests of our citizens and the community. We should not allow ourselves to be taunted either by the expression used in Stormont recently, namely, that this poor bankrupt Republic was unable to prevent a closure.</P>
    <P>As I said already, the Northern Ireland Government's approach to this matter is a purely financial approach. Branch-lines have been closed here, in Northern Ireland and in Britain. There is an organisation with which I am connected that covers all these areas and it has never opposed a closure of a branch-line previously. There are economic arguments in regard to the closure of unremunerative branch-lines, but you eventually reach the stage where the economic argument can be outweighed by the bigger arguments such as the social arguments, the maintenance of a rail system as a whole and the maintenance of proper communications in and between territories.</P>
    <P>I know something of this problem and I do not think that the Northern Ireland Government have decided to close these lines in order to create a barrier between the two territories, or in order to make more difficult communications and contacts between the two parts of our island, or between <Col N="1140" /> one part of the Republic and the other I do not think they did it for those reasons, but it is very fair to say, I think, that they would not be too grieved at the result, because the result, as you can quite easily see, will be that communications and contacts between the two territories will be made more difficult.  It would mean building higher the Border.  The Northern Ireland Government would not be too grieved with that result and I do not think we should look at it from that viewpoint.</P>
    <P>I have said that these are common services.  I looked at the debates that took place when the 1953 legislation was going through in order to see if I could find any explanation as to what &ldquo;common services&rdquo; mean.  There is no such explanation, but I think it is obvious that what is meant is that certain railway lines are scheduled as common services so that even though they may run through other territory, the Government in that territory cannot close those railway lines without going through certain stages, certain machinery.  In the last resort, the Government in the one territory may exercise their rights of keeping open a railway line in the other territory.</P>
    <P>One of the common services is defined as the Dundalk-Clones-Enniskillen, and, strangely enough, Londonderry.  How &ldquo;Londonderry&rdquo; crept into our legislation, I do not know, but there it is.  As many Senators must know, passengers from Donegal to Dublin, do not in fact travel over that common service, but instead are brought around via Portadown.  The same applies to a great extent to merchandies travelling between Derry, Donegal and the South. Most of that merchandise traffic does not pass through what is scheduled as the common services, but instead goes through a purely Northern Ireland railway section, that is Omagh and Portadown.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Government here have a responsibility to provide proper rail services between the rest of the Republic and Donegal and those rail services should be routed through the common service, through Enniskillen. <Col N="1141" /> By doing so, the receipts on that portion would be considerably improved. There is no substantial difference in the mileage.  It is some 12 miles longer to come via Enniskillen than to come around via Portadown.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this matter which affects these railway lines is the allowing of Northern Ireland lorries into the Republic.  They are principally live-stock lorries and it was said that they are largely operating illegally. They are allowed in here to pick up their owners' live-stock and bring it back into Northern Ireland territory. In fact, they come to fairs as far south as Clare and from Clare bring live-stock illegally to Dublin, go to some other fair and afterwards go back to Northern Ireland before coming back in again.  That affects the live-stock receipts over the Sligo-Leitrim line and over the Armagh route of the G.N.R. which it is now proposed to close.  If the Government here decide to exercise their right to keep open these lines, they should have regard to those two points I have made which would considerably improve the position.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that the purpose of putting down this motion was to enable Senators to give their considered views on the problems which now faces us.  It is not put down for propaganda purposes.  I have tried to approach this matter as calmly and as factually as I can, and I would wish that Senators would consider this matter, not on the basis of any bias against the Northern Ireland Government, but in relation to its effect on our own people.  If, as I said, in deciding to help our own people, we also help the people in Northern Ireland, we should be very glad to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamWoods" hpid="Mr. Woods Mr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding this motion, I should like first of all to remind the Seanad that, in my maiden speech in this House, I prefaced my remarks by congratulating the Minister for Industry and Commerce on his action in relation to the preservation of the G.N.R. lines, and, even at this stage, I have every hope that the Minister will persist in his attitude and see that these common service lines will not be closed.  I was <Col N="1142" /> asked to put my name to this motion perhaps because I took that interest on that occasion, and because, on the other hand, in the past, I have taken a very deep interest in trying to save and preserve the old Dundalk-Newry-Greenore line which was also a cross-Border line.</P>
      <P>In this discussion, my most immediate concern is in relation to the Dundalk railway works which are in my home county and where there are upwards of 1,000 workers employed. Senator Murphy has covered practically all the ground leading up to this G.N.R. crisis, and has left very little for any Senator to say following him on this matter, but, as he has pointed out, if, for example, the line were closed from Dundalk to Enniskillen, it would mean one-third of the G.N.R. line.  In the earlier agreement to which he referred, which was arranged at the taking over of the G.N.R. by the Northern Government and our Government, certain guarantees were given to the workers at Dundalk, as far as I recollect.  Should these cross-Borders lines, the common services, be terminated, in the works in Dundalk alone, it would mean the disemployment, I understand, of about 100 men. I am quite sure that the Minister is aware of the great work that has been done at that works, and the quality of the work, and it is something he will bear in mind in his consideration as to the future of that great work.</P>
      <P>The international situation in recent weeks calls, to my mind, for reconsideration by the Northern Ireland Government of their attitude in this question.  I consider, and I believe the House will consider, that it would be a very wrong step, in view of these events, to permit those common service lines to be closed.  There is a very grave fear and suspicion in Dundalk that, if those common services are allowed to be terminated, not alone will 100 men be disemployed as a result, but it will be really the thin edge of the wedge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been pointed out by Senator Murphy, there has been a very big disagreement between the chairmen of the tribunals in the Republic and in Northern Ireland.  We are told that <Col N="1143" /> these railway lines are being closed down for economic reasons.  I am speaking now from experience of what happened so far as the close-down of the Dundalk, Newry and Greenore railway line was concerned.  Those unfortunate employees who were then redundant, and who had purchased from the British Railways their houses and property, remained for a short time in the district, but eventually each and every one of them, as a result of no further industry coming along to take the place of the railway, was forced through circumstances to emigrate.  Some of them certainly were transferred to the British Railway services here in Dublin, but the vast majority of them and their families had to leave the country and go across to England.  I would fear that if the Northern Government persist and if there is any change of attitude on the part of our Minister for Industry and Commerce, it would have very grave repercussions not alone on the district I speak particularly about, the Dundalk district, but on the entire system which will be affected.</P>
    <P>After listening to Senator Murphy covering perhaps the main aspect of the situation, I shall be brief, and I shall conclude by asking the Minister to maintain the attitude he has maintained right through in these discussions with the Northern Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the few members from a northern county in this House, I am glad to be associated with the motion.  Senator Murphy has made a very excellent case for the retention of these lines, as Senator Murphy made an excellent case at the inquiry which was held in Belfast and at which the Council of which I am a member was represented.  The proposed closing of these sections of railway is another indication of the evils of Partition.  Unfortunately, the problem which is now presented to the Minister is a very serious one, and one which will require a considerable amount of consideration.  I feel, however, that we cannot approach the problem in a realistic way until we have further information, as Senator <Col N="1144" /> Murphy has stated, in connection with the intention of the Northern Government regarding the proposed closing of the railway line from Portadown to Derry.</P>
      <P>Apparently, that section of railway can be closed without any further inquiry at which we would be represented, and if we, previous to that closure, accepted the decision of the Northern Ireland Government that the Bundoran line was to be closed, and later the other section was closed, then Donegal would be completely isolated by rail from the capital.</P>
      <P>I have already been interested in a section of railway in my county.  An inquiry was held there in 1947 and presided over by the present Chairman of the Transport Tribunal.  The case then made was that the complete section of railway from Stranolar to Glenties should be closed, and it was based on the fact that the complete section of railway would require to be re-laid.  I extract from the report of this inquiry, which is dated 16th May, 1947, this passage from page 28, Section 61:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;These factors indicate that were it not essential to renew this section of the railway line not only would no economies be effected by the proposed transfer from rail to road, but such traffic could be conveyed by rail at approximately one half of the cost of conveyance by road. Furthermore, if the figures indicating present rail expenditure were increased, as shown hereunder by an annual sum which over the length of life of the permanent way would provide for renewals, the total rail expenditure will still be less than that incurred in providing substitute road transport services.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I assume that the G.N.R. do not require to relay the sections of railway line which it is now suggested by the Northern Government should be closed.</P>
      <P>An inquiry was held by a number of experts in 1948, and the tribunal set up by the Minister for Local Government at the time stated in its report, on page 18 of the Report on Transport in Ireland, 1948:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" />&ldquo;Railways afford the most economic form of transport for conveyance of long-distance passenger traffic by regular services and excursion trains and should offer distinct advantages over other forms of transport in both speed and comfort.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I understand that in 1954 the G.N.R. placed a dieselisation programme before the Government.  If these proposals had then been acted upon, I am satisfied that considerable savings in fuel costs would have been effected and more frequent, faster and more comfortable services would have attracted back to the railways many who now travel by road, as happened in the case of the C.I.E. system.</P>
    <P>On Monday night last, I went to Amiens Street Station to meet passengers. The train was 40 minutes late.  I believe that that would not happen on the C.I.E. system, as a result of the dieselisation programme which they have effected.  As I have indicated, the Government at the time apparently were prepared to back up the proposals of the G.N.R. Board for dieselisation, but no indication was received from the Northern Government that they were prepared to cooperate. Instead, the Minister for Commerce in Northern Ireland suggested that the railways would require to be pruned and it is now stated that the three cross-Border sections of the railway should be closed.  It is, therefore, of extreme importance that our Government should announce their proposals at the earliest possible date. The time lag that has occurred has meant that there has been a fair amount of deterioration in modernising the system, that losses have continued to occur and that the rolling-stock and permanent way have naturally fallen into a certain state of disrepair.</P>
    <P>The accounts of the G.N.R., published some time ago, show that the G.N.R. operated about 4,750,000 steam-locomotive miles per annum at an approximate cost of 3/- per mile for coal.  If that mileage were operated by diesel traction which, I understand, is roughly 10d. per mile for locomotives and 6d. per mile for road-rail cars, savings to the extent of £500,000 could have been made.  This would have <Col N="1146" /> contributed to some extent to the relief of our trade deficit.  I appreciate that only portion of it would be applicable to our State and that, naturally, a fair amount of it would affect the Northern Ireland economy.  For that reason, and because our Governments have spent £4,500,000 in acquiring the railway&mdash;which is a considerable amount of capital of the tax payer&mdash; in my opinion it would be wrong that one-third of these railways should now be abandoned after such a short period from the time they were acquired.</P>
    <P>If the section of railway referred to in this motion is closed, then Bundoran will receive a crushing blow.  It is dependent practically entirely, on its tourist traffic for its existence.  It was stated at the inquiry that up to 40,000 Sunday day-trippers go to Bundoran during July and August.  The Prior of Lough Derg said that 18,000 people travel to Pettigo during the season and that most of them travel between the middle of July and the 15th August, which is the closing date of the pilgrimage. The trains all cross the Border.  It is difficult to imagine how buses could possibly cater for that traffic if there is a considerable Customs examination which does not now occur owing to the fact that the Bundoran Express is non-stop between Dundalk and Bundoran.  As it does not stop in Northern Ireland, there is no Customs examination.</P>
    <P>At page 34 of his report, Dr. Beddy states that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...their replacement by separate services provided by two transport organisations (the Great Northern Railway Board and the Ulster Transport Authority) each confined to separate operating areas, thereby necessitating Border transfer of passengers and merchandise unless this can be avoided by arrangements, the nature and efficacy of which cannot be judged as they have not yet been subject to any examination.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I can visualise, therefore, a great deal of delay and trouble if two distinct transport organisations are catering for the traffic on each side of the Border.  The prospects, for instance, of developing Ballyshannon or South <Col N="1147" /> Donegal generally would be practically hopeless if the railway is to be closed down.  The same would apply to Donegal generally if, later, the Strabane-Portadown section of the railway closed.</P>
    <P>The Northern Minister for Finance has suggested that one or other of the two lines between Belfast and Derry are to close.  At the present time, these lines are in severe competition with the Ulster Transport Authority.  Apparently Northern Ireland have placed a considerable amount of their confidence and their finance in the Ulster Transport Authority and the problem, therefore, is particularly difficult.  I suggest that the Minister should obtain a definite intimation from the Northern authorities as to their intentions before he finally decides on these three sections of line.</P>
    <P>Senator Woods has already referred to the problem which is presented by the lack of oil supplies.  It is obvious that, in consequence of the proposed rationing which the Minister announced to-day, great numbers of people will now have to depend on public transport. I believe that transport even by diesel locomotion consumes less oil than bus transport.  I understand also that France had a deficit of up to £60,000,000 last year and Britain up to £55,500,000 and if these two countries are prepared to pay that deficit rather than abandon their lines, it is my opinion that, in an agricultural country like ours, where live stock must be transported quickly and collected all over the country, we should have the services of the lines as far as possible. There is no doubt that the West of Ireland cattle trade will be very adversely affected if the Sligo-Leitrim line is to be closed.  It has been said that it would cost £1 per head more to have cattle shipped via Dublin and there would be considerably more delay.  Sir Anthony Babington stated that the ultimate decision must rest with the two Ministers and I would ask our Ministers not to acquiesce in this closure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to go on record as being in complete agreement with the purpose and intention of this <Col N="1148" /> motion.  Senator Murphy in particular has spoken at some length and has given the House the benefit of his varied and intimate knowledge of the problem involved and he has been followed by Senator Woods and Senator Walsh, both of whom, I should imagine, are <i>au fait</i> with the seriousness of this problem in the areas from which they come, and for the people who live in these areas.  On that account, I do not propose, and I do not think it would be fair, to labour these arguments <i>ad infinitum.</i>  I merely wish to make one or two remarks by way of emphasis of some of the points already made.</P>
      <P>I should like to say that, in my view, the maintenance of services such as these is absolutely vital to the continued development and economic health, not alone of the particular counties affected but of the country as a whole.  Secondly, it should hardly be necessary for anyone at the present time to point to the importance of maintaining them, in the light of the very obvious danger which is facing us just now of a complete disruption of our transport services and the prospects of a prolonged and very serious shortage of petrol and various types of oil.</P>
      <P>When I was asked to put my name to this motion, I decided to do so and I was influenced by the consideration that I was very impressed, having read Dr. Beddy's Report, by the quite unambiguous terms in which he put himself on record as being solidly in favour of these services.  I anticipate that before the motion is disposed of the Minister will give the House the benefit of his knowledge on this subject and possibly on the very serious financial commitments to which the motion would pledge the country.  In conclusion, I say that, unless these commitments were such as to make it utterly impossible for the country to undertake them, I believe we should face up to the problem and the Government should do its part in maintaining them, even at their own cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichealPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I am primarily concerned with the effect which the closure would have on the live-stock industry and the implications it may <Col N="1149" /> have for the West of Ireland, whence a large number of our cattle are exported to England and Scotland and are transported on these lines.  The Senators who have already spoken have covered the ground very well as regards the economic repercussions.  As I say, my interest is primarily in regard to the live-stock industry.  In 1955, the total exports of live stock were over 618,000, of which 161,004 were either exported through the North of Ireland or remained in the Six Counties for a further period of feeding. That constitutes almost 25 per cent. of our total exports, and, while I am not suggesting that all these cattle were being exported on the lines in question, I submit that the transport of between 60,000 and 70,000 cattle, 9 to 10 per cent of our total exports may be affected.  This flow of cattle is so great that it could not be carried on without the railway lines and it is very hard to visualise what could be given to us to replace those railway lines.</P>
      <P>I maintain that the two Governments cannot pass the responsibility on to the live-stock trade or the farming community and that the problems is as much one for them as it is for us.  It has taken us half a century to build up the cattle trade and that trade should not be jeopardised.  Before it is cut off, or any attempt made to cut it off the repercussions should be examined by the two Governments and they should be able to show an alternative method of transport which would not slacken the present flow.  I would appeal to the Tánaiste to leave no stone unturned in his efforts to stop the closing of these lines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerMcHugh" hpid="Dr. McHugh Dr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter which I have already notified you, Sir, I intended to raise on the Adjournment is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To call the attention of the Taoiseach and of the Minister for External Affairs to the fact that Ireland, although a member of the U.N.O., has not yet contributed a contingent to the United Nations <Col N="1150" /> Emergency Force entrusted with the preservation of peace and order in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>I have put down this matter in no tendentious spirit, but simply and purely in order to elicit information and partly in order to express a view which I think is the view of a considerable number of people in this country at the present time.  That body of people to which I refer perhaps was divided originally about the advisability of Ireland's entry into the U.N.O. and perhaps was sceptical in recent months when at first it looked as if the U.N.O. would achieve very little except talk, when confronted with the Middle East situation and subsequently with the Hungarian situation.</P>
    <P>Since then, I think this body of opinion recognises that a historic thing has happened in the formation and despatch to the Middle East of the U.N. Emergency Force, charged with the restoration of peace and order in that area.  It seems to me, and I think to a good many other people, that the experiment of the U.N. Emergency Force in the Middle East is really going to be a test of the Organisation. It seems to me also that there is something about it that appeals to the imagination as well as to the practical reason of peace-loving nations, tired of the imperialistic warfare which periodically is thrust upon them in one or other of its modern forms.  I quote the words of Mr. Hammarskjöld, Secretary General of the U.N.O., when he referred to the U.N. Emergency Force: &ldquo;It is the first truly international force; let us hope that it will succeed, let us hope that we will succeed in establishing peace and order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Up to the present, there is at least a reasonable hope that the experiment will succeed in the Middle East.  If it does succeed, the moral effect of its success will be tremendous.  The eyes of the world can then be turned to the prospect of using such an international police force&mdash;as it is, in effect&mdash;to restore peace and order in Hungary. Hungary, like Egypt, has been the victim of a form of imperialistic aggression, in this case, Communist <Col N="1151" /> imperialism.  If the U.N. Emergency Force succeeds in the Middle East, it may prove effective one day in Hungary&mdash;for, remember, it went into Egypt against the wishes of two of the Great Powers.</P>
    <P>I have been reading in the debates of this Seanad the discussion that took place on the League of Nations Bill. I recall that you, Sir, made an excellent speech on 13th November, 1935, which is reported in column 1111, in which you expressed your doubts about the League of Nations, which indeed did prove eventually to be dancing to the tunes of the Great Powers.  You cast some doubts upon Britain's boast as the moral leader of the world in imposing sanctions and you, Sir, inquired had Britain not been responsible for giving a lead in the imposition of sanctions against Italy, would there be any question of the imposition of sanctions at all.  I do not wonder that you, Sir, were sceptical, but in this case, Sir, I would point out that it was the smaller Powers that took the initiative, despite the opposition of the Great Powers.  So there is at last some hope that small Powers like ourselves can exert that influence in the councils of the nations which they should exert.</P>
    <P>As regards Hungary, I should like to say&mdash;and in order to relate it to the terms of my statement&mdash;that I am proud that Ireland has played a part, within the limitations imposed upon her by hard fact.  She has protested in the U.N.O.; she has provided financial aid and medical supplies; she has offered to take 1,000 refugees&mdash;a number which I think is still far short of the number we should take in this country.  The vital remedies for Hungary are the vital remedies for Egypt: the withdrawal of foreign troops from her soil, and, secondly, the holding of free elections.  This can best be done, under present circumstances through the U.N.O.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out also that, already, Britain&mdash;aware of the influence that this small country can play in international affairs&mdash;has invented a mythical race called the &ldquo;Eireanns&rdquo;&mdash;a term which has a basis neither in etymology nor in political <Col N="1152" /> fact.  This is to play down our reputation as &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; in &ldquo;the councils of the nations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out further&mdash;it has been commented upon by several of my friends&mdash;that the B.B.C., either through its newscasts or through its telecasts, in certain messages from the British troops in the Middle East home, has always been careful to include a couple of Irish soldiers serving with the British forces from, say, Down, Antrim or Derry, or another of the occupied counties, thereby creating an erroneous impression, that Ireland is in some way a party to the British aggression in Egypt.  An admirable counter-move would be the contribution of a contingent force to the U.N.O. Emergency Force; coupled with that, a continual demand for justice for Hungary, and to pave the way for a favourable reception in the U.N.O. towards the ending of our own great injustice, the ending of Partition.</P>
    <P>It may possibly be argued that there is some constitutional barrier in the way of our contributing a contingent to this U.N. Emergency Force.  I have looked carefully, through the Constitution&mdash;carefully, if rather hurriedly. The only Article which I have found which might be quoted against me is Article 16, Clause 6, paragraph (2), and it reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No military or armed force, other than a military or armed force raised and maintained by the Oireachtas, shall be raised or maintained for any purpose whatsoever.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that argument is used against me, I should like to point out that this token contingent, an earnest of our own people's desire for international peace, would be raised and maintained by the Oireachtas.  It would help perhaps to benefit our own soldiers to serve in such an international force.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I would say that to-day it is a question of Egypt, to-morrow it is a question of Hungary, in relation to this international force; and perhaps some day it may be a question of Ireland.  I believe that it is a great experiment and that Ireland should play her part in helping it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather that the Senator is seeking to elicit information and to express a view which he says was held by a considerable number of people.  I do not know what information he was seeking to elicit and I would have liked to have known the extent of the body of opinion that supports the suggestion that I gather is implicit&mdash;although not explicit&mdash;in the motion he has moved on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>I have made clear, I think, the attitude adopted and unanimously approved of by the Dáil, and I think by the people, that Ireland, on becoming a member of the United Nations, was fully prepared to play its part in the maintenance and preservation of world peace.  Our small nation has something to contribute in international affairs and to world peace and perhaps it has something to gain. We are a small nation, as everybody knows, but we have considerable influence because of our far flung exiles throughout the world.  I have not made any secret of my own personal conviction that we have much to gain and a lot to contribute by our membership of the United Nations.  We are independent.  We have no axe to grind.  We are not tied to the tail of any big Power and that has been made clear by the Minister for External Affairs in all the speeches he made since he went to the United Nations. We have that independence, prestige and influence which, I know, will be of considerable value, not merely to us but to the other countries represented in the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have only just been admitted a member of the United Nations.  Nineteen nations, including our own, were admitted quite recently.  Of those 19 nations, only one European nation offered to contribute to the International Emergency Force that is being sent to Egypt.  I think that is a matter of very considerable significance and importance.  Certainly it weighed with me and my colleagues when considering this matter.  We were fully alive to the problem as to whether we were not merely obliged to make a contribution towards this force, but whether we ought to do it, even if we were not under any obligation.  There <Col N="1154" /> is, in fact, no obligation on any member to contribute to this police force, but there may be perhaps considerations of humanity and a desire to contribute to the maintenance of peace and to the clearing up of a very disturbing situation which might compel countries to contribute something.</P>
    <P>But taking all the considerations into account, taking those very relevant and forcible considerations put forward in his speech by Senator McHugh about this experiment which everybody hopes will be successful, we think that this is not the time when we should offer to contribute to the police force. It might be that, if matters developed and if we were requested to do so, considerations of a different character might emerge.  It is relevant to consider that only one European nation of the 19 admitted recently made an offer and that nation was Finland.  In respect of that country, it may be that there were very different considerations from those which might weigh with us.  Perhaps Finland may have been impelled to a decision by reason of her proximity to Russia, or, more likely, by reason of the fact that there were Scandinavian neighbours of hers who were foremost in making the offer.</P>
    <P>The situation is new.  We were not asked or requested to contribute, nor was it suggested that we should.  In these circumstances, I think it would be better for us to wait and see how matters develop.  It is perhaps something that should be considered, although if we felt morally obliged to make an offer of volunteers, it would be necessary to have an amendment of the law.  That is not a very serious matter, if there was a very genuine view in the country that we should offer to support this international emergency force.  I think it would be necessary to amend the Defence Forces Acts before we could send any troops.</P>
    <P>If there was a very large volume of public opinion desiring that we should make this gesture in the interests of international peace and as a small nation very vitally interested in the maintenance and preservation of peace, and also as being vitally interested <Col N="1155" /> in economic security, it would be easy enough to secure an amendment of the Defence Forces Acts.  Taking all the circumstances into consideration, as a new member, and it not having been suggested to us that we ought to contribute something, and in the very unprecedented circumstances <Col N="1156" /> in which this force was evolved, I think it is better for us, as a small nation, and a new member of the United Nations, at least to await developments.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.15 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 28th November, 1956.</P>
