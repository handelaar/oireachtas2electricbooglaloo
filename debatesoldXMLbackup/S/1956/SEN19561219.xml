      <P>It is proposed to take Items 1 and 2 on the agenda and to open the debate on Item 6 with, also, a statement from the Minister for Defence and then adjourn the debate.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed to take the Committee and further Stages of the two Money Bills, the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and the Industrial Grants Bill and for that purpose, of course, recommendations will be accepted as late as possible if Senators desire to move them.  It is proposed then to adjourn until January 16th for the consideration of the Voluntary Health Insurance Bill, the Statute of Limitations Bill and the Married Women's Status Bill.  I think if we give precedence to Motion No. 6, Senator Tierney's motion will have to preserve its position on the Order Paper after the adjournment.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business &mdash;I gave notice that I would like to raise a question in connection with the slowing down of the Land Project and the dismissal of a number of men employed thereon.  I wished to ask the Minister if he would be prepared to make additional allocations for that purpose.  You have conveyed to me, a Chathaoirleach, that you have ruled this out but I would like you to reconsider it, in view of the urgent need to keep this work going.  In my county and in adjoining counties, there has been considerable slowing down of the work and a great number of men have been dismissed.</P>

      <P>I have no knowledge of the Minister's intentions in this matter, but the fact is that the Senator presented me with the question this morning and, on investigation, it was quite clear that the substance of the Senator's question had been replied to in Dáil Éireann last week.  I, therefore, referred the Senator to the reply given by the Minister and, in view of that reply, it seemed to me that the matter which he desired to raise had been, in essentials, discussed in the other House. Accordingly, I indicated to the Senator that I did not think it was a matter that ought to be raised.  That is my ruling on the matter and the matter ends there.</P>

    <Title>Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1956&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed) and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking last night, I illustrated the fact that private enterprise was a far more effective way of operating coal mines than State enterprise.  I believe that we shall be called upon very often to give reasons and show justification as to why these tax concessions should be made available, if the State is to give remissions of taxation.  I propose very briefly this morning to quote from two publications which, in my opinion, show conclusively that these tax concessions are necessary not just for the individuals but necessary for the development of our economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>The first of these documents which I propose to quote is from the Ibec technical services and it makes a comparative analysis between our industrial climate here and the climate in America and in other countries.  In paragraph (f) page 59 it says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1565" />&ldquo;It may be stated with conviction that, upon such evidence as is available, profits in Irish manufacturing are generally too low.  As has already been pointed out, the information about the status of profits before taxes is so limited as to raise the question of why official information on this score should display a reticence that is in direct contract to the excellent data furnished upon other phases of business operations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Since then the Minister for Finance in the previous Government set up a Commission of Inquiry into industrial taxation and this report has been submitted. On page 79, paragraph 211, of the Report, there is the following statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The present burden of industrial taxation is in our opinion a deterrent to industrial expansion and, in the absence of a reduction in the standard rate of income tax, an acceleration in wear and tear allowances is justifiable.  Our proposal is that such acceleration should be effected by an increase in the basic rate of wear and tear allowances and in the granting of initial allowances...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is obvious to anyone who reads these two reports in an objective way that if we want industrial expansion and exports, we shall have to create the climate to allow industry to expand by allowing it the money to be ploughed back into industry.</P>
    <P>I do not advocate for an instant that it will be permissible to take the money out of the industry.  I want it left to the industry so that the <i>corpus</i> of the industry can be protected, developed and expanded to the benefit of our community, as is envisaged in the provisions relating to coal-mining. The intention in this Bill is to encourage that hazardous type of industrial enterprise.  The chief benefits will accrue to the people working in the industry and to the people producing the various types of machinery and services that the coal-mine will require.</P>
    <P>We have a coal-mine at Ballingarry, County Tipperary.  The major benefit of that mine will go, first, to Tipperary; secondly, to the nation and, <Col N="1566" /> a long way behind, there is the benefit which will accrue to the owner of the mine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>Will that mine qualify for the financial assistance under this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that any increased output from that mine will be covered by this Bill.  As I understand it, the purpose of this Bill is to encourage further efforts rather than to reward past performance.  It has the weakness that people who have done well in the past are difficult to reward. I do not see how the Minister could have helped them, although Senator Guinness made a plea on their behalf. However, this concession is for further efforts on behalf of our economy rather than for past results.</P>
      <P>From my own experience and observation, I know that in another town on one of the three sister rivers there is a very fine enterprise whose products are sold all over Ireland. Indeed, its products are exported to the Six Counties and I have seen its lorries in Belfast.  Recently, that business had to receive very substantial support from one of the largest industrial enterprises in the country.  I say in all seriousness that the reason for that was that the industry in question had to pay so much in tax that it was not allowed enough money to preserve itself intact as a private company.</P>
      <P>Are we not wrong if we do not create the climate that allows that type of fine local industry to stand on its own feet rather than to put it in a position in which it has to go to a very big business combine in this country to get support in order to continue in operation?  It was not that this business was not well run or that its products were not the finest of their kind in this country.  It was not that it was not progressive: it exported to the Six Counties.  The fact is that the burden of taxation prevented it from developing adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been so much talk about the British Coal Board that I think I should refer to it briefly.  There are 50,000,000 people living in Britain.  The greatest drag on the political and economic strength of Western Europe <Col N="1567" /> is the fact that the British Coal Board has not been able to solve its problem. If another 50,000,000 tons of coal could be raised in Britain to-day, the whole political and economic strength of Western Europe would be enhanced. The dependence of Europe on America would be removed and we would be able to stand on our own feet.  It is as a result of the activities of the British, as private traders, that such a large population can live on that small island.  No one can point out any instance to me where public ownership in Britain has made it possible for those 50,000,000 people to live on an island three times the size of Ireland.  I challenge anyone to prove it.</P>
    <P>I come now to the subject of prize bonds.  Personally, I am not in favour of prize bonds or of lotteries.  I should much prefer to see people work on their own farms, or at their own business, or in their own factories and earn their livings in that way rather than hope to make their money through gambling or a lottery.  Senator Kissane referred to the investing public, the people who set aside a small amount of their savings each year and who have continually invested in State loans.  He said that the people who invested in the past are the people who are the most likely to invest in the future.  I agree 100 per cent. with him.  They have been brought up in that tradition.</P>
    <P>The Minister could do one very good thing for people who have invested in State loans.  I think that all State loans should be accepted by the Revenue Commissioners at their face value for estate duty purposes.  A provision could be inserted that unless these loans had been purchased within the three years prior to death, they would not be eligible to rank at par value for estate duty purposes.  That would create a market for these loans and undoubtedly it would bring up their price very much.</P>
    <P>To-day, the 3 per cent. loan is quoted on the Dublin Stock Exchange at 73 and the 5 per cent. loan is quoted at 97.  Our small market is not very buoyant.  I believe that, instead of <Col N="1568" /> going to insurance companies, and so on, to cover their estate duty liabilities, people would go into the market for State loans and that it would have a very desirable effect on our State loans.  Furthermore, it would help the Minister for Finance to borrow money because there would be the guarantee that the capital sum would stay at a much higher figure than is quoted to-day. The people who invested in the 3 per cent. loan will now get only £73 for every £100&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell us if private firms, other than private or public companies, will receive the benefit of the concessions outlined in Section 10 of Part III of the Bill?</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I want to reiterate one or two things I said last night.  I believe the Government is right in encouraging industrial production because it has been stated that good industry can employ a person for every £1,000 invested; but the long-term programme must be the development of our agricultural resources.  That requires a far greater amount of capital, from five to ten times the amount required in industry, to obtain the same immediate results; but the long-term results in agriculture would be far greater because it would not be necessary to import raw materials for the development of agriculture.  On the other hand, in the development of industry, although a person may be employed by the investment of £1,000, most of the raw materials have to be imported and the final paper results tend to be illusory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this is one of the most progressive pieces of legislation that has ever been put before this House.  It runs parallel with the recommendations of the Ibec Report, drawn up by a group of American experts, and the <Col N="1569" /> recommendations of the Commission on Industrial Taxation.  If the Minister did not take cognisance of the evidence given from the best available sources, I believe he would be failing in his duty.  Those of us who wish to criticise what the Minister is doing should put forward counter evidence of the same weight to show that he is wrong in introducing this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody objects to the Bill itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHartney" hpid="Mr. Hartney Mr. Hartney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the ground has been fairly well covered by the various speakers before me and I will be brief in my remarks on this Bill. There are only a few points I would like to make and I do not think it will do any harm to impress their importance on the Minister.  The introduction of this Bill, the giving of tax concessions and the making available of money for various industries is very desirable, but it may seem a bit strange to the man down the country or the man in the street that £2,000,000 can be made available for this and that the very small sums being asked by local authorities are held up.  They see that, while no money can be got to carry out the small jobs they are interested in, more money is proposed to be spent as a result of this legislation. It is like a man making a will leaving certain sums of money to distant relatives, people who may be nothing to him, without making provision for his own family.  Small amounts cannot be extracted from the Local Loans Fund.  The first thing that should be done is to remedy the present ills before we embark on this. I think it requires some explanation by the Minister to the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is definitely good business to ease the tax burden on any industry, especially existing industries that have a possibility of developing and expanding export markets.  I saw it mentioned in the papers recently that the whiskey people could do a much bigger export business, if some relief were given to them.  I do not happen to be a brewer or anything like that&mdash;I have to pay for any connection I have with that beverage&mdash;but I think this is a case that definitely should be considered. <Col N="1570" /> The raw materials are in the country and if you expand a trade of that kind, you will be helping the country and helping the growers of malting barley by opening up a way for increased agricultural production. Whiskey is a commodity you can start producing straight away, once the industry is in a position to compete in a foreign market, and a lot of money can be made without taking up a great deal of shipping space.  Whiskey is not like a bulky product which may have to be sent abroad.</P>
    <P>On the question of coal mines, I understand there is coal not yet touched in this country.  That is all to the good.  It will be wanted in time, despite the fact that national requirements are being lessened by the use of oil.  However, the Suez problem may create a change in that regard.  Coal and turf should be considered side by side and one should not be put in competition with the other.  In areas where there is no turf, coal should be worked to the utmost and in areas where there is ample turf, turf and coal should be provided for the people.  The turf industry may be started without any high initial cost.  Recruit your men, land them in the bogs, give them their weapons and away they go.  A big job can be done without any large machinery.  Turf production is of much more national value than is appreciated.</P>
    <P>I saw from to-day's paper that a new body is being set up for the purpose of shipping cattle to the Continent.  That is very good news because, as we know, there is a continental market crying out for cattle and at one period this year, when we had a surplus, we were unable to avail of that market to the fullest.  Unfortunately, I heard of the case of an Irish shipper who got a fairly substantial order from, I think, France and he went to Scotland to fill a substantial portion of it.  That was nice treatment for his own country.</P>
    <P>Would that company starting off be a company that would qualify for assistance under this Bill?  Suppose they had so much to begin with but required so much more to do a good job, would they qualify?  I think they should because I think this is a company <Col N="1571" /> that will pay dividends from the start.  If it so happens that the application comes before the Minister, I hope he will consider it sympathetically because this is a much needed project at the moment.  But I would impress on the Minister, if he is making any financial assistance available to that body, to ensure that it will ship none but Irish cattle until such time as they are in short supply.  I wish the Bill every success.  In whatever way the money is allotted, I hope it will be allotted in a way that will react to the benefit of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill very much, not because of the fact that it stands on its own here at the moment but because it is part of the positive action by the Government to expand our economy.  All sides of the House can be in agreement that there is great need to expand our economy. Unfortunately, the evidence of under-development is before our eyes in the large unemployment figures and continuous emigration and it does seem to many of us that, after a quarter of a century of freedom, we have failed completely to live up to the ideals of the people who fought for freedom a quarter of a century ago.</P>
      <P>The Minister in introducing the Second Reading of the Bill here, referred to the fact that we have a wide open economy, and he suggested that remedies which might be applicable to a closed economy are not, because of our economy, applicable here.  It seemed to me that he was hinting that we were unable to do very much about the under-development of this country because of that wide open economy.  At least, there seemed to me to be some sort of regret that steps which were easy in other countries, because of their closed economy, could not easily be taken here because of what he termed our wide open economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not say exactly what he meant by a wide open economy and a closed economy.  He set me wondering as to whether he was referring to the fact that our currency is linked with sterling, linked with the currency of another country.  Again I must pose the question which I have continued <Col N="1572" /> to pose, as to why we are unique in this respect.  Why has every other sovereign country its own currency and why should we in the Twenty-Six Counties, a free nation, decide to be unique and to link our currency with that of another country?</P>
    <P>I have never suggested, and I do not want to suggest, that there might be particular merit in breaking that link but the question is, can somebody explain what particular merit there is for us in maintaining that link?  We are, I suggest, in a unique position in this respect and nobody ever seems to explain why we should be in that position. It is no answer at all to say that, if we had a currency of our own, the point that would matter would be whether it would be at par with or lower than sterling.</P>
    <P>During the past 12 months various measures have been taken to correct the economy, in particular, to correct the balance of payments.  There were restrictive measures taken in the spring and in the summer.  I suggested to the Minister some months ago that he should not be too down-hearted about the position, that, in fact, the levies, since they were introduced in March, were correcting the balance of payments difficulties.  I am very glad that the Minister can now assure us that such is the case.  I would advise him, however, not to become too fond of his hair shirt.  He suggested that now is not the time to change the policy, that the patient is recovering and that a patient recovering is more likely to kick against the doctor.</P>
    <P>I personally do not think that we can safely abandon the levies at the present time but I do think a case exists for examining the prescription. Unemployment has arisen out of these levies.  The Minister fairly told us, when he introduced the levies, and it was accepted all round, that there would inevitably be some unemployment because of the levies but I am suggesting that the patient is well on the road to recovery and another look should be taken very quickly by the Minister at the levies inasmuch as they affect employment.  I must reiterate that I am not advocating abandonment of the levies willy nilly but, because of <Col N="1573" /> the other factors involved, we must look at them and I would suggest that the Minister might now usefully look at some of them to see if he can relieve to some little extent the heavy unemployment in the country.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like briefly to refer is the savings campaign which the Minister said is now gathering force.  I want to say, as I said before, that the Labour Party, the trade union movement generally, welcome the savings campaign and are very anxious to give every possible assistance.  I suggest that we might now consider giving a particular slant to the savings campaign, that is, we should indicate the saving to the economy involved in the purchase of Irish goods.  I have been wondering as to the people who are touched by or who listen to the appeals for more savings.  It seems to me that the average man does not purchase very much, apart from his cigarettes, his pint or his drop of whiskey, and that the principal spenders, inevitably, are the housewives.  I wonder if we are getting across to these spenders the need for saving and the desirability, where they must spend, of purchasing Irish goods.</P>
    <P>I believe we can fairly suggest to all our people, men and women, that if we continue to export money, then inevitably we will have to export our children after that money.  We should, therefore, concentrate on trying to get across to everyone that money must be kept at home.  Goods and commodities, where they have to be purchased, should as far as possible be Irish goods, because, if we export our money by buying foreign goods, we are inevitably deciding, in doing that, that we will export our children after that money.</P>
    <P>Much of the discussion yesterday seemed to have reference to private enterprise.  Indeed, some Senators appeared to be setting up private enterprise as a god to be adored. Senator Sheehy Skeffington apparently wanted the Labour Party to declare against private enterprise.  On the other hand, friends on the right and on the left wanted the Labour Party to declare against public enterprise.  May <Col N="1574" /> I say now that it is the concern of the Labour Party, and I think it is the concern of other Parties, too, to develop our economy and to provide employment for all our people at home?  We are very anxious that that development should proceed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>We welcome this measure.  We know its purpose is to assist private enterprise and, by assisting private enterprise, to assist the economy of our country by developing exports, by producing more coal in order to cut imports, by developing our factories and developing to some extent, I take it, our very valuable tourist industry.  We welcome all measures designed to achieve that object, but we are not at the same time prepared to say that we will make a god of private enterprise. We hope that private enterprise will assist our economy, as it is envisaged it will assist it under this Bill; but, if private enterprise cannot succeed in developing our economy, then inevitably there will have to be more pressure for public enterprise to step in and develop it instead.  I should not use the word &ldquo;instead&rdquo;, because, in my opinion, there is room in this economy for both private and public enterprise and it would be a mistake for us to attempt to set one against the other.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh referred to the success of private enterprise in the United States of America.  I quite agree with him that it has been successful, but the biggest example of public enterprise in the free world to-day is the Tennessee Valley Project in the United States. I suggest that we could learn a good deal from that public enterprise.  The Minister made some reference to the employment content of public enterprise as compared with private enterprise. I think he suggested that there was likely to be a greater employment content in a private enterprise project than in a public enterprise project.  I rather thought the Minister was letting himself down somewhat by that reference. I wonder does he think the E.S.B., for example, is any less successful because it has a fairly low employment content?  It is a public enterprise concern.  It was set up by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  To my <Col N="1575" /> mind, it is a very efficient public enterprise. It has a small labour content, but that cannot be taken as an assessment of its merit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>To come back to the Bill, I sincerely hope that one step in particular which the Government has taken to help to develop our economy, will be an outstanding success.  I fear, however&mdash;this is not a criticism&mdash;that there will be pressure brought to bear upon the Minister, pressure which he must resist.  I fear there will be pressure on him to give the same concessions to other concerns, irrespective of whether they are engaged on export, <Col N="1576" /> coal-mining or anything else.  This measure will largely lose its effect if that pressure is successfully applied.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill, as the Minister suggested, is to stimulate the production of coal and to stimulate exports.  I hope it will succeed in doing that.  I can assure the Minister now that we are grateful to him for the work he has put in on all this. Earlier this year, restrictive measures had to be introduced.  We suggested then that we should not halt at that point and that we should take positive steps to develop our economy.  I know that the Minister has devoted all his energies in the meantime to planning how that economy can be helped.  This is one step in that direction.  It is evidence of the hard work the Minister has put in since he introduced the first series of restrictive measures in the spring and summer of this year.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and I associate myself with the compliments that have been paid to the Minister for its introduction.  Over a number of years here, I have listened to those engaged in industry asking for certain concessions by way of tax relief for the improvement of their buildings and machinery.  The Minister has gone some distance now in this measure towards remedying some of the grievances.  As Senator Douglas told us yesterday, however, there are border-line cases which will need attention, too, but certainly the Minister has made an honest effort and done his part in offering incentives to increased production.  I am satisfied that the concessions made in the matter of tax reliefs now will have a beneficial effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made yesterday evening by many Senators to the need for increased production and to the large number of unemployed people in the country.  I am afraid that much of the unemployment at present could be reduced if people engaged in such employment as public works would work nearly as well for the wages they receive as they would work if they were doing the job for themselves. Recently, travelling along a road in my native county, my attention was drawn <Col N="1577" /> to the fact that a number of people working on a county council scheme had their overcoats on while two men, working for themselves digging potatoes behind a neighbouring wall, had only their waistcoats on.  These contrasts are there and I believe there must be some answer to them.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that I welcome the experiment in prize bonds.  Even in small towns throughout rural Ireland very large numbers of people are inclined to have a flutter.  In these towns there is a fairly ready sale for tickets in various types of raffles and sweeps.  As the Minister pointed out, people contributing to these bonds will not be running any risk.  They will not be running such risks as they do when they buy tickets in sweepstakes or raffles.  They do stand the chance of winning a prize but, even if they do not, their investment is still there to be realised any time they want it.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy referred to a matter about which I should like to speak briefly.  I hope that in his reply the Minister will briefly and plainly give an answer to those people who advocate a break with sterling at the present time.  Over the years, quite a number of people who advised a break with sterling are to-day very anxious to maintain the link with sterling.  I should like to know what is the value of its preservation and what would be the repercussions of a break with it.</P>

      <P>In introducing this measure the Minister used the occasion to make a comprehensive statement on the economic position of the country as he saw it.  I think every member of the House will agree it was a welcome statement.  It was realistic, clear and unambiguous.  While there may be people who do not agree with the Minister in certain things, few will disagree with the suggestion that a statement like that which he made yesterday was desirable.  No matter what may happen in the future, and while the stature of some men may not grow, I think it can be said that because of the realistic manner with which the present Minister for Finance is prepared to deal with the situation as he <Col N="1578" /> sees it, his stature will not diminish in public opinion.</P>
      <P>I think it is only fair that some such tribute should be paid to him because the tragedy to-day is that there are so few people in public life prepared to face up to difficult issues in a realistic way.  I think it may be said, however, that it was also a tragedy the Minister for Finance did not face up to this position soon enough.  If these issues had been faced up to sooner the Minister might not now have the rather difficult task with which he is confronted. It is true that warnings were given by people in the Dáil who were, in the opinion of many, capable of foreseeing trends and of giving such warnings.  However, other people in high places in the Government said there was no crisis, that there might be some difficulties but they were easy to get around.  It was a pity that the Minister did not then take the strong view that he takes now.  If that had been done I think many of the difficulties that now face us would not be so great.</P>
      <P>Since the Minister used this occasion to make a comprehensive statement I think he deserves commendation.  So much time has been spent on discussing this measure that there is no need for me to deal with it at any great length. I should, however, like to say that the point of view of this side of the House was put very clearly and lucidly by Senator Ó Buachalla.  I think his statement was listened to very seriously by all members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a debate such as this, covering a wide field of financial issues, reference had to be made to such things as banks and banking.  If some people continue to make certain types of statements often enough they almost invariably convince themselves that certain things are so.  These people, who make statements with the apparent object of convincing others, succeed in convincing only themselves.  I should like to say now, as others have said already, that I feel the measures now being taken are too few and have come too late.  I hope I am wrong in that.  It is felt by many people that the economic situation has gone to a point from which recovery will be long and <Col N="1579" /> tedious.  I believe as does the Minister that recovery will come but I am afraid it will not come as easily as the Minister hopes.  The Minister said we were now convalescing and that a convalescing patient had to be more seriously cared for than when he was seriously ill.</P>
    <P>That is true and it reminds me of a statement made by a previous Minister for Finance about the nation rounding a corner.  My attention was drawn to this statement by a cartoon in one of Dublin's humorous journals. This journal developed the idea of the Minister's statement by having a full page cartoon of a lady rounding a corner with two people, wearing masks and armed with cudgels, about to hit her.  The Minister who made that statement was in office so long ago that he is not now in public life.</P>

      <P>I believe it is relevant because we have heard so much about nations rounding corners.  It seems to me to be a very slow process.  I think the Minister will be fair enough to agree that in the crisis confronting the Government, the issue is being met fairly by the majority of the people who do not agree with him in politics.  I think the Minister will also agree that no Party has a monopoly of either vice or virtue.</P>

      <P>I wish to relate it to the debate.  I think the Minister will be fair enough to agree that the manner in which this crisis has been met by the Fianna Fáil Party is just a bit different from the manner in which the Fine Gael Party dealt with a rather similar position when our balance of payments was out of balance to the tune of over £60,000,000 <Col N="1580" /> and when certain things had to be done by way of taxation to curb inflation. We had the spectacle of people who should know better and should have a better sense of responsibility talking about hairshirt policies and suggesting to the people in an insidious way that the people were asked to eat less, and so on.</P>
      <P>While I am sure it could happen again since, as I say, no Party has a monopoly of vice or virtue, I should hate to think that an Opposition, no matter what Party is in opposition, would be so irresponsible as to behave like this and I hope my colleagues will not behave so.  I do hope the Minister will realise that it would be very undesirable that that sort of thing should happen twice.  Once was enough for it to happen.  It can always be argued that a Party in power and a Party in opposition are two different things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>If you regard it as a ruling, I agree.  As I have said, this is a miscellany of financial provisions. I do not think it is a desirable thing for the latter part of the Bill to be included amongst provisions like this.  I wonder why the Minister and the advisers in the Department of Finance when they wanted to make provision for prize bonds and legislation had to be brought in, did not have a separate measure introduced.  There was a particular principle involved.  Some people may agree with it, who believe one way or another in State raffles, to use the term used by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  I do not know whether he used it as a joke or in a sneering way.  However, there is the element of the raffle involved.  A State raffle might not be the best word to have used in this context, but there is a certain principle involved and the Minister and the Department of Finance saw fit to tack this idea on to a measure providing certain tax reliefs for people engaged in certain industries and mining undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I myself think it was wrong on the part of the Minister to have included the latter part of the Bill dealing with prize bonds in this measure.  I suggest there should have been an independent Bill dealing with that matter only.  It would have been a small measure and could have been treated on its merits. The Minister is aware that there are people in this country who object to that idea of prize bonds, who do not believe in gambling or anything even connected with gambling.  I am not one of them, but I do respect their point of view.  There is a fairly large number of people who hold that viewpoint and I suggest that the Minister tacked on the latter part of the Bill <Col N="1583" /> making provision for the prize bonds so as to prevent its being treated separately so that the Bill would appear to have something good in it as well as something bad.</P>
    <P>Of course, it will take time to tell whether the scheme itself is a good idea or not.  As Senator Douglas suggested last week there are people who do feel it is immoral.  That is why I object to the fact that the scheme providing for prize bonds has been added. I think it should have been separate.</P>
    <P>In regard to the other part of the Bill which provides for tax reliefs for coal mining undertakings and industries hoping to break into the export market, it has been suggested by some people that they are not sufficient to warrant the risk involved.  That is a matter with which I would not be competent to deal but, since everybody agrees that the greatest expansion should take place under agriculture, it is regrettable that a measure to boost agricultural output has not come before a measure of this sort since we will also have to deal with a Bill in that regard after this measure.  Having given expression to these criticisms I merely wish to add that I hope the Minister will be successful in, in my opinion, his genuine desire to put the economy of this country right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and the frank statement made by the Minister yesterday.  The statement indicated that the Government during the last six months have had to take unpopular measures to put the country's economy on a proper footing and shows that they were strong enough and were prepared, despite what the Opposition stated in the past, to take unpopular measures.  Senator O'Reilly speaking here a few moments ago said that the measures were too meagre and too late.  One would expect that a responsible Opposition like the Fianna Fáil Party, a Party that was in office for 20 years, would be unanimous on a policy to meet the present difficulties that confront the country.  We all have to agree that they are not.  While in the House they promise us co-operation; I think we were told by the Leader of the Opposition <Col N="1584" /> that they would support this Government although they detested it.  It is very hard for anybody to co-operate with you if they detest you at the same time.  While the Opposition state in this House they will support the Government, down at the chapel gates and throughout the country, they blame the Government for everything, for the fall in the cattle prices, over which the Government have no control, the fall in the turkey prices, which are governed by the supply and demand in the British market, and for every little thing that has gone wrong.  I think it would be a good idea if the Opposition were unanimous and had a plan and told the people what their plan is to get the country out of the economic difficulties that confront us.</P>
      <P>Senator Cogan speaking here yesterday evening spoke about a turning point that took place in 1948.  Obviously he was trying to throw the blame on to the inter-Party Government but it might be no harm to remind Senator Cogan that he supported the Coalition Government between 1948 and 1951.  From 1951 onwards he supported a Government that in my opinion started all this trouble because, in the latter part of 1951, they injected £24,000,000 of the Marshall Aid into an already over-inflated economy.  I think it was their action at that time that started the troubles that we have to-day.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance pointed out in his speech yesterday that our future depends on more savings and on the investment of our people's money in productive enterprises.  I am one of those people who claim that in the past we spent too much money on work that was not of a productive nature and that, while it was giving employment at the time, it was not of any lasting benefit to the country.  In my own county we spent £12,000 per mile on roads which were already good enough for anybody.  I know that it is the Minister's idea that in future more money should be spent on land reclamation, forestry, work under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, on lime and fertilisers and on the erection of more factories to help to get into the export market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cogan seemed to be very <Col N="1585" /> anxious about the land reclamation scheme but our memories are good and we remember 1948 when the farmers were told not to avail of the land reclamation scheme, that if they did their valuations would be increased immediately.  We all know that the Minister at that time faced great difficulties and it took him nearly two or three years before he was able to get that scheme going in a proper form.  I think we all agree in this House and throughout the country that, as Ireland is an agricultural country, the prosperity of every man, woman and child depends upon what we are able to get from the land, both for our own people and for export to Britain, to get the money to pay for the raw materials which keep the wheels of industry turning.</P>
    <P>When Senator Cogan tries to blame us, it is necessary to go back to 1947. He should remember the point from which we started when we had the lowest number of cattle, sheep and pigs in living memory.  Between 1931 and 1947 the number of cattle dropped by 750,000; sheep by over 1,000,000 and the pig population from 1,200,000 to 475,000.  He should also remember that in 1947 total exports were only £38,000,000 and that in 1951 they had increased to over £81,000,000.  I think we will all have to agree that the Government of that time, despite what Senator O'Reilly stated a few minutes ago, were interested in agricultural production because the bulk of those exports came from agricultural production.</P>
    <P>We have in this country 12,000,000 acres of fertile, arable soil.  We have a population of only 2,500,000, which gives nearly five acres for every person in the country.  It is agreed by everybody that we should be producing more from the land and that we should have increased agricultural production. A few minutes ago we heard about the collapse in the turkey market.  In my own town of Mullingar yesterday the price of cockerels was between 2/6 and 3/-, and hen turkeys went up to 3/6 a lb.  I am glad for the farmers' wives and for the people who produce these turkeys that that has happened.  When people speak about a collapse in <Col N="1586" /> certain prices, I agree that cattle prices have dropped considerably but it should be remembered that farmers have an agreed price for wheat and for barley, both for pig production and for supplying to the brewers, and also for beet.  I think we should appeal to the farmers to grow all the wheat they can and all the barley necessary for pig production and to try to supply our beet requirements.</P>
    <P>I mentioned this before&mdash;and I think other speakers mentioned it also&mdash;that we could easily grow enough barley in this country to feed 1,000,000 extra pigs, and, even if we had 1,000,000 extra pigs in the country, we would not have the number of pigs we had in the years 1925, 1926 and 1927.  If we had 1,000,000 extra pigs, it would bring in from £18,000,000 to £20,000,000 extra each year and we all know that that would go a long way towards putting our economy on a very firm footing. There is no harm saying that the farmers saved this country in the past. They were in the front line trenches in various wars, social and economic.  I think they have an opportunity now of saving the country again, and if they grew all the wheat, barley and beet we need, they would go a long way towards doing that.</P>
    <P>It is also agreed that we should have increased industrial production and that our industrialists should produce the best.  Too often in the past some of our industrialists&mdash;I will not say all of them&mdash;have tried to get rich quick by producing inferior articles when they were protected by a high tariff wall.  That policy has done harm to a lot of our industries.  While only a small percentage of our industrialists are concerned, at the same time, that small percentage did a lot of harm to this country in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister should try to get our industrialists to produce the best and to export abroad.  If we export material which is up to the standard, we will get a market and sale for it. The people abroad will not buy our goods for sentimental reasons, because it is Irish, because of the colour of our eyes or anything like that.  If there is co-operation all round, we can get on to the export market and produce an <Col N="1587" /> article that will get a ready sale abroad.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy mentioned a matter upon which I intended to speak.  We should have a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign in this country and by that I do not mean a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign around the 17th March for one week of the year but a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign for the 52 weeks of the year.  Every Irish man or woman will admit that every time we buy an imported article when an Irish-made equivalent is available, we add to the financial difficulties of the State.  I think that if everybody understood that, more people would be prepared to buy Irish goods.</P>
    <P>I am a farmer and I heard many farmers recently complaining on account of the protective tariff imposed to help certain industrialists in this country manufacturing tweeds and so on.  I told some of the farmers who complained to me that the farmers in Ireland are the last people who ought to complain because certain Irish industries are protected.  I pointed out to them that this Government was paying over 70/- per barrel for wheat when we could buy it abroad at 50/-.  The farmers should remember that when they are inclined to grumble at times.</P>

The statement is true, and if the Senator looks up the records, he will find it is true.  Our country is a grand little country of which we should all be proud and if everybody did a little more and worked a little harder, there would be no difficulty in solving our present financial problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us should take a lesson from what Germany did over the past few years.  Germany was down and out and her buildings were razed to the ground, but look at how that country has worked since.

      <P>As was, of course, natural, having regard to the survey I made when opening the debate, the members of the Seanad took the opportunity of covering a wide field. I am glad they did so.  We had a debate which varied in its scope and ramifications.  Some Senators dealt with problems that arise in a way which was easy to understand, whether one agreed with it or not.  Others, I am afraid, were to me somewhat less clear and, when I am dealing with some of the points they raised, I hope they will not think I have deliberately misunderstood them if I failed to understand exactly what they were getting at.</P>
      <P>Senator Kissane in opening the debate challenged my statement that we had here an endemic balance of payments problem.  I do not think that there can be any doubt whatever about the matter and if the Senator goes back over the figures and examines them, he will find that I am correct.  We have had, I agree, that endemic position, cloaked and concealed in certain years.  The Senator, I think, made his point for the purpose of showing that the Fianna Fáil Government in, say, 1953 had met the situation that was arising then.  The fact, of course, is that between 1952 and 1953 the international events moved to assist the then Government.  When I was opening the debate, I gave some figures in relation to the terms of trade.  The index based on 1948 of the ratio of export to import prices, as I explained, had come down from 105 in 1953 to 98 in the current year.  That, as I made the case properly, of course, was a factor over which no Irish Government would have any control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we go back to 1952 and 1953, we will find then not a change adverse to ourselves but that there was between those years a change in the international trading situation which was most beneficial to this country and equally a change with which the then Government had nothing whatever to do.  Obviously, no Irish Government could have anything to do with the international position to that extent. <Col N="1589" /> In fact, the index moved in 1952 from 98 up to 105 in 1953.  That meant that there was in that year an improvement in the terms of trade of 7½ per cent. and it also meant that there was an improvement from the point of view of our international trading between 1952 and 1953 of £12.6 million, purely due to the fortuitous benefit improvement in the terms of trade between those two years, just as I explained that there has been a disimprovement&mdash;fortuitous, and again from the outside&mdash;in the first nine months of the year, to the extent of £10,000,000.  Therefore, in considering the situation, the comparison of 1952 to 1953 with 1953 to 1956, we should realise that the difference is a cumulative one and that, therefore, as between the two periods, we face an adverse reaction in the current year of a very substantial amount indeed.</P>
    <P>Following Senator Kissane's opening on that line, we had an indictment by Senator Sheehy Skeffington of a capitalist economy, as he described it&mdash;an indictment of private enterprise, as it was intended to be, I think.  The Senator was rather unfortunate, however, when he was proclaiming the virtues of socialism, in the example he took.  Let me say that I wish to join with Senator Cogan in paying tribute to Senator Sheehy Skeffington, in that at least he has the courage to admit flatly and categorically that he is a full-blooded socialist.  Other people who might like to dabble in those waters might not have that courage.  I need hardly say, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington admits and as stated in the course of this debate, he and I have different views on that subject; but it is at least good to see that people who have strong views are prepared to admit those strong views.</P>
    <P>The Senator, as his argument in favour of socialism, took the example of Sweden and put the case that Sweden's improvement and Sweden's progress was due to its being a socialist State.  It just so happens that I had read last week a review in <i>The Statist</i> of a book which was published on the Swedish economy.  I would commend to the Senator reading that review, which is contained in the December 8th issue of <i>The Statist</i><Col N="1590" /> page 710, and to remember particularly the last sentence, which is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The lesson here is that private enterprise, left to get on with its job unhampered by unnecessary interference and penal taxation, is best for the national economy, its industry, its workers and its shareholders.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In case there might be any doubt that the review was not a true review of the book, I sent to Sweden for it immediately I read the review.  It was delivered to me actually yesterday while the Senator was speaking.  Therefore, I had not the time to digest it all, but there is one table in it which I should like to quote, for the purpose of exploding completely the view that Sweden's progress is due to socialism and that, therefore, because Sweden has progressed, we should have socialism here&mdash;which of course was the argument the Senator was trying to put across to us.</P>
    <P>In Sweden, in their forest industries, 95 per cent. are in private ownership, 3 per cent. are in public ownership and 2 per cent. are in consumer co-operatives. I wonder what our position here is in relation to forestry and how we would compare with those figures. I intend to give the Seanad a good many of them.</P>

Steel making is 93 per cent. private and 7 per cent. public.  I would not be in a position to know what the percentages here are, but we must remember that Haulbowline is in public ownership here and I would imagine that our figures here would show a different trend.  In power, the output in kilowatt hours is 58 per cent. in private ownership and 42 per cent. in public ownership.  Our comparison would look a bit odd by that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is worth mentioning that, because that is an argument I have heard not merely from Senator Sheehy Skeffington before but from others who feel rather on the same line.</P>
      <P>I was criticised&mdash;or rather the Government was criticised&mdash;in certain respects in the debate for a lack of consistency.  Senator Ó Buachalla was one of those who did so.  Senator Kissane also followed somewhat on the same line.  Nothing I said in my survey was new.  I have been saying it for some considerable time.  The only thing which appeared to be new about it was&mdash;and I am grateful to the Senators for it&mdash;that they paid a little more attention to me on this occasion than perhaps they have on other occasions. The fact is that I have been saying this, and my colleagues also have been saying exactly the same thing, for some considerable time.  It is not necessary for me on this occasion to go back over the statements which have been made in that regard, but if there was some sort of suggestion, first, on that consistency line and, secondly, from other speakers that perhaps a policy of that type might be desirable, I think it is right that I should ask Senators on the other side of the House where they stand in relation to consistency in respect of one particular item which is of immense importance in connection with the subject we have been discussing yesterday and to-day.</P>
      <P>Approximately a year ago a proposal was put forward by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Dáil that it was desirable that there should be an expenditure of approximately, in his view, £100,000,000.  The quotation is:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It can be said, however, that if new capital sources to a maximum extent of £100,000,000 were made available over five years for public investment in the development of the national economy....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember in the same speech he had said that &ldquo;this should be financed otherwise than by taxation or by borrowing from current savings.&rdquo;  I should like to know where the consistency is between that statement made by him at that stage and the speeches we have <Col N="1593" /> heard from others yesterday and to-day?  Is it not a fact that it has been put into cold storage because it was realised that it was so inconsistent with the policy of the Opposition in other respects or that perhaps&mdash;I do not know&mdash;the policy of the Opposition in other respects has been pushed back and that policy has been brought to the forefront?</P>
    <P>I do not want anybody to be under any illusion as to what I said in respect of that suggestion which was made officially on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is nothing but a deliberate invitation to inflation which would have disastrous results on the economy. I hope that it will never be operative here.  The only effect it would have would be to swell the balance of payments deficits to an extent which we could never catch up with, to an extent that would bring that ruin and those difficulties upon us to which I referred yesterday, if we were not as a nation to be able to choose the imports that we wanted or if we had to allow others outside to make that choice for us.  It is precisely to avoid that choice having to be made that the Government took steps earlier this year to ensure that our payments will be brought into balance.</P>
    <P>Other Senators took a somewhat similar line.  I must confess I agree with Senator O'Reilly that Senator Hickey is completely sincere in what he said, and, even though I do not agree with somebody who is at least sincere, it is a pleasure to listen to sincerity, but I fail to understand the Senator if his view as expressed did not mean an invitation again to inflation.</P>

He would be doing me a great service if he would make himself clear on that at some future occasion, but I have, I am afraid, failed to follow him in his argument.  Fundamentally, I think what he has suggested&mdash;he did not say it&mdash;is the same as the printing press.</P>

      <P>A change in the par value of a member's currency may be made only on the proposal of the member and only after consultation with the fund.  There are 70 countries in that agreement and most countries, as I say, have fixed arrangements in relation to their currency.  New Zealand was off parity with the British pound and came back to it; Australia is not.  South Africa is, and of course even in relation to British sterling itself, it is fixed at a determined value in relation to the dollar&mdash; 2.80.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator in his suggestion a second ago made the point that he was interested purely in having power to vary the rate of exchange other than by statute.  That is not the case that is normally made in relation to this matter in this country.  It is certainly not the way it is understood in the country.  It is understood in the <Col N="1596" /> country as creating a desire that we would have a fluctuating rate of exchange for the Irish £.</P>
    <P>I think it was very frequently, if not always, understood by people who do not understand the problem as indicating that those who advocate such a change believe that our £ in those circumstances would appreciate in value.  I said previously and I want to repeat now that I do not believe in change for change's sake.  I believe in changing when I see a clear advantage in making any change, but I think that merely to change something for the sake of change is a rather puerile concept.</P>
    <P>I want to know from those who advocate a change in our currency rate of the moment whether they think it desirable in present circumstances to overvalue or to devalue the Irish £ as against British sterling.  Let me make clear where I stand in that respect.  As I said in answer to a question the other day, the Government by reason of the measures it has taken over the past year has shown clearly that it intends to do everything in its power to sustain the value of the Irish £.  We propose to continue that policy.  It is important that that should clearly be understood so that there will not be any lack of confidence on that account.</P>
    <P>While making it clear that that is my view, I think the future discussion on any advocacy of breaking the link would be coupled with an expression of view by the persons who advocate it, as to whether they wish it to go up or to go down.  I believe they have not come to any conclusion at all either way and that they are advocating a change for change's sake rather than because of any inherent belief in the merits of an appreciation or the merits of a devaluation.  I have made my position perfectly clear and beyond question in that respect.</P>

      <P>We have here a certain amount of resources.  Those resources must be developed to the utmost.  The best market for the export of those resources, the largest <Col N="1597" /> market, is that on the other side of the Irish sea.  We must do everything in our power to ensure that, while expanding that market, we obtain other markets as well.  We must realise that, in the ultimate result, our prosperity will depend not on nominal values but on the amount we are able to produce and to produce for export.  I am afraid that, in the past, we have been too slow to realise that point and too prone to think that by strokes of the pen, whether in regard to banking, finance, currency, legislation or other arrangements, we can produce prosperity. We can only produce it by hard work and obtaining more of the material things by our own resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties I shall come to in a minute is the one mentioned by Senator Hartney.  I shall deal with it now, as Senator McHugh has interrupted me.  Senator Hartney seemed to miss the point which is of absolute importance that, in the undoubted restriction that there will be of resources available for development not merely here but in any country, it is essential that those resources be put to real productive use.  If, in the past, they had been put to more productive use then we would not have the emigration of which Senator McHugh speaks.  The only way of stopping the flow of emigration is to put more and more of our capital resources to productive development and less to non-productive purposes. In relation to employment in particular &mdash;and it is vital that this be appreciated &mdash;during the expenditure of capital moneys on non-productive works employment is given and, therefore, there are jobs for the people concerned. However, when that capital expenditure on non-productive work is concluded, there are no jobs for those people and our capital resources have been weakened by the amount that has been expended on that non-productive work&mdash;a worse state of affairs than the first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if we utilise our <Col N="1598" /> resources for productive purposes we shall have, from that utilisation of capital expenditure, not merely employment for those who are building up the development but, after the capital buildup is concluded, there will be a productive asset there that will continue to provide income and employment thereafter.  That is the vital difference which we must appreciate and which must be borne in mind.  In that connection, I want to make quite clear exactly where I stand in relation to programmes of capital development.</P>
    <P>I believe that what we want here is the largest possible programme of productive capital development that the people will sustain.  In that sentence, the emphasis must be on the words &ldquo;productive&rdquo; and &ldquo;sustain.&rdquo;  That is why, because of my belief in the emphasis on the word &ldquo;sustain,&rdquo; I spoke at such length yesterday on the position of our savings and compared them with those in other countries.  In that connection Senator Cogan and also, I think, Senator O'Callaghan, mentioned the question of expenditure on the land project.  The fact is that, in the current year, we shall be expending some £400,000 more than was expended on the land project in 1954-55, approximately the same as was expended last year.  As we all know, this year, in the late spring and early summer, we got much better weather for doing that type of work than we would have in normal years.  In addition, there were some improvements made in administration.  The result was that, because of the weather conditions and the administrative improvements, more work was done in the early part of this year than was done in the early part of other years.</P>
    <P>What has happened is that, as a result of the speeding up of work in the early part of this year, there has been an exhaustion of the amount allocated for the work for the current year.  As Senators are aware, that allocation was recently reinforced again and the reinforcement will enable more work under the land project to proceed in the whole country at the moment.  In relation to that, I want to make it <Col N="1599" /> quite clear that there was no bringing to a close, as one Senator suggested. In fact, the allocation for the land project for the current year at £2,691,000 will be approximately £400,000 more than the similar allocation made by my friends opposite in the last year in which they were in office.</P>
    <P>Senators Douglas and Guinness referred to the effect that this Bill might have in relation to existing firms who had already gone into the export market.  Senator Douglas was rather inclined to think that a tax concession, which he worked out at £1,187 10s. on his own figures, is a very meagre one.  I must confess I take issue with him there at once.  A tax concession of £1,187 10s. on a profit of £5,000 is a pretty big concession.  In fact, if I were in the fortunate position of being able to engage in export industry at the moment instead of being most inadequately paid as a Minister, I would regard that as being a quite useful concession.</P>
    <P>The case made by both Senators was that this was not rewarding the firm who had already gone out and got export markets.  That is true.  There is an element of reward in the provision by virtue of which there is the choice of 1955 or 1956 as the datum year.  But the point of this Bill is not to reward anybody; the point of this Bill is to get increased exports.  It is on that basis, and solely on that basis, the Bill is framed.  If, for example, I were to go back and give a concession in respect of a firm which, shall we say, exported nothing in 1948 and exported £100,000 worth of goods last year, if I were to allow them to choose 1948 as their datum year, and this year they only exported £50,000 worth of goods, they would get a concession, not for increasing their exports in the national need, but for decreasing them.</P>
    <P>That situation might not arise but it seems to me to be wrong to look on the matter on any basis other than that of giving a concession in circumstances when exports are being increased. That is looking at it from the point of view of the national need, not, as I think both Senators looked at it, from the point of view of the reward <Col N="1600" /> for particularly industries concerned.  I certainly pay tribute to their enterprise in going out and getting markets up to this, but I do not think that it would be justifiable in the national interest to deal with that on a system of retrospective reward, which is really what their argument comes to when analysed to rock bottom.</P>
    <P>I may say also that Senators are incorrect when they refer to the necessity for the ploughing back of this amount.  I had originally provided that there would be a plough-back of the concession.  I was anxious, if I possibly could, to retain that.  I had provided it on the basis that there would be a plough-back of the profits that are to be made from excess exports. During the discussion in the other House certain representations were made to me by Córas Tráchtála and others.  It became clear that I had to take a definition for profits which were not going to be the actual profits but would be what we would deem profits for the purpose of covering a case where an exporter was able to get a lower margin of profit in the export market than in the home market.  I felt it would be quite unrealistic that the plough-back should be in respect of not what was a profit but what was deemed to be a profit.  On that account, I had to change that provision during the course of the passage of the Bill through the Dáil and it is no longer in the Bill as it comes before this House.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas also asked about unprocessed gypsum and shell-fish.  As I said in the other House, the position as regards unprocessed gypsum is that it will be considered further and, when that consideration is concluded, the result will be announced as soon as possible.  It is not possible to consider all the ramifications and implications which will arise from this Bill.  As far as shell-fish are concerned, I am afraid it is the shell-fish itself that does the processing rather than the person who exports the shell-fish.  Therefore, it seems to me that Senator Douglas correctly estimated the effect there.</P>
    <P>When making his general review, Senator O'Brien expressed the hope that the levies would be temporary. <Col N="1601" /> He said that if they were not temporary they would lose their sharp effect.  As I explained at the time they were introduced, they had two effects. One was the deterrent effect.  I agree with him that there is this shock effect but there is also a second effect&mdash;that is, that the moneys that are collected by the levies go to that extent towards reducing the deficit financing that was part of the cause of our adverse balance of payments.  In considering the effects of the levies at all, one must consider not merely the deterrent effect but also the effect they have in bridging that deficit.</P>
    <P>I do not think there were any other points raised on the Bill itself.  I think the general view in the House was that, as part of the desire of the Government to increase production and increase exports, the Bill was a desirable one.  Perhaps I should refer to one thing said by Senator Murphy. He seemed to misunderstand what I meant by the differences between an open and closed economy.  It is not at all on the lines that he indicated.  A closed economy is one in which you do not have free movement of materials, that is to say, free imports of the raw materials and the resources that are required to carry on the economy.  We have not got, and could not hope to have, what one might term self-sufficiency in that regard.  Unless we have available within our own economy the resources to meet all modern living requirements and eventualities, we must bring those in and it is because of that and because of the movement of funds that goes with that necessity to bring in imports, if there is a shortage in internal production, because of our lack of resources, that we are an open economy, not because we maintain a parity link with British sterling.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I may add in that respect, that even in present circumstances, I think Egypt maintains parity with British sterling, so that it is not necessarily a sign in the direction that some of the Senators would like me to interpret that link.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered most of the points that were raised.  I am grateful to the House for the manner in which <Col N="1602" /> they accepted the proposals contained in the Bill.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister one question?  He referred to the land project and, if I correctly interpreted what he said, there has been some slowing down recently due, perhaps, to the fact that there was a big expansion of work in the early part of the financial year.  Would the Minister be able to hold out any hope that the allocation to the funds for the land project could be supplemented so as to maintain work at the same rate as in the early part of the year, because it has certainly slowed down?</P>

A sum of £150,000, as well as I remember, was allocated for the land project. That will enable the land project to pick up again where in fact they had gone too fast in the early part of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( ) In this section the words &ldquo;existing coal-mining operation&rdquo; include extensions which are not new coal-mining operations.</P>
      <P>The reason I am raising this is&mdash;of course, it is a small point&mdash;under Section 4 the relief under Section 7 is not given to coal-mining which is merely an extension of any existing operation.  On the other hand, under Section 8 there is a concession to coal-mining which increases its production but that concession is limited to existing coal-mining operations.  It does seem to me that there is a possible gap there.  An existing mine, let us say, extends its present operations.  It would not be entitled to benefit under Section 7.  Again, it might be a mine not registered under Section 8 because it might not be an existing coal-mine actually in operation.  I merely want to draw attention to that possible defect in the two sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the matter is adequately covered.  If the Senator will look at the definition of coal-mining operations in Section 4 he will <Col N="1605" /> find that it is very wide.  In relation to Sections 7 and 8, we did not take the line in this Bill that I took in relation to metallic minerals last year.  If I were following on the line I adopted in relation to metallic minerals, then there would be complete point in the Senator's recommendation.  Here, profits arise from the increased output of existing coal-mines, and that includes extensions.  The Senator can be quite happy that output from existing mines does include extensions.  I presume he means, in his recommendation, existing coal-mining operations to include an extension of coal-mining operations.  He is intending to keep it to coal.  I think that is adequately covered.</P>

      <P>I raised this matter on the Second Stage.  I feel very strongly on the case of individuals working in a small way but doing very valuable work in the export of commodities popular in America and on the Continent generally.  If these people are now compelled under this section to form themselves into a corporate body an additional burden will be put upon them.  There are a number of individuals, singly or in partnership, who are doing a very valuable export trade. I am anxious that the Minister should explain why it is not practicable to permit such people to avail of the advantages this Bill purports to give.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it does, but I am not prepared to say so without notice.  Virtually, all manufacturing of any consequence is done by corporate bodies.  Remember, in relation to this Bill, I have provided that the relief goes to the manufacturer and not to the person who exports.  The exporter does not qualify for relief inasmuch as he is not the person who manufactures and processes the goods.  It is the actual manufacturer who will qualify. There are obvious reasons why that is desirable.  Equally, we can all see the immense administrative difficulty that would be created in relation to Part III if individuals were permitted to obtain concessions under it.  The additional administrative cost would be immense and the benefit spread over the economy as a whole would be very, very small indeed because there is an insignificant percentage of production suitable for export made other than by corporate bodies.</P>

He said the effect of Section 13 in relation to exports and the cognate section in relation to coal mining was to relieve the companies concerned from excess corporation profits tax.  That is not so. It has nothing to do with excess corporation profits at all.  It deals only with profits from excess output of coal or profits from excess exports.  That, of course, is an entirely different thing <Col N="1608" /> from giving the benefits in respect of excess profits.</P>

      <P>I am not quite clear of the advantage there is in sub-section (2) as it stands. It provides that &ldquo;if the building or structure when it comes to be used is not an industrial building or structure...&rdquo; What does the phrase, &ldquo;when it comes to be used,&rdquo; mean? It seems to me that under the section as it stands a company might be liable to refund any benefits or reliefs it had been granted in respect of a building when that building ceased to be used as an industrial structure.  I quite agree it is very difficult to devise the correct wording.  I do not suppose that could be done in the present Bill, but I would ask the Minister to remember it when he comes to introduce the next Finance Bill.</P>

For instance, if allowance were to be given for a building during the course of its erection on the grounds that it was to be used as a factory, and then, when the building was completed, instead of using it as a factory the owners turned it into a cinema, this section enables me to ensure that they do not get a concession for its use as a cinema. Once the first use of the building has been as a factory that governs the whole operation of the section.  The phrase &ldquo;When it comes to be used&rdquo; means the first use to which the building is put.</P>

The effect of Section 22 is to enable me to issue non-interest bearing securities if I wish.  The effect of sub-section (5) enables me to issue Prize Bonds.  I can issue, if I so desire, bonds that are partly interest bearing and partly prize.  However, without sub-section (1) of this section I could not issue bonds that had no interest bearing provision.

    <Title>Industrial Grants Bill, 1956&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is scarcely necessary for me to emphasise the importance which must be attached to the development of industrial production as a means of providing employment and easing the balance of payments position by the production of goods here which would otherwise have to be imported and by contributing to our export potential.  Successive Governments have accepted the need for creating conditions favourable to the expansion of manufacturing activity; these conditions have taken a number of forms including the grant of protection where necessary, the provision of <Col N="1611" /> facilities for securing capital and the provision of information and advice to industrial promoters.  More important, perhaps, than the forms of assistance which I have mentioned is the fact that persons contemplating the establishment of industries here know that if they invest their capital and use their abilities in establishing efficient manufacturing units they can be sure that at all stages of their operations they will enjoy the goodwill and encouragement of whatever Government is in power.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has already been made in the field of industrial development.  But the need for increased employment, reduced dependence on imports and the expansion of exports requires that further steps should be taken to stimulate and if possible speed up the tempo of industrial development.  The Government have therefore decided on certain measures to afford additional incentives for industrial development.  Deputies have recently been considering proposals for tax relief in respect of industrial exports and for industrial buildings and the present Bill is designed to implement the Government's proposals for grants to aid industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill empowers the Industrial Development Authority to make grants of up to two-thirds of the costs of factory buildings and other works required for the establishment of industrial undertakings, subject to a maximum grant of £50,000 in any one case. Before the grant is given the Authority must satisfy itself that the project concerned will be reasonably permanent and is likely to be carried on efficiently and that its establishment will be in the interests of the national economy and is likely to provide substantial employment or to make available substantial quantities of the goods concerned or to provide an opportunity for exports.  I do not think that any promoter of a worthwhile project should have the slightest difficulty in satisfying the Authority under these heads as they are in effect the essential prerequisites for the establishment of a sound industrial <Col N="1612" /> project.  The assistance to be given by the Authority under the Bill will, as I have said, take the form of a grant and once the project has got under way and the grant has been paid the industrialist concerned will be free to manage his affairs in whatever way he thinks best.</P>
    <P>When it was decided to introduce the scheme of industrial grants we were conscious that there might be some fears among existing manufacturers that their position might be worsened by competition in a saturated market from new units established with the help of grant moneys.  While I could not conceive that the Authority would make grants available in such circumstances, nevertheless, I thought it well to have a provision written into the Bill which would allay any fears on the part of existing manufacturers. Accordingly, the Bill provides that when considering applications for grants the Authority shall have regard to the extent to which the requirements of the public in respect of the commodities to be manufactured are sufficiently met by undertakings already established.</P>
    <P>The announcement by the Taoiseach on 5th October of the Government's intention to introduce a scheme for industrial grants indicated that it would be administered in accordance with the accepted policy of decentralisation. The Bill does not contain a specific provision to this effect, but it is my intention when the legislation has been enacted to issue a policy directive in the matter to the Industrial Development Authority.  The directive will be in the sense of the reply given in Dáil Éireann to a question on 25th October, 1956, when it was indicated that the accepted policy of decentralisation of industry is to encourage so far as it is practical to do so the dispersal of industry throughout the country so that areas away from the centres of largest population shall secure industrial projects and thereby share in the employment and other advantages resulting from industrial development.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a maximum aggregate of grants of £2,000,000 for the seven years to the 31st December, <Col N="1613" /> 1963, but I must admit that this estimate may fall wide of the mark as the volume of grants will, of course, depend on the extent to which projects came forward for consideration by the Authority.  I would be very gratified if the estimate should prove to be too low, as I cannot think of a better way of spending money than on industries which will provide permanent employment for our people, reduce our expenditure abroad on the goods which we need and increase our export potential.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not apply to areas to which the Undeveloped Areas Act applies; these areas will continue to enjoy the benefits of that Act.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was before the Dáil fears were expressed in certain quarters that its enactment would have adverse effects on industrial development in the areas covered by the Undeveloped Areas Act.  I am satisfied that these fears are groundless as projects located in these areas will continue to be eligible for the very substantial facilities made available by that Act under which An Foras Tionscal are empowered to make grants up to 100 per cent. of the cost of factory buildings plus 50 per cent. of the cost of plant and machinery plus a grant towards the training of workers.  Compared with these facilities the assistance proposed in the Bill for projects outside these areas is quite modest and will not react adversely on development in the western areas.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, there are certain areas which are in the unfortunate position of being too far west to share in the benefits attaching to location near the large centres of population on the east coast and of being too far east to enjoy the benefits available under the Undeveloped Areas Act.  It is hoped that this new measure will help such areas to secure a share in the benefits to be derived from future industrial development in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there are any other matters arising on the Bill which call for comment by me at this stage and I will conclude by expressing the hope that, as the Bill is one which should commend itself to Senators of <Col N="1614" /> all Parties, it will be given a speedy passage as an agreed measure.</P>

      <P>Tá an Bille seo cosúil leis an mBille eile a ritheadh sa Teach inniu.  Sé an gnó céanna atá iontu araon.  Táimid go léir ar aon aigne idaobh an tír seo do thionscalú chomh tapaidh agus is féidir ach nílimid ar aon aigne i dtaobh conas chur chuige.  Sin í an cheist.  B'fhéidir go bhféadfainn a theasbáint don Aire go bhfuil gnéithe áirithe san mBille seo go bhféadfí iad do locthú ach tá tairbhe san mBille san am gceanna.  Sé tá i gceist an mó an tairbhe atá ann nó an mó an mhí-thairbhe i slite áirithe?</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill could be said to be complementary to the provisions of the Bill which we have just disposed of.  Both, I take it, are designed to stimulate industry in this country, with the view, it is to be hoped, of providing more employment for our people.  The Minister has mentioned certain conditions attaching to the grants for new industries under this measure.  It is, he has said, the Industrial Authority that will administer this measure when it becomes an Act and the Authority must satisfy itself that the project considered will be reasonably permanent and likely to be carried on efficiently and that its establishment will be in the interests of the national economy and likely to provide substantial employment.  I would say that the latter condition is the most important of the whole lot, that is, the provision of employment for our people, but at the same time the other conditions also are important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister stated in his opening remarks, it has been the policy of successive Governments to establish industries here as quickly as possible and to do everything within reason towards that end, but while it is certainly the policy of successive Governments, perhaps there may be a difference in approach.  I must confess that there are certain features of this measure with which I would be inclined to find fault.  First of all, as we have said in connection with the last measure, the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, there is a discrimination, if I <Col N="1615" /> could put it like that, as against existing industries.  I notice that in Section 2 of the Bill, which is the operative and important section, there is not a single reference to existing industries, so that if it happens that any industrialist finds that he is in need of capital to expand his industry and increase the output from that industry, he will get no assistance whatever under this measure.  I do not know if that is the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 2&mdash;is that it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing at the moment with Section 2.  Sub-section (3) states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Authority, in considering applications for grants under this section, shall have regard to the extent to which the requirements of the public in respect of the commodities to be manufactured are sufficiently met by undertakings already established.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That has nothing whatever to do with what I am saying.  That sub-section refers to the danger of a new industry being set up in opposition to an existing industry.  That is what it deals with so far as I can interpret it.  I repeat that there is no provision being made for those people who are already engaged in industrial enterprises and who are in need of capital to expand their business and put it on a sounder financial footing.  I do not know if my interpretation is the same as that of the Minister, but I would like to hear the Minister, on that aspect of the problem.  After all, it is not right, as we said before in connection with the other measure, to place existing industrialists at a disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> newcomers and that is exactly what we are doing if we are not making any provision for them in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, the Minister referred to the Undeveloped Areas Act and he gave us an assurance, or something in the nature of an assurance, that this measure would not cut across the operation of the Undeveloped Areas Act.  The question is whether the Minister is in a position to give us that <Col N="1616" /> assurance because, if a prospective industrialist comes in here to start an industry and finds that he will get almost the same benefits from the State when he establishes the industry in any part of the country&mdash;in some part of the country nearer to the big centres of population&mdash;as he would get if he established it in the undeveloped areas, where is he going to put it?</P>
    <P>The whole object of the Undeveloped Areas Act was to compensate intending industrialists for the disadvantage they would suffer by going to the far-off, isolated parts of the country in the West of Ireland and along the western seaboard to establish their industries. No matter what the Minister says and no matter what assurance he gives us, I think that the effect of this Bill will be to negative to a great extent the operation of the Undeveloped Areas Act.  I am not one who would say that there have been very spectacular developments under the Undeveloped Areas Act, but at the same time good progress has been made and I am afraid that, despite any statement to the contrary, a lot of that good work will be halted.</P>
    <P>I remember, when the Undeveloped Areas Bill was passing through this House, some of us referred to the Gaeltacht because we realised that giving economic assistance to the Gaeltacht was a problem that should be considered by the Government, too.  The Minister of that time admitted that the Gaeltacht was a problem in itself, but that it was not being specifically catered for under the Undeveloped Areas Act; that the Undeveloped Areas Act applied to the congested districts of the country.  Now we are opening up the field throughout the whole country and we are, as it were, declaring the whole country to be a distressed area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator hardly believes all that himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we are doing, because otherwise it would not be necessary for the State to give financial assistance to intending industrialists. I mentioned the conditions under which it is proposed to give <Col N="1617" /> those free grants and it is well to remember that in this case they are free grants&mdash;free unrepayable grants, every penny.  Industrialists coming in here and establishing industries outside the undeveloped areas will get up to two-thirds of the cost of buildings and works to a maximum of £50,000.  I submit that £50,000 is a hefty sum and any industrialist who gets up to £50,000 towards the establishment of an industry would not be inclined to go into the undeveloped areas of the country, to the far-off places for which the Undeveloped Areas Act caters.</P>
      <P>As somebody said in the Dáil, it was not necessary at all to bring in a measure like this because there is provision already in the Undeveloped Areas Act, under Section 3, to extend the area, so I do not know why the Minister considered it necessary to bring in separate legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in concluding his statement, gave us to understand that, despite the fact that there is nothing in this Bill to ensure that its provisions would not prejudice the operation of the Undeveloped Areas Act, he would issue a directive to industrialists coming in here.  I do not know what force will be behind that directive. Those people need not accept it and if they do not accept the Minister's directive, will they still qualify under this Bill for the rather generous grants that will be given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I correct the Senator?  The directive will be given to the members of the Industrial Development Authority who will be administering the grants and not to the industrialists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The directive would be given to the Industrial Development Authority for the purpose of telling them that they are not to give <Col N="1618" /> grants in respect of already cluttered up areas from an industrial point of view and in administering the grants, therefore, they will have regard to where the industry is located.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>We will leave it.  There is a lot of speculation, I must say, about these things.  There is an old proverb in Irish which says: Tar éis a tuigtear gach beart&mdash;it is afterwards that everything is found out.  I think it is after this measure has been in operation for some time, we shall find out exactly what the position is.  I hope we will be all in a position to have another look at it.  We all subscribe to the policy of industrialisation and in doing so we must be prepared to spend a certain amount of the money of the State towards promoting that policy.  I do not know whether the idea of grants is the better one, especially for would-be industrialists who will not be under the disadvantage of going to the far off parts of the country.</P>
      <P>As was advocated in the other measure by certain members of the Dáil at the time, if the policy of giving loans was regarded as the better one for the undeveloped areas surely it should be regarded as the better one for the other areas?  Here we are proposing to give grants free, gratis and for nothing, up to £50,000 towards the establishment of the industries envisaged in this Bill.  I do not know if it is the best method but I suppose the Minister and the Government have given that some consideration.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I for one shall be glad if the results the Minister has in mind flow from this measure.  If the beneficial results which he thinks are likely to flow from this measure are realised, we shall all be glad.  We all realise that while agriculture must get the primary place in our consideration, it is necessary also to expand the industrial arm of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on this Bill.  It is a <Col N="1619" /> necessary thing if the country is to get new industries and capital has to be found.  One of the great difficulties is to find capital.  The Minister has acted very wisely in introducing the present measure.  What has been done in the undeveloped areas has been quite successful and the Minister is very wise in extending the experiment.</P>
      <P>No mention has been made so far of one part of the Bill, the Schedule, which deals with the setting up of the Industrial Development Authority as a corporate body.  I should like, if I might be permitted, as one who had a good many dealings with the Industrial Development Authority, to express a sense of the very admirable way in which those who constitute that body have carried out their work.  I think the country and the various Ministers who have been in office have been very lucky to have had their assistance.  The experiment of setting up such a body has proved to be an extremely wise one.</P>
      <P>As regards the provisions of the Bill itself, reference has been made to Section 2 (3) by the Minister.  He has explained that protection is given by the sub-section against a prejudicial use to existing industries.  I do not know whether the Minister would be prepared to consider, instead of the words &ldquo;sufficiently met&rdquo; some word such as &ldquo;sufficiently already met or capable of being met by existing industries&rdquo;.  There are certain industries which have been getting up on their feet and which might not sufficiently answer the needs of the country already, but in these cases it would be rather unfair to set up by public money a competing industry.  Therefore, the Minister might consider whether the scope of that direction to the Industrial Development Authority goes quite far enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Finance Bill I referred to the very strong feeling I have that the Control of Manufactures Acts are impending the industrial development of the country.  As it is rather relevant to the matters in this Bill, I think one should refer to this again.  It may perhaps be very undesirable, but in fact most of the new industries which <Col N="1620" /> are set up in this country, in my experience, come very often through an initiative from abroad.  I have had personal experience again and again of how much outside people, who might be attracted to this country for various reasons to set up industries here, are deterred by the provisions of these Acts, even though there are many ways of complying with them.</P>
    <P>I think the Control of Manufactures Acts have never achieved the objects for which they were introduced, that is, the strengthening of the Irish element in industry, but have resulted in introducing a great deal of sham into a great many companies and, to my mind, quite certainly have interfered to a considerable extent with the setting up or bringing to this country of new industries.  I know that the Minister has met this to some extent by a more effective policy in the granting of new manufacture licences, but I think it is a thing which has kept on doing injury to the development of industry here.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the necessity to spread industries in the country.  I fully appreciate and agree with that, but one should remember that this is a very small country.  It is probably only about the size of a county in an American State.  It is quite possible that, while trying to bring life to every part of the country, one may be defeating one's own object. I have often felt that if this country had had a more fortunate history and could have developed as an independent country over the centuries, the natural centre for the country would have been along the Shannon, with its great navigation.  I am not at all sure that sooner or later there should not be a certain amount of industrial planning, not merely to try to help one small industry in each town but rather to build up semi-industrial areas, possibly towards the centre of the country.  It seems to me that the present geographical set-up of the country indicates completely an historical development in which we were dependent entirely on England for the east coast development and the west coast remained entirely undeveloped. The remedy there probably is to try to <Col N="1621" /> move things a little more towards the centre.  It is quite right to try to spread industry, but it would be a mistake to try to spread it too much and perhaps it may become ineffective and inefficient in that way.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I think the policy adopted by the Minister is the right one.  There is no doubt that these new industries, under existing circumstances, require help to obtain their capital.  I think that the policy he is suggesting of outright grants is probably the wisest way to meet the difficulty.  It does seem queer at first sight that a country should make a present of a large sum of money to people who are setting up plainly for their own benefit but the fact remains that unless there is a considerable stimulus to industrial development it will not occur in the shape in which we want it.  The Minister is quite right in selecting this form of injection.  The Bill provides that grants are to be made under conditions which the Industrial Development Authority would approve.</P>
    <P>It has always seemed to me that there is one thing possible in the case of these grants which we should guard against and that is what I might call quick realisation.  Supposing people come in with £30,000 or £40,000 capital and get a grant of say £50,000, just start an industry and then sell out in a very short time, they might get away with something worth getting away with, but the fact would still remain that the Minister would have succeeded in his object of having put there an industry that had not been there before.  I think it is worth while running these risks, but I think the Industrial Development Authority would need power to impose certain conditions which would enable them to give safeguards in those respects.  I should like to support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other Senators in congratulating the Minister on introducing the Bill.  The Bills which we dealt with yesterday and to-day were foreshadowed in the Taoiseach's speech of October 6th when he disclosed the Government's <Col N="1622" /> positive policy for dealing with our economic conditions.  I should like the Minister, as suggested by Senator Kissane, to elucidate Section 2&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the whole section.  I shall deal with it later.  When it became known that grants would be made for industry I approached a progressive young industrialist and asked him what would be the possibilities of exporting to Britain the products which he was manufacturing.  This industry was established originally for the purpose of supplying an article or articles which were imported.  He caused a survey to be made of market conditions in Britain and of the prices at which these products were sold in Britain.  He has since informed me that it would appear to him that a remunerative market could be established for these products.  He did stress the fact that freight would probably be one of the deterrents but I shall refer to that problem later.</P>
      <P>His suggestion to me is that there should be a large extension of the factory and that it be used for the export of these goods.  He further informs me it would have the effect of allowing them to reduce the price of goods for the home market because the output of the factory would be larger and more efficient machinery would be capable of being used economically for a proposed output of twice the present magnitude.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to tell me, can grants be made in that very desirable way?  This industry is established and can demonstrate to the Industrial Development Authority that it can produce goods that are at least equal to the quality of goods produced in Britain and in other markets to which it is proposed to export.  The industry is owned exclusively by Irish nationals and they have the technical know-how to produce these goods.  I give that example because I know of it in a practical way and I know it from the facts.  I am not stating a hypothetical case and I think it would be wholly desirable if extensions of that type of industry were encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1623" /> Frequently, when industries were started, capital was raised and, perhaps, the industries had not the technical know-how.  They changed ownership and there were years of disappointment, sometimes even financial loss, on the investment of other people's capital as well.  This Bill envisages grants of up to only two-thirds of the cost and I presume it would only be in the extreme case that the Industrial Development Authority would be so generous as to give two-thirds. I imagine in most cases it would be one-third or 50 per cent. that would be given and that the other half or two-thirds of the capital would have to be raised here.</P>
    <P>Those who have shown they are able to produce goods for the home market up to standards that this exacting market requires, are the people who are likely to get private capital to put down, pound for pound, for the grants that will be given by the Minister.  I think the Minister was right in taking power to give a directive to the Industrial Development Authority with regard (1) to decentralisation of industry and (2) to location.</P>
    <P>One of the disadvantages which an island country like ours will always have to contend with&mdash;pushed, as we are, out in the Atlantic, away from the Continent of Europe&mdash;is the cost of transport, the cost of bringing in materials and sending them out. Therefore, the location of factories must be considered by the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    <P>Recently a very interesting example of the efficient and intelligent use of shipping came to light.  The Clyde Shipping Company in Waterford found that owing to the location of the port it was possible to use one of their steamers to go to Liverpool early in the week and then to go to Dieppe with cattle in the latter part of the week.  I have been informed that the ship would not be able to do that turnround from any port in the country other than Waterford.  That shows the importance of location and Senator Cox did raise a very important point when he stressed that.  The location will also depend on the type of goods being manufactured.  As Senator <Col N="1624" /> Hartney said on a previous Bill, if we were to export whiskey it might be possible to fly it out, but we might also be exporting something which would require the chartering, building or provision of shipping to allow that industry to succeed.  When the goods are manufactured, they must be moved out of this island to suitable markets.</P>
    <P>A very interesting survey of the effect of transport and location on industry was dealt with very extensively in the <i>Economist</i> on the first week of October of this year under the heading &ldquo;John Bull's Model Island.&rdquo; The group who wrote the series of articles on this economy, which is very similar and complementary to ours, stressed the necessity for the development of efficient shipping facilities. They said that one of the greatest disadvantages to the Northern economy, closely allied as it is to Britain, is the cost of the transport of materials from Britain to the North where they are manufactured and then their re-export. Anything that can be done to facilitate the economic handling of the goods which we propose to export at the point of export from our country and at the point of import into the country to which we are sending them will, in the long run, greatly help us and assure the continuance of the types of industries which are being suggested under this Bill.</P>
    <P>This is a short Bill and I think it would be wrong to speak at length on it.  I would again ask the Minister if there is not power to make grants to existing establishments&mdash;line 24, Section 2.</P>
    <P>It is not clear to me whether or not it is possible or whether an extension of the Bill would be warranted to assist in giving money to these people. If some well-established industries here can demonstrate to the public that they can make a success of it, I feel they will create a climate for industries here.  If they are able to get the money, then others will follow their example because it will be shown that it is a good thing to invest in Irish Industry and that the Irish are able to export to the world markets. It would be a boost to the morale so far as exports are concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1625" /> I congratulate the Minister on introducing this measure.  As a person engaged in industry myself, I think the grants are very generous.  This Bill shows the wide compass of the Minister's mind.  He realises that there may be cases where it is necessary in this economy to establish industries and he is even prepared, if the Industrial Development Authority so decide, to make grants up to two-thirds of the cost of the provision of the factory buildings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Senator Cox in asking the Minister to satisfy himself that the Bill as set out will not prejudice existing manufacturers in any way and that they will be able to derive the same benefits under the Bill as those to which a new industry would be entitled.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Senator Cox, however, that industries should be confined to the larger areas.  I feel that industries should be more equitably distributed throughout the country. To some extent, industry is complementary to agriculture.  Some of the members of families from small farm holdings who work in these industries in the towns and villages help to supplement the family income and therefore enable parents to rear families and maintain themselves on uneconomic holdings.</P>
      <P>I live in a small village in a congested area.  It is an industrial village. Were it not that there are industries in that village, I am satisfied that quite a number of the people living on smallholdings would not be able to maintain themselves and that the holdings would be left derelict and would possibly be used only for afforestation purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of this Bill is to secure industrial expansion outside the undeveloped areas.  I feel that the Bill will injure the prospects of the further development of industry in the undeveloped areas, as such.  I would refer the House to a statement which the Minister made in 1951 when the Undeveloped Areas Bill was being discussed.  As reported at column 900 of Volume 128 of the Official Debates of <Col N="1626" /> Dáil Éireann, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will be extremely difficult to induce the ordinary private person to establish industries in the West even with the facilities provided in this particular section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On 12th December of this year, when this Bill was under discussion in the Dáil, the Minister said, as reported at column 2230 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If you could get the same facilities for establishing an industry in Meath or County Dublin as you would by establishing it in Donegal or Connemara, it is quite clear nobody would go to Donegal or Connemara; they would all clamour around the capital of the country and draw the same benefits there ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that possibly up to 90 per cent. of our existing industries are concentrated in or around Dublin, it is obvious that Dublin has tremendous advantages.  People running industries in rural districts far removed from the capital and far removed from large centres of population have to pay a substantial freight on the importation of the raw material and on the transportation of the finished article.  They require warehouses and agents.  They have not contact with the buyers which industrialists in or around Dublin have and definitely they are at a tremendous disadvantage.</P>
    <P>People have suggested that the grants under the Undeveloped Areas Act were generous.  They were.  Nevertheless, there is still an unexpended sum of approximately £750,000 in that fund.  This Bill reduces the advantages of a building grant by two-thirds for those people who now propose to erect or to take up an industry in the undeveloped areas.  Obviously, if the grant for a building in the undeveloped areas were 100 per cent., and if one can now get a grant of up to 66? per cent. for the erection of a building in an area other than an undeveloped area, then the advantage has been reduced by the amount which I have stated.</P>
    <P>Apart from the blow which this Bill will inflict on potential industries in the undeveloped areas, it will also prove a considerable disadvantage even to proposed industrialists in rural <Col N="1627" /> Ireland in general.  The tendency is to come as near as possible to the city. The Minister suggests he proposes to issue policy directives to the Industrial Development Authority to encourage industrialists to go further out.  That is indicative of the fact that it is anticipated that the industrialists will naturally come as near to the port and as near to the population centre as possible.  I wonder why the Minister does not include that policy directive in the Bill.  I do not know what authority he will have for issuing a policy directive when the Bill is passed.  Even if that is his idea&mdash;and I am quite sure it is&mdash;there is no guarantee that another Minister in some other Government will not discontinue the policy which the Minister has suggested.  I feel it would be a desirable thing if the idea which he suggests could be incorporated in the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>It is not right to exclude the undeveloped areas from this Bill.  I appreciate that the undeveloped areas have advantages at the moment, but if there is only £750,000 left in the kitty at the moment, what will happen when that sum is exhausted?  There is no guarantee that further moneys will be voted by the Oireachtas to provide for any further demands from those areas. There will be £2,000,000 available for the country generally.  The Minister has already stated positively that the Act will terminate in 1958.  Therefore, unless a new Bill is enacted in the meantime, it will mean that those areas will be excluded from any grant whilst other areas will be allowed benefit until 1961.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting the Minister put it in.  I am trying to be constructive in any criticism I have.  I feel the undeveloped areas will <Col N="1628" /> definitely suffer when this Bill has been passed.  The reduction in population in the congested areas is still proportionately much greater than in the rest of the country.  I would refer the Minister to the fact that the reduction in population in Connacht, Donegal, Clare and Kerry, according to the last census, amounted to 44,399 out of a total reduction of population in the country of 65,771. Therefore, over two-thirds of the reduction in population has taken place in the areas which the Undeveloped Areas Act was supposed to help.</P>
      <P>For that reason, I believe it is vital and essential for the national economy that every effort possible should continue to be made to allow the people in those areas to maintain themselves; otherwise, whole areas may be denuded of their population in a very short space of time.  Undoubtedly, Dublin and its suburbs have a tremendous attraction not alone for industrialists but for people, for instance, who retire from business and professional posts.  If the industrialists in these large centres are now to benefit to the extent proposed under this Bill, the position may be aggravated and the whole economy may consequently suffer.</P>
      <P>I feel the farming class is still a depressed class.  Their income is going down because their produce which has been exported to Britain has obtained a lesser amount, while the prices of the commodities which they have to purchase are steadily rising.  Therefore, it is natural that a great number of the small farmer class have emigrated and they are continuing to emigrate and take up very hard work in public works in Scotland and England.  Were it not for the work which these workers from Connemara, Donegal, Kerry and Mayo are doing in Great Britain it would not have been possible, perhaps, for that country to achieve the progress it has in hydro-electric schemes and other spheres.  When there is such a demand for that type of labour in Great Britain, I believe those men would be very suitable for employment in their own area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of people have suggested that at the moment industries find it <Col N="1629" /> difficult to get sufficient capital to expand their business because of the credit squeeze and the rate of interest. They say that industries are feeling the pinch at a time when the population is decreasing.  I feel that, if this £2,000,000 was partly spent in the provision of loans to companies for extending their industries or making them more efficient, even if these loans were provided at a reasonably low rate of interest and the money spread over a greater number of industries, ultimately a much better return would be secured by the community.  I am aware that grants such as contained in this Bill are fairly common in the Six Counties and that a large number of industries have come from Great Britain and established themselves there.  The advantages which these industries have there are greater than those provided in this State, because of the fact that, apart from anything else, they do not have to pay rates for a number of years.  Many of those industries are very successful there.</P>
    <P>If this Bill enables or encourages people to come in here and establish further industries&mdash;industries which our own people could not establish because of a lack of capital or technical knowledge&mdash;I trust it will be successful; but, as I said our areas will undoubtedly suffer unduly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with one thing Senator Cox said, that is, that it might seem funny to introduce a Bill for the purpose of giving money grants to people to persuade them to come and manufacture and put money into their own pockets.  It does seem funny.  My reaction to this Bill is that it is a surprising Bill.  Frankly, in the present context, in which we are all told about the necessity for saving, tightening our belts and practising austerity, I find it very strange for the Government to come along and say: &ldquo;Now, I would like you to give £2,000,000 in grants to new industrialists who are not yet in production.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to this question of new industries; in our economy, I think a normal question, if a new industry is <Col N="1630" /> to be set up, is: Will it be viable; will it be able to run itself at a profit; will it be able to continue?  Of course, the Minister has reserved the right in this Bill to ask that question before such grants are made; to ask the question, in other words, whether such a new industry would be an economic proposition? If the answer is &ldquo;Yes, such a new industry will be demonstrably an economic proposition,&rdquo; I would be inclined to ask the further question; why does the ordinary process of supply and demand of credit not function?  If this new industry will satisfy the demand for a product either at home or abroad, if the industry in question is needed, if such a new factory is needed, if clearly a profit is to be made out of it&mdash;if, in other words, it is a sound proposition, as the Minister tells us he will assure himself before he gives any grants&mdash;then, why cannot such an industrialist go to the banks and get all the money he wants on the ordinary moneylending terms? Because, as I understand the system in which we exist, it is possible to borrow money from the banks for demonstrably sound undertakings, be they new or already in existence.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, such industries are not demonstrably sound, if they are unsound, why should the State give grants?  Why should we be asked to step in where bankers fear to tread?</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it is quite possible&mdash;I think it is arguable, and the Minister may make the point&mdash;that banks may not be prepared to lend money, even if it is a sound proposition. Is that really true?  Are we in this country in a position where the banks would refuse to lend new industries money, even when the proposition is demonstrably sound and would be in the national interest?  I should like to hear the Minister's answer to that question.</P>
    <P>Is that the situation, that where a new industry is demonstrably a sound economic proposition that would be to the national benefit, our private banks will not lend the money?  I think the Minister might in that case explain to us just what is wrong with the system. Why does it break down in this way? <Col N="1631" /> If we have a perfectly good proposition, economically sound, why do not the ordinary economic forces come into play?  Why does the State have to step in?</P>
    <P>Is it that the banks could only lend such money at interest rates which would be, owing to Government policy, too high, because I think it is legitimate to say that Government policy has put the interest rates up?  Is it that the banks could not lend the money at interest rates which would be sufficiently low, or is it, as in the case when a bank is asked to lend money to a farmer, that too great caution is practised by the banks in lending money for new undertakings. It is well-known that a farmer, in order to borrow money from the bank, must prove absolutely that he does not need it.  Otherwise, he will not get it.</P>
    <P>Is it one of these two reasons that might lead a bank, in the case of new industries, not to lend the money&mdash; either that the interest rate will have to be too high, owing to Government policy, or that the banks will have to exercise too great caution in lending to new undertakings, owing, again, to Government policy of the credit squeeze, the cutting down of credit, the greater reluctance of the banks to issue credit?</P>
    <P>However that may be, it seems to me that, since the private banking system apparently cannot or will not make sufficient credits available, the Government is asking, by the terms of this Bill, to be allowed to step in and find £2,000,000 to lend or give away. I do not know whether it will be lent or not.  Other speakers have suggested that these were outright grants, but Section 2 (1) says that &ldquo;the authority may on such terms as they think fit make grants&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;on such terms&rdquo;. Frankly, I do not know whether that includes the payment of interest, or the eventual repayment of the grant. I do not know whether it is an outright grant, an interest-free loan or what it is, but, at any rate, we are asked to permit the Government to step in through the medium of the Authority and find £2,000,000 to give or to lend to these new industrialists with less <Col N="1632" /> precautions and at more favourable interest rates, if there are any interest rates at all, than the private banks find it possible to do, under the present credit squeeze conditions.</P>
    <P>Although, in a few weeks' time, the profits of these banks over the past year, I am prepared to hazard a guess, will be found to have been enhanced by this credit squeeze policy of the Government, nevertheless they &ldquo;cannot find&rdquo; the necessary money, and so the Government will step in, and is asking us to allow them to do so, in order to counteract the Government's credit squeeze policy.</P>
    <P>I find that puzzling.  Senator Cox has suggested that some of us might find this Bill rather funny.  If it were not so serious a matter, I would say that it is funny to see the Government asking to be allowed to lend money which is not otherwise made available to such people&mdash;presumably they are reputable people with sound economic propositions to put forward&mdash;by the ordinary banks, apparently owing to Government policy on the credit squeeze.  So, the Government will pledge its credit and thus try to counteract the effects of the Government credit squeeze policy; and £2,000,000 are being asked for to start with, £2,000,000 of what I should call easy money.</P>
    <P>I am sorry, in a way, that the Minister for Finance is not here to explain to us how this will be done without inflationary tendencies, because I am quite confident that, if Senator Hickey were to propose that £2,000,000 were to be made available in this way, he would be warned that, of course, he was merely printing bank notes, and that the effect of this would be inflationary.</P>
    <P>I should like to know why the injection of this fresh £2,000,000 of credit, which cannot be found in the ordinary capitalist banking system, will not, in effect, be inflationary, and I should like to ask where will this money come from. We were told in relation to pensions for civil servants, the other day, that £140,000 was an absolute maximum. We were told in relation to voluntary health insurance that £50,000, all of which would have to be repaid, was an <Col N="1633" /> absolute maximum.  We shall be told presently to-day, I think, in relation to I.R.A. and Army pensions that only about £40,000 is available, that there is no money there.  But, for new industrialists, people who are not yet in business, people who have not yet got their factories on the ground, we will be able to find, not £140,000, but £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>If this money which the Minister is asking for, and which the Government is prepared to put up, were to be devoted, as certain Senators have suggested, to the undeveloped areas, for further development there of industries, I would feel perhaps a little less reluctant.  If it were to be devoted to education and the building of schools, along the lines you find in relation to secondary schools in the North of Ireland getting two-thirds of the cost of building from the Government just as we are to give two-thirds of the cost of building up to a certain maximum, to the builder of a new factory, I certainly would not grudge it.  Or, if it were to be given to agriculture, as certain Senators have suggested, for, say, parish tractor and reaper and binder stations, or if it were made available to subsidise cheaper fertilisers&mdash;I see to-day that the price of superphosphates, so far from being subsidised, will go up&mdash;or, even if these millions were to be given to existing industries which are temporarily feeling the effects of the credit squeeze, and of the import levies on a whole host of commodities and certain raw materials, it would be more understandable.  But, in spite of all that, the Minister says that he &ldquo;cannot think of a better way&rdquo; of spending State funds than to give it to new industrialists.  I hope that we in the Seanad can think of a few better ways.  Several people have already told the Minister several better ways of spending this proposed £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>These £2,000,000 then are not for education, not for schools or education and not for agriculture.  They are not for existing hard-hit industries.  They are for new industries, the real need for which is so very much open to doubt that the private banks will not <Col N="1634" /> risk their money to back private enterprise in establishing them.  And, so, as usual in this country, the State, when there is going to be a risk, is asked to step in and help foot the private industrialists' bill without, apparently, having as a result of this grant any lien on the company, or any proprietory rights in relation to the new factory.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I find myself totally against the principal of this Bill.  This Bill does not represent State planning for the community welfare but State moneylending, or money-giving, because as I say, we have not yet understood whether it is to be simply moneylending or money-giving.  It represents State money-giving, shall we say, for enfeebled industrialists whose moral fibre has apparently already been so far sapped, whose desire for individual effort has been so far supplanted, and whose spirit of self-reliance has become so enfeebled that they are no longer able even to stand on their own feet.  This represents a system of State doles, in other words, for severely weakened industrialists of apparently very limited business initiative and business capacity.  Admittedly, these doles are a mere matter of £50,000 to each new industrialist&mdash;a bagatelle.  In actual fact, £50,000 is not too bad, even if you say it quickly.  Three such individual grants would have been enough to double the Civil Service pension increases we gave last week.  They only amounted to £140,000.  Three such industrialists together will get £150,000 as a gift.  Just one such grant of £50,000 would cover, and more than cover, the entire anticipated grant for Army and I.R.A. pensions, on which there will be a further talk this afternoon.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I am opposed to this Bill.  If, however, the Bill is passed, I would suggest to the Seanad that we ought quite radically to cut down the amount made available in this way. Let us limit it to a more reasonable sum.  Let us say we will put up £250,000 for the present.  I would suggest that far better purposes could be found for the £1,750,000 thus saved and, with that in mind and those purposes, <Col N="1635" /> I intend to put down an amendment to that effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from an undeveloped area, one of the first to avail of the opportunities provided by the 1951 Act, and one of the first to set up a local industry under that Act. I do not believe for one moment that this Bill, when it becomes law, will in any way interfere with the benefits that the 1951 Act was designed to confer. This Bill, as the Minister pointed out, is a dual purpose Bill.  Its object is to increase our export trade and to help in the manufacture at home of articles and commodities now imported, thereby reducing the balance of payments. Its second purpose is to relieve unemployment.</P>
      <P>Now in the developed areas, as well as in the undeveloped areas, numbers of people are unemployed for whom some provision must be made.  If it is the function of Government to provide employment in the undeveloped areas, I do not see how they can shirk that function in relation to unemployment in the developed areas.  The conditions of the unemployed in the areas which will be covered by this Bill are more rigorous and more difficult than the conditions of the unemployed in the undeveloped areas.</P>
      <P>I do not believe for a moment that this Bill will in any way nullify the effects of the 1951 Act.  I cannot understand the criticism that this Bill is an effort to sabotage the Undeveloped Areas Act passed in 1951.  It was stated in the Dáil that the Government were introducing this Bill because they were jealous of the success of the Undeveloped Areas Act.  They have no reason to be jealous.  Even though the Undeveloped Areas Act was passed by the late Government, the inter-Party Government have utilised it to a greater extent since they came into office.  That can be proved from the figures available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 1952 to June, 1954, a sum of £69,000 was paid in grants to people setting up industries approved by Foras Tionscal in the undeveloped areas.  From 1954 to 1956 £232,000, or over, was paid by the inter-Party <Col N="1636" /> Government by way of grant to people setting up industries in the undeveloped areas.  In so far as approval of new industries is concerned, whereas the figure from 1952 to 1954 was £373,000, the figure for 1954 to 1956&mdash;that is, under the present inter-Party Government&mdash;is £800,000 in relation to industries approved by Foras Tionscal.  I submit, therefore, that instead of being jealous of the success of the Undeveloped Areas Act, the Government have every reason to be proud of the manner in which they have operated it.</P>
    <P>It has been stated here to-day, and it was also stated in the Dáil, that there was no need for this Bill, that it would be possible to amend the Undeveloped Areas Act to cover the object for which this Bill is intended. I do not think that is so.  I believe if the Government did approach this work by way of an amendment of the Undeveloped Areas Act, they could reasonably be accused of endeavouring to interfere with the success of that Act.  I hold that any persons interested in the setting up of an industry have far more attractive terms to avail of when they decide to set up that industry in the undeveloped areas rather than in the areas for which this Bill provides.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out to-day, the maximum grant that can be given for the setting up of new industries in areas which this Bill covers is £50,000, whereas, under the Undeveloped Areas Act, grants of up to 100 per cent. of the cost of erecting a factory, 50 per cent. of the cost of the machinery and a grant to train operatives can be voted.  Therefore, I hold that as far as the attractiveness of the respective measures is concerned, there is no comparison.</P>
    <P>I do know that a certain amount of criticism has been directed at the manner in which the Industrial Development Authority approaches the consideration of applications for new industries.  As I stated at the outset, I was in a small way connected with a successful effort made in 1951 to avail of the Undeveloped Areas Act to bring an industry to my native town. Once the project was mooted, it was <Col N="1637" /> enthusiastically received.  I can assure the House, however, that enthusiasm is not quite enough.  The effects of this legislation must be backed up by something in the nature of local effort. Were it not possible in that town for the Town Improvements Committee to make available a sum of £3,000 for the purpose of developing a site selected by the people who came to set up the industry, I do not suppose the town would have got the industry.  Whether the industry has developed the area to the extent that was anticipated, I do not know, but it has provided employment for about 40 people who might otherwise have to emigrate.  I think this Bill is a good one and I do not imagine for one moment that it will in any way interfere with legislation of a similar kind passed for the benefit of the undeveloped areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>By introducing this Bill, the Minister has paid a very high tribute to his predecessor and to the Fianna Fáil Government inasmuch as he has copied the Act introduced by them for the establishment of industry in the undeveloped areas.  Imitation is, I suppose, the very best form of praise. There is a very exact imitation in this Bill of the Undeveloped Areas Act. The only fear is, as has been expressed by a number of Senators, that in extending the advantages of the Undeveloped Areas Act to the whole of Ireland, as this Bill does to a considerable extent, we may injure those areas.</P>
      <P>The Undeveloped Areas Act sought to tilt the scale very heavily in favour of the western counties.  The margin of incentive that was offered in that Act has been considerably reduced by the introduction of this measure.  When the time comes to introduce legislation for the continuance of the Undeveloped Areas Act, I hope the Minister will see fit to improve somewhat further the concessions provided under that measure.  In that way, the incentive in favour of the west would be maintained to a certain extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anyone could oppose a measure of this kind.  It certainly gives incentives to increase production and to increase employment in protected industries.  I can never follow&mdash; perhaps because I am not intelligent <Col N="1638" /> enough or intellectual enough&mdash;arguments made by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  His arguments to-day appeared to be based entirely on pure theory, far removed from reality.  You do not cause inflation, as far as I know, by injecting more money into production, provided that the injection of more money does actually lead to more production and that markets are found for that production, particularly external markets.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington said he could see no justification whatever for giving assistance to productive industries here, particularly when they are owned and managed by private enterprise.  He even went so far as to suggest that the money would be better spent on increasing pensions and salaries, or even on the dole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned neither the dole nor salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffingtion certainly did mention the dole in this respect: he described the concessions provided in this measure as a dole to industrialists.  He may not have mentioned salaries and I accept his correction in that respect. He did mention pensions.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington asked what case there was for giving State assistance of this kind; he asked why the State should step in here to assist industry. The reason why the State stepped in through the Undeveloped Areas Act was in order that the scale might be tilted in favour of these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a sense, we are extending that principle to the whole of Ireland under this measure.  If one compared this country with Great Britain, one must admit that the whole of this country is an undeveloped area.  It is necessary to tilt the scale in favour of this country as against others because it is not always possible to protect industrial development here by tariffs or other such methods.  As we are seeking to cater for the British market, our industries cannot be protected to any great extent by tariffs. If an inducement is offered to industrialists such as is offered in this Bill, in order that industrialists may produce goods for export, I think that is <Col N="1639" /> a good thing.  If such inducement were not offered, the same financial interests might decide to set up their industries outside this country.  As somebody said earlier, we are operating an open economy, not a closed one.  Industrialists will go to the country where they will find the highest reward.</P>
    <P>When travelling through the town of Newbridge a great many years ago, I was struck by the derelict condition of many of the huge buildings in the town.  Anyone who passes through that town to-day will see that there is a number of thriving industries there. Those industrialists were not induced to come to Newbridge by any overwhelming desire to get inside the Minister's constituency, or from any other romantic or sentimental reason. They made their way to Newbridge because there were buildings there which were comparatively cheap to purchase.  In this Bill we are providing buildings at a very reduced rate by giving grants for their erection.  In that way, the same principle applies and we may have as a result some new industries established.  It is our hope that the balance will not be upset against those counties which demanded and required special assistance, that is, the areas covered by the Undeveloped Areas Act.</P>
    <P>I do not for one moment agree that the injection of new capital into the erection and establishment of productive industries causes inflation, and I do not agree with another Minister who spoke to-day when he said that the plans outlined by Deputy Lemass for the injection of substantial sums into productive industry over a period of years would cause inflation.  It would do nothing of the kind, provided the money was put into really productive industry and that it had the effect of producing goods to balance the expenditure incurred.</P>
    <P>Apart from the industries which will cater for external markets&mdash;and they are many and varied&mdash;there is need for the further development of industries catering for the home market, particularly industries which provide vital needs.  There is a vital need for <Col N="1640" /> the production of some substitute for imported motor fuel and tractor fuel. That is a matter into which research must be made and in regard to which something definite must be done.  The development of our export industries and the development of industries which complete and are complementary to our agricultural production are of vital necessity.  There is opportunity for further development and I think this Bill will be availed of to the full.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have been coerced, if you like, into bringing this Bill forward rather hurriedly.  It has gone through the Dáil hurriedly at the end of the session and the Minister has been coerced into taking that action by the alarming position in respect of unemployment.  Unemployment as compared with last year is up by over 15,000.  Yesterday I was reading an article in the <i>Irish Times</i> in which the matter of manufacturing industries was discussed.  It was pointed out in that article that there has been a decline of 4 per cent. in employment in manufacturing industries during the last quarter of the present year as compared with that of the previous year, and that there has been also a decline of 9 per cent. in production in manufacturing industries.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will have some effect in remedying that position.  I hope also that industries which are already established here and which find an opportunity to enlarge their scope of production and to enlarge their premises and buildings, will be able to avail of this Bill to the same extent as an entirely new industry.  The Minister should make it clear that that is so, because there can be no justification for excluding an established industry from the benefits of this Bill, when it is proved that they must incur capital expenditure on the provision of additional buildings and constructive works of a permanent nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington has asked why the banks do not provide the capital required.  It is not the function of the banks to provide fixed capital.  The moneys which banks lend are borrowed by them from their depositors and they are liable to <Col N="1641" /> repay those depositors at very short notice.  Consequently, it is necessary that they should maintain their assets in liquid form so that they can be collected in at short notice.  It is the function of the banks to lend working capital to industry and not fixed capital.</P>
      <P>The Senator also referred to the possibility of uneconomic industries being created under the terms of this Bill.  I do agree with him there is that possibility. It is difficult to understand, if there has been an adequate demand for a product, why that product has not been produced.  One would have thought that industry would have seen its opportunity and taken the necessary action.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill, the attitude of the industrialist must be somewhat different.  In respect of the provision of a certain capital sum, he will receive a grant to which I understand no strings are attached.  In view of that, he probably will be prepared to accept risks which he would not otherwise take and we may find ourselves after some years in the position that industries which have been entered into under the terms of this Bill will prove uneconomic and those industries may need to be supported and assisted by further protection.  I hope I am wrong in that view but it is a view I feel we should air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point which I think was also referred to.  Under the terms of this Bill, as I understand it, the State will provide up to £50,000 for the provision or adaptation of buildings whereas the promoter will put up £25,000. In the course of some years one of two things will happen.  Either that industry will be a success, a failure or a partial failure.  If it is successful it is open to the industrialist, I presume, to sell his shares in the business.  In fact he will sell shares, which cost him £25,000 and assets which cost £75,000. In turn he will put in his pocket £50,000 that has been put up by the taxpayers of this country, either directly or indirectly.  If the business is a partial success he has to realise only half of its cost in order to obtain a profit of £12,500 and if it is a total failure he should be able, with luck, to <Col N="1642" /> sell it for one-third of its cost.  I do feel there should be some restriction to prevent a thing of that kind occurring.  The Minister may say: &ldquo;If it is a success what does it matter? The State has lost nothing.&rdquo;  On the other hand I think provision should be made for that contingency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I must say I was rather surprised at the treatment which Senator Sheehy Skeffington gave it.  I think it should be borne in mind that the object of the Undeveloped Areas Act was primarily to encourage industrialists to go to a particular part of the country to which they might not normally go. This Bill seeks not only to do that but to bring industrialists to this country who might not come here otherwise, and to encourage Irish industrialists to create new industries.  I do not think that the greatest or most important question is who the State actually gives the money to, but the use that is made of the money and the effect the spending of that money has finally on the economic structure of the State.</P>
      <P>I was surprised that Senator Sheehy Skeffington should say that the money could be used to double Civil Service pensions or, alternatively, that the money could be given to existing industrialists.  Usually Senator Sheehy Skeffington makes the case that industrialists here have had the benefit of protection and that they should not be in need of further assistance.  He also stated that the giving of this money might cause inflation.  I do not know how the Senator can arrive at the conclusion that money spent on something that leads to greater production of goods and services could lead to inflation.  I find that there is something contradictory in that approach to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be remembered that the giving of this money is based upon a sound proposal which has first to be examined to ascertain what it is intended to produce, whether or not the product is something that is saleable on the Irish market and will not interfere with existing markets and how much can be exported.  On the basis of that one gets a grant.  In no <Col N="1643" /> circumstances, or only in exceptional circumstances, will the full two-thirds grant be given and then only for an exceptional proposal that would have very good results as far as the economy of the country is concerned.  I cannot see that there should be any fear about giving money to industrialists when in the final analysis it will mean greater employment, less emigration and more goods for export.</P>
    <P>Fears were expressed when this Bill was in the Dáil, and again here to-day by Senator Kissane, that the Bill might interfere with industrial progress in the undeveloped areas.  At the same time he referred to the fact that the Minister had power, under the Undeveloped Areas Act, to extend that Act rather than introduce a new Bill.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I was amazed at that line of reasoning coming from somebody who had stated that the Bill might hinder industrial expansion in the undeveloped areas because it would automatically mean that one would get the same benefits as one would get by going to the undeveloped areas, in centres which were, perhaps, nearer to the cities, and consequently nobody would go to the undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill, in conjunction with the Undeveloped Areas Act, provides a correct balance.  One is entitled to get two-thirds of the cost of erecting factories if one goes to any place in the country except the undeveloped areas and, if one chooses to go to the undeveloped areas, one has the possibility of getting an additional 25 per cent. of the cost of the factory and, in addition to that, 50 per cent. of the cost of plant and machinery and an allowance for training operatives.</P>
    <P>I think the additional encouragement to go to the undeveloped areas is still sufficient to induce any industrialist who can go.  There are, however, industrialists who could not go to the undeveloped areas.  An industrialist might come here from abroad&mdash;he might already have an industry in Britain&mdash;to establish an industry here. That would require a great deal of travelling backwards and forwards especially when the industry was in its early stages.  That industrialist <Col N="1644" /> would have a certain value upon his own time.  It might well be that he would not come here at all if he found that the advantages to be gained by going so far west were counterbalanced by the fact that it would be impossible for him to promote the industry in an efficient and economic way.</P>
    <P>I believe this is an excellent Bill and gives the correct balance and incentive to industrialists to come here. In the final analysis it will put more people in employment, result in the production of more goods and more exports.  I think it is worthy of the support of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want, like my colleague, Senator Bohan, to welcome this Bill.  It is, like the Finance Bill which we had earlier to-day, a constructive measure by the Government to develop the economy of the country. I feel it is a good measure even though we had, earlier in the debate, something of a criticism from the Opposition benches of the £2,000,000 which is being provided for industrialists.  When I came to look at the £2,000,000 and how it was to be paid out, my reaction was surprise at the smallness of the sum.  We have under this Bill a maximum sum of £2,000,000 to be paid out in grants over the next seven years.  The maximum grant that can be made in any case is £50,000.  It seems to me that even if maximum grants were paid in all cases the total number of factories that would be set up would be about 40 in seven years. That would be about 6 a year.  I cannot quite understand the note of criticism voiced earlier this morning of the £2,000,000 being supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of that, I was rather glad to hear the Minister say that, whilst this money was being provided, he would certainly be delighted that the money was expended quickly and that it would be necessary to come back in the next few years to seek further assistance.  I wonder if the maximum sum of £50,000 to any individual factory is a proper maximum.  I wonder whether the Minister has given consideration to that aspect of the matter. You may have&mdash;and we hope to have&mdash;<Col N="1645" /> large industrial concerns set up here and £50,000, in spite of what was said by the Senator on my left, is not, when you are building a factory, a really substantial sum.  I wonder why has the Minister put down that particular maximum, because he does seem to be tying himself to that extent in giving such assistance within the next seven years.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the assistance to industry upon which I should like the views of the Minister.  We are providing financial assistance towards the construction of factories in order to provide employment and produce goods here which are not being produced and, we hope, to produce goods for the export market.  Senator Guinness raised the question as to whether we might not be wasting some money in doing this.  I hope we are not, but it seems to me that consideration might be given in the future&mdash;I hope we will continue to assist industrial development&mdash;to an alternative policy.</P>
    <P>That is the policy in operation to some extent in Northern Ireland, where, instead of giving financial assistance to industrialists to build factories, the Government itself builds the factories and rents them to industrialists. It would seem to me that if that practice were followed here, it would certainly overcome the objection which Senator Guinness saw in the present measure.</P>
    <P>We have spoken in the Seanad, as the Minister will be aware, of the need for decentralisation during the past 12 months, but, quite frankly, I was rather puzzled by Senator Kissane. He seemed to think that we were, by passing this measure, in some way undermining the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, and it prompted me to wonder what exactly Senator Kissane wanted.  Does he think that the assistance given under this measure is at too high a level and would he seek to have it reduced so that thereby the value of the assistance given under the Undeveloped Areas Act would be comparatively better?</P>
    <P>On the other hand, does he think that further financial assistance could be given or should be given to the under-developed areas?  I ask the latter <Col N="1646" /> question because I wonder how that could be done, because, as the Minister pointed out, there is power, under the Undeveloped Areas Act, to give financial assistance to a maximum of 100 per cent. towards the cost of the building, 50 per cent. towards the cost of machinery and financial assistance towards the training of operatives.  I should not ask the Senator the question &mdash;he has not the right to reply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;what exactly he wanted, whether he thought the financial assistance here was at too high a level or some further assistance could or should be given to the undeveloped areas.</P>
      <P>The House will excuse me if I return to a matter which I mentioned earlier to-day, that is, the campaign of buying Irish goods.  I then directed my remarks, under the Finance Bill, and here, again, I think it would be appropriate to say to the House&mdash;I think there is no need to say to the Minister&mdash;that every effort should be made to encourage the buying of Irish products.  Here we are attempting to help the establishment of Irish industries and another assistance which could be given to Irish industries would be a good market here for our products.  By having a good market here, we would be able, to my mind, to branch out into the export market.</P>
      <P>I said earlier to-day that probably the people who purchase most, who expend the money earned, are the housewives.  I am afraid we fail in many instances to get across to them the benefit to them and their families of purchasing Irish goods.  In other words, when we decide to export any money, we at the same time decide to export our children after that money eventually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one further aspect of this &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign which I should like to mention.  It seems to me that the business community could themselves give assistance, that there is a tendency in some businesses to avoid Irish products.  I understand that in some shops in Dublin there is difficulty in getting Irish products; that if you <Col N="1647" /> specifically ask for something manufactured here, you will get a down-thenose sort of answer that it is not in stock and is not very much good.  I do not want to raise this question of profits under the levies again to-day, but it seems to me that in many shops there is a tendency to encourage the sale of the foreign product in spite of the price differential and in spite of the high prices, when an Irish product of equal quality can be sold at a cheaper price.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the people selling want either a profit made on that increased price for the foreign product or there may be a commission on the actual sale.  It may be that if the foreign product is sold, the commission might be higher.  I would ask Senators who have influence in this respect to encourage amongst chambers of commerce and the business communities generally a realisation that they should assist in this &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign. I think they owe it to themselves and they certainly owe it to the country to do everything possible to assist the sale of Irish products in this country. All of us can assist in some respect. I do not want to appear critical of anybody except to suggest that we should have co-operation in the sale of Irish products which would help to expand industry in this country and provide employment for our own people at home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming this Bill, I will not say very much except to support what Senator Murphy said in regard to the desire, or what seems to be the desire, on the part of shopkeepers to press certain articles of foreign manufacture rather than to sell the Irish goods.  I myself for quite a long time have tried to purchase Irish machine thread in shops in our principal shopping centres.  To use Senator Murphy's phrase, I have been subjected to the &ldquo;down the nose&rdquo; attitude and also have been forced to listen to long lectures on the superiority of English thread.  I have used Irish thread and English thread and all kinds of machine thread.  Irish machine thread is far and away a superior machine thread to the English <Col N="1648" /> product&mdash;you get more for your money, you get a very wide range of colours and you certainly get good quality.</P>
      <P>I have almost formed a hobby of going into shops in Dublin, just for the amusement which it has come to be now, though it used to be anger, of listening to the learned lectures from the shop assistants on the inferiority of the Irish article and the superiority of the English article.  I would like if the Minister could tell me the reason for that, because my own experience has proved beyond any doubt that the Irish sewing cotton and Irish machine thread is very much in advance of the English product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to note that fairly large amounts of money are to be spent in helping to establish new industries and also that the undeveloped areas will not be interfered with in any way.  I would like to mention a point which has been crossing the minds of a lot of people in my locality during the past 12 months.  It is an undeveloped area and we have been seeking a suitable industry for the locality.  I refer to the people's intention to erect a creamery or separating station in that area.  I have been deputed with other members of different Parties in the county to approach the undeveloped areas authority, but so far we have drawn a blank and have been able to get no assistance whatever.  We were told at all times that the matter was always under consideration, that is, the giving of a grant for the proposed erection of a creamery and separating station in that area; but we can get no further. If help could be given, it would be a very useful thing, in my view, and would benefit not alone the people in the country but the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small farmers along the western seaboard never can be described as farmers in the real sense of the word, because their small holdings can never enable them to make a living and therefore they can be described generally as half farmer and half labourer. In other words, there is competition always on the labour market between those people who themselves hold <Col N="1649" /> small holdings of land.  Let us say 1,000 such small holders are supplying to a local separating station.  There would be a cheque, small or large, finding its way into each home every month.  In a case like that, it would take the owner of the small holding immediately away from the labour market.  That would mean taking 500 or 1,000 people, who otherwise would have to seek employment from the county council, out of that employment and leaving it more freely available to those people who are genuinely deserving of employment.</P>
    <P>These are the arguments we have been putting up and so far they have borne no fruit.  I am making the suggestion to the Minister to consider, that it would be a good thing, particularly in the undeveloped areas, if a little financial assistance could be given.  There would be no need for a big grant.  A reasonably good separating station could be erected for £5,000 or £7,000.  If a little help, a certain percentage or whatever would be thought fit, could be given, I can assure the Minister that it would have a very beneficial effect on the locality. Not alone would it be producing something which would be valuable for the general community, but it would also take away so many people, who now feel they are entitled to be called labourers as well as farmers, and put them in a position where it would be unnecessary for them to look for work of any kind at the labour exchange.</P>
    <P>Therefore, whenever an amount of money would be available for relief schemes and such employment in the locality, if one of these new creamery milk suppliers ever approached the exchange to look for such work, he could be turned down immediately, because there would be an income, small as it might be, finding its way into his home.  I would like the Minister to consider whether such a project would be worth while for the purpose of an advance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to speak very briefly on this Bill.  Unfortunately, I was absent when the Minister introduced it and did not hear the speeches <Col N="1650" /> of Senator Kissane and Senator Cox. I gathered from the speeches made in the House that there was a certain amount of fear that this Bill was rather like the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, in that it was penalising or attempting to penalise existing industries.  Knowing the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I am quite satisfied that nothing was further from the intention of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I have a fear, which I share with Senator Burke, I think, that, in the wording of the Bill, there is a danger to certain small established industries, which are struggling to carry on their existing production, and who could, with financial assistance which is not available from the normal sources, extend their production for export.  I would like to feel that these people would also be able to benefit under this Bill.  For that reason, I have tabled for the Committee Stage two recommendations which I hope the Minister will at least consider or give reasons why he feels they cannot be incorporated in the present Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 2 (1), I suggest, should be amended as follows, after subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the authority is satisfied that financial assistance is necessary (1) to enable an existing industry to extend its production or (2) to ensure the establishment of an industrial undertaking to manufacture the commodity to a substantial extent, that the undertaking will be of a reasonably permanent nature and will be carried on efficiently, it may on such terms as it thinks fit and proper, make a grant towards the cost of acquisition, construction or adaptation of the buildings and other works required for the purpose of&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think one could also insert the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;establishing or extending the undertaking.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If these words could be added, it would enable the Minister, in desirable circumstances, to provide a certain amount of capital for established industrialists and so enable them to <Col N="1651" /> draw benefit from the Bill and to extend their production for export.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for the manner in which the Bill has been received and for the successful way, on the whole, in which Senators have endeavoured to understand the relationship of this Bill to the Undeveloped Areas Act. Inevitably, perhaps, there has been some confusion which I would like to try to set right in order to arrest the fears which some Senators have expressed in that regard.</P>
      <P>Senator Kissane, and a number of other Senators later, referred to the fact that they did not see any benefits in this Bill for the existing industrialist. So far as the existing industrialist already has a factory, it is not proposed to give him another factory because the need does not arise.  The position of the existing industrialist is that if he wants money for development&mdash;and I take it that is what Senator Kissane has in mind&mdash;he can approach the Department of Industry and Commerce and see to what extent he can get the benefit of the Trade Loans Guarantee Act.  The Trade Loans Guarantee Act is available for the purpose of giving trade loans guarantees for industrial purposes in the name of the State, and when the State gives such a guarantee the industrialist can take the guarantee to a bank, insurance company, to a finance house or to anybody willing to lend him money and the State will guarantee the repayment of the principal and interest.</P>
      <P>Because the industrialist has that guarantee he is invariably able to negotiate an advance at a rate of interest substantially less than he would be able to get if he went into an ordinary bank, insurance company or finance house without a Government guarantee.  That is a very substantial facility.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to why in a moment.  As far as the industrialist is concerned, he will get advances in that way for the development of his business.  If he is short of capital, he may approach the Industrial Credit Company, explain to them what exactly he wants capital for.  As anybody who looks at their balance sheet will see, they have taken substantial blocks of shares, ordinary and preference, in a number of companies and in that way have helped companies to develop and to expand substantially because of the shareholding interest and financial support for their undertakings.</P>
      <P>Senator Kissane said that this Bill made the same, or much the same, grants available for the whole country outside the undeveloped areas as for the undeveloped areas.  I cannot imagine how anybody can consciously make that mistake.  Under this Bill we are giving a two-thirds grant provided the person engages in the activities set out in paragraph 2 of the Bill&mdash;to provide employment on a substantial scale or to make available in the State quantities of the commodity, or to provide an opportunity for developing an export trade.  He is not required to comply with all these rather tight conditions in the case of the Undeveloped Areas Act.  One may get a grant in the undeveloped areas for small industries; this is not intended to deal with the problems of small industries but with the problems of the larger industries which will make an impact on the absorption of the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not correct to say that the grants under this Bill are virtually indistinguishable from the grants available under the Undeveloped Areas Act.  Under this Bill one may get a two-thirds grant for a factory; under the Undeveloped Areas Act you are entitled to get 100 per cent. of the cost of the factory buildings, 50 per cent. of the cost of the machinery and a grant-in-aid for the training of workers.  Putting a two-thirds grant on one side&mdash; that is the maximum available under this Bill&mdash;and putting 100 per cent. of the cost of buildings, 50 per cent. of the cost of machinery and a grant for <Col N="1653" /> training of workers, on the other, how can anyone say that these facilities are virtually the same?  Of course there is a very substantial difference between them, and An Foras Tionscal grants will apply to certain types of industry which probably will not qualify under a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>Senator Kissane expressed some fears that this Bill might somehow or other disadvantageously affect the undeveloped areas, and having said that, he asked me why I had introduced this Bill at all, that in fact by using my power under the Undeveloped Areas Act I could have avoided the introduction of this Bill.  Of course I could.  If I had wanted to do it I could have made an Order under the Undeveloped Areas Act bringing in the whole of Leinster, the whole of Munster or the whole of the northern part of our country.  I could have given them grants and made them eligible to qualify for the 100 per cent. grant for factory buildings, the 50 per cent. for machinery and the grant for training of workers.  But does Senator Kissane know any better way of killing the undeveloped areas than by doing that?</P>
    <P>If I made the Undeveloped Areas Act grants available in Leinster, Munster and in the northern counties, is it not clear as daylight that nobody would go to the western areas?  It is because I did not want to put these areas in the same position as the undeveloped areas that I disarmed myself of the right to apply the Undeveloped Areas Act to the eastern, midland or southern counties and instead introduced this new Bill which makes clear as daylight the distinction between the undeveloped areas and the areas which will be covered by this Bill.  If I were to do as was suggested to me and use my power under the Undeveloped Areas Act, that would be the last you would hear of the undeveloped areas. I wanted to keep the Undeveloped Areas Act and to have the facilities provided under it and enable it to carry on as at present because I believe valuable work has been done, is being, and will be done under that Act as it stands.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox raised the question of the provisions of Section 2, sub-section <Col N="1654" /> (3) and he said that one of the conditions of the grant was that it could not be got where the commodity was being sufficiently manufactured at present by an undertaking already existing.  I think he wanted to make sure that if an existing industry is potentially capable of providing the full requirements of the home market that should automatically disqualify a competing firm from the possibility of getting a grant.  The existing position in this respect is already catered for under the Control of Manufactures Act and there the Minister is required to have regard to a number of considerations before he gives a new manufacturing licence.  One of the considerations is that he should have regard to the extent to which a commodity for which a new manufacturing licence is being sought is already being manufactured by an existing manufacturer. My invariable practice&mdash;and I think the same applies to An Foras Tionscal and the Industrial Development Authority in their approach to their respective problems&mdash;is always to lean over on the side of the existing manufacture, if he is doing it, if he is attempting to do it or if he shows evidence of an energetic desire to manufacture to a greater extent for the home market.  I think Senator Cox need not have any worry on that score.</P>
    <P>The functions under this Bill will be administered by the Industrial Development Authority.  They will have to decide the grants on the basis of the available information at the time the application is under consideration.  If they had imposed on them what Senator Cox suggests&mdash;a statutory obligation to consider the possibilities of future expansion by existing firms &mdash;it would be very difficult for them to deal with applications.  It is not an easy matter for the Industrial Development Authority to decide in that kind of way where possibility ends and where possibility is still alive.  That whole matter can best be left to the Industrial Development Authority to deal with in the way it has been dealt with so far when the issue of a new manufacture licence under the Control of Manufactures Act is raised.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox also raised the question of the Control of Manufactures Act <Col N="1655" /> itself.  I agree with him and with everybody else who says that, in the main, the Control of Manufactures Act has long since served its purpose. I have been considering applications for the past 2½ years from firms or groups of industrialists who sought a new manufacture licence for the purpose of establishing an industry here. I take the view in all these cases that, so long as the applicant group would not engage in cut-throat and undesirable competition with an existing Irish industry, I would give them a new manufacture licence in order to enable them to operate here to produce goods which we must import at present and to provide employment for people who, if that employment were not provided for them, would probably be emigrants to-day.  That will continue to be my policy.</P>
    <P>I am certain that any industrialist or group of industrialists who desire to establish an industry in Ireland to manufacture commodities not made here will be warmly welcomed and, so far as I am concerned, the Control of Manufactures Act will not stand in the way of their operating here.  I should like to see this Act, if not revoked, at least substantially amended.  However, I am reluctant to throw the question of its revocation or its amendment into a political cauldron in which there will be allegations that this is an attempt to ruin Irish industry, that this is an attempt to kill the Irish manufacturer, that this is an attempt to promote the commercial conquest of Ireland by people from all over the world.  Any discussion on such a barren field as that would not only, I think, do harm to existing industries but would do immense harm to the potentialities we have to offer in the way of industrial development here.</P>
    <P>If there is a disposition on the part of all Parties in this country to evolve a Control of Manufactures Act, if there be need for one at all, which will protect the interests of the Irish manufacturer who has borne the heat and burden of the day, who has shown commendable enterprise and a real pioneering spirit, I should like a committee <Col N="1656" /> to examine a Bill of that kind and let it go through the House as an agreed measure, without all the turmoil of the vituperation and the recriminations which would be bound to arise if the repeal or the amendment of that Act were made a Party issue either in this House or in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>So far as I am concerned, no industry will be prevented from starting to produce goods which are not made here at present.  I will entertain favourably applications from reputable people for the establishment of industries here to produce these goods in factories which will employ our Irish people.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke asked about the export possibilities of a certain firm. This firm could qualify for consideration under this Bill by setting up a separate factory.  A new factory will be a new factory and if it is for the purpose of operating any new lines of activity, whether in the home market or in the export market it will be a new factory for the purpose of this Bill.  In addition, that firm now, for the first time, will get the benefit of the taxation concessions which are set out in the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which was dealt with by the House to-day.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh was concerned about the possibility that the Undeveloped Areas Act might expire in 1958, while this Bill runs until 1963.  When the Undeveloped Areas Bill was going through the House, 1958 was stated as the deadline for its life of operation. It is a good Bill.  I think it is one of the ways in which we can bring some hope and some light into some of the dark economic recesses in the undeveloped areas.  It would be my objective to promote legislation to continue the Undeveloped Areas Bill so that we might continue to make grants available for the establishment and operation of factories in those areas. We have done well in that respect.</P>
    <P>I have some figures here which might be of interest to the House.  The Undeveloped Areas Bill was passed in 1951.  In respect of the years 1952-53, 1953-54 and up to June, 1955, the total approvals for grants amounted to £373,000.  Since the 2nd June, 1955, the <Col N="1657" /> total approvals of grants for new industries in these areas amounted to £898,000.  Therefore, having found £898,000 since the 2nd June last for the purpose of financing industries in these areas, I think the House will feel that the operation of the Undeveloped Areas Act is at present in very safe hands. Senator Kissane will be happy to know that we have given approvals since June, 1955, which constitute an increase of about 150 per cent. on the grants given up to that date.  I would say to Senator Walsh and to those who think like him that I am most anxious to continue the Undeveloped Areas Act.  I believe it is capable of doing valuable work in the undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington engaged in the delightful recreation of putting up Aunt Sallies.  I must congratulate him on the skill with which he knocked them down.  The Senator asked one question after another and almost immediately afterwards provided the answers to his own questions.  He wanted to know why there were grants at all.  If I were to debate that question here, I would have to debate it not merely in respect of industry but, in respect of agriculture, education and of almost every other field of activity in the country.  It would be out of order to do so and I do not propose to break the rules of the House during my short sojourn here.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that Senator Sheehy Skeffington is far too experienced and skilful not to know why there is a need for grants.  Why was there a need for grants in the undeveloped areas?  To stimulate employment.  Why is there a need for guaranteed prices in agriculture? To stimulate the growing of wheat. Why is there a need for these grants? To stimulate the establishment of factories. The Senator goes off at a tangent on this Bill because he gives the impression that it is a Bill to put money into the pockets of industrialists.</P>
    <P>I am not worried about the position of industrialists in this matter at all. I am concerned with providing factories which will give work for Irish men and women, where they can earn the wherewithal to lead a decent life <Col N="1658" /> in their own land.  I hope that these factories, by creating more wealth in Ireland, will make it possible to aggregate and distribute that wealth much more equitably than it has been distributed and provide a decent living for all.  Giving two-thirds the cost of a factory building is purely a means of priming the pump to ensure you can stimulate people to do things under this kind of attraction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not speak for the banks in this House.  Take an absurdly simple example to illustrate the philosophy behind this.  How many times has a person told a child: &ldquo;Do that and I will give you threepence or sixpence&rdquo;?  In a minor way, that is the stimulation behind this, to encourage people to interest themselves in industrial development, people who probably would not be interested and who up to the present, in fact, have not shown a great deal of interest in industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator knows Ireland as well as the rest of us.  Anybody going through Irish towns is struck by one thing&mdash;and certainly the visitor from overseas sees it at once&mdash;that is, the rows and rows of shops, where people engage in distribution, and the all too inconspicuous presence of factories. The whole truth of the matter is that industrially we have leaned very decidedly towards the shopkeeping and distribution line.  Our policy is to produce goods for our own requirements. I say that, economically, that is better than distributing the imported commodities of other countries.  In so far as we can convert our people to being industrially minded instead of being just shopkeeper minded, I think we can create wealth here.  Its creation is much more vital than its distribution in the form of commercial distribution.  As I say, this scheme has the same stimulation behind it as the Undeveloped Areas Act.  Whether the grant is provided for building an ordinary house, a farmhouse or any of these other activities, the State's assistance is for the purpose of priming <Col N="1659" /> the pump to provide the stimulation without which it could not perhaps be got going.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy asked why was the grant limited to a maximum of £50,000. So far as Foras Tionscal is concerned, it has no limit to the amount of money which it may advance for any one project. Anybody whose appetite for industrial development cannot be satisfied by a maximum grant of £50,000 under the present Bill will have to move to the undeveloped areas where there is no limit to the amount.  But in these days I think it is not a bad start to provide, for the first time after 34 years of native government, that we would give a grant for the establishment of new industries in areas outside the undeveloped areas. Up to the present, these areas have got nothing.  Senator Murphy could upbraid me by saying: &ldquo;Why not make it £100,000?&rdquo;  A start had to be made some time.  I was dealing with the situation in which you got nothing if you established a factory here, and I was moving to a situation in which, in order to ensure more factories in the rest of the country, we would stimulate interest by providing a grant of two-thirds, subject to a maximum of £50,000.</P>
    <P>When people try to set up a rivalry between the undeveloped areas and the rest of the country, I think there are some facts they should know.  The undeveloped areas consist of places like Donegal, Sligo, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway, Clare, Kerry, Leitrim and some smaller areas of West Cork.  For them, the House provided facilities which are still in existence, and which I hope will continue, for industrial development in those areas; but the House has never provided any grants whatever for the establishment of industries in counties like Louth, Wicklow, Wexford, Waterford, most of Cork, Kildare, Meath, Westmeath, Monaghan, Cavan, Laois, Offaly, Tipperary, Carlow, Kilkenny, Limerick and Dublin.  So that in a substantial area of the country, there are no grants whatever for factory buildings, for machinery and for the training of workers, while in the undeveloped <Col N="1660" /> areas, as I said earlier, there is the possibility of obtaining a 100 per cent. grant for the factory, a 50 per cent. grant for the machinery and a grant towards the training of workers.  This Bill is an effort to balance up the situation so far as it concerns those areas which, up to the present, have got no grants.</P>
    <P>I do not think the provisions here are unreasonable, nor do I think they will be harmful to the undeveloped areas.  After all, I know&mdash;and I am quite sure many Senators know&mdash;towns in these counties not covered by the Undeveloped Areas Act where there is no industry whatever.  In that respect, they are just the same as the place in the undeveloped areas which has no industry whatever.  In so far as the workers in that town are concerned, it is just as bad to be idle in the east as in the west of the country, or in the south or in the midlands.  From the point of view of the prosperity of the town, if there is no industry, it is affected as adversely as towns in the west or east.  This Bill is an effort to obtain a balance but by far the preponderance of facility still remains in the undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy referred to the position in the Six Counties where factories were built and let to potential industrialists.  I think our scheme is a better one than that, because, by giving the industrialists here a grant of two-thirds of the cost of the factory, it will at least ensure he will build the factory.  He will know his own requirements and that factory will satisfy his precise industrial needs.  There is a further consideration which I should point out to the Senator.  Once he gets the grant and once he builds the factory, it is then his own factory and, being his own factory, the buildings can be used by the promoter as a security for a bank loan for working capital.  Therefore, if he has a building in respect of which he got a grant of £50,000, and that ultimately becomes his own because he operates it, he has a very valuable asset which can be used from time to time to stimulate further activity and provide further employment, so far as the factory is concerned.</P>

      <P>It might not have started at all.  He might still be a distributor.  Let me say one thing to Senator Sheehy Skeffington in the end. While he was speaking, I made a rough calculation.  He was worried about this £50,000 going to industrialists. I do not think it is going to the industrialists as such.  I think it is going to the nation to strengthen its economic fabric, to strengthen its industrial front, to provide employment for Irish workers here instead of seeing them emigrate to find employment elsewhere.  If it is inevitable that there is an industrialist somewhere in that set-up, it is inevitable, and it is probably around him that that money has to be spun and that activity created and generated.  It is a mistake to look at it in that one-sided way, finding the industrialist and saying: &ldquo;Ah-ha, I knew you were here looking for the money&rdquo; as if nothing else was happening, apart from just giving him the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you had to deal with 330 unemployed men to-morrow, who had a wife and two children each, it would cost £50,000 to keep them on social welfare benefits which would not amount to £3 a week, for 12 months.  In other words, taking 330 unemployed men with a wife and two children each, getting less than £3 a week social welfare benefit, although they would qualify for more under the Social Welfare Acts, it would cost £50,000 to keep them in unemployment for 12 months. If you set up an industry and give it £50,000, if it survives for ten years and employs during that period 33 persons per year, you would get back the amount that you would have spent if these people had remained unemployed for a period of ten years.  They might well be changing people, but in an economy in which you would always have unemployed, if you take 33 people off the unemployment register for ten years and put them into a job, you save the £50,000 that you provided in giving a grant of two-thirds of the cost for the factory building.  You would <Col N="1662" /> be doing more than that.  You would be giving them a better life.  You would be giving their wives and children a better life.  You would be keeping them in Ireland.  You would be strengthening the whole fabric of the nation.  They would be creating wealth out of which taxes would be paid and the strength of the whole nation improved.</P>
    <P>I know that you can nag about this £50,000 and about industrialists.  I know you can work yourself into almost a rage and a craze over the thing, but, stand back and look at it, with economics of that kind to some extent impregnating your mind, and I think Senator Sheehy Skeffington, with all the prejudice that he showed in his approach to this matter, will realise, on second thoughts, that, on the whole, in our country, in our circumstances, in the year 1956, it is a good Bill.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 23, before &ldquo;to&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(i) to enable an existing industry to extend its production or (ii)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recommendations Nos. 1 and 2 are <Col N="1663" /> really on the same section.  I was hoping to deal with them very briefly together.  I have already on the Second Stage given my reasons in some detail for tabling these two recommendations and I do appreciate that, with the desire of the Government to have this Bill passed as promptly as possible, it is probably not possible for the Minister to consider or to accept these recommendations, but I do submit them in the hope that, if a similar Bill has to come before Parliament at a later stage, dealing with industry or other types of industry, the Minister will consider endeavouring to cover industries which have already been established so as to give them the benefit of interest-free grants.  I think there is a basic difference between the grants available to established industry and the grants which conceivably can be received under this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly true that the Bill does not state whether or not the Industrial Development Authority will charge interest, but I rather assume that in many circumstances the grant will be free of all charge.  So, I propose formally to move these recommendations and possibly the Minister would say a word on them before I press or withdraw them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the idea behind these two recommendations, but, at the same time, I should not like to go as far as the Senator proposes to go.  As I said, in my Second Reading speech, I was concerned about existing industrialists and could not see any reason why they could not qualify for financial assistance under this Bill to the same extent as new industrialists.  There would be, of course, I admit, one great difference between the two because an established industrialist who wanted to expand his business would not be expected to undertake the same amount of expense as a new industrialist would have to undergo.  In other words, the expansion of an existing industry would not involve anything like the same expenditure as the establishment of a new industry would involve.  I do not know if the two recommendations that have been <Col N="1664" /> tabled by Senator Douglas entirely meet the point.  I was inclined to submit a different recommendation, something like this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If the authority are of opinion that an existing industry is capable of expansion and by its expansion would fulfil the conditions laid down in paragraph (c) of Section 2, sub-section (1) the authority shall make a grant of two-thirds of the cost of such expansion subject to a maximum of £10,000.</P>
      <P>I would imagine that the existing industrialist, in expanding his business, would derive as much benefit out of a maximum of £10,000 as the new industrialist would derive out of a maximum of £50,000.  There is a fundamental difference between the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the suggestions made by both Senator Douglas and Senator Kissane.  I can see the Minister's difficulty.  He may leave himself open to the criticism that he was helping an industry which is competing with an already existing industry.  It is a problem.  I believe that more immediate results would be achieved in stimulating industrial production, providing employment and creating greater national wealth by assisting existing industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider the points that have been raised with regard to these matters.  Possibly the Minister may consider bringing in another Bill to deal with them, something on the lines suggested by Senator Douglas and Senator Kissane, with a lower ceiling than £50,000 and, at the same time, not granting quite the same amounts as are given under the provisions of this Bill where in it is proposed to give up to two-thirds. Possibly, one-third would be sufficient in the case of existing industries because they already have their plant and machinery.  With the help of that one-third, they would probably be able to borrow the balance either from the public or from the ordinary financial houses.  Nevertheless, I believe more immediate results in relation to employment will be gained by helping existing industries to provide themselves <Col N="1665" /> with the facilities to export rather than establishing new industries for that specific purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated, when replying, that, so far as existing industry is concerned, it is protected inasmuch as State moneys will not be provided to set up a rival.  Therefore, from that point of view, industry has substantial protection at the moment.  In this case, however, State moneys could be used to give one person a grant to extend his premises and his activities at the expense of somebody else who fails to apply for it.  I do not think the problem can be dealt with in the way suggested.  It certainly cannot be dealt with under this Bill.  The idea can be considered if amending or supplementary legislation is contemplated at a later date.</P>
      <P>If an existing industrialist wants to start a new industry, which will satisfy the conditions set out in Section 2, then the thing for that person to do is to establish a new factory.  If he does that, he can get the benefit of two-thirds of the grant and in that way he will have a factory subsidised to that extent, provided his purpose is to provide employment on a substantial scale, or make available in the State substantial quantities of a commodity or provide an opportunity for developing an export trade.  If that person intends to do an export trade in a new commodity, the obvious thing would be to establish a new factory.  If he wants to provide employment on a large scale, it may well be that what he will require is an entirely new factory, leaving his existing activities to continue as at the moment.  In that way, he can be helped under Section 2. I do not see that he can be helped in any other way under this Bill or at this stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has side-tracked the issue in relation to these recommendations.  What we have in mind is the case of an industrialist who is engaged in the manufacture of a certain commodity.  If his business is capable of extension and would, by extension, provide employment, surely there should be provision for such a case.  Surely such <Col N="1666" /> a person should not have to undergo the same expense as a person venturing on an entirely new project.  That is why I would limit it to one-third of the cost or, perhaps, a maximum of £10,000.  Of course, if the Minister says that cannot be considered in connection with this Bill, we are talking in the air.  If the Minister is not in a position to enshrine in this Bill the principles laid down in the recommendations, I hope he will bear it in mind in relation to future legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the discussion is rather unrealistic in one respect.  An existing factory, set up to cater for the home market, has the machinery and the buildings.  If that factory increases production, it will increase it for an export market. As a result of the Bill we passed this morning, we are encouraging that factory to increase production and to get into the export market.  Most factories can do that without having to build extensions.  Even if they have to extend, there is assistance for them under the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which we passed this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>

I do not know what the reduced rate of interest would be in a case like that.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, the point I want to make is that when I referred to this matter on Second Reading, there were Senators who doubted the accuracy of my interpretation of the section.  Now that they have heard the arguments for and against it, and now that they have heard the Minister, I think they will have no doubt whatever as to whose interpretation was correct.  In other words, it is not possible for an existing industrialist to get financial assistance under this section for the expansion of an industry in which he is concerned.</P>

      <P>This is an effort, with £2,000,000, to stimulate people to produce new factories in which to produce new goods.  It is not intended to give grants to a person to extend a factory by 1,000 square feet, to buy another store, to buy another motor car, to put up a new loft or to put a roof on an old one.  This is an effort to use this £2,000,000 in the best possible way, not by saying to those already in industry: &ldquo;Do another little piece here and there&rdquo;.  All we want is to induce people to go into industry in a vigorous, courageous way.  These grants are being stepped up to a maximum of £50,000 in the hope of bringing into industry people who are not there already.  We do not propose to go around trying to stimulate existing industrialists.  If they want to build new factories, to do things in a big way, they should avail of the provisions of this Bill when they will be eligible for two-thirds of the cost of the factory.  If such industrialists want more facilities than that, they can go to the undeveloped areas.  These two facilities taken together are as good as can be found anywhere in the world. This is a start in this field and I think it is a good start.  In regard to Senator Sheehy Skeffington's point, the sub-section means that arrangements will be made as to the conditions under which grants will be paid.  These are free, non-repayable grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 6, to delete &ldquo;two million&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;two hundred and fifty thousand.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My aim in putting down this recommendation was to underline the fact that the putting up of such big sums of money&mdash;£2,000,000&mdash;is at this juncture rather going against the sort of policy we have been asked to accept in relation to other things&mdash;voluntary health insurance, pensions and everything else.  The section says that the aggregate amount of grants shall not exceed £2,000,000.  Even if we accept the principle of the Bill, we must still regard this as being too high.  I should like to start more cautiously.  The point was made by Senator Guinness that if we go too generously without sufficient circumspection, some of these new industries may prove uneconomic. He made the point that industrialists may be tempted to take risks, which they would not otherwise take, at the State's expense.  If that were to happen, I do not think it would be wise for too much of it to happen. That is why I would like to put a limit to the amount that would be lost.  We might start with small amounts which would give us a sum total of a quarter of a million pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It used to be considered that the justification for the payment of a dividend was that the capitalist was lending and risking his money.  In this case, the risk is taken by the State but the dividend is taken by the private industrialist.  I do not quite understand why, in the giving out, to such a generous maximum, of these grants the three Labour Senators who spoke supported the Minister, <Col N="1670" /> apparently unanimously, in the suggestion that sleepy industrialists would be stimulated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very careful not to interpret it as Senator Hickey's attitude.  Senator Hickey, had he spoken, would not, I feel sure, have agreed with the other three Labour Senators.  Perhaps I am wrong, but I feel he is not as enthusiastic as the others about the proposal to give these free grants to industrialists.  In relation to these grants, the point was made by Senator Murphy that the Government might build the factories and rent them to these people, that in that way they would be buying or retaining a measure of control.  I should like to ask, again in relation to this quarter of a million pounds as the sum will be when the Seanad accepts my recommendation, where the money is to come from?  I do not think we were told that.  There is also the question of the pump priming.  I should like to know who owns the pump, who decides on the distribution of the water.  The Minister said the creation of wealth is much more important than its distribution.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I misinterpreted the Minister.  Perhaps the Minister's point that you would be giving wealth to the nation was quite a sound one, but my question is about ownership.  We are getting no lien on the factories.  We have considered such a lien necessary in other enterprises and the State has done remarkable things where private enterprise just could not enter the field&mdash;in turf production and electricity production &mdash;on the lines of social democratic economic planning which, perhaps, the Minister still slightly thinks about, and not just by bolstering tired industrialists&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was just finishing off and saying that my reason for putting down this recommendation was that I did not want to see such a generous distribution of grants without the retention of a measure of control. Therefore, I feel the maximum ought to be far smaller than the £2,000,000 lightly thrown out for this Bill.</P>
      <P>I would prefer to see that sum reduced to £250,000, which does not seem to me to be such a very small sum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

      <P>I think Senator Sheehy Skeffington's idea is to destroy the effectiveness of the Bill by putting down this recommendation to reduce the figure from £2,000,000 to £250,000. If the Minister has proved&mdash;and he has proved&mdash;that this Bill is necessary, it is ridiculous to make this suggestion, and the Senator might as well have proposed that the whole thing be struck out.  On this Bill, in relation both to people who were elected here to represent labour, industry and commerce, and everything else, Senator Sheehy Skeffington adopted a holier than everybody else attitude towards us all.</P>

      <P>The giving of grants is not an uncommon thing.  It is certainly new in regard to the building of factories, but for a decade or so we have had the practice of giving grants for the building of houses, grants from the Central Fund and, lately, grants from the local authorities.  I wonder does Senator Sheehy Skeffington think it a very wrong thing, that these houses, when they are built, are not owned by the State?  They have no vestige of control over them.  In fact, we could say that they are practically owned by the local authorities by the rates that have to be paid on them. However, the principle is more or less the same as here.  You encourage the building of houses because they are needed, because you know it is a good thing.  Now we are trying to encourage the building of factories because we think it is a good thing.</P>

      <P>As amended by the Senator.  The Senator has brought that philosophy to a fine art.  He has never been held down yet to any single interpretation as applied to any given set of circumstances.  The Senator is a very experienced controversialist and conversationalist.  There is nothing he delights in more than the difference between a grant to industry, a grant towards the national economy and the application of social democratic principles to industrial development.  On that, the Senator is out on his own and I do not propose to compete in that race with him because I have no chance of winning, even if I were off the limit mark.  Therefore, all I have to do is to say how I interpret the Bill and what the Bill is intended to mean for the people outside who will be affected by the Bill and for the people here who are going to pass it.</P>
      <P>I propose to grant £2,000,000 under this Bill which can be drawn upon for the purposes of stimulating industrial development through the medium of factory grants.  The sum ought to be a substantial sum if you are to give the impression that you intend to do this thing in a big and visionary way.  To make the grants small, to make the aggregate sum small, would make it a puny effort which would not strike the imagination of those whose enthusiasm and co-operation we must get if there is to be any success in this field.  There is no value in putting down £250,000. If this is going to be an outstanding success, it is only a matter of coming back to the House and looking for more money.  If it is not going to be a success, we will know that in the very early stages of it because the extent of the demand for these facilities will determine almost entirely whether this Bill will be a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have never done this before.  No Government for 34 years has done it. This Government has decided to do it, has decided to blaze the trail in this direction to see if it can induce and stimulate an interest in that form of development.  If you like, it is a calculated risk which we are taking to see whether this method will ensure wider industrial development than we have got up to the present.  I imagine, holding <Col N="1674" /> the convictions which he does, Senator Sheehy Skeffington will share my view that excessive caution could be a disease and what we must do in this case, having made up our minds that some new method must be tried, giving us quicker results than we have got, is to take the risk and hope we will be justified in the end.</P>
    <P>These grants will be administered by a body which is prudent in its general administration, the Industrial Development Authority, which has taken risks, and calculated risks.  It has not allowed anybody to pull the wool over its eyes and has proved itself to be progressive as well as prudent.  That is the body which will administer these grants.  I think the State and the Houses of the Legislature must take the risk of trying out this experiment. If it does not succeed, we must confess that it has not succeeded and we must try some other methods by which to stimulate industry.  A mere fear of taking risks and making ourselves a prisoner of caution is not the way to deal with this problem at a time when it needs to be dealt with in a manner which will provide many more thousands of jobs each year for those who are looking for them and are arriving to claim them on the industrial market each year.  The money for this purpose will be raised in the ordinary course on the strength of the Government's credit and will be utilised to finance the activities designated under the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann is of opinion that, in view of the steep rise in the cost of living, I.R.A. service pensions, disability pensions and special allowances should be increased and that the Army Pensions Acts be amended (a) to abolish the closing dates for applications for military service pensions and military service medals, (b) make provision for invalid children of I.R.A. men killed in action, and (c) make all I.R.A. service medal holders eligible for a special allowance irrespective of the date of issue of the medal provided that the claimants are otherwise qualified.</P>
      <P>In moving this motion, I feel that I am merely pressing an open door, so far as the present holder of the office of Minister for Defence is concerned. I am satisfied from my experience of the Minister over a long number of years that he is as anxious as I am, and as anxious as any member of the Oireachtas is, to ensure that the persons referred to in the motion will get all the consideration possible from this State.  But when I saw during the past few weeks that increases were being given to persons in receipt of State pensions on the ground of the drop in the purchasing power of the £ and the increase in the cost of living, I felt it was unfair that, as happened on previous occasions, persons in receipt of I.R.A. and Cumann na mBan pensions should again be the last to be considered.  For that reason I put down this motion.  It is an endeavour to strengthen the Minister's hand in dealing with the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure it would be the unanimous opinion of the House, and also of the Dáil, if they had the opportunity of discussing it, that persons in receipt of military service pensions, army pensions, and special allowances, should be considered in the very near future.  I have no intention of flogging <Col N="1676" /> the question of the rights and claims of those people who gave service in the cause of the freedom of this country. It has been talked about often enough and I know that every member of this House will pay tribute to them, as I am satisfied every member of the other House would pay tribute to them also. Nobody will question that they are entitled to all the consideration that this or any other Government can give them during the few short years which are left to them.  In the course of ten or 15 years, they will, at any rate, all have passed on and it would be a terrible thing if it should be thrown in the faces of future members of the Oireachtas that they were unfairly treated by their own Government and country.</P>
    <P>I have not got the figure of what has been saved year by year to the Department of Finance by the deaths of a large number of these persons.  I am sure the Minister could easily get that figure and probably he has it, but the fact remains that it is a decreasing debt and is likely to decrease more quickly now than ever it did before.  If the fact rate at which this debt is decreasing is taken into consideration, I think nobody will quibble about improving the present position because, by the end of, say, 15 years, this debt will no longer be there.  Because of that, I would ask the Minister for Defence to expedite the introduction of any legislation he has in mind for the purpose of giving these people the benefit of it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In the motion, I mention three headings in which I was interested and which, I think, cover the ground.  I will first take military service pensions. From time to time, we have had Bills before the Oireachtas for improvement of military service pensions and again, for the improvement of disability pensions and special allowances.  On each occasion these different items were mentioned, members of the Oireachtas were anxious that they should not be taken piecemeal.  In other words, they preferred that they would all be included in one Bill.  That is one of the reasons why I put down the different headings.</P>
    <P>In fact, the Minister himself was always in favour of that and in <Col N="1677" /> Volume 136, column 104 of the Dáil Debates, he was anxious that these pensions should not be taken piecemeal and that debates on increasing military service pensions, disability pensions and special allowances should be taken together.  In connection with the increasing of military service pensions, it is a well-known fact that some very low pensions are paid&mdash;some of them so low that we are almost ashamed to mention them.  As far as I can remember, we have military service pensions under £10 per annum, including past increases.</P>
    <P>When this matter was being debated previously, many members of the Dáil and Seanad were anxious that there should be minimum pensions.  I know how difficult it is for any Minister to fix minimum pensions because of the method that was used and is being used in assessing military service.  As the lower pensions, and the higher pensions, too, of course, are paid on the assessment of the value of the service rendered, it will be very difficult to fix minimum pensions.  Certainly, I should like to see minimum pensions fixed, if it were at all possible, because it is certainly no tribute to us or anybody else when we see such a small pension as £10 or less than £10 paid for military service.</P>
    <P>At any rate, a big number of Deputies and at least five Minister of the present Government supported the idea of minimum pensions and every member of the Oireachtas who spoke on the occasion of the last increase in military service pensions regretted that the increase could not be greater.  I think they very definitely accepted the increase then given as an instalment of more to come.  That was the position in 1953 and that being so, I think a great case can be made now for an increase at the present moment.  If there was a case then and if, as we saw last week, there was a case made for an increase in other State pensions, I think we must all agree that there is need for consideration of an increase at the present moment.</P>
    <P>So much for the increase but there is another matter in connection with military service pensions which I should like to mention and it is in connection <Col N="1678" /> with the making of applications for military service pensions.  At any rate, throughout the years I have been associated with it, I have always made it a point that I do not think any date should be set up after which a man may not apply or be entitled to a military service pension.</P>
    <P>I think that the question of a date after which a man may not apply should be abolished.  Any fixed date or closing down on applications of that kind should be abolished.  I know it will be argued that military service pensions have been in vogue since 1924 &mdash;that is 32 years.  It was argued before by previous Ministers that it was there long enough and that everybody should know about it, but the fact remains that, year by year, we have some applications coming from many parts of the world from people who were entitled to a military service pension and, indeed, we have even some coming in from this country after all the years. I cannot understand why there should be a closing date in relation to something to which a citizen of this State is, by law, entitled.  That to which he is entitled this year or was entitled to last year, he will still be entitled to next year.  I suggest to the Minister that there should be no closing date.</P>
    <P>I notice from Volume 160, column 2108 of the Dáil Reports, that the Minister for Defence in reply to a question by Deputy Gilbride said that he was glad to be in a position to state that the Government had now decided to introduce with all speed the necessary legislation to amend the Acts to provide for an extension of the date to enable members of the organisations mentioned in the Acts to apply for the award of a 1916 service medal or a 1917-1921 medal.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to hear that.  Of course, medals were issued but the holders of those medals were not entitled to a special allowance if the need arose, that is, if they were incapable of self-support and had no means.  The medals were issued and, of course, beyond the fact that they proved a person was a member of the forces, they were worthless as far as obtaining a special allowance was concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1679" /> I know that the Minister has that matter under very active consideration and that he has decided to put it right but here, again, I should like to suggest to the Minister that, as in the case of applying for military service pensions, there should be no date limit for applying for military service medals.  I know that in that matter, too, the Minister is of the same opinion.  I hold with the Minister that what a man is entitled to now he will still be entitled to five years or ten years from now.  We have it in the Minister's own words, that what a person is entitled to in June he is also entitled to the following January.  I am sure I am merely pressing an open door as far as that matter is concerned but I feel that it is up to me, when I feel that way, to take some steps to bring the notice of the House and the Minister to bear on the matter again.</P>
    <P>With regard to disability pensions, it is true that a small increase was given recently which was, indeed, much appreciated by the recipients, but it is a well-known fact that the money expended by the State in payment of disability pensions will decrease much more rapidly than the sum paid in any other kind of benefit. Because of the very nature of these pensions&mdash;they are disability pensions &mdash;everyone in receipt of them is, in the natural order of things, on the move out.  These recipients have a far less chance of drawing these pensions for any length of time than the recipients of any other pension.  As far as they are concerned, surely the position is that no sum of money will give them back their health.  I am sure it is the wish of every member of the Government, of every member of the Oireachtas and of every Irish man and woman who was grateful for their services in the struggle for the independence of this State, that they should be treated as generously as conditions will allow in the few short years that remain to them.</P>
    <P>In connection with the payment of dependents' allowances under the Army Pensions Act, I came across a rather sad case a few weeks ago.  In the Army Pensions Acts, provision is made for the payment of an allowance, <Col N="1680" /> which barely helps to keep body and soul together, to certain dependent relatives of I.R.A. men killed in action.  Under Section 4 of the Army Pensions Act, 1953, an allowance may be granted to a widow of such deceased person, or to one parent of such deceased person, or to one sister of such deceased person provided she is unmarried or a widow, or to one permanently invalided brother of such person; but, to our enternal reproach, there is no provision whatever for the invalid child of a man killed in action.</P>
    <P>The case I have in mind&mdash;I will give the Minister the name at some future date&mdash;is that of the son of a man who was killed in action in 1920.  The widow and child got an allowance, the child up to the time he reached the age of 16 and the widow up to her death.  That child is a grown man now, but I regret to say that he is practically totally incapacitated, owing to congenital paralysis and debility.  I have doctors' certificates&mdash;I think they are in the Department&mdash;to bear that out.  Surely it is a reflection on us and on our Government, on our country and on every member of the Oireachtas, that the orphan son of a man killed in action, this child who is totally incapacitated and therefore surely a dependent of that man who was killed, within the meaning of any of the Acts, cannot get an allowance from this State while, as I said before, there is provision in the Act of 1953 for the widow, parent, brother and sister of such a man.</P>
    <P>I thought this might be an opportune time for the Minister to correct that omission from the I.R.A. Pensions Acts.  I do not know whether there is any other such case in the country.  I have heard only of one.  The Minister may know of others or may have them on the record.  However, there should not be even one case of that type without some provision being made for it. I suggest to the Minister that Section 4 of the 1953 Act should be amended by adding a grant to such invalid child of a man killed in action, of an annual allowance, because provision is made for the other members of his family in that section.</P>
    <P>With regard to special allowances, I can make the same case for an increase <Col N="1681" /> as I made for increases in military service pensions and disability pensions. I feel there is a much stronger claim under this heading.  First of all, a special allowance is granted only to persons who are incapable of self-support and who have no other means. Therefore, a person in receipt of a special allowance is entirely dependent on it and if a case can be made for anybody in this State for assistance by way of an increase surely it can be made for the person who has no means beyond his special allowance? Again, from what I know of the Minister over the years and from his statements in connection with these matters from time to time, I am sure I am merely pressing an open door.</P>
    <P>I know it is rather late in the evening now and at the end of the session, to bring up this matter.  I was hoping, from time to time in the past few weeks, when I saw increases in other State pensions coming up, that this matter would be introduced before this session finished.  Now we have it from the Minister that some legislation is to be introduced early in the next session.  I was anxious to put these points before him, so that he would know the way the people I represent, so far as this motion is concerned, are thinking and the way we are hoping.  I would make a very special plea for consideration for the smaller pensions and for the special allowances.  Above all, I would like some clear decision as soon as possible, whether or not we have any other cases in the country like the one I have mentioned&mdash;that is, the invalid son or daughter, the invalid child, at any rate, of a man who gave his life for this country&mdash;and I trust that we will be able to say in the new year that that reproach on us will have been removed.</P>
    <P>I thank you, Sir, and I thank the Minister for giving me this opportunity to say these few words on this matter, even at this late hour.</P>

      <P>I must say that the Senator has made the case in a very reasonable <Col N="1682" /> frame of mind, on a reasonable motion, and indeed it is one of those cases in which I can be cited very prominently in support of the views he has expressed.  I have always felt&mdash;and I have said in the House&mdash;that those who rendered service to the State and those who suffered should have very special consideration given to them by the State.  I also expressed the view that those who said they had rendered service, but in fact did not although they claimed they did, should get very little consideration.  I think the Senator who sat down agrees with that proposition.  I regret to say a large amount of the difficulty we have had was created by these pseudo-claimants.</P>
      <P>Really, I do not know how to handle the case made by the Senator.  I have announced in the Dáil that the Government has approved of my proposal to amend the Act removing the date for applications for military service medals which will qualify holders for special allowances.  There are other amendments which I am in the process of drafting.  It is not easy to get everything I want, especially at the present time.  The Senator was very careful to avoid saying what he would suggest&mdash;something he should have done.  He did not make any suggestion as to what increases should be given or what the probable cost would be.</P>

      <P>He left us high and dry on that point.  He did, however, make the suggestion that there was a decreasing charge in some cases due to deaths.  That is not so; charges in regard to military service pensions are increasing every day.  That is so largely because the Military Service Pensions Board is still operating and new pensions are being granted at a greater rate than that at which holders of pensions are dying.  Thank God for that.  I do not want to see them dying.</P>
      <P>In regard to special allowances, the new cases coming on charge this year cost £50,000 and the number of those who died&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, they are fairly hefty young fellows in no danger of dying for a while.  In 1956, 1957 and 1958 a great number of those will reach the 70 mark and up to the present, under the special allowances regulations, a person has to be permanently disabled before he can qualify for special allowance, that is, he has to be totally incapacitated and unable to earn a livelihood. But the code also says that the moment he reaches 70 we deem him to be incapable of working and therefore the number will increase and the estimate in regard to that is very substantial.</P>

      <P>Short or long, it will mean a jump for which the Exchequer will have to find the money and that is a fairly big problem.</P>
      <P>When the Senator made a case in relation to everybody who has a medal no matter when he got it, whether before or after the date, he should remember it is a well-known fact that a large number of people who had the medal should never have got it.</P>

      <P>We have, therefore, reached the stage when the Minister for Defence must get some machinery by which that matter will be examined in full, so that only persons entitled to medals shall have them and so that, when entitled to a medal, they shall also be entitled to a special allowance if their circumstances warrant it.  I take it the Senator is anxious to be helpful but my proposals are under examination and are not submitted as a whole to the Government as yet.  I have submitted only one portion because I am&mdash;I hope&mdash;a good campaigner and tactician and I feel that if I moved to seek a sum of money to complete what I want to do, the proposal is of such a nature that I do not believe I would get it.  I prefer to hold my hand and keep something in reserve rather than meet an ignominious defeat when I believe, with patience, I shall probably win or go a long distance towards winning.  As <Col N="1684" /> this matter has been going on for a very long time, another few months will not matter either way, except in the case of the poor fellow who will die in between.  That is something we cannot avoid.</P>
      <P>The section concerning allowances for a disabled child was there prior to 1932.  I know of cases in which the allowance ceased in 1932.  There are disabled children of people who died who are now over 40 years of age and are still disabled but have got nothing. Is the Senator not very optimistic in asking me to change overnight what could have been done long ago?  He was a very prominent member of a Party and if he had pressed them as hard as he is pressing me&mdash;and I was prepared to help then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Pardon me, I must interrupt the Minister.  I said that this was the only one case that I have heard of so far, and that probably he had heard of others.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are others, but what I have said is true.  It was not done.  The Senator is very naive when he says there should not have been a date.  I want to remind the House that the Government of which the Senator was a supporter wound up the Military Service Pensions Board in 1946.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not make a Party matter of it.  I opposed that then and I intend to oppose it now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that it was wound up.  The door was closed and locked and the referee and the board sent home and no more cases were to be heard.  One of my predecessors, the late Dr. O'Higgins, brought in an amending Act in 1949 and he made certain calculations which, I am glad to say, erred in the wrong direction.  He outlined what he thought it would cost and his estimate was above what it is costing at the moment&mdash;but not much.  It was a very close estimate indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-day we have the Military Service Pensions Board still operating and I intend to give some figures to show the difficulty I am in.  Sixteen thousand people appealed under the 1949 Act <Col N="1685" /> and the Minister for Defence, when he was speaking at that time, said he thought 4,000 or 5,000 people who had not applied before, would apply then. The exact number of new applications was 4,600&mdash;that is, of people who had never applied before either under the 1924 Act or under the 1934 Act, for one reason or another.  Out of that, the number successful, in round figures, between old and new, is approximately 2,000.  There are 2,000 people who qualify for certificates of service under the 1949 Act&mdash;people who, if that Act had not been brought in, could never have got them.</P>
    <P>I said in 1954, when moving the first Vote for Military Service Pensions, that I was completely dissatisfied with the whole working of the Act.  I was merely repeating then in Government what I had said time after time in Opposition.  I also said that I intended to amend the Act, but I pointed out that the Referee and the board were working on the matter and that I expected they would wind up the cases then before them in a short space of time.  I said that I would then be in a position to review the whole situation and that I would bring in whatever amendment was found to be necessary. The argument used against that by my friends and opponents was that it would then be too late and that a lot of people would have passed on if I waited until that occurred.</P>
    <P>Having set up a Board and a referee in 1949 to deal with appeals and then, before he has heard all the appeals that are before him, do you think it would be right for me to come in and say: &ldquo;We will not let you hear any more appeals.  We are going to give an opportunity to the people to appeal against their appeal?&rdquo;  I submit that that would be a vote of no confidence in that board and, frankly, I cannot do it.  I have asked the referee to expedite the matter.  A thousand cases still remain to be heard.  At the rate at which he is doing it, the work ought to be finished about this time next year.  Then we shall all see what the picture is.</P>
    <P>I think the Senator should not press this motion, knowing as he does that <Col N="1686" /> he is pushing an open door.  He is aware that the Government is sympathetic towards the whole question.  He knows that the Government have undertaken to honour the bond I gave that every person entitled to recognition in respect of service rendered will get it, irrespective of which side of the fence he was on over the years.  There will be no political partisanship in it, good, bad or indifferent.  Each person will get his due, and I will do everything in my power to help.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to Senators to prevent the fellow who did nothing from getting something to which he is not entitled.  I have in mind the fellow who never rendered any service and whose dog did not even bark for us. We do not want to let him in.  It is causing us a lot of trouble.  You hear criticism all over the country about this person, that person or the other person getting something to which he is not entitled.  It is disgracing us all and it is causing a public scandal. Needless to say, it is a very awkward situation.</P>
    <P>I want to be fair to my predecessors in previous Governments.  The reason the date was inserted was to try to have some finality.  By inserting the date, you were forcing people to apply before a specified time, and while there were still people alive and well who were in a position to certify the service.  The longer this is left over, the more likely it is that the O'Sullivans and the MacEoins and many others will be dead and will not be able to certify.  Then, any fellow can say that MacEoin's mantle, Collins's mantle or somebody else's mantle fell on him and that, therefore, he was the cat's pyjamas.</P>
    <P>I am taking out the date for good. Remember, however, that the fellow who comes up now with an application will have to show good cause as to why he did not apply before this.  He will get a fair crack of the whip, at the same time.  There are some people in this country who rendered valuable service in the early days, but who do not accept the institutions of State as they are established here to-day.  Let us hope they will recognise them even for this purpose.  It would be of some <Col N="1687" /> benefit to us.  I hope they will make use of the opportunity they are getting.</P>
    <P>I assure the House and my old comrades that I will do everything that can reasonably be done and that is within the financial resources of the State at the present time, and, as things go on, we hope we will have better conditions for them.  The various Acts are of very great benefit.  I am satisfied that, if only those who are entitled to these benefits got them, everybody would get a reasonable crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>On the question of extending the special allowance to other dependents, we must wait until we see where exactly that will bring us.  From the information at my disposal, I would say that the figures in respect of 1957, 1958 and 1959 will be three times what they are to-day.  Notwithstanding that, Senator O'Sullivan says it is a decreasing liability.  There is a minimum figure there in relation to a person's means.  We increased the figures from under £100 to well over £100 for the <Col N="1688" /> single man and similarly for the married man.  More of these will come on charge.  To extend that to their dependents would be a very serious undertaking.  The dependents are covered at present.  Only when we see the whole picture will we have an opportunity of assessing the amount that is necessary and of the charge it will bring upon the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I want to get this matter cleared up and finished once and for all, if I can. I will make a great effort to do so.  I feel the time is long past when people should be mendicants at anybody's table, begging for something to which for all time so that a person will get what he is entitled to in law.</P>
