      <P>I received notice in writing from Senator Sheehy Skeffington stating that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House tonight, he proposed to raise the question of:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The circumstances surrounding the non-circulation in the Irish Republic of the <i>Observer</i> of Sunday 1st April and the Government's failure to make an early and frank public statement on the matter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I replied to the notice as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I have considered your notice for to-morrow's Adjournment regarding the non-distribution in the State of the <i>Observer</i> on Sunday, 1st April, <Col N="1762" /> 1956, and have made inquiries from the Ministers whose Departments may have been thought to have been implicated.  As a result, I have ascertained that no action was taken to prevent the distribution of this paper by or on the authority of any Minister.  In these circumstances I must rule that ministerial responsibility is not in issue and therefore the matter is not suitable to be raised in this manner.  Neither can your corollary&mdash;that the Government ought to be censured for non-publication of the facts&mdash;import into the case an element of Government responsibility where none existed.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;As a result, I have ascertained that no action was taken to prevent the distribution of this paper by or on the authority of any Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Would the Cathaoirleach say whether any such action was taken without the authority of the Minister by one of the Minister's officials&mdash;not &ldquo;by or on&rdquo; the Minister's authority, but, nevertheless, by one of his officials, acting without his authority?</P>

      <P>That was what he presented to me.  In my capacity as Cathaoirleach, I had to determine whether or not this was a matter which I would regard as in order under the particular Standing Order.

      <P>I accept the Chair's ruling, and I wish, under Standing Order 25, formally to move the Adjournment on a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, the failure of the Minister for Finance to ascertain the true facts regarding the hold-up of the <i>Observer</i> on April 1st by an officer or officers of the Customs and Excise Branch of the Revenue Commissioners, and/or having ascertained them to allay the widespread public concern by issuing a frank and early public statement.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment and of the three following amendments, which really all arise from the same intention, is to meet the point which was made, I think, by Senator Cox on Committee Stage with reference to Section 26.  Senator Cox argued that the inclusion of the condition that a person must be a citizen of Ireland, in addition to having a specified experience entitling him to registration, might operate to debar from registration a person who had been providing <Col N="1766" /> a satisfactory service before the Bill came into operation.</P>
      <P>As I indicated on Committee Stage, I was swayed by the argument made by Senator Cox and I undertook to meet the point on Report Stage.  The purpose of amendment No. 1 is, therefore, to exclude the wording in sub-section (2) which provides as a condition that the person must be a citizen of Ireland and to substitute therefor that his principal means of livelihood during the qualifying period must be that of carrying on the business of an ophthalmic optician within the State.  I take it, Sir, that the amendments may be taken together?</P>

      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>The following Government amendments were also agreed to:&mdash;</P>

      <P>3.  In page 12, Section 35, lines 22 and 23, to delete &ldquo;conditions that, on the establishment day, he was a citizen of Ireland and&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;condition&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>4.  In page 12, Section 35, lines 30 and 31, to delete &ldquo;conditions that, on the establishment day, he was a citizen of Ireland and&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;condition&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 15, Section 48, to delete sub-section (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1767" /> I moved this amendment on Committee Stage and withdrew it, hoping the Minister might be able to see his way to look into some modification of that section.  I do not want to go over the ground that was covered before. However, I have looked further into the position since and I feel that, whereas orthoptics is carried out under special supervision at present, under the Bill as envisaged it is not going to be under medical specialist supervision and is only very vaguely going to be under the supervision of the general practitioner.  I was wondering if the Minister would still consider leaving this question to a vote.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister said he was quite prepared to leave the matter to a decision of the House. Perhaps I might ask the Minister if he would still be prepared to let the amendment go on that basis.  I feel that quite a number of Senators share the same view as myself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is how I feel about this matter.  I undertook to the House, after the full discussion we had on the Committee Stage, to consider very carefully whether and in what way Section 48 could be amended to meet the views expressed by certain Senators. On this issue between myself and Senator ffrench O'Carroll and other Senators who raised the question of whether ophthalmic opticians should be entitled to engage in orthoptic treatment, I do not think there should be any compromise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made it clear that, so far as I was concerned, since the inclusion of this part of the Bill was a Committee amendment of mine in the Dáil, after due consideration I could not alter my view on it.  On the Committee Stage I advanced the reasons why I felt it was proper and fair, in the interests of the public, that this treatment should be carried on.  However, I was concerned about the point made by certain Senators that the wording of the last few lines of sub-section (3) might, though not intended, work an abuse inasmuch as advertising might take place.  The exclusion in sub-section (3), in relation to the representations <Col N="1768" /> which an ophthalmic optician might make, includes any representation that he was capable of or did carry on orthoptic treatment. The purpose of that particular saving was to take orthoptic treatment out of the general prohibition already contained in the Bill on various representations which an optician might make.  Having considered the matter carefully, I thought the best way of meeting the points raised in this House was by an amendment to Section 52.</P>
    <P>In the next amendment, Senators will notice that I propose to include, if the House agrees, in Section 52 a particular prohibition on advertising which will include advertising of orthoptic treatment.  In other words, the board itself may, under Section 52, in addition to a control of any advertising with regard to the prescription of spectacles by a registered optician, also include the control of advertising in relation to orthoptics by a registered optician.  I think that represents a very genuine attempt to meet the views expressed by certain Senators with regard to the danger of representations, almost amounting to advertising, by ophthalmic opticians in relation to orthoptics.</P>
    <P>I fear I must insist that the liberty to engage in orthoptics should be available to ophthalmic opticians, because, in fact, it represents the present position. The liberty is carefully circumscribed by the provisions in the Bill. It can only be exercised on the written direction of a registered medical practitioner who certifies he has examined the patient and directs a particular treatment.  I think, on the main issue, the provisions in the Bill are fair and reasonable, and the later amendment to prevent advertising is an effort to meet the views expressed by Senators on the subsidiary question with regard to making representations in relation to orthoptics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Professor Fearon Professor Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think some of us would be easier in our minds if the last two lines of the sub-section were deleted, that is, &ldquo;or from suggesting that he has provided or is capable of providing as aforesaid.&rdquo;  It seems to me that, if that means anything at all, it means that nothing is going to prevent <Col N="1769" /> him from advertising.  Now we are going to stop him from advertising later on.  Is this not an internal contradiction in the Bill?  I do not see what we gain by retaining these last two lines &ldquo;or from suggesting that he has provided or is capable of providing as aforesaid&rdquo;.  Surely we can stop at the end of the line above that.  I do not see why the ophthalmic optician can be told he can suggest when, a little later on, we tell him he must not suggest.  I think there is an internal contradiction there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put an example, which is generally the best way of getting a point of view across? The Senator, whether or not he agrees with it, concedes the necessity for permitting an ophthalmic optician, in accordance with the conditions laid down in sub-section (3), to engage in orthoptic treatment.  Accordingly, a medical practitioner who has examined the patient concerned sends him down to an ophthalmic optician to get the treatment laid down in the written direction.  The first thing the patient asks when he goes to the ophthalmic optician is: &ldquo;Will you give me the orthoptic treatment the doctor says I must get?&rdquo;  If the last line is left out, the ophthalmic optician must be silent, as otherwise he commits an offence.  If he says &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, then he is suggesting he is capable of providing the treatment which he is entitled to provide. That is a <i>reduction ad absurdum</i> and I do not think it is a thing to be desired. Accordingly, I feel that the main concern of Senators is to prevent the kind of unethical advertising which is largely aimed at under Section 52 and to give to the board control of any advertising in relation to orthoptics.  To remove the last two lines of sub-section (3) would, in effect, stultify the power contained in the earlier lines to ophthalmic opticians to engage in orthoptics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but I thought I might make a <Col N="1770" /> short comment as the Minister spoke a second time.  I wanted to say that I am sorry the Minister has not been able to alter that section, because I feel that we are taking a retrograde step, certainly in so far as this aspect of his work is concerned.  The amendment he has put forward will help in regard to the publicity side of it, but still leaves a very undesirable position with regard to orthoptics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider a further compromise, by omitting the words &ldquo;or is capable of&rdquo;?  It would then read that he was not prevented from saying he had done it. There is a good deal of force in the objection, because one does not generally see in an Act that you permit something to be done, nor does one generally consider it necessary to add that you may say that you can do what the Act permits you to do.  The very fact that these lines come in does seem to be rather strange, and almost to suggest that the person concerned is invited to put himself forward.  The Minister's amendment to the later section does make it clear that, subject to proper control under the regulations that are made, such a person could advertise.  Why bring it in here again in this way?  I would suggest that if you leave out &ldquo;or is capable of,&rdquo; you would be meeting the advertising complaint, but would still leave it open to that person to say: &ldquo;I have given that treatment.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am loth to get into this argument, but surely we are deciding in Section 48 that an ophthalmic optician may give orthoptic treatment and certificate to a person sent to him by a registered medical practitioner. If we are allowing that, surely, we must allow the ophthalmic optician to say not only that he has provided such treatment, but to hold himself out as a person who is capable of providing such treatment, because in the Bill we are providing that he is capable of it.  The objection taken, as I understand it, on the last occasion to the final words of sub-section (3) of Section 48, that they permitted advertising of an undesirable kind, is met by the Minister's amendment to <Col N="1771" /> Section 52, which means that advertisements of orthoptic treatment will be controlled by the board.  That may be left to the board, and if it is, why should we take any steps about the last lines of sub-section (3)?</P>
      <P>Senator Cox's suggestion that we should allow a man to say that he has given a certain kind of treatment but should not allow him to say that he is capable of giving the treatment which he has in fact already given would give you very extraordinary legislation. Surely the whole thing hangs together and is practicable and desirable, namely that a medical practitioner must send a person to an ophthalmic optician, and the ophthalmic optician will be allowed to carry out the treatment, but will only be allowed to advertise under rules drawn up by the board.  That surely meets the objection.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to close a loophole in the Road Transport Acts which was disclosed by a recent decision of the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>The Road Transport Act, 1933, provides that, except in certain exempted areas around the principal ports, no person may carry merchandise for reward by road in a mechanically propelled vehicle unless he is the holder of a merchandise licence.  It was accepted up to recently that the Act prohibited the hiring of a vehicle for the carriage of goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a recent case, a lorry owner hired his lorry to a building contractor on the understanding that the owner was to keep the lorry taxed and insured and was to provide a driver.  In practice he drove the lorry himself but this did not affect the legal position.  The lorry was used for the haulage of sand the property of the building contractor. <Col N="1775" /> Both parties were prosecuted for illegal haulage.  The defence pleaded that the arrangement between the defendants was a contract for the hire of the lorry and not for the transport of goods.  The district justice accepted this defence.  The case was brought to the High Court by means of a case stated and the High Court sustained the decision of the district justice.  The Attorney-General then brought an appeal to the Supreme Court, but this was dismissed.</P>
    <P>The loophole revealed by the Supreme Court's decision would frustrate very substantially the objects of the Road Transport Acts.  Anyone who has goods for transport could now hire a vehicle for this purpose even though the vehicle owner is not the holder of a merchandise road transport licence.  The vehicle could be hired for any period, long or short.  A group of persons or firms could combine together to hire a lorry between them and use it freely for the transport of goods owned by each of them individually. Moreover, enforcement of the Acts would become impossible.  It would be extremely difficult for the Gardaí to obtain satisfactory evidence of cases of illegal haulage, because the parties concerned would claim that the vehicle had been hired by the owner of the goods.  If this position were allowed to continue a large proportion of the merchandise road transport business carried on by the public transport concerns&mdash;C.I.E., G.N.R. Board and other railway companies&mdash; and by hauliers licensed under the Road Transport Acts would pass to unlicensed hauliers.  The existing organisation of public road transport would be jeopardised and the financial position of the public transport undertakings would be adversely affected. While the loophole will be closed by this Bill safeguards are provided for traders who may genuinely need to hire vehicles while their own are being repaired or overhauled.</P>
    <P>In recommending this Bill to the House, I should like to emphasise that the Road Transport Acts were designed to secure certain objects and were framed to give effect to a clearly defined <Col N="1776" /> transport policy.  It is now revealed that the Acts as drafted and enacted failed to give effect to the intentions underlying them.  Until the recent court decision, the Acts were accepted at their face value by all interests concerned.  In effect, therefore, the Bill imposes no new restriction or control on transport.</P>
    <P>During the debate on this Bill in the Dáil a number of Deputies expressed the view that having regard to developments since the Road Transport Act, 1933, was enacted our road transport legislation should now be reviewed with a view to introducing more flexibility into local transport in rural areas. It was argued that much of the traffic carried by horse and cart in 1933 now falls to be carried by mechanical transport and that compliance with the Road Transport Acts is unnecessarily restrictive on farmers.  Deputies considered that a farmer hauling his own goods locally by tractor or even by station-wagon should be able to oblige his neighbours and to make some reasonable charge for doing do.</P>
    <P>I undertook to have this matter specially examined to see to what extent it may be possible and practicable to effect some relaxation of the Transport Acts in favour of farmers without, at the same time, prejudicing the established interests of C.I.E. and the hauliers licensed under the Road Transport Acts.  This examination is proceeding but it would not be possible to take any steps in the matter in connection with the present Bill.</P>
    <P>As Senators may be aware, a private motion on this subject has since been tabled in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Níl fhios agam i gceart an cóir dúinn an Bille seo a rith tríd an Seanad i láthair na huaire seo go dtí go mbeidh caoi againn ar an gceist seo ceist tráchta na mbóithre a scrúdú go hiomlán.  Ní fheadar an bhfuil aon ana-dheabhadh leis seo mar Bhille.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil agus do dhealródh an scéal nach bhfuil aon ghéar-ghá leis, mar, chomh fada agus is cuimhin liom, tá an chuid is mó de bhliain caite anois ó thug an Chúirt Uachtarach an bhreith sin uathu, breith a thug buadh d'fheirmeoir áirithe maidir leis an Acht a ritheadh <Col N="1777" /> tríd an Oireachtas sa mbliain 1933.  Ní hamhlaidh, áfach, go mbéinn i bhfábhar é d'fhágaint mar atá sé, ach gur dóigh liom ná déanfaí aon díobháil don tír ná do C.I.É. dá bhfanaimís go ceann tamaill eile go dtí go mbeidh ceist tráchta na mbóithre scrúdaithe ag an Aire an ath-uair agus is maith liom a chlos go bhfuil an t-athscrúdú san á dhéanamh agus tá súil agam nach fada go mbeidh sé de chaoi againn díospóireacht iomlán, díospóireacht níos leithne, a bheith againn ar an gceist seo.</P>
      <P>Acht tábhachtach is ea an bun-Acht a chuireamar i bhfeidhm sa mbliain 1933 agus, tríd is tríd, d'oibrigh sé go maith, agus bhí gá leis mar Acht; ach dá fheabhas a bhíonn aon Acht, ní fhágann san ná tagann athruithe le himeacht aimsire agus go bhfaightear amach go dtarlaíonn rudaí ná raibh aon choinne leo nuair a bhítheas ag díospóireacht ar na cúrsaí a bhí i gceist an uair sin.  Ní mar a chéile cúrsaí na tuaithe maidir le feirmeoireacht agus aistriú stoic agus ábhair talmhaíochta ó áit go háit sa lá atá inniu ann agus an lá a bhí ann 23 bliain ó shoin.  Tá athrú mór tagaithe ar na cúrsaí sin go léir.</P>
      <P>I must confess that I have rather varied views on the measure we are discussing.  I know, of course, and I am at one with the Minister in this, that probably it would not be desirable to leave the position of transport here or any phase of it in a state of uncertainly.  It is always desirable to remove a state of uncertainly, but the question arises as to whether this is the best way of dealing with that position of uncertainty.</P>
      <P>This is what I would describe as <i>post factum</i> or stop-gap legislation, or whatever you like to call it, dealing with a particular situation, and I do not know whether the situation that has arisen would develop into so serious a situation as to influence us to have recourse to a stop-gap measure of this kind.  It would be far better, in my opinion, if we could wait until such time as the Minister and his Department have reviewed the whole transport situation of this country in the light of the changed circumstances that have arisen here since the passing of the Road Transport Act of 1933.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1778" /> The Minister may tell us that it would be too long to wait and that a certain amount of damage might be done by the time anything like a comprehensive measure was ready in his Department for introduction to the Oireachtas.  I do not know whether that would be the case or not, because, as far as I can recollect, it is now the most of 12 months since the Supreme Court gave that decision in favour of a certain member of the farming community down the country. If it has been found possible to wait for the most of 12 months before even having this measure we are now discussing put through the Oireachtas, why could it not have been possible to wait a few more months, or even six months, so as to give members of the Dáil and Seanad an opportunity of reappraising the transport situation in this country?</P>
    <P>That is a point of view I am putting before the Minister to-day.  I am not, as I have said, opposed to this measure.  I am one of those who believe that it is not right to leave any situation such as that which has arisen as a result of a decision of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance. The Oireachtas could deal with it, but, perhaps, the Oireachtas should deal with it in a different way from that in which they are dealing with it now. Again, we are inclined to approach this problem of public transport with our eyes always fixed on C.I.E.  I suppose that, in the nature of things, that is unavoidable.  It is necessary to make sure that the public transport system of the country is upheld and it is only to be expected that the country as a whole would be expected to bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>But there sometimes arises the doubt as to whether, perhaps, the community as a whole, or certain sections of it, may be expected to make too much of a contribution towards the preservation of the public transport system of this country.  The Minister himself referred to the farming community and, no doubt, it is quite right and proper to bear the interests of the farming community in mind when we are discussing this question of public transport and there are many people who believe that <Col N="1779" /> there should be a more flexible system of transport available to the farmers of this country than there is at the present time.</P>
    <P>Here again a question arises.  If, for instance, we left this position as it is and had not this measure before us at all to-day, and if the farmers were left to themselves to deal with the situation as their own ingenuity has dealt with it up to now, what loss would that be to the community as a whole and what loss would it be to C.I.E.?</P>
    <P>Again, there is another aspect of this question that comes before my mind and I think it was also dealt with in the Dáil.  If all sections of the community are expected to submerge their own interests to any extent from time to time for the upkeep of the public transport system of the country, how is it that there are certain sections who are entirely outside the scope of that position?  We have, as somebody mentioned in the Dáil, powerful lorries plying up and down the country on behalf of Messrs. Guinness.  They have nothing to do with the public transport of this country and they are being allowed to have their own system of transport.  The same applies to the oil lorries here which ply up and down on the roads of the country every day. They are not brought within the scope of the public transport system of this country.  They are allowed to ply entirely on their own.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has given any consideration to that particular aspect of the case because somebody could come along and say, and would be justified in saying: &ldquo;Why should the farmers of the country in an isolated locality be compelled to fall into line with whatever is considered the most beneficial public transport system to the community as a whole when those other interests are allowed to stay outside?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator misunderstands the position.  Under the Act passed in 1933&mdash;the Senator knows the Government that was in power then&mdash; anybody may buy a lorry and haul his own goods, whether as a farmer, a brewer or a petrol transporter.  Anybody may haul his own goods in his own <Col N="1780" /> lorry.  That is the position to-day and it is not proposed to interfere with that. The 1933 Act intended to create a situation in which a person who had an unlicensed lorry could not haul goods for reward.  By a device of hiring the lorry, it was sought to get behind the provisions which the Legislature thought were safely inserted in the 1933 Act. That is the only simple issue sought to be corrected in this amending Bill.  If a farmer wants to buy 100 lorries tomorrow to transport his own goods he may do so and it is legal for him to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that position, but what I am referring to is the restrictions that can and are being put on people for the sake of the public transport system.  If restrictions can be imposed in one direction, why can they not be imposed in other directions? However, I will leave it at that.</P>
      <P>I have nothing more to say on this measure, except that we hope that, in the near future, we shall have an opportunity of having a fuller discussion on the whole transport position, when, as we expect and as the Minister has told us, we may be discussing another and more comprehensive measure than that which we have here to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I approve of the Bill.  I must confess, however, that, probably foolishly, I am rather puzzled by Section 2.  The word &ldquo;hirer&rdquo; is rather ambiguous.  It might sometimes be used to mean the owner of the vehicle and it might sometimes be used in respect of the person who, so to speak, takes the vehicle on tender.  In legal language, one generally uses the word &ldquo;owner&rdquo; as proprietor and &ldquo;hirer&rdquo; as the tenant.  What rather puzzles me is that, in Section 2, it is the person who becomes, so to speak, the tenant of the lorry who is deemed to be carrying on the road transport business which I understand to be a business of hauling goods.  I should have thought that it is the person who is the owner of the vehicle who would be deemed by this ingenious device to carry on the road transport business. Whichever we say, the other party would, I think, be held to be conspiring <Col N="1781" /> to commit the offence.  I wonder if Section 2 is quite clear as to whether it is really the hirer and not the owner who ought to be deemed to be carrying on the business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any opposition to the passing of this Bill through the House.  Everybody must feel a considerable sympathy with those people who fought a successful action through the courts on this point and won their case.  It is, nevertheless, undesirable that we should have the kind of position which would be created by the court's decision.  Everybody would be hiring lorries from everybody else and it would become very difficult for the Gardaí or anybody else to know the real and actual owners.  Such a system would, in all probability, create a certain amount of dishonesty and would be very undesirable.</P>
      <P>A measure of this kind affords opportunities to members of this House to point out how unfair is the operation of the present transport system, particularly as it affects people living in rural areas.  In the days when the road transport of goods was mainly carried out by horse transport, and when public transport consisted mainly of rail transport, the position was entirely different.  At that time, a farmer could convey not only his own goods but the goods of his neighbour to the railway station, to a market town, to the seaport or to any other place by horse transport.  Now, the farmer who has got rid of his horses and who has substituted therefor a tractor of his own is not allowed to help his neighbours in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be argued that a farmer could carry goods the property of his neighbour as an act of charity without pay or reward and comply with the law, but I do not think anyone would envisage such a situation, because there are very few people who have goods to be transported who are not willing and anxious to pay for the transport of these goods in some form or other.  If, for example, a farmer conveys his neighbour's wheat or potatoes to the market, it is only right and proper that the neighbour, if he does <Col N="1782" /> not pay in cash, should recompense the farmer in some other way.  Thus, it could be argued that that service was for reward.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is investigating this matter, as he says he is, it should be examined very thoroughly and as far as possible the farmer's tractor should be placed in exactly the same position as the farmer's horse.  By that, I mean that the farmer who is a <i>bona fide</i> farmer, not a haulage contractor, should be allowed to carry his neighbours' goods for reward with his tractor and trailer to the same extent as he would heretofore have done with his horses.  It may be argued that such a concession would be abused and that, perhaps, a farmer might fit himself out with a fleet of tractors and trailers and proceed to carry goods on a very large scale for reward.  It would be quite easy to safeguard the position as far as that is concerned, provided it is accepted that this concession would apply only to a <i>bona fide</i> farmer, that is, a person who is deriving his living mainly from agriculture.  I think such a person should have a very wide freedom in the use of his tractor.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the agricultural tractor has come to stay and that the horse has gone absolutely and completely, as far as Ireland is concerned.  It may take a few years to eliminate the remainder, and, in a few mountainous areas, the horse may survive for a while, but, taking the country as a whole, the tractor will eventually take the place of the horse, because it is more economic and efficient. Therefore, it is in the interests of agricultural efficiency that a farmer who owns a tractor should be permitted to use it to the best possible advantage.</P>
    <P>There will always be some small holders or others who may not be able to undertake the transport of their produce by road and may need to avail of a neighbouring farmer's tractor, and it is only right that there should be give and take in a matter of this kind, as there always was in the past in regard to horse transport by road.  There is also a wider aspect of this question. The Minister may be inclined to impose restrictions and perhaps hardships on <Col N="1783" /> the farmer in order to sustain and support and bolster up the public transport company.</P>

      <P>I know that, but the Minister indicated as a sort of justification for getting this Bill through that he was actively considering this whole matter of meeting the just claims of those who feel that they are aggrieved by the operation of the present monopoly which safeguards the interests of C.I.E. and of licensed hauliers.  In that connection, perhaps, if the Minister sees that in his endeavour to be fair and just to the farming community and to those who desire greater freedom for their tractors and lorries, he may be jeopardising the interests of C.I.E., I would ask him to consider whether it is entirely desirable that C.I.E. should continue to operate a road transport service, or whether they should be relieved of the obligation of operating such a service, and requested to confine themselves to passenger transport by road and rail and to haulage of goods wholly by rail.  If it is proved that C.I.E. are not making a profit out of road transport of goods, then they might be anxious to be relieved of the obligation of carrying on that service, and it might be possible to substitute, through private enterprise, a cheaper service.  I do not intend to go into that matter further than that.</P>

    <P>Finally, I would like to ask the Minister, as this matter has come up for discussion, whether he would consider defining clearly what goods a farmer, for example, may carry, using his own tractor and trailer.  The farmer paying an £8 tax should be free to carry any commodity which he requires for use on his farm, or which he has to dispose of off his farm.  I do not object very much to the £8 tax, provided it enables the farmer to carry every commodity which it is necessary <Col N="1784" /> for him to carry in order to carry on his business as a farmer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as the Minister has said, is amending a flaw which has been discovered in the 1933 Road Transport Act, and is the third Transport Bill which the Seanad has had before it in the past few months.  It is right, therefore, to refer to the Bill against the background of the legislation which it amends and the experience we have had in the intervening years.  There is no dispute on any side of the House as to the intentions of the Oireachtas in passing the 1933 Act. I remember, when speaking to the Transport (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill here on 9th November, pointing to the flaw which had been discovered in the 1933 Act, and saying why I thought amending legislation should be introduced as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>It might be no harm if we reminded ourselves what exactly was in the Transport (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to which I refer, because it is obvious that we have forgotten some parts of it already.  That Bill provided permanent legislation for the exemptions from Section 9 of the 1933 Road Transport Act&mdash;for the carriage of milk and milk containers to and from creameries.  It also allowed the Minister to continue the practice of exempting, during a specified period each year, what we commonly call the grain season, the carrying of wheat by agents of millers for reward, without having a licence plate to do so.  In other words, the position is that milk and milk containers may be carried for reward, and so also may wheat during the grain season, without a licence to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another section of that same Bill amended previous legislation so as to facilitate C.I.E. in conducting experiments with light diesel units on branch lines which would otherwise be abandoned.  I recall that all sides of the House joined in welcoming the Minister's success in getting C.I.E. to conduct these experiments and reconsider its attitude.  I suggested at the time that the provision of this modern equipment would not be enough, unless more traffic was secured to public transport as well.  I pointed in support <Col N="1785" /> of that to the various reports of C.I.E. and the first report of the G.N.R. Board, all of which stressed the necessity for curbing illegal haulage and transferring some of the heavy traffic from road to rail, if organised public transport were not to collapse. The Seanad at a later date showed its confidence in the future of public transport by passing the Transport Act, 1955, which, amongst other things, increased the borrowing power of C.I.E. by some £5,000,000, so as to enable that undertaking to modernise and re-equip.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us remedies a flaw, as I said, in the 1933 Act, which, if not remedied, would quickly lead to the collapse of organised public transport in this part of the country.  Not alone would it jeopardise C.I.E., but also the G.N.R., the County Donegal Railways, the Londonderry and Lough Swilly, and the 900 licensed hauliers scattered throughout the country. The opportunity is being availed of to argue that the whole basis of the 1933 Act should be fundamentally reviewed. I think it is right that we should look at this critically, but with some knowledge of the background and appreciation of the overall position, not only in relation to the agricultural community, but to the whole national position.  The viewpoint which has been expressed is, understandably&mdash; and this is admitted&mdash;a partisan viewpoint, being related to the agricultural community only; but I want to suggest to the advocates of this fundamental change that they might find that it is the agricultural community who would suffer most if the whole basis of organised public transport were undermined as is suggested.</P>
    <P>Senator Cogan made a point here to-day that the horse as a means of transport has virtually disappeared in this country and has been replaced by the tractor.  Some figures which I have show that, in August, 1954, there were about 23,000 tractors in the country and 313,000 horses, 260,000 of which were engaged by or owned by the agricultural community.  In other words, in spite of the assertion that the horse has virtually disappeared, he still outnumbers the tractor by 11 to one.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1786" /> We are told that, as the tractor has replaced the horse, the same facilities to carry for reward should be given to the tractor as the horse had prior to 1933 and since then.  I was rather young in 1933, but I do have some memories of spending a lot of time on farms, and I wonder whether people who have more knowledge of the situation would agree with my estimate of the position.  That is that, prior to 1933, every farmer had either a horse and cart to transport his own goods to give him a service or, if he were on a smaller scale, he had a donkey and butt, as we used to call it down in County Kerry.  In fact, it was not the general practice to any extent to carry for reward because every farmer had his own means of transport.</P>
    <P>Has that position changed since then?  If a farmer has got a tractor in the meantime, he still has his own means of carrying his own goods and he is quite free to do so.  If he has not got a tractor in the meantime, I suggest he still has a horse and cart, though probably not the same horse. He still services himself by his own horse and cart.  In addition, he now has the organised public transport of the State to give him additional services, plus, as I said, the 900 licensed hauliers, plus also the exemptions which we gave under the Transport (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill some months ago of carrying for reward milk, milk containers and grain.  I think that it would be very wrong that this bubble should be blown up too high altogether.</P>
    <P>I note particularly that the representative of Fianna Fáil, namely, Deputy Lemass, who has most expert knowledge of transport and the needs and difficulties of it, does not apparently attach too much weight and has not declared so far in favour of this general assertion that the 1933 Act should be reviewed so as to release the farming community from supposed restrictions. I suggest these restrictions are supposed and, from some of the speakers here to-day, it is obvious that the restrictions are more in their own minds than in actual operation.</P>
    <P>I referred to the 900 licensed hauliers who service the community in addition <Col N="1787" /> to the public transport undertaking, and it should be noted that these operators are not required to be common carriers.  In other words, they have greater freedom and do not operate under such stringent conditions as public transport undertakings. In fact, they can supply a local service to the local community more adequately and more economically in many cases than the organised public transport undertakings, which have to operate under different conditions.  I do not think that any of us here, in this part of the country anyway, would be so rash as to advocate that the public transport undertakings should be released from their common carrier obligations.  That is of great value, not alone to the commercial people of this country, but also to the agricultural community throughout the country and the fishermen operating from our ports.  It means that a service must be operated, whether there are one ton or 100 tons offering, one box of fish or 100 boxes of fish.  The service must be given all the time, must operate on a schedule and must be available.</P>
    <P>The point was made here to-day again that the tractor should be allowed to carry goods, and particular reference was made to the farmer carrying his own goods on the £8 licence fee.  I think that Senator Cogan will know that the agricultural community are already getting very favourable concessions for their tractors, both in regard to taxation and the taxation of fuel.  The position is that a tractor owned and operated for agricultural purposes is subject only to a 5/- per annum agricultural tax, provided it is used only within the farm or to and from a farm, unloaded, except for agricultural implements.</P>
    <P>Then there is a heavier tax, the £8 tax to which Senator Cogan refers, and there is no restriction whatever going with that £8 per annum tax in regard to the conveyance of agricultural produce; but, of course, they are precluded from carrying for reward the same as anybody else owning a tractor or a lorry, unless they are specifically licensed to do so.  As I <Col N="1788" /> said, the agricultural community has in addition substantial rebate of taxation on fuel.</P>
    <P>Making a comparison, the taxation to which I refer on tractors for agricultural purposes&mdash;5/- per annum to £8 per annum&mdash;compares with the ordinary commercial rate of £21 10s. per annum, which is the very lowest, up to £45 per annum.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it would be pertinent to throw this point into this debate and make a comparison with the similar situation which was allowed to develop in Northern Ireland.  We are aware&mdash;the Minister more than anybody else probably&mdash;of the difficulties of public transport in Northern Ireland at the present time.  The advocates of this freedom, this release from supposed restrictions, might have the benefit of this argument.  I make them a present of it.  Under the Northern Ireland Transport Act of 1948, farmers as such are allowed to carry for reward for neighbours who live within a mile of themselves.  They can carry for reward for those neighbours and we do know that is one of the reasons why public transport in Northern Ireland has got into such a terrific mess and the advocates of this release, of this freedom to the farmers to carry for reward, might have regard to the interests of the community as a whole and not their own particular sectional viewpoints.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting to the Seanad that the very material concessions given to the agricultural community in regard to tractors is designed to encourage production in agriculture.  They are designed to encourage the farmers to own and operate tractors, so that they can increase the productivity on their farms.  I do not think it was ever the intention to encourage them to buy tractors so as to enter into competition with other transport concerns, that they should branch out and become licensed hauliers or unlicensed hauliers as is suggested.</P>
    <P>I think that the difficulties which would be created by the giving of such freedom to the agricultural community would lead to a state of chaos which would be to the detriment of the <Col N="1789" /> farmers eventually, because what would happen is that every second farmer would be encouraged to set up his son as a haulier.  That is all right while the lorry or the tractor is new. They can go hell for leather up and down, but they will quickly find out&mdash; it is the experience here and in Northern Ireland prior to 1933&mdash;that such freedom is not worth while in the end. It means that these people cut their own throats and run themselves down to the rims of their wheels, and they and the general community are the poorer in the long run.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest very seriously that no adequate case has been made for a fundamental revision of the 1933 Act. I want to make a point that the people in Fianna Fáil who know the subject and who know the problem do not apparently favour it themselves.  I want to make the point also that the people who are advocating this removal of restrictions are not aware of the freedom they at present have and are in many cases imagining restrictions which do not exist.</P>
    <P>I have pointed to the freedom which at present exists and the concessions which are made and I do not think that it can be fairly said that the operation of the 1933 Road Transport Act places the farming community now in any worse position than they were in prior to its operation.</P>
    <P>The farming community have adequate transport and it cannot be said that there is a fundamental need for them to be allowed to carry for reward, so as, they say, to oblige their neighbours.  There are good facilities at the moment.  Each farmer has his own means of transport, whether it is horse and cart or a tractor; and the horse, as I have shown, has not been wiped out of Ireland yet. They still outnumber the tractors by 11 to one.</P>
    <P>I think that a far better case will have to be made for any easement in the 1933 Act than has already been made.  The difficulty which would be created would be very severe.  If the people who want such freedom are prepared to come along, at the same time, and say: &ldquo;We recognise that this would greatly jeopardise transport <Col N="1790" /> and we are in favour of the principle of subsidising public transport&rdquo;, well, then, there would be more meat in what they are saying, but at the moment they do really want to have their cake and eat it.  I think greater thought and more detailed study of this situation should be made before our whole experience, our background and our organised public transport here should be scrapped having decided only a few months ago to go ahead and spend many more million pounds in modernisation and re-equipment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the 1933 Road Transport Act was passed principally in order to bolster up the falling traffic on rail in regard to the carriage of merchandise and to prevent as far as possible the cut-throat competition from road transport.  It was naturally desirable that, if the railways were to be maintained, the transport of goods by road running parallel with a railway should be discouraged as far as possible. At that time, 20 years ago, most firms still continued to transport their goods by rail, but now, as Senators have already remarked, such firms as Messrs.  Guinness and Smithwick transport the bulk of their products by road transport.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note that the Minister states his Department are considering a more flexible position in rural areas in favour of farmers.  Senator Murphy referred to the fact that in Northern Ireland farmers may transport goods for their neighbours approximately one mile, but I do not agree with the Senator's suggestion that the chaos that now arises in connection with Northern Ireland transport is due to that position. In fact, a reversion to private enterprise as far as road transport generally is concerned, is being seriously considered in Northern Ireland. The position has altered considerably in a good part of this State in connection with the transport of merchandise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reside in an industrial village which is 25 miles distant from the rail head from which goods are distributed.  A great part of the north and west of Donegal is even further distant from any railway than the 25 miles I have mentioned.  The cost of the transportation <Col N="1791" /> of goods by road is higher per mile than the cost of transportation by rail.  Therefore, the people in those areas have to pay higher charges for the transportation of their goods than they would if there were a railway in their district.  There are practically no horses and carts left in my area, due to the fact that the people are small uneconomic holders.  Many of them have not even horses.  They depend on a few tractors to do the work.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy said the donkey and cart were in Kerry in 1933.  I can assure Senator Murphy that there are very few donkeys in Donegal and we never used that animal very much at any time.  Once the horse went, the people depended to a great extent on tractors.  These tractors can operate satisfactorily for only a short distance. I feel that agricultural produce could be transported more cheaply, more economically and more expeditiously by private enterprise.  I am convinced that if the rural community had any say in the matter, they would be entirely in favour of permitting such vehicles to transport agricultural and other produce for reward for their neighbours.</P>
    <P>We are continually hearing the cry that only by increasing our agricultural output can this State improve its economic position.  We should take the opportunity which this Bill presents to do something of a practical nature for the farmer in his essential work for the future prosperity of the State.  A railway company which has a complete monopoly of transport, or the carriage of merchandise for reward by road, can be responsible for a considerable wastage.  In my opinion, it is responsible for freight charges being too high, particularly for the farmer who has to sell a considerable amount of his produce in the world market.  We are already priced out of the world market as far as eggs, pigs and butter are concerned and, with the falling price for our cattle, any assistance we can give to the rural people to help them in their work should be given.</P>
    <P>With regard to wastefulness, I should <Col N="1792" /> like to mention that I am aware that in my county, railway lorries have to travel up to 82 miles to do a single journey of 16 miles and transport cattle from one fair to another because suitable lorries with cribs for the transportation of cattle are not available any nearer.  They are headquartered in Stranorlar and must go a considerable distance to pick up these cattle and return again to their base.  I am also aware that Lough Swilly Railway lorries which have gone to Dublin with merchandise have had to return empty, despite the fact that the person for whom that merchandise was being brought had a return cargo to be brought back.  Because the G.N.R. had a transportation monopoly in respect of part of this State, the Lough Swilly Railway lorries had to return empty from Dublin to North Donegal.</P>
    <P>If local lorries could be employed in many of these cases, a considerable reduction in the cost of produce could be effected.  For instance, the local authority is not permitted, as the Minister is aware, to employ lorries for the carriage of road material, but a railway company are entitled to employ private lorries.  They deduct 10 per cent. from the amount being paid and they pay the 90 per cent. to the private lorry owner.  I think, therefore, it is wrong that local authorities should be compelled to employ public transport lorries for the transportation of such material.  If local or private lorries were permitted to do so, it would help to supplement the income of those private lorry owners who could do such good work for the farming community during the slack periods.  I do not think it was the intention of the 1933 Act that local authorities should be restricted in that way.</P>
    <P>I understand that recently in our county, in consequence of the decision of the Supreme Court, private lorries have been employed at £5 a day, when the railway company lorries were charging £9 a day for the same work. If a public transport company have a complete monopoly of public transport, there is always the danger of a lightning strike.  The whole transport system could be paralysed and that might have a serious effect on agricultural <Col N="1793" /> produce of a perishable nature. For that reason, the staff and the employees of a railway company are in a privileged position.  I suggest that their wages are higher in proportion to the wages of other people engaged in a comparable type of work.  They are certainly much better off than those depending for an existence on the produce of the small farmer.</P>

      <P>Senator Murphy referred to the Lough Swilly Railway Company.  He knows well that that is not a railway company at the moment at all.  They have no railway system whatsoever.  It is entirely a road system and last year paid a very substantial dividend on its profits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a few words to what has been said by the speakers on this side of the House.  The Minister told us that the Bill was for the purpose of closing a loophole in the transport laws.  I would prefer to have the transport laws with the loophole, and, in saying that, I think I express the views of the whole farming community.  Agriculture needs more competition in road transport. The cheaper and more efficient road transport and transport generally that we have, the greater agricultural production will be.  Everybody seems to desire that increased agricultural production should be attained and be the salvation of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1794" /> Senator Murphy has stated that the speakers on this side of the House put up a very weak case.  In reply to that, I would say that I hope the farming community will not have any opportunity to read the speech made by Senator Murphy.  I would not like a speech like his to go out to the farming community, because it would undoubtedly depress agricultural production, instead of stimulating it.  The Minister referred to the 1933 position and said that the Transport Bill was brought in by the Fianna Fáil Government at that time.  The position to-day is very different from what it was then.  Senator Murphy gave some statistics about horses and tractors.  I do not know exactly what he said, but I think he said the proportion was 11 to one.  I doubt if those statistics are correct.  I know from what I see, being in touch with the country, and different parts of it, every day, that the horse is completely gone.  When a horse remains on a farm, he is there more as an ornament, or rather out of kindliness to the animal, than for work.  The roads are steam-rolled, and horses cannot travel on them, and the production of crops by horse work is antiquated and completely gone.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that he was having the position examined with a view to doing something to relax the regulations so that a tractor and trailer and a jeep or station wagon could be hired by one farmer to his neighbours.  I think the Minister is on the right line there and I would encourage him to develop along those lines, and, further, to realise what the position is to-day.  The horse is completely gone and the tractor has taken its place.  Road transport is not satisfactory from the farmer's point of view.  Transport laws are a heavy burden on the farming community, and the cheaper and more efficient our road transport is the greater agricultural production will be.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned strikes.  I do not like to say anything that would worsen the position of the railway company.  It is bad enough.  I would like to see it in a very thriving way. Two or three years ago, the transport section of the railway, who were carrying <Col N="1795" /> a good deal of beet for the factories, went on strike in the middle of the season.  The railway lorries were on strike, and were it not for the fact that there were private lorries available here, there and everywhere, the position would have been very difficult. The beet would have remained in the fields, and the factories would be paralysed and the beet growers paralysed, so that the situation is not as cheerful at all as Senator Murphy would have the House believe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephMeighan" hpid="Mr. Meighan Mr. Meighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meighan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse everything said by some of the previous speakers, for the reason that, in rural Ireland, the backward parts of it, as Senator Walsh has pointed out, the farming community suffer from great inconvenience.  Attending fairs, for instance, it is not always very easy to get public transport to come out at any hour of the night, and usually fairs are held very early because it suits the farmers to travel early and get home early.  Undoubtedly the question is serious in regard to horse traffic.  On my journeys from the West of Ireland to Dublin for the past couple of years, I have not come across 20 horses and carts on the road.  It is impossible, practically, for horses to travel on the roads.  Apart from the dangerous slippery surface of the modern road, the traffic of heavy vehicles makes it impossible to take a horse out now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody will agree that, in modern times, it would not pay, from the economic point of view, to leave a man in charge of a horse.  That is borne out by the fact that merchants throughout the country, people who had horses and carts taking their stuff from the railways in years gone by, have given up the horse for the simple reason that they found it too expensive. In these times, it is too slow to have a man entirely engaged on such work.  I definitely think that the Minister is on the right lines in what he has in mind, and I would urge him on in that respect with regard to tractors and trailers in the backward places.  I do not see why the Dublin transport people should have a monopoly within a 15 mile radius and we should not <Col N="1796" /> allow the same to apply to parts of rural Ireland situated long distances from railways.</P>
    <P>I did not think the situation in Donegal was as bad as was pictured by Senator Walsh, but definitely not alone in Donegal, but anywhere in the West of Ireland, the position is pretty bad, even for passenger service at the present time.  The people say that between Dublin and Ballaghaderreen, you can only get down in the morning by train&mdash;one service.  I endorse the statements made by the members of the Opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerMcHugh" hpid="Dr. McHugh Dr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer merely to one matter which seems to affect the whole question of public transport as against private transport.  Senators have been discussing at some length various aspects of the matter and the monopoly which they said C.I.E. had. I should like to refer to a statement issued on 21st January by the National Farmers' Association in connection with the Transport Bill which appeared to be hostile to the Bill.  Some of their arguments did not impress me very particularly, but they stated that co-operatively owned lorries should be allowed to carry the goods of members, as otherwise small farmers would be penalised.</P>
      <P>I am not sure whether that statement arises from a misreading of the Act, but I do say that anything in the Transport Bill which would militate against the provisions which the National Farmers' Association desire would be a bad thing.  I think it will be agreed that the forward movement in farming has proceeded along cooperative lines and consequently I would ask the Minister to say whether in fact this Bill bans co-operatively owned lorries from carrying the goods of members of the association or not.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the statement made by Senator Meighan that it is difficult to get C.I.E. lorries to go to the fairs.  I have never heard complaints in that regard and I have seen these lorries at all hours of the morning and night carrying cattle from the fairs.  As far as the fishing business is concerned, the same thing <Col N="1797" /> occurs and I have never heard any complaints.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know they have.  I want to say that, generally, looking at the whole position of transport, so far as private lorries are concerned, I have seen these lorries in Cork City from places as far distant as Castleisland and Cavan.  They can be seen going round the various warehouses in Cork and selecting the choice goods they want to carry, leaving C.I.E. to carry the awkward goods and the non-paying traffic.  That created a difficult situation for C.I.E.  These private lorries are operating to a high degree and picking the best of the goods on offer for transport, and yet they are to be seen around the town all day long and they are operating without regard to trade union wages and conditions.</P>
      <P>There should be some regulation to deal with the whole system of transport because, in the present chaotic conditions of road transport, there is great expense on everybody in maintaining the system we have in this country at present.  It is unfair that that system should be allowed to develop. Most of these lorries are being operated by men who were paid high compensation when they were taken over under the original Transport Act and they have now come back as big transport operators.  As far as road transport in this country is concerned, it has become chaotic and something should be done to deal with the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is dealing with one particular issue, and that is to close a loophole which was opened in the Act by the recent decision of the Supreme Court.  Between 1933 and 1955, the Transport Act was interpreted in a particular way, but, as a result of the court's decision, it was found that the accepted interpretation was not apparently in accordance with the legal interpretation.  The simple purpose of this Bill is to close that loophole in the legislation created by the court decision.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not deal with the wide prairie-like land imparted to it in the course of the discussion.  It seems to me that there is really an inadequate appreciation of many of the factors which must be adverted to, if we are to have an intelligent approach to the solution to whatever transport problems there are at present.</P>
      <P>For instance, it has been stated here by many Senators that C.I.E. has a transport monopoly.  Of course, the Senators who say that are indebted to their imagination for their statements. The facts are that in 1949 there were 23,000 goods vehicles on the roads.  By 1954 that figure had gone up to 37,000 and I think the present figure is over 40,000.  Therefore, you have 40,000 vehicles on the roads now and every single one of these vehicles is in competition with C.I.E.  Therefore, to say that C.I.E. has a monopoly, when there are more than 40,000 goods vehicles on the road, is to misstate the whole situation.  C.I.E. has no monopoly in respect to road transport.  Every one of those vehicles is a competitor of C.I.E., and if those vehicles were not there, C.I.E. would be getting the traffic which they are getting.  If there were only half of those vehicles on the roads, then C.I.E. would be getting the corresponding portion of the traffic.</P>

      <P>The number of vehicles <Col N="1799" /> on the roads in 1939 was 8,000 and to-day it is 40,000.  It is easy then to realise how much traffic C.I.E. has lost by reason of the fact that the number of lorries has increased from 8,000 to 40,000.  Whatever complaints there may be about C.I.E., and I am sure there are many, it cannot be said that they have a monopoly.  Every single one of those other lorries is carrying goods which C.I.E. would be carrying, if it had a monopoly, because the other lorries would not then be permitted to carry these goods.</P>
      <P>Senator Kissane, I think, said, or game me the impression, that he believed that the purpose of this Bill was to help the railway companies exclusively in the matter of these goods. What he overlooked was the fact that there are over 1,000 licensed hauliers on the road, that is, people licensed to carry merchandise and who make their livelihood by doing so.  They do so by getting the traffic in whatever way they can.  The man who has to fight to go on existing is the licensed haulier.  He has got some interest in this matter. His interests have been built up and may have been acquired by the purchase of a lorry for which he paid a substantial sum because it had a merchandise licence, and, if you are not to deal with the problem now thrown up by reason of the Supreme Court decision, you do a very grave injury to the livelihood of that man, who may well have invested his entire savings in the purchase of a lorry, because that lorry had a merchandise licence attached to it.</P>
      <P>This Bill, therefore, merely restores the position as the Legislature intended it should be, and the architect of the 1933 Act, Deputy Lemass, supported this Bill in the Dáil, admitting there that what had now been revealed was something which the Legislature did not intend to leave as a loophole, when the 1933 Act was being passed. It has been suggested we ought to give this a run for 12 months.  We can do that, of course, if we want to make up our minds that we are going to pick out the unlicensed haulier and let him have a Klondyke for the next 12 months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and let him hire his lorry at whatever price he can get for it because of this loophole, a loophole which the Legislature did not believe was there.  If we do not close this gap now, the licensed haulier is going to be injuriously affected and the public transport companies are going to be injuriously affected.  I do not know whether the Seanad feels it is equitable that the licensed haulier&mdash;the man who puts his money into his licensed business in the transport field&mdash;should be injuriously affected merely because of a flaw which the Legislature never intended to be left in the legislation, and that this flaw should be availed of by the unlicensed haulier to harm the licensed man and, at the same time, to harm the public transport companies.</P>
      <P>The Seanad may want to wash its hands of concern for the public transport companies, but it cannot do that. If the public transport companies go down, the Legislature will have to find the money, because the public transport companies cannot be allowed to go bankrupt; and, if they are going to have serious inroads made upon them to the extent that it affects their ability to pay, then the State will have to come to the aid of the public transport companies.  Should it be asked to do that merely for the purpose of allowing the unlicensed haulier to make hay, while this legal sun shines on him under the recent Supreme Court decision?  I do not think that is a realistic approach to the problem, and I think what we are doing here is something which, on reflection, must earn the commendation of all the Senators who are really concerned with an intelligent approach to this whole problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard with dismay some Senators advocate getting back to a free-for-all in the field of the transport of goods. I wish some of the Senators who spoke in those terms to-day would read the speech of the Minister who introduced the 1933 Act.  We had free enterprise then without restriction in this field, but the position was so chaotic and conditions of employment so appalling <Col N="1801" /> that the Legislature felt it necessary to introduce the regulation provided by the 1933 Act.  The free enterprise which was there then was something which induced the Legislature, both Dáil and Seanad, to end it, because the cut-throat competition and chaos were so bad and called for intervention by the Legislature.  Is it seriously suggested now that, 23 years after that legislation was enacted to bring some kind of order into the transport industry, we have progressed so far that we want to go back to the chaotic conditions which existed prior to 1933 and to go back to them in conditions which would be a thousand times worse to-day, because at that time we were dealing with a very small number of road vehicles in the transport field? To-day, we have got to deal with a problem of over 40,000 vehicles competing with the licensed hauliers and the public transport companies.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that C.I.E. was a kind of transport octopus from the way people spoke about competition from C.I.E. lorries to-day.  The fact of the matter is that the total number of vehicles on the road is over 40,000 and the total number of lorries owned by C.I.E. is 636.  The total number of all freight vehicles, including vans, trailers and everything else, is 1,072, so that, as far as the generality of the conveyance of goods by road is concerned, that is the total number of vehicles C.I.E. has on the road.  There are about 1,000 licensed hauliers as well.  So it is clear that, as far as the generality of freight transport is concerned, there is no serious impact by these 2,000 lorries on the 40,000 vehicles which day after day are being utilised to their maximum capacity&mdash;probably to a greater extent than C.I.E.&mdash;in the transport of goods up and down the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox asked some questions on Section 2 of the Bill.  This was a rather difficult section to draft so as to ensure that the purpose of the Bill was achieved, while at the same time hardships were not imposed on people whom it was not desired to catch in the section.  The section provides if a person, who is not a licensed haulier, hires a lorry for the carriage of goods, <Col N="1802" /> the hirer shall be deemed to be carrying on a merchandise road transport business.  Thus the hirer will be contravening the provisions of Section 9 of the 1933 Act.  The owner will not commit an offence under this Bill in letting his vehicle for hire.  It is necessary in this section to stipulate that it should be the hirer and not the owner who shall have committed an offence.  Firstly, if the contract of hire is a genuine one, then the vehicle is removed from the control of the owner and he cannot fairly be held to be responsible.  Secondly, it is intended that a licensed haulier shall be permitted to hire a lorry replacing his own while it is out of order, subject to the provision in the Transport Act of 1933 and the relative section of the 1944 Act.  A further reason for drawing the section in this way is that it has been the practice of C.I.E. to hire lorries from other parties to deal with peak traffic and to ply them for the purpose of their business.  When Senator Cox realises that it was necessary to make provision for these exemptions, I think he will see the necessity for drawing the section in the way in which it has been drawn.</P>
    <P>Somebody raised a question of what we are doing in respect of permitting farmers to utilise tractors for the purpose of conveying goods for their neighbours.  That opens up so many wide avenues that I do not propose to prejudge the issue at this stage.  There are, however, a number of difficulties which must be adverted to before one can come down on one side or the other in connection with this matter. Some Senators appear to have found considerable difficulty in finding horses around the country, but the facts show that, in 1933, there were 332,000 horses used in agriculture and the statistics show that, in 1955, there was still a total of 248,000 horses being used in agriculture.  Now, they must be in the country somewhere.  These are the returns which we get from the Central Statistics Office and, therefore, whatever case is to be made for permitting the farmer to use his tractor in some limited way for some limited purpose, it clearly cannot be grounded on the fact that the horse has left Ireland. They still approximate to a quarter of <Col N="1803" /> a million.  Whatever argument there is for giving farmers facilities in the use of tractors must be based on some ground other than the disappearance of the horse.</P>
    <P>There are other matters to be considered. A farmer who operates a tractor on the road will have preferential terms in the way of a subsidised licence and he will get subsidised fuel as well.  Is he to be allowed, with a subsidised licence and subsidised fuel, to carry goods for reward?  The farmer is not bursting to do this, unless there is some element of reward in it.  This, surely, cannot be a one-way traffic.  He is not going to be loaded up every morning with his friend's produce and told to take it wherever the friend suggests. There has got to be some give and take in this matter.  I take it the farmer who is going to use his tractor for this purpose is going to put out his hand to be paid.  If he is going to compete for traffic with the licensed haulier or with the public transport company, is he to be allowed to do it with a subsidised licence and subsidised fuel?  Is he to be allowed to do it without regard to any of the other considerations of which the licensed haulier must take serious notice and of which the public transport company must take statutory notice, before it can contemplate partaking in such traffic?</P>

      <P>But the fuel is beside the tractor.  While mouse traps do not run after mice, the mice nevertheless manage to get into them very quickly and we must make sure that nobody is exposed to a temptation which his human frailty makes it impossible for him to resist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter requires to be investigated to see what is the right and equitable thing to do and how we should protect those who have built up an interest in the transport business. I propose to appoint a departmental committee who will carry out an examination of the problem and then to tell the House at some later <Col N="1804" /> date what we have found as a result of that examination.</P>

      <P>The point I want to make is this, that many farmhouses are a considerable distance in from the road and tractors can go in there, where lorries might not be able to go.

      <P>One other point raised by Senator McHugh was the position of co-operative organisations.  A co-operative organisation can use its own lorry for the purpose of transporting its own goods, but own lorry and own goods operate in a co-operative sense.  They do not operate in the sense that an individual in a co-operative society can use his share of the lorry for the purpose of transporting his share of whatever goods may be in the co-op.  A co-operative society can operate its own lorry to transport its own goods. There is no difficulty in that at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is a further step in the direction of allowing the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946, to expire.  It re-enacts the provisions of the current Orders relating to tea made under that Act, the effect of which is to prohibit (a) commercial importation of tea by any person other than Tea Importers, Limited, and (b) wholesale dealing in tea by any person who is not the holder of a tea wholesaler's licence issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Senators will wish that I should indicate the circumstances that gave rise to these Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the 1939 war the bulk of the tea consumed in this country was purchased in, and imported from, London.  On the outbreak of war the distribution of tea was controlled by the British Ministry of Food which promised that this country would be given its due proportion of the available supplies for which there was an unanswerable case in view of the prewar practice.  The British Ministry of Food failed to implement this promise and in consequence from the early months of 1941 there was an acute shortage of tea in this country which involved the community in serious hardship.  In order that this hardship might be relieved so far as possible, Tea Importers, Limited, a State sponsored non-profit-making company, was set up in April, 1941, for the purpose of purchasing and importing from every available source supplies of tea to supplement the meagre allocation from Great Britain.  The company's purchases were financed from a bank overdraft guaranteed by the Minister for Finance and their efforts were successful resulting in appreciable additions <Col N="1806" /> to the weekly tea ration when most needed.</P>
    <P>At the end of 1946 the Governments of India and Ceylon took action which precluded the British Ministry of Food from purchasing tea for re-export and this country was duly advised by that ministry that all allocations from London would cease as from the 1st April, 1947.  Production of tea in 1947 was still substantially lower than demand necessitating the continuance of rationing here and elsewhere.  In the circumstances arrangements for the importation of our tea requirements from origin had to be brought into operation as a matter of urgency. At that time the total production of tea had not caught up on world demand and it was considered undesirable that there should be competition for the limited supplies available between Irish buyers with the necessary financial resources to operate on their own account on the Calcutta and Colombo markets.  It was also considered necessary at that time to ensure that the smaller Irish wholesaler was not placed at any disadvantage in securing a fair share of the available supplies at reasonable prices. Accordingly, in agreement with the wholesale tea trade it was decided that for the time being Tea Importers, Limited, should be the sole purchasing agency as from the 1st April, 1947.  It was also decided at that time to restrict the issue of licences authorising the carrying on of a wholesale tea business to concerns which were conducting all the operations of a <i>bona fide</i> tea wholesale business from premises located in this country as it was considered that the admission of external wholesalers would increase the cost of tea to the consumer by introducing an unnecessary additional link in the chain of distribution.  In the latter connection I should mention that it is the intention to bring in at a later stage an amendment designed to strengthen Section 6 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A subsidy to keep down the retail price of teas was introduced on the 1st November, 1947, and this development was an additional reason for maintaining Tea Importers, Limited, as the sole importer of tea.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1807" /> Up to 1950 world production of tea continued to fall short of demand and as the tea issued by Tea Importers, Limited, was heavily subsidised there was no incentive to any individual trader to import tea on his own account. But in 1950 there was an improvement in the world supply position which enabled Tea Importers, Limited, to put on sale unrationed tea at a price which yielded a profit which was offset against the subsidy.  These developments provided the incentive to the individual trader to endeavour to obtain supplies of tea outside this country for sale at the unrationed price thereby depriving the Exchequer of the benefit of the profit which would otherwise accrue from sales made by Tea Importers, Limited.  Accordingly, it was decided to prohibit commercial imports of tea except under licence and to restrict the issue of such licences to Tea Importers, Limited.</P>
    <P>Following abolition of the tea subsidy and tea rationing in July, 1952, consideration was given to the question of restoring freedom to the trade to purchase and import this country's tea requirements subject to direct importation from the producing countries. Proposals made in this connection by the Wholesale Tea Dealers' Association for the replacement of Tea Importers, Limited, and involving continuance of the prohibition of commercial imports of tea except under licence have been under examination but progress has been slow because of the complexities and uncertainties of the general tea situation.</P>
    <P>In addition to the fact that the proposals made by the association contemplated retention of the restrictions on commercial imports of tea, it is recognised that the absence of these restrictions would involve Tea Importers, Limited, in serious risk of being unable to dispose, without loss, of heavy stocks of tea purchased for supply to the wholesale trade with bank advances guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Early in 1955 when the question of the purchase of 1955 season teas was under review the Wholesale Tea Dealers' Association made representations <Col N="1808" /> to the effect that the arrangements whereby Tea Importers, Limited, purchased and imported this country's tea requirements should not be discontinued earlier than December, 1956. It was pointed out by the association that the bulk of the demand in this country is for Indian tea and they represented that on account of the seasonal nature of the Indian tea market it would not be possible for the successors of Tea Importers, Limited, to commence to land before December of the year in which it was bought sufficient suitable quality Indian tea to meet the full demand.  I agreed that the company should continue to be responsible for securing our tea requirements for a further period.  In order to enable the company to continue to discharge this responsibility until arrangements of a permanent nature can be brought into operation, it will be necessary to maintain the present controls on the importation and wholesale distribution of tea.  This is the sole purpose of the Bill, the life of which it is proposed to restrict to a maximum of two years.  It is anticipated that a period of two years will be sufficient to enable arrangements to be made for putting the importation and distribution of tea on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>I ask the Seanad to give favourable consideration to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little puzzled about one or two points in connection with this Bill and, perhaps, the Minister might clarify them for me.  First of all, the period of two years he has just told us is provided in order to give the Minister time to make more permanent arrangements for the future import of tea into the country. I should like a little amplification of that, because, in my opinion, the bulk buying of tea by Tea Importers, Limited, for this country has proved of great benefit.  I am quite convinced that the continuance of some such system will give better value to the consumer than the competition, or the theoretical competition, shall we say, between private interests importing tea.  In other words, I am not convinced that the restoring of the buying of tea to purely private interests will result in <Col N="1809" /> competition which will be effective on price and which will benefit the consumer. I should prefer to see the continuance of some system of bulk buying and bulk importation of this commodity and, consequently, I am a little worried by noticing that the Minister asks for the continuance of this Bill only for two years&mdash;only up to 1958.</P>
      <P>I wonder whether he considers that that represents, perhaps, the life of the present Government, or whether in 1958 he envisages bringing in some such other Bill, or alternatively whether he thinks he will at that juncture be able to pass on the headache to some succeeding Minister.  I should like the point cleared up as to what these two years are necessary for; why should he not decide on his intentions to-day; and whether he has yet made up his mind to have some method of bulk buying for the benefit of the consumer, because I believe it to be for his or her benefit.</P>
      <P>There is only one other point I want to ask about.  I notice that in both Sections 4 and 7, sub-section (2) of Section 4 and sub-section (3) of Section 7, the Minister may attach to an import licence such conditions as he thinks fit.  That is the kind of clause that one hopes will never be abused. One hopes that such conditions will be reasonable conditions.  Nevertheless, it is such a wide clause and contains no explanatory matter in it that I think the Minister might perhaps, even for his own sake, give us some idea of what kind of conditions might reasonably be attached to either the import licence or the wholesaler's licence.  I think he might give us some idea of just what kind of conditions he has in mind might be necessary and might be attached to the licence by him.</P>

      <P>This appears to be just a temporary measure to deal with the situation we have here in relation to the purchase of tea.  What the Minister has said about the position that existed before the establishment of Tea Importers (Eire), Limited, is quite correct.  I am afraid it has to be said, even at this hour, that during the earlier years of the emergency, the British did not treat the people of this country in the way that was expected.  No doubt it was necessary to have an organisation of our own to deal with purchases of tea from abroad and to have those purchases effected through channels other than those through which they had been made previously, that is, through British channels.  It must be admitted by any fair-minded person that Tea Importers (Eire), Limited, did their job fairly well during the difficult years of the emergency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that were it not for their efficiency and vigilance, the tea situation here during the emergency, especially during the latter years of the emergency, would not have been as satisfactory as it was.  I think it can be claimed, as far as supplies of tea were concerned here during the emergency, that despite the default of the British in the matter of tea supplies to this country, the people of this country were better served than the people of many other countries who had to depend on foreign supplies.</P>
      <P>I must agree with Senator Sheehy Skeffington that we are somewhat in the dark as to the future policy in relation to the purchase of tea.  I regard this question of tea supplies as one of the utmost importance because many families throughout the country prefer tea, for the most part, to anything else.  Because of the importance of that beverage, we should like to get some indication from the Minister as to the future policy of the Government in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1811" /> This measure is designed to deal with Tea Importers (Éire), Limited, for two years.  Is it proposed to give them a free hand for the next few years and then to dispense with their services altogether and have some other organisation to carry out whatever purpose the Government may have in mind?  I think it is agreed that Tea Importers (Éire), Limited, have done a good day's work for the country.  If, in recent times, things occurred in relation to the purchase of tea and the fixing of the price of tea, the responsibility for that can hardly be laid at their door.  The Government stepped in and dealt with this tea question in a certain way which did not prove beneficial to the country and I suppose this non-profit making organisation had to fall into line with whatever the Government suggested.  I firmly believe, and I will give expression to my belief, here, that if Tea Importers (Éire), Limited, had not been interfered with by the Government, the price of tea in this country to-day would be much lower than what it is.</P>
    <P>There is not very much that can be said on this Bill, but I would again ask the Minister to give us some indication as to the long-term policy in connection with this all-important matter of the importation of tea.  I appeal to him to tell this House whether or not the Government intend to keep Tea Importers (Éire), Limited, in existence for longer than the two-year period mentioned in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I think everyone is in agreement that the work that devolved on the shoulders of Tea Importers (Éire), Limited, during the emergency years was very well done. They certainly prevented sharks who at that time were able to import tea through diverse ways into this country from charging 20/- and 30/- a lb. for it.  I think that no commodity, relatively speaking, commanded a higher price here during the war years than tea.  Therefore, it behoves every one of us in this House to pay a tribute to that organisation for doing their job so very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, one hears quite a lot of <Col N="1812" /> talk about the quality of the tea we are bringing into this country.  The general opinion is that it is not up to the standard of the tea we got here in pre-war years.  No matter what line of business we may be engaged in, we are in a very competitive world.  It is incumbent on the Minister to ensure, as I have no doubt he will ensure, that the tea we import will be of a very good standard and quality.  As every one of us is aware, the Irish people are recognised perhaps throughout the world as great connoisseurs of tea.  It is one of the staple beverages of this country, and it behoves the Minister to ensure that the quality is of the very highest possible standard.  I should like to ascertain from the Minister whether we deal directly with India, Calcutta and Ceylon, or do we deal through agents in Mincing Lane or in Dublin, or anywhere else.  What exactly is our contact?</P>

      <P>That is very good. The Minister is safeguarding the position of our tea supply for the next two years, at any rate, and I hope that at least by that time the world may find itself in less turbulent conditions than it has been for the past 12 or 15 years.  Nobody can disagree with what the Minister is doing in this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in his clear and brief statement introducing the Bill, did a service, inasmuch as he vindicated very clearly the action taken by his predecessor in setting up Tea Importers, Limited.  There is no doubt that, as the Minister's predecessor very often pointed out in Dáil Éireann, the British Government, or the interests concerned, broke faith with this country during the war, and failed to give us the supplies of tea we were entitled to.  The Minister then occupying the position of Minister for Industry and Commerce, or Supplies, did take immediate action and set up Tea Importers, Limited, and that company did successfully supply this country with a supply of tea which was not entirely unsatisfactory all through the period of the emergency <Col N="1813" /> and at a price which, having regard to all the circumstances, was not excessive.</P>
      <P>That is something in regard to which we ought to feel some satisfaction and a certain amount of pride, that we were able to set up an organisation in those difficult times and meet our people's needs, because I have often listened in Dáil Éireann to the Minister's predecessor being bitterly attacked by some members of the present Government&mdash;not the Minister here present&mdash;who denounced him for setting up Tea Importers, Limited, and demanded that he should return the tea trade into the hands of the merchants in Mincing Lane, London.  They demanded that the trade should be transferred to those people, and said that they were the only people who knew how to import tea, and that we should put our trust in Mincing Lane again.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows that that case was made by one of his colleagues in the present Government.  It was made between 1945 and 1946, and possibly in 1947.  But, as he himself here to-day pointed out, that course is not open to the Government, and it is not open to the British merchants now to re-export tea to this country, so that the person who made that claim, and denounced Tea Importers, Limited, in such strong terms at that time, was entirely misinformed and completely unjustified in the action he took and the case he tried to make.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree entirely with Senator Sheehy Skeffington when he says that bulk buying is in the best interests of this country.  It was certainly in the best interests of the country during the emergency and it may continue to be in the best interests of the country for a time, until the trade can be handed back to private enterprise, and Irish wholesalers can deal directly with the producers in India and Ceylon.  But, taking the long term view, if world conditions are normal, it is better that our wholesalers here should be permitted to import directly from the countries of origin, and I understand that that is what the Minister intends to do.  I think he is doing the right thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter on which the <Col N="1814" /> Minister might give some information, that is, the position of Tea Importers, Limited, having regard to the commitments in which they were involved when they were compelled by the Government to seek a very large overdraft and to continue to sell tea at a price below what was economic.  The position, I understand, is that that overdraft is now being repaid through a levy on the price of tea, but I assume that that overdraft is being repaid by Tea Importers, Limited, and if the company is wound up, I am just wondering what will become of the overdraft.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington inquired what was intended by the provision in Section 7, sub-section (2), which says that the Minister may attach to the tea wholesalers' licences such conditions as he thinks fit.  This sub-section is designed to facilitate the repetition on future licences of the conditions which attach to the present licences, and nothing new or occult is intended by the sub-section.  The present conditions which are imposed on licence holders provide for the period of validity of the licence, the production of the licence to the customs authorities when importing tea under licence, an obligation on the licence holder to notify loss or destruction of the licence to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the return of the licence to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on its expiration or revocation.  These are the simple and innocent conditions now imposed, and I do not intend to have the sub-section used for any conditions other than these simple regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of bulk buying of tea, and what is the future tea policy, if we were in a position to say that, this Bill would not be necessary&mdash;we would have permanent legislation.  It is because the way is not open to us at the moment, and the tea situation is bristling with uncertainties, that it has been necessary to come to the Dáil and say to the Dáil: &ldquo;In case the Supplies and Services Bill were to finish this year, we want you to permit us in this separate Bill to continue for a maximum of two years to do what we would be doing since Tea Importers, <Col N="1815" /> Limited, was set up during the war years.&rdquo;  The position, therefore, is that the advocates of bulk buying of tea have in this Bill an assurance that the present bulk buying practice will continue, and that nothing will be done to depart from that until such time as proposals for such departure are brought before the Oireachtas.  Therefore, they cannot be taken unawares as to what the change of policy may be, nor is there any danger that they will wake up in the morning and find that we have abandoned entirely the whole question of bulk buying.</P>
    <P>What the future policy will be has to be thought out in the light of a number of difficult problems and some uncertainty, and this Bill is really one designed to continue the present practice, until we can make up our minds what is best to do in all the circumstances. That is the answer I must give to the point raised by Senator Kissane&mdash;that we are to continue the present position, and there will be an adequate opportunity of seeing what the change is, because no change will take place overnight.  A change will take place only on the introduction of a Bill into the Dáil and on its passage through this House.  I think, therefore, that Senators have all the assurances they want in that respect, and they may feel satisfied that no change will be made, unless, of course, they are party to it by means of enacting the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Gorman raised the question of the quality of tea and I have given directions that this be discussed with Tea Importers, Limited, so that we can find out the best possible thing to do and what steps are necessary to secure a revision of the situation and what is the best way of doing it.</P>
    <P>Senator Cogan raised the question of the financial position of Tea Importers, Limited, in case we decided to make a change to some other method of buying tea.  Since it was set up, Tea Importers, Limited, have operated on a substantial overdraft guaranteed by various Governments and they have continued to buy on an overdraft.  Whether they buy on an overdraft or whether individual tea importers buy on overdrafts, <Col N="1816" /> somebody has to pay for the overdraft.  Whoever is buying the tea, if they buy in advance and have to get accommodation from the banks, somebody has to pay the interest and it is the consumer who always has to pay the interest on the overdraft.  That happened, of course, to a greater extent a few years ago than it does to-day and it is normal trade operation.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the position is that if any goods are bought on accommodation provided by the bank, somebody has to pay the interest on that accommodation, a perfectly normal trade operation, and that is what happened in the case of Tea Importers, Limited.  I hope that, by the time Tea Importers, Limited, go out of office their liabilities will be substantially reduced and that against them they will have easily encashable assets.</P>

    <Title>Restrictive Trade Practices (Confirmation of Order) Bill, 1955&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to deal with the amendment put down by Senator Douglas.  A perusal of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953 shows that the amendment is not in accordance with the terms or intention of the Act.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas debated the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill, 1952 at considerable length and there was abundant opportunity for the amendment of the Bill which was, in fact, amended in several respects before it became law. The Bill, as passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and signed by the President, is the legislative instrument from which all the activities of the Fair Trade Commission flow and the instrument which confers upon me the power to make an Order such as I have made in regard to the radio trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot go outside the terms of the <Col N="1817" /> Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953. That Act did not place any obligation on the Fair Trade Commission to have verbatim reports of evidence or to submit any such transcripts to me.  All the Act did was to require the commission to furnish me with a report of the inquiry.  They have done that and I have no power to ask them to go further and furnish me with, as the Senator has suggested, a complete transcript of the evidence presented to them.  Not only did the Act limit the obligations of the commission to the presentation of a report, but it actually provided that they could regulate their own procedure.  I understand that it has been the practice of the commission to have verbatim notes taken for their own assistance.  But that is a matter of procedure within the competence of the commission itself and I have no power to demand that they should make any such transcript of the evidence available to me.</P>
    <P>Apart from not having the power, I have no desire, in any event, to seek such a transcript.  It was laid down by the Oireachtas in the Act that the sittings of the commission must be held in public, except where special private sittings are necessary to safeguard the legitimate business interests of any person.  The inquiry into the radio trade was held in public.  The whole object of having an inquiry in public is to let the public know what is happening.  Any person was at liberty to attend the public sittings. It seems to me that it would have been highly illogical, in any event, to prescribe that the hearings must be in public, but that, notwithstanding this, a transcript of the evidence must be furnished.</P>
    <P>If the Oireachtas had any intention &mdash;which was certainly not expressed&mdash; that a transcript of the evidence should be afforded to either of the Houses, there would have been no necessity to direct that the inquiries must be held in public.  The commission could have been left to hold all their inquiries in private, giving due notice and affording an opportunity to all interested parties to give evidence and the Oireachtas could have prescribed that <Col N="1818" /> the transcript of such hearings should be furnished to me and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That was not done, however, and it is, of course, obvious that it was not done for the very good reason that only one purpose would be served by making transcripts available to the Oireachtas, namely, to enable the Oireachtas to conduct its own detailed investigation into matters already examined and reported on by the commission.</P>
    <P>When the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, was before the Oireachtas, it was clearly understood that those Orders should stand as a whole, and that the Oireachtas would have the right to accept or reject, but not to amend them.  It was understood also that there would be no question of the Oireachtas covering again the ground already covered in detail by the commission.  The necessity for a special investigatory body to inquire into restrictive trade practices was clearly recognised.  It was accepted that a detailed investigation into such practices could not effectively be undertaken by the Oireachtas, and that the sensible approach was to set up a statutory commission for the purpose, to give to the commission special powers of examination, to rely on the commission to submit fair and impartial reports of their findings, and to provide that the Oireachtas should have power to review the findings, but not the investigative processes, of the commission.  It seems to me that Senator Douglas's amendment cuts right across the principles underlying the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953.</P>
    <P>I think that, on reflection, members of the Seanad would agree that no useful purpose could, in any event, be served by any Senator or any Deputy seeking to go through a transcript of the evidence and form conclusions. The Senator's motion ignores the fact that the oral evidence comprised in a transcript is only one part of the evidence, of which the commission took account.  It is clear to anyone who has read the commission's report or, indeed, who followed the public hearings, that minute books and documents of all kinds formed another and <Col N="1819" /> a very important part of the evidence. It is on the basis of the evidence as a whole that the commission drew up the statement of facts set forth in their report.</P>
    <P>The Seanad will be aware that proceedings have been initiated in the High Court concerning the report of the commission and the Order which I have made.  I am not prepared to enter on any line of argument which might seem to prejudge or prejudice the attitude the commission would take in their defence to this action.  It must be obvious, however, to the Seanad that the members of the commission, being completely impartial and responsible persons, must be assumed to have given the weight to the evidence that it merited and I do not think it would be proper to embark on a separate evaluation of the evidence.  My function under the Act is to consider the report which was made to me.</P>
    <P>I have done that and I may say that I had no difficulty, having read the report and considered the conclusions, in making up my mind to accept the commission's recommendations and to make the Order which I made and which is now before the Seanad for confirmation in this Bill.  There was, of course, no question of my accepting these recommendations automatically. I examined the report in detail and I considered each recommendation very carefully.  I could have rejected the commission's recommendations in whole or in part.  But my examination and consideration convinced me that the commission were fully justified in their recommendations and that I should make an Order on the lines suggested by the commission.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Bill itself, it may facilitate Senators if I give a résumé of the commission's report and of the recommendations which the commission make with a view to terminating restrictive trade practices which are considered to be unfair or to operate against the public interest.  Senators will understand that in referring to trade practices, I am referring to the position as it was stated in the commission's report and that I have no <Col N="1820" /> means of knowing to what extent, if any, practice has been altered in the meantime.  According to the commission's report the retail trade in radio sets is regulated by agreement between two trade associations&mdash;the Federation of Irish Radio Manufacturers and the Wireless Dealers' Association.  More than 90 per cent. of the radio sets marketed are handled by manufacturers and distributors who are members of either of these two associations. Entry to the retail trade is controlled by the Wireless Dealers' Association by means of the maintenance of a list of approved retailers to whom the manufacturers of radio sets agree to confine distribution.  It is virtually impossible for a trader whose name is not on the approved list to engage regularly and openly in the sale of radio sets.  Application for admission to the list of approved dealers must be made to the Wireless Dealers' Association.  Certain conditions as to premises and the stocking and display of radio sets must be complied with by an applicant and, in addition, an applicant must maintain a repair department in his premises, and, if he is not technically qualified himself, he must employ at least one service mechanic on a whole-time basis.  An applicant must undertake not to supply radio sets for resale to any person whose name is not on the list of approved retailers and he must undertake also not to sell radio sets at prices lower than the retail prices specified in the manufacturer's list of prices. These requirements are enforced vigorously by the association.  Breaches of the requirements may result in fines or suspension or deletion of the retailer's name from the approved list.</P>
    <P>Assessing the actual and potential effects of the approved list system, the Fair Trade Commission have expressed the view that the system prevents or restricts competition and restrains trade.  They consider that such interference with competition and trade is unfair and operates against the public interest.  The commission point out that the system places in the hands of an association composed largely of radio traders the power to determine whether these traders should allow <Col N="1821" /> other traders to enter into the radio business.  The commission indicate also that the existing arrangements provide a means of organising boycotts of manufacturers whose discount rates or list of customers are not acceptable to the Wireless Dealers' Association; that private enterprise in distribution is stultified and, as a result, the public is deprived of the benefits of healthy competition.  The commission have also adverted to the fact that the emphasis in the operation of the approved list of retailers is in favour of retailers resident in the larger towns and cities and that the restriction of business opportunities to the larger centres of population is not in accordance with public policy.</P>
    <P>The view has been widely expressed that if the approved list system is abolished, everyone would be entitled to engage in the sale of radio sets.  The commission do not, however, accept the contention that the only alternative to the approved list system is widespread and uneconomic proliferation of retail outlets.  They take the view that it is for individual manufacturers to determine the economics of distribution so far as the number of outlets, is concerned and they point out that, in the absence of collective restrictions, competition between manufacturers may be expected to serve as a deterrent to distributional arrangements which are irrational and uneconomic from a manufacturer's point of view. The commission consider that, in the case of any individual manufacturer, the objective of achieving efficiency and economy in distribution justifies the making of conditions by that manufacturer, if he so wishes, as to the volume and frequency of orders, or as to the provision of service to the public provided such conditions are reasonable and are not designed or likely to restrain trade or limit competition unfairly. It is the considered view of the commission that individual manufacturers, acting in this way, can ensure the avoidance of an undue proliferation of outlets while at the same time preserving fair and equitable methods of distribution.</P>
    <P>The retail prices of radio sets to the public are fixed by the manufacturers, <Col N="1822" /> and sets are sold to the retailer at the retail price less a discount of 33? per cent. giving the retailer a gross profit of 50 per cent. on the cost price.  This rate of profit is substantial, and it will be observed from the commission's report that, even though retailers might be satisfied to accept a lower rate of profit, they are obliged to adhere strictly to the retail prices fixed by the manufacturers.  The practical result of this arrangement is the establishment and enforcement of minimum selling prices in respect of all radio sets sold in the Irish market.  In normal conditions enforcement of a fixed retail margin results in prices being higher than they would be in the absence of a fixed margin.</P>
    <P>The purchase of a radio set involves the purchaser in a relatively substantial outlay, and the retailer's profit margin represents a large portion of that outlay. An arrangement which deprives the public of the benefit of competition in respect of one-third of the retail price of a radio set is clearly a matter which affects the public interest in a very direct way.  The commission have expressed the view that resale price maintenance, to which all approved radio retailers are required to adhere, is a practice which is contrary to the public interest.  The commission see no valid reason why retailers, wherever located and whatever their operating expenses and efficiency, should be compelled, regardless of their own wishes, to accept a margin of gross profit as high as 50 per cent. on the cost of radio sets.  The commission are of opinion that it is contrary to the public interest that retailers should be put out of business if they choose to operate on the basis of a profit margin which, though less than the prescribed margin, is sufficiently remunerative in their own particular circumstances.  The view of the commission is that resale price maintenance, whether enforced by an association or by an individual manufacturer, should be abolished, and they consider that the abolition of this practice in the radio trade would be to the advantage of the consumer, would lead to increased efficiency in retailing and would not detract from efficiency in production.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1823" /> The argument most commonly advanced against the abolition of resale price maintenance is that such a step would lead to extreme price competition, with consequent instability in the trade.  Radio sets would, it is feared, he used as loss leaders, that is to say, offered for sale at drastically reduced prices in order to induce customers to purchase other commodities, the price of which has not been reduced.  A large concern, dealing in a wide range of goods, would be in a stronger position than a small retailer to make up for a reduction in the prices of radio sets by increased sales of other goods, and the consequence of this would be the large-scale elimination of the small retailer. Persons without any real interest in the trade, and without any intention of continuing in the business, might seek a quick profit by reducing prices in order to increase turnover and so disrupt the business of legitimate traders.</P>
    <P>The commission consider that it is necessary to distinguish between price cutting in circumstances where resale prices are fixed, though ineffectively or only partially mantained, and a situation where price competition is accepted as a normal condition of trading. The commission take the view that, in the latter circumstances, the opportunities for unscrupulous traders will be very limited, and regular retailers will be in a position to weigh the long-term consequences of a particular price policy in relation to other forms of competition.  The commission do not accept the contention that price competition would lead to the elimination of numbers of small retailers.  On the contrary, the commission consider that such competition would tend in some measure to favour the small retailer by providing him with a means of countering the attractions in the way of elaborate facilities offered by larger concerns.</P>
    <P>As regards the practice of loss leader selling, the commission's view is that, having regard to the substantial cost, radio sets are much less likely to be used as loss leaders than are other commodities which are low-priced and have a high rate of turnover. <Col N="1824" /> In any case, the loss leader device derives much of its sustenance from the prescription of fixed prices. The fact that a very high proportion of radio sets is sold under hire-purchase arrangements further reduces the possibility of extreme price cutting. In such cases the customer is concerned with the size of the monthly instalment, which is governed by the duration of payments and the specific terms of hire purchase, as well as by the price of the radio set.  The impact of price competition is much less direct in such circumstances than in the case of cash sales.</P>
    <P>It is unreasonable, in the view of the commission, that the consumer should have to forgo the benefits of price competition in order that retailers might be protected against the contingency that competition might at some time become excessive.  It is preferable to try to meet the risk of the emergence of such competition, not by eliminating all price competition, but by devising a method of checking excessive competition should it appear. The commission consider therefore that in two sets of circumstances the general prohibition against enforcement of resale price maintenance should be modified.  Firstly, if a retailer offers or sells a particular brand of radio set at a price less than or equal to the price at which he originally purchased it from the manufacturer, unfair trading might legitimately be alleged, and the supplier should not be prevented from withholding further supplies.  Secondly, if the goods are offered or sold at a price so little exceeding the purchase price as materially to injure the legitimate business interests of a supplier, the supplier should be at liberty to withhold further supplies, provided that he informs the commission of his intention.  If, in the latter case, the commission, having examined the matter, notify the supplier that, in their opinion, the circumstances do not justify the continued withholding of supplies, the supplier would be obliged to continue to supply the trader in question.</P>
    <P>I have given careful thought to the recommendations of the Fair Trade <Col N="1825" /> Commission, and my view is that the commission are fully justified in making the recommendations which are contained in their report.  I agree entirely with these recommendations, and I am satisfied that it is unfair that radio manufacturers who have the benefit of tariff protection should discriminate against dealers by refusing to supply them on the grounds that the dealers are not approved by a particular trade association.  I am of opinion, also, that it is wrong that it should be within the competence of vested retail interests to restrict the right of new retailers to enter into the radio trade.</P>
    <P>I consider also that a number of the conditions imposed by the Wireless Dealers' Association on new entrants to the retail trade are unduly onerous. I refer, in particular, to the obligation that a new dealer must maintain a repair department and, if he is not technically qualified himself, must employ at least one service mechanic on a whole-time basis.  This obligation, which, it may be noted, does not apply to firms which, prior to 1946, were on the approved list maintained by the Wireless Dealers' Association, bears with severity on the retailer in rural areas where the volume of repair work would not be sufficient to justify the employment of a service mechanic on a whole-time basis.  I am satisfied that it is contrary to the interests of the consumer that competition should be restricted both by the maintenance of a list of approved retailers and by the enforcement of minimum resale prices for radios.</P>
    <P>With the object of removing the abuses which exist and restoring conditions of free and fair competition in the radio trade, the commission recommend in their report that an Order should be made prohibiting the particular practices which are considered to be harmful to the public interest.  The commission recommend, for instance, that, subject to the adoption of safeguards against the contingency of excessive price competition, resale price maintenance should be prohibited and that it should be made possible for retailers to determine their own selling prices in the light of their own operating <Col N="1826" /> costs.  Dealing with the withholding of radio sets from retailers who have not complied with the rules of the Wireless Dealers' Association, the commission recommend that it should be made unlawful for a manufacturer or wholesaler to discontinue supplies of radios to a retailer on the grounds that the retailer has not observed minimum resale prices.</P>
    <P>As regards restraint of trade which arises from the exclusion from supplies of retailers whose names are not on an approved list, the commission recommend that it should be made unlawful for a manufacturer to withhold radio sets from a retailer on the grounds that the retailer is or is not a member of a particular organisation or association or because the retailer's name does not appear on an approved list. The commission recommend that no manufacturer, trade association or organisation should be permitted to publish lists of approved or non-approved persons which are likely to restrict entry to the retail trade or to be used as a basis for regulating the supply and distribution of radio sets.  The commission recommend also that it should be made unlawful for any person to secure a boycott of any manufacturer of radio sets on the grounds that the manufacturer has refused to do any act which would be contrary to the terms of the Order.</P>
    <P>There are, finally, two recommendations by the commission regarding the imposition by individual manufacturers of terms and conditions for the acceptance of orders.  Firstly, it is recommended that a manufacturer should be permitted to impose certain conditions including conditions as to the volume and frequency of orders <i>et cetera</i>, provided such conditions are reasonable, are equitably applied, and are notified to the commission, which may, if the circumstances at any time so require, make fair trading rules in relation thereto.  Secondly, it is recommended that there should be a prohibition against a manufacturer differentiating between customers who should, in the normal way, be supplied on the same terms and conditions, having regard to the size and frequency of their orders.  The commission do not consider <Col N="1827" /> that a manufacturer should be prevented from advertising or specifying a resale price which is a maximum price or from withholding supplies from a retailer if the maximum price is exceeded.  Any such specified or recommended price will not, however, be binding on retailers as a minimum price.</P>
    <P>I have made an Order to give effect to the recommendations contained in the report of the Fair Trade Commission, and a copy of the Order has been circulated to Senators.  Section 9 (3) of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, provides that an Order of this kind shall not have effect unless it is confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas. The Bill which I am sponsoring is the Confirmation Bill which is necessary to give the force of law to the Order. Senators are probably aware that proceedings have been initiated in the High Court seeking, <i>inter alia</i>, a declaration that the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, the inquiry held by the Fair Trade Commission in regard to the supply and distribution of radio sets, and the Restrictive Trade Practices (Radios) Order, 1955, are unconstitutional. The hearing of the action has not yet commenced and I do not wish to say anything that might be regarded as prejudging the hearing, but I consider that, having regard to all the circumstances, it would be proper that the Oireachtas should proceed with its consideration of the Bill for the confirmation of the Order.</P>
    <P>I commend to the House this Bill which, on enactment, will, I hope, put an end to unfair restrictive practices in the radio trade.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Seanad Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Restrictive Trade Practices (Confirmation of Order) Bill, 1955 until a complete transcript of the evidence presented before the Fair Trade Commission is made available for the consideration of members of the Oireachtas in view of the fact that representatives of the radio trade who gave evidence before the commission have publicly <Col N="1828" /> stated that certain sections of the report on which the Restrictive Trade Practices (Radios) Order, 1955 is based are, in their entirety, or in part, contrary to the evidence submitted at the inquiry.</P>
    <P>In moving this amendment I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not opposed to legislation being passed through Parliament which deals with the type of restrictive practices which are found, on investigation, to be opposed to public interest.  Every trade union in this country is guilty of restrictive practices which are opposed to the best interests of the public as a whole and this very principle is enshrined in the Trade Union Act, 1871, and I think in all subsequent Trade Union Acts.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil, when the Minister was moving the Second Reading of this Bill, and also this evening when moving it in the Seanad, he stated he had given careful thought to the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission. &ldquo;... my view is that the commission are fully justified in making the recommendations which are contained in their report.&rdquo;  It is because I am satisfied from the evidence given me by persons who appeared before the Fair Trade Commission that the commission were not justified in making their recommendations that I have tabled the amendment in my name.</P>
    <P>Before proceeding with the arguments, I should like to pay a tribute to Mr. MacCarthy, who was Chairman of the Fair Trade Commission when the wireless dealers' case was being considered.  Every person who has discussed the report with me has paid tribute to the fairness and the fair way in which Mr. MacCarthy presided at the inquiry.  I am satisfied he did everything possible and everything in his power to see that the commission and the inquiry were conducted as fairly as possible.  However, I have a feeling that, like myself, Mr. MacCarthy had decided that the 1953 Act and the setting up of the commission was in fact unworkable and that it would be quite impossible to get a fair and accurate report on any trade under the system of inquiry which had been set up under the Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1829" /> Section 8 of the 1953 Act provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A report made by the commission under Section 6 or 7 shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) describe the conditions which obtain in regard to the supply or distribution of the goods concerned and, where appropriate, the conditions in regard to the rendering, in the course of carrying on any trade or business, of any services affecting such supply or distribution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The complete transcript of the proceedings of the Fair Trade Commission will, I believe, show that, far from describing the conditions which obtain in regard to the supply or distribution of wireless goods, the report before us is a complete distortion of the evidence presented before the inquiry and of the facts.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to try to prove that there are no restrictive practices in the radio trade or in the set-up of the trade union which is known as the &ldquo;Wireless Dealers' Association&rdquo;.  It is well to remember that the Wireless Dealers' Association would not have secured registration as a trade union if its rules had not provided for restrictive conditions, including the conditions upon which any members of the association shall or shall not sell their goods.  But restrictive conditions were kept to the minimum required under the Trade Union Acts and the association is probably less restrictive than any other registered trade union.</P>
    <P>The 1953 Act includes a schedule of unfair trade practices.  I think the radio trade&mdash;and I have some knowledge of the trade&mdash;has contravened these less than most other trades and certainly less than any other trade union.  The main objects and activities of the Wireless Dealers' Association can, I think, be summed up as follows. They are, I think, mentioned in the back of the report, but I think they can be summed up under four headings. These are (i) The protection of the interests of those engaged in the radio and television trades; (ii) the giving of advice whenever desired to individual members; (iii) the compilation of a list of approved retailers of radio receiving sets; and (iv) the prevention of the exploitation of the public and the <Col N="1830" /> maintenance of the reputation and standing of the radio trade.  In addition, of course, they have the usual trade union object of seeing that their members get a reasonable return for their labours.  I imagine all members of the association are small people, self-employed, or employing one or two assistants, and, as I hope to show later on, when considering the report in detail, few of them are making what most trade unions would consider an adequate weekly wage.</P>
    <P>Most Senators know that I am associated with a radio shop in Dublin.  I was not asked to give evidence before the Fair Trade Commission, but, if I had, I would have been prepared to give figures which, as far as I know, were not submitted to the Fair Trade Commission, I would have been prepared to give the figures of the gross profits of that radio shop with which I am associated.  I would have been prepared to give the gross profits for that branch over whatever period of years the Fair Trade Commission had asked.  I believe that the staff in that radio shop are efficient.  I believe that, since that shop was opened, they have endeavoured to give service to the public, and I am satisfied that, if it had been asked, I could have got many of the customers of that shop to go before the Fair Trade Commission to say that they believed that they had got fair value for their money and fair value in after-sales service.</P>
    <P>Over the past nine years&mdash;and I do not mind giving these figures to the Seanad&mdash;the average gross profit in that radio shop was £3,533.  Out of that, we had to pay all overheads.  In 1947, wages absorbed 46 per cent. of that gross profit.  In 1955, wages absorbed 58 per cent. of the gross profit.  Rates in 1947 took up 3.7 per cent. of the gross profit, whereas, in 1955, they accounted for 5 per cent. of the gross profit.  Between 1947 and 1955, wage cost increased by 42.5 per cent. and rates by 48.8 per cent.; whereas the gross profit for the same period went up from £3,475 to £3,857. As far as I am concerned, I personally have not earned one penny out of the radio trade over the past nine years, but I am proud to say that I have been able, by providing the capital for that <Col N="1831" /> radio shop&mdash;and I suppose I am in a privileged position in that I was able to provide that capital&mdash;to maintain employment for five or six people in the radio trade.  I believe that in their small way they have given efficient and able service to the public.</P>
    <P>One of the complaints lodged against the Wireless Dealers' Association is that it has unfairly restricted entry into the trade and that it has refused membership to persons who were, in fact, fully qualified under the rules.  I will deal with both points in greater detail when I am going through the report.  At this stage I would just say that every union has its teething troubles and the Wireless Dealers' Association is no better or worse than any trade union. We are all aware of the unofficial strikes which occur from time to time. These should not occur in any properly organised trade union.  The fact is that they do and they often impose great hardship on the public as a whole.  When these strikes do occur, the Government does not try to rush through hasty legislation to deal with them.  Rather, it leaves it to the good sense of the members of the union concerned to try to put their house in order.  I consider that the Wireless Dealers' Association and their predecessor have, during the past number of years, tried to put their house in order and have succeeded in doing so exceedingly well.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech this evening and also in the Dáil mentioned that the wireless trade was a protected body.  In the report, on page 101, the commission gave the customs duty which has been chargeable on wireless sets and it is well to note that it was not until 1946 that the wireless trade got what I would call completely restrictive protection.  In 1926, when there were no wireless sets made in this country, there was a duty of 33? per cent., with a preferential duty of 25 per cent.  In 1938, when, I think, there were practically no wireless sets made in this country, we had a 60 per cent. and 40 per cent. tariff.  The wireless trade may be a protected industry, but I am satisfied that it never sought protection, and that the Minister is not <Col N="1832" /> really correct in his argument when stating that, because it is a protected trade, it should not be allowed to have certain restrictions.</P>
    <P>I think his wording was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I agree with these recommendations&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is, referring to the report of the Fair Trade Commission&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and I am satisfied that it is unfair that radio manufacturers, who have the benefit of tariff protection, should discriminate against dealers by refusing to supply them on the ground that the dealers are not approved by a protected trade association.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope before the end of my speech to show that this report of the Fair Trade Commission bears little relation to the evidence and, in fact, as I have already said, in many sections is completely at variance with the weight of the evidence.  To put it bluntly, the report might have been drawn up before ever the inquiry was held at all, for all the relation it bears to the facts put before the commission.  The wireless trade was the first victim of the 1953 Act, because it was a comparatively young trade and did not employ a very large number of persons.  A considerable amount of misinformed public comment has been made about the profit margins taken and allowed, but the fact is that the wireless trade is one of the few trades that has been able to maintain practically pre-war prices. This is due to the close co-operation that exists between manufacturers and distributors.  The public wanted a victim under the 1953 Act and, so, the wireless trade was prejudged and condemned.</P>
    <P>Since the report was published, a deputation from the Wireless Dealers' Association has endeavoured to put the facts before the Minister, but up to the present, as far as I know, he has refused to receive them.</P>
    <P>We claim that a large part of the evidence given at this inquiry has been so distorted or misrepresented as to give a completely biassed and unfair picture of the trade and the association. We claim that, if the full transcript of the evidence were made available, it would prove that the <Col N="1833" /> radio trade is neither making an excessive profit, nor is it imposing restrictions on the distribution and sale of the goods which are detrimental to the public interest.  The members of the association claim that the full transcript will prove that the Wireless Dealers' Association was in no way restricting entry into the trade. Rather, it has imposed certain minimum standards solely in the interests of the public and not in fact to restrict competition.</P>
    <P>I should like to impress on the House this evening that the subject before the House is not a general consideration of the principles of restrictive practices relating to trade and industry.  That, I think, was fully covered in 1953 when the original Fair Trade Act was passed in this House. It is, rather, a Bill to bring into law an Order which was made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, after he had considered the report of the Fair Trade Commission.  If we are to approve the Bill, we must as a consequence approve the Order and the report. If there is any reasonable doubt as to the accuracy of the report, or that it does not reflect a true picture of the proceedings and the weight of evidence, then we should refuse to consider the Order and the Bill.  The Minister has stated that we cannot amend the Order or the Bill and that we must accept or reject it in its entirety.  We can, however, reject it and, at the same time, ask the Minister to introduce a revised Order which will be in keeping with the true position which will be disclosed in the complete transcript of the evidence or in the documents and facts which will become disclosed during the proceedings in the High Court.  There are proceedings before the High Court and I, like the Minister, do not like to say anything that will prejudice that case. I will not bring forward any documents not already available either to the Minister or to the public.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that it is not possible for us to amend the Bill.  I find in 1953 in the Seanad Debates, Volume 41, column 578 that the then Minister for Industry and Commerce said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1834" />&ldquo;The Orders made by the Minister under the appropriate section of the Bill will not have any force until they are confirmed by legislation passed by the Oireachtas. The intention is that the confirming Bills will be of a simple kind with which the Seanad will be familiar in connection with the confirmation of Orders made by various Ministers under different statutes, such as Orders imposing customs duties, or harbour works Orders.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I find my father interrupted the Minister and asked: &ldquo;Can they be amended when passing?&rdquo;  and the Minister replied: &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; and my father said: &ldquo;That is very important.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister on that occasion, continuing, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The power of the Oireachtas to amend any Bill proposed to it is beyond question.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was part of Deputy Lemass's speech on the Second Reading of the 1953 Bill when it was before this House.  In the absence of the complete transcript of the evidence, which I had hoped I might have been able to convince the Minister should have been made available to this House, I must take my case on the verbal evidence placed at my disposal by the secretary of the Wireless Dealers' Association, the members of the deputation who have tried without success to wait on the Minister and on the transcript of part of the proceedings of the inquiry, a copy of which was made available to the Wireless Dealers' Association for the princely sum of £11 18s. 9d.  I propose, with the permission of the Chair, to quote from this available transcript of the evidence occasionally.</P>
    <P>The actual report, at the bottom of the introduction on page five, states: &ldquo;The witnesses before the commission were examined on oath.&rdquo;  A list of witnesses is given and it states that the Wireless Dealers' Association was represented by counsel and the Irish Association of Civil Liberties by a solicitor.  I consider that this paragraph implies that the witnesses from the Irish Association of Civil Liberties were examined on oath.  No witness from the association is listed in appendix <Col N="1835" /> C of the report, nor was the Wireless Dealers' Association made aware of any representations made by anyone on behalf of that association at the inquiry.  The position of that association at the inquiry was never defined by the commission and it is not indicated in the report at all that any witness from the association was examined before the commission on oath.  The evidence put before me is that a representative of the Irish Association of Civil Liberties was not only never examined on oath, but was not there. That is the first inaccuracy which I find in the report.</P>
    <P>Chapter 1 of the report is headed &ldquo;Organisation of the Radio Trade&rdquo; and it gives, amongst other things, details of the estimated annual turnover and particulars of retailers in the trade.  According to this chapter, nearly 1,000 people&mdash;actually 971&mdash;received trade terms on radio sets.  The home market is estimated in the report at 60,000 sets per annum and the retail trade turnover is estimated at £1,200,000.  Let us for a moment assume these figures to be correct and take the profit at the maximum discount allowed under the rules of the Wireless Dealers' Association of 33? per cent.  We find then the greatest profit distributed amongst the total retail radio trade to be £400,000 per annum.  That is an average of £400 profit per dealer.  It could hardly be argued that this sum is an excessive gross profit from which to pay wages, overhead charges and after sales service for the customers.</P>
    <P>These are the best figures that the commission could produce to show that excess profits were being made and that entry into the trade was restricted.  I wonder if many people really give consideration to what are gross profits.  I cannot help thinking to-day that gross profits involve many more things than people take into account.  It is the net profit after all expenses have been paid that is the figure by which comparison of one trade with another should be made. We have six representatives in this House who are members of university professorial staffs and I wonder what <Col N="1836" /> their gross profits on salaries are.  I think 100 per cent. to most people in business.  That is the full amount; yet I am quite satisfied that if we consider the salaries of the university professors and teaching staffs of various schools most of us would be happy to see some increase in their gross profits, but the fact is that we find, after paying all expenses arising from the continual increase in the cost of living, that their net profit is not so high.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil recently, it was stated that there were 446,830 radio licences, other than transmitting licences, issued by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. It was estimated that there are 50,000 sets in houses already under licence because people might have two or three sets in one house and there are those who do not pay licences. There are a total of 500,000 sets in use in the Republic.  In accordance with the figures available in the Statistics Office, it is estimated that there are less than 600,000 domestic establishments in the State.  The average radio owner replaces his set every ten or 12 years at the most, so on the figures only 4,800 are required annually in the replacement market and the other 12,000 out of the total of 60,000 sets produced annually must find an outlet, either in new homes or in the export market.</P>
    <P>I think it is obvious from the figures available to the commission that sales will not increase greatly and an increase in dealers will result in an increase in distribution cost for which the public must ultimately pay.  It was shown at the inquiry that the present system of after sales service has reduced the manufacturers' overheads through the medium of fixed retail prices.  It was obvious to the inquiry that large countries cannot absorb these 60,000 sets annually.  That is the output of the manufacturers here and there would not be an adequate livelihood for even 500 people, much less 1,000 odd dealers.</P>
    <P>The approved list was originated by the manufacturers and not the dealers, and several manufacturers who gave evidence before the commission made it clear that that was so.  The evidence before the commission showed that an <Col N="1837" /> approved list was essential, if the radio trade was to be maintained at its present high level.</P>
    <P>Half way down in page 7 of the report, it is stated that the sales of radio sets were carried on through the medium of hire purchase and deferred payments and it was estimated by a number of witnesses that sales on this basis represented as much as 80 per cent. of the total.  The commission suggests here that radio is associated with other business, but in fact about 30 per cent. of the dealers on the Wireless Dealers' Association's approved list rely on the sales and service of radio and television sets for their livelihoods.</P>
    <P>The reference to hire purchase is important, as this system depends on a basic price.  It does not lend itself very much to price cutting as &ldquo;no deposit&rdquo; schemes have become very popular.  It is true that very recently we had a hire-purchase Order introduced which does restrict sales under hire purchase and does provide for an initial deposit of 33? per cent.  In spite of that Order there is plenty of evidence to show that there are ways and means of getting over that initial deposit and in fact certain dealers are continuing to sell on what might be described as a virtual &ldquo;no deposit&rdquo; system.  Therefore, the benefits if any, which would accrue from the abolition of price maintenance, would be available only to a small proportion of purchasers and, at that, to the people who need it least&mdash;in other words the people who pay cash and who have cash to spare when purchasing.  The poorer man who buys his set on the hire-purchase system will certainly get no benefit, but the wealthier person who can afford to pay would almost certainly benefit.</P>
    <P>At the top of page 8 of the report, it is stated in the first line:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...at the list price less a discount of 33? per cent., thus giving him a gross profit of 50 per cent. on cost.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a misleading statement as in no business is profit assessed when one buys an article.  Profit is always assessed as a percentage of the selling price or turnover.  In fact, in most sections of the report, it does accept <Col N="1838" /> the principle that the average profit in radios is 33? per cent.</P>
    <P>This same paragraph&mdash;section 2 of the report&mdash;deals with resale price maintenance.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Resale price maintenance is in operation and is the subject of collective enforcement; the retailers are required to charge the purchasing public the fixed prices as listed, and steps to fix maximum trading allowances on used sets accepted in part payment have also been taken.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was made perfectly clear at the inquiry that the used radio set values list, which is given in appendix E, was printed on a card for public display in each member's premises.  Each member was requested to see that that was kept on public display.  It was not binding for retailers, but was merely in the retailers' shops for their guidance. The list was intended to avoid unduly enhanced and uneconomic allowances which amount to price cutting, and it was also to ensure that the public would know what would be a fair price to pay for a used set.  That was the reason that the association insisted that that card, referred to in appendix E, should be publicly displayed in their premises.  In the report it is suggested that this was a secret document only for the use of dealers. In fact, it was quite the opposite and was meant to be for the use of the public.</P>
    <P>On page 9, the report states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Although a few manufacturers and distributors belong neither to the association nor to the federation, more than 90 per cent. of the sets marketed in this country are distributed by manufacturers and distributors who are members of either the Federation or the Wireless Dealers' Association.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>According to appendix C of the report, representatives of 13 manufacturers gave evidence.  Of these at least four were never members of or associated with the Wireless Dealers' Association, and one&mdash;the Gramophone Company, Limited&mdash;has since ceased to be a member because they have offered trading discounts and inducements in excess of the ceiling fixed by the <Col N="1839" /> association.  Among the manufacturers who have never been associated with the Wireless Dealers' Association are Cossor, Ekco, Ever-Ready, K.B. and Ultra.  These names are well known and respected by radio dealers, and it is ridiculous to suggest that they enjoy only 10 per cent. of the sales in this country, if that is what paragraph 4 suggests.  These five makes are marketed through many outlets not on the approved list of the Wireless Dealers' Association.</P>
    <P>This statement in the report bears no relation to the evidence submitted at the inquiry.  That paragraph continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A trader whose name does not appear on the list of approved retailers has such limited varieties of sets available to him that it is virtually impossible for him to engage regularly and openly in the sale of radio sets on any significant scale.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the five well-known makes which are freely available to people not members or on the approved list of the Wireless Dealers' Association.  I have already shown that that statement is at variance with the evidence given before the commission.</P>
    <P>At the bottom of page 9, we find in paragraph (5), which deals with the application form for membership of the Wireless Dealers' Association:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The application form is a detailed and lengthy document in which, apart from names and addresses, information is sought under 13 heads and, in addition, undertakings are required on 11 different matters. The form also incorporates an agreement on the part of the applicant that, if at any time he ceases to maintain all or any of the standards or requirements set out in the application form or fails in any of the undertakings given, the control committee shall be at liberty to delete his name forthwith without objection from him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This, in my opinion, suggests that the form is as complicated as an income-tax form; yet a glance at appendix F shows that that is not so.  The applicant is merely asked his name, address, <Col N="1840" /> trade name, description of his shop, the poor law valuation, and particulars of his radio repair department and the ability of himself or his staff to repair sets.  Surely there is nothing very difficult about that.  Yet, this paragraph in the report suggests it is one of the most complicated forms, and one which would require a university professor to unravel it.  The undertakings in this application form were framed to ensure that the applicant would keep his shop open, display and keep in stock radio receivers, keep a service department, adhere to the manufacturer's prices and not wholesale through other retailers or part-time canvassers or agents on a commission basis.</P>
    <P>Page 10 of the report states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The control committee of the Wireless Dealers' Association, by which applications are considered, consists of 12 members of whom six are manufacturers and six retailers, and the chairmanship (with casting vote) alternates between a manufacturer and a retailer.  The control committee is also charged with the periodical review of the list with a view to the deletion of names of persons no longer considered by the committee to be reasonably active in the sale of sets or of persons who are deemed to be unsuitable for retention on the lists because they have not continued to comply with undertakings given when they were approved.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If you refer to appendix G on page 111 of the report, it will show that the rules of the association do not provide for alternative chairmanship, in spite of the statements in page 10 of the report; neither does it show that the control committee is charged with periodical review of the list with a view to deletion of some person deemed to be unsuitable for retention. This part of the report is a complete misrepresentation of the rules of the Wireless Dealers' Association and of the evidence submitted before the commission.</P>
    <P>On the next page, page 11, section (f) under the heading &ldquo;Price Maintenance,&rdquo; it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1841" />&ldquo;Appendix &mdash; contains a directive issued by the Wireless Dealers' Association regarding calculation of trading allowances and specifying that the allowances so calculated must not be exceeded by any member of the trade.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with that section in Appendix E and I could not say anything about it other than that it is incorrect.</P>
    <P>Now let us examine Chapter 2 of the report.  Chapter 2 purports to be the evidence which was taken at the inquiry from 18 persons who complained of being excluded from full participation in the radio trade through the operations of the Wireless Dealers' Association and the federation, and it continues:&mdash;&ldquo;A summary of the evidence is given below.&rdquo; Chapter 2 is the sole evidence provided in this commission's report against the radio trade as a whole, and I want to examine this chapter with particular care, because it is the full evidence on which the report is based.  In all the statements regarding the Fair Trade Commission, it has been clearly suggested that the commission's function is to look after the public interest.  If this is true, we would expect that at least one chapter of the report would show that some section of the public found the wireless trade or the Wireless Dealers' Association acting to its detriment.  Not one member of the general public felt sufficiently aggrieved to appear before the commission&mdash;not even that jack-of-all trades, the Housewives' Association, who, I think, appeared before every other commission. Not even they could find sufficient complaints against the trade to come before the commission.</P>
    <P>The only complaints that can be found were from 18 people who had a desire to enter the trade.  They had every intention of coming into the business, if they could, and of transacting it on what they considered the same terms as the present people in the trade.  They are hailed in this report as public benefactors, while existing radio traders are painted as public enemies.  Before examining the cases given in this chapter may I read a very short excerpt from the transcript of <Col N="1842" /> evidence, or part of the transcript of evidence, taken before the commission? It is from a speech which was made before the commission by the senior counsel who was representing the wireless trade.  Mr. McGilligan said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are special circumstances in the wireless radio business.  It is not one that touches the community at all.  It is only fringing the matter at the very worst and in the circumstances that prevail it is an astoundingly good industry to be able to keep its costs of manufacture and distribution at a cost where the manufacturers can sell at a little less than what they did pre-war, the dealer, at the same time, getting the same percentage discount; he is getting into his hands money that is far less so far as purchasing power is concerned than pre-war.  Nevertheless we have been unfortunate because openly&mdash; there is no question of any secret&mdash; it is common knowledge&mdash;manufacturers and dealers in this particular business had two things&mdash;they had an approved list and they tried to restrict the sales of receivers to that particular group,...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the person taking down the transcription could not get the next couple of words uttered by Mr. McGilligan.  Mr. McGilligan continues for quite a long period in a similar strain.  All his speech in this available transcript of evidence goes to show that in the evidence brought before the commission there was no case built up against the wireless trade.</P>
    <P>If I may deal now with these 18 cases, the first case was a Mr. Snee of Kilkelly, County Mayo.  It appears that this man deserted the radio business when things were slack.  He did not worry about his customers who might require service.  That was too bad, but he had emigrated.  He decided to return to the business when he thought money was again in it.  He flatly refused to show that he was qualified to give after sales service that his customers were paying for at the time when they purchased a radio from him. What had he to offer to the public? We are not told, nor are we told that it was serving the public interest to have him in the radio business.  The <Col N="1843" /> only organisation mentioned as having dealt with Mr. Snee is the Wireless Dealers' Association, who did not add him to the list of approved dealers in 1946.</P>
    <P>This report mentions the Wireless Dealers' Association approved list, which did not exist in 1946.  The Wireless Dealers' Association approved list was first published in January, 1950, and I would ask Senators to bear that date in mind in dealing with other cases.  It is perfectly true that the manufacturers had an approved list before that, and it was in fact the Federation of Irish Radio Manufacturers who dealt with this case of Mr. Snee.  The three morning newspapers of the 15th January, 1953, all quoted Mr. Snee as stating that he was dealing with the Federation of Irish Radio Manufacturers, yet apparently the Fair Trade Commission were not aware of that, although the newspapers quoted him as having said it; and all the morning papers quoted Mr. Snee as claiming to be one of the original founders of the Wireless Dealers' Association, so obviously he is a subscriber to the principles of that association.</P>
    <P>Again, that is not made clear in this commission's report.  The Wireless Dealers' Association's case with regard to Mr. Snee only gets four lines.  The report says &ldquo;he had been asked to undergo a test to prove that he was capable of undertaking repair work, but had objected, in principle, on the ground that he had the requisite experience and skill and undergoing the tests entailed expense for him&rdquo;. As I say, the Wireless Dealers' Association's case is only given that short reference in that case.  According to the newspapers, arrangements were made for Mr. Snee to undergo the tests in his immediate locality at no great inconvenience to himself.  He refused to do this, but lost far more trouble and time coming to an inquiry in Dublin seven or eight years later. Why does the commission not tell us that this man has failed to show any reason as to why he should be considered as being in a position to honestly take money from a customer?</P>

      <P>Reading from a report.  On the second point of order raised by Dr. ffrench O'Carroll, it does seem to me to be necessary that he should refer to the names of individuals who gave evidence, but I would suggest to the Senator that, in making reference to those individuals, he should just choose to make known their <Col N="1845" /> names without some of the comments which he deems necessary to make to illustrate his point.

I am examining the report issued by the Fair Trade Commission.  I am endeavouring to show that, in my opinion, the report does not reflect the evidence submitted. I agree with Senator ffrench O'Carroll that it is not our place to try the case in the way the commission did.  I am trying to show that I am satisfied&mdash;and I wish the members of the House to feel the same&mdash;that this report is not a fair report on the evidence submitted at that commission.

      <P>Yes.  Senator Douglas is now inviting the Seanad to retry the case by quoting his version of what happened before the commission and how wrong the commission were in coming to the conclusions, which he thinks were erroneous conclusions. This House cannot possibly test the veracity of what Senator Douglas is saying, unless it proceeds to examine the members of the commission who wrote this report and ask them what they have got to say about Senator Douglas's charges, but there is no machinery in the restrictive Trade Practices Act whereby the Seanad has any such functions in that regard.  I do not know what Senator Douglas is now inviting this House to do.  He is telling the House that the commission made an incorrect report as far as the evidence is concerned, but how the Senator is going to check the accuracy <Col N="1846" /> of that I do not know, nor do I yet know what is the purpose of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the second case&mdash;case B&mdash;which refers to a Mr. Leetch, Kilkelly, County Mayo, this man also forgot about his customers when supplies got scarce, but he decided to come back to business when sales started again.  He showed no concern whatsoever for service.  The commission suggests that he tried to get on the wireless dealers' approved list in November, 1949, and claimed to be able to do normal service work.  The official transcript of the evidence shows that Mr. McGilligan submitted in his summing-up that Leetch admitted during the inquiry that he had never filled in an application form to the Wireless Dealers' Association.  He also admitted that he had no technical knowledge whatsoever.  He claims to have gained practical experience through the sale of sets over a period of years, but admitted during questioning that he had never received a complaint in respect of a set he had sold. Where then did he get this practical experience of servicing sets?  Can we take the five lines of the Wireless Dealers' Association case given by the commission as being a fair summary of the evidence?  Can we accept it that the commission has been fair in not showing clearly that Leetch failed to establish it was in the interest of the consuming public that he should be allowed to accept money when he was not in a position to give after sales service?  That is not brought out in <Col N="1847" /> the commission's report.  The report says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In November, 1949, he applied to the Wireless Dealers' Association to be put on the approved list of radio retailers, but was refused on the grounds that he had not a person in his whole-time employment who was capable of carrying out repair work.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Case C refers to a Mr. T. Gray, of Shercock, County Cavan.  Here is a case of a man accepted by the Federation of Radio Manufacturers in 1948 and deleted again from its list within 12 months because he was found not to be a shopkeeper.  He came before the commission and described himself as a radio and cycle dealer prevented from making a living.  None of the newspapers, nor the summing-up on behalf of the Wireless Dealers' Association referred to the fact that he claimed to be able to do any service work.  The commission says he did make this claim.  This is something upon which we should have some more information as it seems extraordinary that the Wireless Dealers' Association or the federation did not deal with this point, if it were ever made.  The Wireless Dealers' Association stated that the witness had, in fact, told its former secretary that he knew nothing whatsoever about repair work.  The commission's own summary indicates that Gray asked to be put in touch with a suitable service man.  Is the commission correct, therefore, that the witness actually claimed to be able to do service work when he gave his evidence?  There seems to be a serious mistake on a very material point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transcript of the Wireless Dealers' Association's summing-up&mdash;a document which I have here&mdash;shows that questioning elicited that Gray was a substantial farmer who owns two farms in the neighbourhood of Shercock. I believe he has never been regarded as a shopkeeper and lost all cycle or other agencies granted to him because he never had a shop open during the day.  He is obviously a man who would never give any service whatsoever to the public and merely wanted to make a few pounds as a <Col N="1848" /> sideline at night when it suited him.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, may I ask for some further information?  If this amendment is put down because the final decision by the Minister was not based on a fair report of what was made available, I cannot see how we can get down to discussing the position between the members of the wireless trade and those 18 persons who objected because they were not admitted into the wireless trade.  That has nothing to do with the actual substance of the amendment.  Apart from that fact, I think it is quite unfair that we should discuss the position and attack people who are not in a position to defend themselves.  It seems to me to be retrying the case.</P>

      <P>All I am trying to do is show that this House is being asked, like the Dáil, to accept a Bill based on an Order which itself was based on a report which I am satisfied from the transcript of evidence made available to me is not a fair report of the proceedings.  All I am asking the House to do, having heard the case, is not to accept this Bill.</P>
      <P>Case D refers to a Mr. J.G. Daly, of Castleisland, County Kerry.  The commission should be ashamed to have given this as an alleged &ldquo;summary of the evidence&rdquo; in the transcript.  It is an absolute travesty of the facts available. This gentleman is quoted in the daily newspapers of the 16th December, 1953, as having made some extraordinary statements to which the commission did not even refer and that is probably just as well.  It is vitally important that the full transcript of the evidence be carefully examined in this case and compared with the evidence of Mr. Jeremiah Kelleher who gave evidence at the inquiry as a director of a company in Castleisland.  In the end of the commission's summary they referred to the witness' reference to &ldquo;his position as a service man with a firm of radio dealers&rdquo; following a breakdown in business.  That is referred to in the report.  Yet, a director of that firm gave evidence before the commission that that person had not been employed by his company.  Why did the Fair Trade Commission decide not to make that available either to the public in its report or to the members of Parliament?</P>
      <P>I do not intend to go through every one of these cases this evening.  I could take each one separately and show, as I have done on the first four cases, that not a single one of these cases has been fairly reported in accordance with the evidence.  I should just like to take out one or two others where I think there is blatant evidence from Mr. McGilligan's own speech at the commission that there is a deliberate attempt to mislead the Minister and the Oireachtas on the evidence given before the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer now to case J, which is from Kilrush, County Clare.  I am referring to this case because this is one in which the Wireless Dealers' Association <Col N="1850" /> was involved.  It refers to a Mr. E.R. Walker.  Mr. Walker should have been on the approved list of the Wireless Dealers' Association but, in the case of Mr. Norton&mdash;Mr. Norton is another dealer referred to earlier in the report and he comes from Dublin &mdash;there was a misunderstanding.  Mr. Walker was asked to give evidence of his serviceability but he felt he was being singled out and questioned because he was an Englishman.  On hearing at the inquiry that everyone got the same treatment, he actually told the commission that he had no complaint.  He is now a member of the Wireless Dealers' Association.  On page 17 of the transcript of evidence, Mr. McGilligan said of Mr. Walker: He was a man who did say he would go on the list on condition that it was cleared up.  He had not appreciated the distinction between those who were on before March 1946, and the later group but when it was explained he said that while he still objected he thought they were doing good work, <i>et cetera.</i>  He said he would apply and be perfectly happy to come in.  He was clearly a man who had sufficient qualifications to be able to walk right on to the list.  He was one of those who made the point that the margin on which they were allowed to deal was too high, that it was too attractive to people who were merely interested in money not radio, a remark which would apply to most of the people who complained they were only interested in the money which they thought was in it.</P>
    <P>There were just two other cases which I should like to pick out because the report is typically flagrant in its dealings with these two cases.  Case P. deals with a Mr. Garvey of New Inn, Ballinasloe, County Galway.  He has one of the biggest businesses in his area.  He owns a cinema, a ballroom, a large garage, large showrooms, shops, a sand washing plant, and so forth, but he still grudged employing a man who knew something about radio.  However, the commission concedes that the Wireless Dealers' Association had not an opportunity of dealing with the application as it was only made at the time of the inquiry and its <i>bona fides</i> can be doubted since, as in the case of <Col N="1851" /> O'Duffy and the cycle dealers from Dun Laoire, not another word has been heard from him by the Wireless Dealers' Association.  The application seems to have been made for the purpose of qualifying as witnesses at the inquiry and may in fact have been made at the instance of the Fair Trade Commission.  I just do not know.</P>
    <P>There was one other case in the report which I feel I should deal with. It is the last one I intend to deal with under this section.  It is case E., a particularly interesting case.  A gentleman&mdash;I will mention his name if the Seanad so desires&mdash;appeared at the inquiry as representing the owners of a family business.  The &ldquo;business&rdquo;, however, consists of two brothers, one of whom was the witness.  As I say, this is case E., Portlaoise.  The commission saw from the Wireless Dealers' Association files that this gentleman, the witness, is a full-time employee of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and possibly a member of the Post Office Workers' Union.  He still submitted himself to the association as being a full-time radio service man in his family business.  The other brother, alleged to be also dependent on the business, holds a full-time position with a woollen mills.  The commission suggests that the Wireless Dealers' Association implied that there were considerations affecting these matters influencing their decision on the application. The transcript, however, will show that immediately Mr. McGilligan tried to put questions to the witness concerning the fact that he proposed selling radio sets from a Post Office van, which he drives, during the hours for which he is paid to work by the State, the then chairman of the commission advised the witness to plead privilege and not to answer the question and the witness accepted this advice. Is the report of the commission a fair summary of that man's evidence? Incidentally, this family business has not even got a shop nor had it in fact got a business.  These things were hidden, as Mr. McGilligan himself says in his report.  That is a case which is given here amongst 18 others&mdash;the only case the commission could put up <Col N="1852" /> against the Wireless Dealers' Association.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, there was not a single member of the public who was prepared to come forward and say there was any justification for the charges made against the manufacturers and the trade that they were grossly overcharging or in fact restricting entry to the trade.  This Fair Trade Commission Report deals with 18 people who gave evidence before the commission, but on page 19 of this particular transcript there is the evidence of another gentleman who gave evidence before the commission. I wonder why his evidence has been suppressed from the report and is not available in it.</P>
    <P>This is what Deputy McGilligan had to say about this witness:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I was not present when he gave evidence, but I have read Mr. Prentice's notes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Prentice, I believe, was another barrister acting with him.  Mr. McGilligan went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am told that his case is a perfect example of the necessity for personal contacts as to whether or not an individual is competent.  He came here as an associate member of the Society of Electrical Engineers.  He spoke of his years in the Signal Corps, and his argument was such that he should not have been stopped on account of his service in radio. A few questions, however, I am told, indicated that he was a dangerous man to operate in any part of the country.  He was unqualified, and in the interests of the public I think it was perfectly legitimate to keep him out, until he became qualified.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder why the commission did not think fit to let us hear about that case.</P>
    <P>Chapter 2, as I have said, is the basis of the case which is supposed to have been built up against the radio trade and the Wireless Dealers' Association. I hope I have shown that it is a travesty of the evidence submitted, but this can only be proved, if we are in possession of the full transcript of the evidence.  The Minister has said that he has no power to provide a transcript <Col N="1853" /> of evidence and that the 1953 Act gives him no power to do so.  It is rather strange that in one case I have seen and in two cases have been offered transcripts of the evidence, in the inquiries concerning the building trade, the grocers, and the motor trade; yet, for some peculiar reason, the transcript of the evidence has been suppressed in the case of the wireless dealers' inquiry in spite of the fact that I have here in front of me a sworn statement by the present secretary of the Wireless Dealers' Association to the effect that he was promised that it would be made available to the association, and subsequently, when he applied for it, was told that he could not have it.  It is a very significant fact that the other traders have been offered transcripts of the evidence, but it has not been made available in the case of the wireless dealers' inquiry.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that Deputy McGilligan's summing up which I have quoted from was made before the publication of the report.  Based on the summing-up and on the verbal evidence given to me, I have shown how often this second chapter of the report is at variance with the truth. The transcript of evidence may, for all we know, show up even more glaring untruths, if it were available to this House.  If, as I believe, this House is made up of fair-minded men, anxious to see justice done fairly, I believe we should defer the Second Reading of this Bill, until we have seen and read the full transcript of the proceedings of the Fair Trade Commission.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, I am in favour of curtailing restrictive practices, if there is evidence that they are detrimental to the public interest.  Not one iota of evidence was produced to show that the regulations of the wireless trade were detrimental to the public interest.  In fact, the evidence submitted was quite the reverse. According to this report 61 complaints were received by the commission. Only 21 were considered to be worthy of examination.  I could show, but I have not in fact taken the time to show, that only three or four had grievances which would hold water, and in each of these cases the <Col N="1854" /> grievances were personal and had nothing to do with the public interest.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the report deal, in the main, with the restrictions which pertained in the radio trade, and as no attempt has been made to deny that there are regulations covering the manufacture, supply and distribution of wireless sets, I need not deal with them in such detail, except where they deliberately twist the evidence.</P>
    <P>Section 27 on page 24 of the report is confused, in my opinion.  It examines the origin and development of the approved list system, and I have already pointed out that the Wireless Dealers' Association did not prepare and publish an approved list until October, 1949.  Neither did its predecesor, the National Radio Traders' Association.  Over and over again, this report refers to the Wireless Dealers' Association's approved list in connection with dates prior to October, 1949. Surely it must have been abundantly clear to the members of the commission that, in referring to any date prior, in fact, to January, 1950, on which the approved list was first published, they were in fact making statements contrary to the truth.</P>
    <P>Page 35 of the report states&mdash;this is at the end of section 37:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was explained by the former secretary of the association that action in this case was taken because of the fact that he had based his prices on a discount of 25 per cent. to the retailer instead of the customary 33? per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the direct opposite of the evidence which was given by the former secretary of the association, Mr. McCann.  What McCann actually stated was that certain individual dealers had refused to support manufacturers because of a lower discount. The Wireless Dealers' Association was never opposed to lower discounts being allowed.  It has, however, imposed a ceiling of 33? per cent.  Yet this statement in the report would suggest quite the opposite to the evidence.</P>
    <P>Again on page 35, section 38 suggests that the Wireless Dealers' Association acted unfairly in the case of a person who wished to import television sets.  It <Col N="1855" /> is interesting and I think worth while to read what Deputy McGilligan had to say on that particular case.  He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Wilson was mainly on the question of T.V. sets.  Whether or not he had an interest in the circumstances of the inquiry, I do not know, but I suggest that the objection in his case was well founded.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Letters sent to him were before the commission and I assume that those letters would be available if we had a transcript of the evidence.  Unfortunately, I have not got those letters to quote from.  Mr. McGilligan went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Wilson's object was to become a member of the Wireless Dealers' Association so that he could sell sets and not offer maintenance, which was in the interests of the public, according to him.  Mr. Brownlee&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of the manufacturing representatives who gave evidence at the inquiry&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;said that a lot of people thought that T.V. was a simple proposition. There was, however, no equipment for real servicing of T.V., and if it came in the public were being deluded; they were being asked would they spend a good deal of money on an apparatus which could not be adequately or efficiently serviced.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At that time there were no facilities in the Republic to service television sets. Of course, as everybody knows, that has been remedied since the commission held the inquiry.</P>
    <P>Chapter 5, paragraph 40 commences by saying: &ldquo;It was alleged or implied by complainants that the system of control was devised and applied with the object of limiting the number of retailers to the advantage of those remaining on the approved list.  It was represented on behalf of the Wireless Dealers' Association that the purpose of the control was not restrictive, and that new applicants were welcome provided they were qualified and that the object was to ensure that only genuine traders who were prepared to afford <Col N="1856" /> adequate service to the public would be admitted to the list and that, on being so admitted, they would not engage in price competition.&rdquo;  Appendix H of the report clearly deals with this point, but I think it is much more clearly summed up in the Wireless Dealers' Association 1954 report, which states that the total number of applications dealt with between January, 1950, and December, 1953, was 438. According to the <i>Irish Times</i> report of 27th January&mdash;that would be 1954, I think&mdash;the chairman of the commission told Mr. McCann, then secretary of the Wireless Dealers' Association, that evidence had been given that 219 people had been rejected and 241 delayed. The same paper on the following day reported the chairman as saying that 530 people had been excluded from commerce in which they wished to engage.  There you have on two consecutive days the chairman of the commission giving completely different statements.</P>
    <P>The figures not given to the commission and not available at the time at the inquiry show the true picture that the public has not yet seen.  The figures mentioned by the chairman were obtained by totalling all the decisions in the minute book, but without having any regard for the number of times applications were dealt with, or the fact that some of the applications were dealt with over and over again.  The commission were made aware of that situation and their figures in this case are yet another example of the inaccuracies in the report.  The figures included cases which the Wireless Dealers' Association had dealt with, in one instance, on two occasions and they were represented as being two separate cases. There was the case of a person who was rejected on two occasions before approval was given.</P>
    <P>Of the 180 deletions from the approved list, some 50 were cases of people who had become ineffective in the trade or had closed their business. There were cases of others who were on the list of approved dealers when that list was first taken over by the Wireless Dealers' Association.  Of the remaining 138 involved in the removals, ten were deceased members of <Col N="1857" /> the trade, 113 raised no objection to removal either with the association or the commission and of 15 who objected the committee reinstated 11.  That information is supposed to be contained in appendix A of the report.</P>
    <P>I will now refer to section 54&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is included in the report, I must have overlooked it, and I apologise.  Section 54 of the report at page 45 states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The various objections raised by witnesses to the conditions regarding repair services on the premises may be summarised as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  that the Wireless Dealers' Association regulations were merely a pretext for limiting entry to the list, and were unnecessary because a satisfactory repair service could be provided in a variety of other ways, e.g., by sharing facilities among a number of dealers, by having repairs done by another dealer, or by making a contract with an independent service man;</P>
      <P>(b)  that dealers in country areas who, over a prolonged period, had provided service to the satisfaction of their customers, and had even repaired sets for approved retailers, had not been admitted to the list;</P>
      <P>(c)  that insistence on the employment of a service man on a whole-time basis was unreasonable for small retailers operating in rural areas as the volume of their business in radio would not provide enough work for a service man.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I return in that connection to the official transcript of the evidence?  Mr. McGilligan says that the use of this document was pointed and was sent in by the Federation of Manufacturers. He produced a sample of the application form for entry on to the approved list which dealt with this question of repairs and service.  That is not contained in the report.  Many of the people referred to as not having to provide service men were people who <Col N="1858" /> had been in the business prior to the taking over of the list by the Wireless Dealers' Association.</P>

I can only read from the sections of it which are available to me and I have not the remainder of the transcript; that is the part of the evidence which I hope might be made available by the Minister to the Seanad in due course.</P>
      <P>Section D at page 45 of the report says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As service men were not readily obtainable and even if it were economic to employ them that it would be difficult to induce them to accept employment in small towns and villages.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Not one person came before the commission to prove that.</P>
      <P>In the next section (e), the report states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;that the extent of the service necessary has been exaggerated.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In regard to that section, only two independent expert witnesses were called before the commission.  They were Mr. Honan, instructor at Kevin Street Technical Schools and Mr. O'Keeffe, Chief Engineer of Radio Eireann.  Both gave evidence completely contrary to the suggestion implied in paragraph 54 (e).</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have dealt <Col N="1859" /> with that earlier in my speech when I said that the Wireless Dealers' Association over a number of years have been endeavouring to put their house in order.  It was perfectly true that certain members of the trade were not fully equipped, but these were people who had been in the business prior to 1946.</P>
      <P>Section 65 at page 51 makes a brief reference to radio prices in other countries and says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The relevance of the point in the present context and indeed of comparisons in distant countries such as New Zealand and Canada was not considered to be such as to warrant the expenditure of time and effort necessary for a full examination of the matter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is a pity that no examination was made of prices in other countries, but I doubt if it would have suited the commission's purposes, for it would have confirmed the evidence produced at the inquiry that prices in this country were amongst the lowest.  Catalogues of many manufacturers were presented, showing the prices over the past 15 to 20 years and these were put in evidence before the commission.  In spite of the documentary evidence produced, the report in section 64 suggests that the average price to-day is some 50 per cent. higher.  It is true that modern sets incorporate many improvements over pre-war models, and there are many expensive models for which comparative sets were not available in pre-war days, but in the cheaper classes, as I call them, up to, say, £25, I find that the equivalent set to-day value for value in these reasonable price classes costs less than it did ten to 15 years ago.  We find that the cost is £15 2s. 6d. as compared with £16 2s. 6d. in 1938-39.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here two examples.  They are two Pye catalogues, one for 1938-39 and the other current at the time of the inquiry.  In 1938-39 the cheapest electric set available was 15 guineas, and at the time of the inquiry, it was £12 10s.  To-day, the Pye five valve set costs £15 2s. 6d. and a comparative <Col N="1860" /> set cost £16 2s. 6d. in 1938-39.  Other manufacturers produced similar evidence. Chapter 7 of the report was obviously prepared to tell the public what they thought the public wanted to hear.  The evidence which will be disclosed in the complete transcript of evidence will tell the truth on that matter.  All the evidence in that regard was submitted to the commission.</P>
    <P>Section 73 on page 55 is another example of the twisting of evidence, but I have already dealt with that point.</P>
    <P>On page 57, the report reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Under the present requirements, a businessman who wishes to take on radio as one of his lines of trade is required as a prerequisite of approval, either (a) to be already possessed himself of a certain skill in servicing radio sets&mdash;which may not be the case, and in most instances cannot be, since he has not been in the trade previously, or (b) to acquire that skill&mdash;which may be impracticable because a correspondence course was said to be inadequate without practical experience in addition and because the only other alternative is to go to Cork or Dublin and take a course in a technical school.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No evidence whatsoever was brought before the commission with regard to the value, good or bad, of correspondence courses; and I may say in passing, in regard to that paragraph, that the Wireless Dealers' Association has provided scholarships in the technical schools and has done everything within its power to encourage new entrants into the trade who are fully qualified to deal with wireless sets.</P>
    <P>At the top of page 67, in section 94, the report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the meantime the number of small-scale outlets has, in fact, been considerably reduced mainly as a result of direct intervention by the Trade Association.  So far from price competition having a similar effect on the existence of the small retailer, it is suggested in a subsequent paragraph that it would tend in some measure to favour him by providing <Col N="1861" /> him with the means of countering the attractions in the way of elaborate facilities offered by the large concerns.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Wireless Dealers' Association have always kept a careful check on price cutting and, since the inquiry, there has been no evidence that any small retailer has engaged in price cutting, although it would appear that that is the suggestion being made.  One man, not a member of the Wireless Dealers' Association, has been deleted from the approved list for price cutting, but he is one of the larger dealers in Dublin and owns three well-stocked stores.  I have here with me the Wireless Dealers' Association's file dealing with this chain-store dealer, and this was also brought before the commission. It is interesting to find that during the war years and after the war, from 1943 to 1948, when wireless sets were in short supply, this particular dealer was, on no less than ten occasions, approached by the Wireless Dealers' Association for overcharging &mdash;for asking a higher price than the recognised list price.  In 1943, for instance, the complaint against the firm was in respect of selling a Bush receiver at 30 guineas when the manufacturer's list price and that charged by every other dealer was 25 guineas. In 1947, to take another year, they supplied a customer in Limerick with a Philips radio receiver for £25 when the manufacturer's list price was £18. This is the sort of thing which is going to happen, if the larger dealers of this type get a monopoly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>He was already struck <Col N="1862" /> off for overcharging and was then reinstated. In this case, the most blatant case was one in which a price of £21 was charged for a set which happened to be one of the cheapest sets on the list at 9½ guineas.  I might mention that it was sold to a member of the teaching profession.  I think, even from that short quotation from this file, it is easy to see how this company would treat the public were they to drive small competitors with little capital out of business by price-cutting.</P>
      <P>Section 108 again repeats the lie that the Wireless Dealers' Association took action against a manufacturer who provided a trade discount of 25 per cent. I have shown already that there is no truth in this allegation and that no such evidence was ever given before the inquiry.  Individual dealers may decide not to buy from the manufacturer offering 25 per cent. discount, but that is not prevented by the Bill we are considering to-day. Another manufacturer, who is quoted in the report, said he thought 30 per cent. discount was not unreasonable for his make of set provided his outlets were reduced and he is satisfied that all dealers gave adequate after-sale service.  Since the inquiry, he has put this policy into effect and is allowing 30 per cent. discount on his sets.  As I have already said, the Wireless Dealers' Association fixed a maximum discount of 33? per cent., but no minimum, and, in fact, they took action against two manufacturers for exceeding this rate.  At the present time, they are actually dealing with another manufacturer who has attempted to exceed that rate in his discount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid I have been talking for a long time on this report, but I feel very strongly that the Oireachtas should be made aware of the type of justice which, in my opinion, is being meted out to its citizens.  We have a small group of manufacturers and traders working together, in my opinion, for the common good in the wireless trade. They have over 25 years' experience behind them and, from that experience, they have built up a system whereby their goods are offered to the public at competitive world prices.  Their trading arrangements and common <Col N="1863" /> objective are to ensure that people living in the remoter parts of the country will get their radio sets at the same prices, in the same condition and with the same after-sales service as persons living in Dublin.</P>
    <P>We have an endeavour by the present Government to decentralise industry, and at the same time we are now endeavouring in this House to pass legislation which will have the effect of penalising the person who goes to live in the remoter parts of the country.  It means that for the future wireless manufacturers will have to fix an ex-factory price, and if there is no adequate service provided in the remoter country districts, then the set will be going back and forth to the manufacturer, and the user will have to pay the costs of transport and will have to pay the additional charges to and fro. The controlled price has enabled the manufacturer to see that his wireless set is only supplied to a dealer who is able to give that service on the spot to the consumer.</P>
    <P>Is there any crime in wishing to fully protect a delicate product and in seeing that it reaches the consumer in factory condition?  I do not think there is.  Is there any crime in providing that the price of that article includes a certain amount in respect of after-sale service?  I do not think there is. Is there any crime in seeing that a person working for an employer should get a moderate return for his labour? I do not think so.  That is one of the objects of the Wireless Dealers' Association. Is it now a crime for a group of people to band together in a union for the purpose of protecting their own interests and of seeing that the public get a fair deal from their members?  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>By far the majority of radio dealers are small men, self-employed or with one or two assistants.  They are in the position of skilled tradesmen.  Are they now to be denied the full protection of the Trade Union Acts?  Up to the present, we have believed in this country that a man or group of men were entitled to a fair trial and if, on the weight of evidence, they were found guilty, they would be duly condemned. <Col N="1864" /> Now we have adopted the Soviet system of a mock trial and we find the defendants guilty without any evidence at all.</P>
    <P>The only concrete evidence which did emerge from the inquisition was, under the restrictions of the Wireless Dealers' Association, manufacturers were able to keep their prices down to pre-war level and at the same time provide greater service and protection to the public.  As Deputy McGilligan so ably put it before the inquiry, it makes us unique among manufacturers and traders in this country.  As I have already said, not one single member of the consumer public gave evidence at the inquiry or lodged complaints of unfair trading by members of the trade.  No evidence was produced to show that legitimate members of the trade were making an excess, much less an adequate, profit, but the report contains plenty of veiled references to that effect.  The only evidence produced against the trade was given by people who wanted to get into the business because they believe there are vast profits to be made.  They have no interest in giving after-sales service and, if I may put it bluntly, they wanted to get into the trade to fleece the public.</P>
    <P>The present Bill seeks to confirm the Order made by the Minister in May, 1955.  The Order is supposed to be based on this report.  We are just being asked to approve legislation which will allow persons who attended and gave evidence against the trade to enter the business.  On their own evidence, they have shown that they have no interest in fair trading or in serving the public.  The present Bill, when it becomes law, will allow them to enter the wireless business, but it will take them some time to realise that the profits in the radio trade are much less than in most other businesses. In the meantime, many of the existing dealers, who have given many years' service to the public, and who have banded together in a trade union to prevent exploitation of the public and to maintain the standards of the radio trade, will be deprived of their livelihood.</P>
    <P>To end, I want to deal with one section <Col N="1865" /> in the actual Order.  In the Dáil, the Minister stated that it was not the purpose under the 1953 Act to deal with the workers' trade unions.  I find that Section 14 of the Order, which is disguised under the heading &ldquo;Publication of lists of approved traders&rdquo; says in Section 14 (1):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No association, organisation, or other combination shall prepare, maintain, publish or issue, or cause to be prepared, maintained, published, or issued, any lists of approved or non-approved persons or of persons classified in any way which have, or are likely to have, the effect of limiting or restricting entry to trade in goods to which this Order applies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now the Wireless Dealers' Association have in the past endeavoured to fix a minimum wage rate for its employees in the radio trade who are not members of a workers' trade union.  If they did not fix that particular wage, it would be possible for the members to employ what might be vulgarly described as scab labour, but they have insisted that their members should pay the minimum wage to such people as they might employ.  Under Section 14 of the Order, it will now be impossible for that association, or for any other trade union, to issue, maintain, publish or cause to be maintained or published any lists of approved or non-approved persons.  In other words, the trade unions will no longer be able to say to the radio manufacturers that they must employ a person at a certain wage rate, because, by employing him at that particular wage rate, you may restrict entry into the trade.</P>
    <P>That is quite clearly covered by Section 14, but it is made more clear in the Order issued a few days ago in relation to the trade, because, if you read the section, it is not put nearly as veiled as it is in this Order.  I agree that it was not the intention to deal with a workers' trade union and I was exceedingly surprised to find in this Section 14 that the Order would in fact apply to the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union, who are the only trade union, besides the Wireless Dealers' Association, concerned with this trade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1866" /> I have tried, possibly at too great length, to show that this report on which this Order is based is contrary to the evidence submitted to the commission. If I have been able to raise any doubts at all in the minds of Senators, then I feel we would be justified in saying that we wish to defer the Second Reading until such time as the transcript is made available to the Seanad.  My case is based on the facts that, in all the other inquiries, a transcript has been available to the people concerned.  It is not available in this case.  As I said earlier, I should like to know why.  I feel that we in the Seanad should ask the Minister, if necessary, to take steps to provide that a full transcript be made available to a committee of the House, or of both Houses of the Oireachtas, so that we can see for ourselves whether the evidence is in accord with the report of the commission.</P>
    <P>I would have put down a similar motion on the Restrictive Trade Practices (No. 2) Bill but I am satisfied from the transcript that it was quite unnecessary to put down a motion of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to speak in opposition to this amendment, and indirectly, consequently, in support of the Bill put before us this night by the Minister.  I think we can all recognise that Senator Douglas has put as good a case as could be put.  I think we can admire his placidity; I think we can admire his stamina.  I think I can promise to cut my own speech to not more than 33? per cent. of the time occupied by Senator Douglas.  I shall endeavour, indeed, to do better than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Douglas started off by saying that the transcript, if it were available&mdash;although he himself seemed to have a reasonably good copy&mdash;would show that the report is a &ldquo;complete distortion&rdquo; of the facts.  I was half tempted to ask him to lay this transcript of evidence, from which he quoted so freely, on the Table of the <Col N="1867" /> House, but I refrained from doing so because I was afraid he might do it.</P>
    <P>My own impression is that he has made a very skilful case out of very little material.  He did not refer, as in other connections one hears similar phrases, to the delicate dealer-consumer relationship in the radio trade, but he gave us to understand that the consumer of radio can only be handled in the luxury and comfort to which he has been accustomed if he dealt with a dealer, not necessarily a member of the association, but, at any rate, one on their approved list.</P>
    <P>He referred to the &ldquo;very simple&rdquo; objects of the Wireless Dealers' Association, and they gave us to understand that they were simply for the benefit of the community in general and, of course, a certain amount for the protection of themselves.  On the last page of the report, page 120, I find the conditions under which a member can be expelled from such an association. I find that if a person refuses to abide by the &ldquo;policy and decisions&rdquo; of the executive council, that executive council can, by a two-thirds of the vote given thereon, remove that member from the association or federation and that member will &ldquo;not have any redress&rdquo; against the association or federation.  Furthermore, I note, on the same page, that a quorum at a meeting of the executive council shall be four members.  Well, that seems harsh.  Senator Douglas employs two analogies.  He said the Fair Trade Commission was like a Soviet trial and he said it was like an inquisition.  I am not sure what kind of a trial a member of the association gets before the executive, but, apparently, he, too, has no redress.</P>
    <P>Now, Senator Douglas, I am afraid, went into the realm of fantasy when he said the commission &ldquo;wanted a victim,&rdquo; and so they hit upon the poor little radio dealer's trade.  It is true that it was the first trade to be examined, but it was only the first trade. Quite a number of other trades have been examined.  Some of them have protested, but the fact is that the wireless dealers have not in any sense been singled out.  The building trade has <Col N="1868" /> been gone into; the grocery trade has been gone into; the chemists' trade has been gone into; the motor trade has been gone into and so on.  The wireless dealers have by no means been singled out.  They were the first, but there had to be a first trade to be so examined.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, Senator Douglas made two excellent points.  First, he challenged the Minister when the Minister stated that these Orders were incapable of amendment and he was able, very appositely, to quote from the debates in the Seanad when the Bill was originally going through and when the then Minister, Deputy Lemass, said that &ldquo;certainly&rdquo; these Orders could be amended in the House.  I feel the Minister is in honour bound to answer that.  I feel that was certainly a valuable point.</P>
    <P>But it is also true that he quoted from that same debate that these Orders were to be considered like any other Orders such as the Imposition of Duties Order which comes before this House from time to time.  I am familiar with the matter, and I have not a very distant experience that the only way in which you can, in fact, amend these Orders coming before the House is by deleting a section.  You cannot amend these Orders in the sense that you can change their wording or purport.  When we get the Imposition of Duties Order before us, we can amend it by suggesting the deletion of one or other item, but we are not allowed to amend it in any fuller sense.  That might be the defence put up by the Minister in the case.</P>
    <P>The other excellent point to which the Minister must advert was that made by Senator Douglas in relation to the employment of trade union labour in Clause 14 of the Order.  I would not anticipate the Minister's answer, but I should like to say that one must, if one is impartial, feel a certain sympathy with the indignation of Senator Douglas when he objects to certain types of restriction on trade being prevented while other types of restriction on trade are not affected.</P>
    <P>We all know it would be irrelevant to go into detail about the existing <Col N="1869" /> restrictive practices of that kind, but I am prepared to support Senator Douglas in any stand he may take for the purpose of removing that type of restriction also.  Unfortunately, however, I understood from him that he is rather opposed to the removal of any kind of restriction altogether.  I am afraid that on that point I might part company with him.</P>
    <P>He said, earlier on, that there were not, quoting average figures, excessive profits in the retail radio trade.  I think that is quite possible.  I do not propose to challenge his figures because I think his figures were accurate. I am quite certain he made them as accurate as he could.  He made a passing jest about &ldquo;gross profits&rdquo; and he suggested that such people as myself &mdash;he did not mention me by name&mdash;he doubted if university lecturers would consider all of their salaries as gross profits.  He did not mention, however, that such people have not got &ldquo;expense accounts.&rdquo;  I think, to complete the picture, he might have given us some insight into what is meant in the business world by an &ldquo;expense account.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>However, his figures I am not challenging. I think in general it is possibly true to say that, on the average, there are not excessive profits in the trade but that might indicate that there are too many people in the business, too many such retailers and too many wireless dealers.  I think that on that point, too, Senator Douglas would agree with me.  The question then must be asked: how shall we decide who is to enter the trade; who shall stay in the trade, and who shall be thrown out?  How shall we decide that?  Again, who shall decide who shall enter this trade, who shall stay in it and who shall be thrown out?</P>
    <P>I suggest that of the alternatives I am going to mention the second is preferable.  Should it be a small private group with a vested interest in the trade that should decide who shall come in, who shall stay in, and who shall be thrown out, or shall it be the consuming public who shall be the controlling group through the often-mentioned law of supply and demand?  If there is not a public demand in a free competitive regime, it <Col N="1870" /> is the least efficient producers who will go by the board and go out of business. I recognise that that may be harsh in individual cases.  It is a fairer test, however, than leaving it to a private group with a vested interest in the profits of the trade.</P>
    <P>I should not like to follow Senator Douglas into all the intricacies of the points he made arising out of the report but I should like to mention one or two things.  He mentioned page seven with a great air of condemnation and the fact that the report suggests that &ldquo;generally&rdquo; the sale of radio sets is carried out in conjunction with the sale of other goods, particularly electrical appliances, cycles, hardware and furniture. That is the statement, if I heard the Senator correctly.</P>
    <P>Now Senator Douglas stated that 30 per cent. of the trade is carried out quite independently of any other goods; so that we find that 70 per cent. of the trade is carried on in conjunction with the sale of other goods.  Consequently, he is objecting to the Fair Trade Commission using the word &ldquo;generally&rdquo; to apply to 70 per cent. of the trade.  He may have established a point there, but it seems to be a small and finicky debating point.</P>
    <P>He went on to a more important point when he suggested that if the Order is to go through and if resale price maintenance is to disappear from the trade&mdash;that is really the kernel of the matter&mdash;he suggested that the benefit of the reduction in price resulting therefrom will not be enjoyed by about 80 per cent. of the people buying radios since, on the evidence of the report, about 80 per cent. of the people buy their radios on hire purchase, therefore, these 80 per cent. would not enjoy the benefit of the price reduction.</P>
    <P>I would make a twofold answer to that.  There will be less than 80 per cent. buying on the hire purchase if you have a more reasonable cash price, because one of the reasons why people are forced to buy certain commodities through hire purchase is because the cash price is unnecessarily and artificially inflated.  Therefore that figure of 80 per cent. will drop if the price is <Col N="1871" /> lowered.  Secondly, the hire purchase prices are always, as far as I understand it, related to the cash price. Consequently, if the cash price drops, presumably the hire purchase price will drop also, and so, in that second way also, those who buy their radio sets through hire purchase will benefit if, in fact, the Minister's Order is implemented, as I hope it will be.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas also referred to the application form for members to the Wireless Dealers' Association.  He referred rather lightly to it, and he did not quote very extensively from it.  He said it was a perfectly simple form, and that anybody could understand it, and that it was not as complicated as an income-tax form.  It is quite a simple form.  It asks for 19 pieces of information, it is true, and it is divided up into four or five sub-sections. Nevertheless, it is of interest to note items Nos. 16, 17 and 18.  Item No. 16 reads as follows: &ldquo;Do you undertake to maintain at all times the Manufacturers' List Prices?&rdquo;  Item No. 17 asks: &ldquo;In connection with the sale of new sets do you undertake to refrain from making allowances on secondhand receivers which are, in the opinion of the Control Committee, excessive and above their true market value?&rdquo;  Item No. 18 reads: &ldquo;Do you undertake to refrain from supplying radio receivers or equipment for resale to the public, to any person, firm or corporation whose name does not appear on the Approved List?&rdquo;  That is very simple.  We can all understand it, but it represents a very big basic document for restrictive practices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

      <P>I should not like to be taken as suggesting that Senator Douglas denied there were restrictive practices.  I would point out, however, that in this simple document the reasons why some of us, not Senator Douglas, object to this kind of restrictive practice, against which <Col N="1872" /> this Bill before us to-day is directed, are clearly stated.</P>
      <P>I noticed, not with surprise, that Senator Douglas made very little reference to Chapter IV which starts on page 28.  It refers to &ldquo;Enforcement Arrangements.&rdquo;  On page 29, a very alarming circular is reproduced which was sent out by the Wireless Dealers' Association.  It has a lot of capital letters and it is a very frightening document.  It starts off in enormous capitals: &ldquo;Our Members must keep a Close Watch on a very Dangerous Situation.&rdquo;  The very dangerous situation is that some members of the Wireless Dealers' Association might give a slight cut in price to some of their friends, or might sell sets to people off the approved list.</P>
      <P>If you are a member getting this circular, you are informed under paragraph (a), page 29, that you are acting as a wholesaler if you do these things with radio sets and, &ldquo;when your guilt is established by the simple process of checking serial numbers, your name will be recommended for deletion from the approved list of dealers&rdquo;.  You can imagine that &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; person in sackcloth and ashes promising never again to cut prices because that is his &ldquo;crime.&rdquo; The word was used by Senator Douglas later in his speech.  He did not quite put the question: is this a crime?  I think it might be put to him: is it a crime to have competitive retail pricing? Personally, I do not regard it as a crime, and there are many occasions on which it may considerably benefit the consuming public.</P>

    <P>The Minister, in opening, made a point, arising out of this request for the transcript, which seems to me legitimate.  I see no particular objection to allowing anybody interested to buy the transcript of evidence of any of these commissions.  I would think it would be quite a good thing.  I see no objection at all to it.  As far as I can see, the main object, as far as Senator Douglas is concerned, would be to discover what were the two words in the speech of Deputy McGilligan which were missed by his official stenographer. I also am intrigued to know what these two words were.  I have no <Col N="1873" /> doubt they were full of dynamite.  I see no objection then to making available to those prepared to pay for it a copy of the transcript of evidence. The Minister, however, has made a good rebutting point on that.  He said the transcript of evidence was only part of the evidence before the commission. Senator Douglas did not answer that point at all.  All the books, documents and files, I understand, in the possession of the various Government Departments, relative to the trade, were placed at the disposal of the Fair Trade Commission, and rightly so.  Naturally, they based their conclusion, not only upon the verbal evidence given before them, but also on the documentary evidence already in the possession of the Government. I do not know whether Senator Douglas wants the publication of all these Government files.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I never questioned the documentary evidence submitted to the inquiry.  If the Senator would read my motion, he would realise I was dealing only with the section of the report in reference to which it was publicly stated that certain sections are in their entirety, or in part, contrary to the evidence submitted at the inquiry.</P>

      <P>I am afraid Senator Douglas is missing the point I am making, and also what the Minister said: namely, to formulate a report on the weight of the evidence, you must weigh not only the verbal evidence, to which Senator Douglas referred, but also the documentary evidence.  If you examined verbal evidence only the weight might go one way, whereas, if you examine the verbal evidence and the documentary evidence, the weight may go overwhelmingly the other way. That is what can happen if you are in possession not only of verbal evidence but of documentary evidence.  It seems to me the Senator has been answered by the Minister on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to Senator Douglas, I got the impression that we got in his speech a pretty full transcript of all the proceedings of the Fair Trade Commission.  He did not spare us any details, or very few at any rate.  Any <Col N="1874" /> of them which do not appear on the Official Report of the Seanad must be small indeed.</P>
    <P>The second point I would make in relation to the demand for the transcript of evidence is that, if the public were to be given it, I still feel we are not the people to judge.  Which is the best body, who is best suited to weigh the evidence?  Obviously, the body officially appointed and required to do so&mdash;the Fair Trade Commission.  Unless we vote &ldquo;no confidence&rdquo; in the commission, I submit we are bound to accept their judicial opinion as to their conclusions upon the weight of evidence, they being the people best suited to judge.  The Minister made the point well, I think, and established it, that his Order did not attempt in any way to interfere with the right of the trade to prevent &ldquo;lost leaders&rdquo; or unfair competition; but he made the case that you do not decide to stop all price competition, which is what the wireless dealers did and admittedly still want, simply because some price competition may be excessive.  I did not feel Senator Douglas answered that point.</P>
    <P>I should like to come now to the main and obvious reasons why we must support the Minister and the Government on this Order.  I suggest they are summed up in a chapter ignored <i>in toto</i> by Senator Douglas, Chapter XI.  I hope I do not want to wrong him when I say that that chapter was ignored by the Senator, but I notice in Chapter XI, which is the chapter on the general summary of conclusions and recommendations on the conditions obtaining, that in paragraph 118 we read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The exclusive dealing and resale price maintenance arrangements described in the report prevent and restrict competition and restrain trade by limiting the numbers of retailers and preventing or restricting competition in price amongst those retailers who are permitted to engage in the trade.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the first main reason for the Order.  The second is contained in paragraph 119 (i):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is unfair that radio manufacturers to whom the market is <Col N="1875" /> virtually reserved by the tariff and on whom retailers are thus dependent should discriminate against certain persons by refusing to supply them solely because they are not sponsored or approved by an association.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the second reason, and it is a good reason.  The third reason is, as stated in the same paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(ii) It is unfair that restriction of the right of any person to engage effectively in the retail trade should be within the competence of vested retailer interests.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fourth reason in the same paragraph is the tariff protection.  I think this touches us in the Oireachtas even more closely:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(iii) The tariff protection afforded to the home manufacturer against external competition has been availed of to protect retailers by restricting intornal competition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is a vital point.  The fifth and last reason I want to quote is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(ix) The arrangements made between the manufacturers and the retailers acting in concert have made compulsory the taking of profit margins beyond the levels which might otherwise have obtained.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are clear reasons.  These are reasons which, I think, are cogent and compelling reasons why we should accept this Bill and be very grateful (a) that we have a Fair Trade Commission which has done such excellent work and (b) that the Minister has decided to act so promptly upon their recommendations.</P>
    <P>I would suggest, as I have suggested before, that the Fair Trade Commission has, in fact, set an example.  It is one of the pieces of legislation by means of which we have set a headline to other countries.  In Britain to-day, they may well be examining the methods whereby we have decided that the Fair Trade Commission will deal with the whole question of unfair restrictions in trade. Therefore, I am disappointed when I find a prominent businessman&mdash;I do not intend to mention him by name&mdash;<Col N="1876" /> the other day, and I quote from the <i>Evening Mail</i> of the 7th February of this year, calling for &ldquo;the abolition of the Fair Trade Commission&rdquo; because he says it is &ldquo;interfering,&rdquo; and so on. He says there are trading conditions to-day where &ldquo;competition is intense&rdquo; and so forth.  He calls for the abolition not only of the Fair Trade Commission, but of the Prices Advisory Body and the prices section of the Department of Industry and Commerce as well.  He pays great tribute, however, to the way in which that Department put protective tariffs on foreign textiles being brought in, and to Córas Tráchtála for aiding manufacturers to export their goods.  If these businessmen are prepared to use the tariffs and protection put on by the State, they should be prepared to allow the State to have some say in the way they fix and maintain prices.</P>
    <P>I would put the proposition to the Seanad that the removal by the Fair Trade Commission and by this Bill of such restrictions imposed by private bodies, private groups and associations, cannot in any way be said to be hampering trade.  The object of all too many of these private bodies is, in fact. the maintenance of privilege and sectionalism. On page 38 of the report, reference is made to the desire in the country to trim down the list, which means squeezing out marginal members on the approved list.</P>
    <P>It is always hotly denied furthermore by such associations that they indulge in fixing prices.  They &ldquo;suggest&rdquo; prices; but, if you do not accept their suggestions, you do not get their sets.  It is nonsense to say that that is not price fixing.</P>
    <P>I come now to resale price maintenance. There is no question but that very frequently in certain trades&mdash;one thinks of the fruit and vegetable trade and other trades&mdash;a high profit margin is justified, or appears justifiable, because the goods in question are perishable. They cannot be kept for long. Refrigerators may be required, in which to keep such goods.  There is a loss on certain goods that go bad, if they are kept too long.  But that does not apply to this trade.  Yet, the wireless trade is insisting up to this day, <Col N="1877" /> until this Order goes through, that their dealers should take a gross profit of 50 per cent. although this is a trade in which the goods cannot be said in any vital way to be perishable or to require refrigeration, and so forth.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this is a trade which is protected by high tariffs and which uses what are meant to be defence weapons placed in their hands by the community&mdash;the consumers, the public and the Oireachtas&mdash;in order to hit the community, and sometimes hit it very hard.  Their motto seems to be to stick together and sting the consumer.  They act as though competitive pricing was quite dead and they try to keep the trade small and tight, and the profits high.  It is we in the Oireachtas who gave that protection and we have the right to see that that protection is not abused in order to mulct the public.  A healthy breath of competition would do some sections of our business community a world of good.</P>
    <P>Many people complain that they hate &ldquo;controls&rdquo;.  They really object to control in the community interest. They clearly foster and build up controls by controlling commodities for their own private interests.  Consequently, I congratulate the Minister and the Government on their swift and effective action, in the community interest, based upon what is an eminently fair report.  I would congratulate even more the Fair Trade Commission for both the manner and the high public value of their work.  I think they have been extremely fair and extremely courageous.  We have set a headline in this matter; and it is excellent that we have had, through their work, a ventilation of all the backroom arrangements and methods which are worked out in order to sting and charge the public more than they should pay.  It is high time that kind of thing was shown up and it is high time effective action was taken to protect the consuming public from what are nothing but predatory tradesmen. It is in that spirit that I support this <Col N="1878" /> Bill and heartily approve the Minister for bringing it forward.</P>

      <P>I do not think this House to-night will have an opportunity of deciding for or against this amendment or for or against this Bill.  It would be desirable, in view of the importance of the measure, that Senators should have perhaps a little time to think over the case that was made very ably by the Minister in favour of this Bill and the case that was made by the Minister, also very ably, against this amendment.  Furthermore, we would need to consider very carefully the lengthy case that was made by Senator Douglas in support of this amendment. Without a doubt, he devoted a very great deal of time to consideration of this matter.  He must have studied the case very carefully and certainly he presented it very well.  I am not completely convinced that what Senator Douglas asked for might be granted by this House.  What is involved to a more important degree by his amendment is whether or not this commission gave a fair report.  The decision the House will be called upon to make is one of confidence, or otherwise, in the Fair Trade Commission. If we are certain that the report presented by the commission to the Government was absolutely fair, then we must adopt it; but if there is any doubt whatever in our minds in regard to the fairness of that report, then we ought to defer consideration of this Bill.  To defer that consideration might mean defeating the measure for the time being, but it would be desirable perhaps that this House should at least show that, on matters of this kind, we are prepared to take an independent stand.  We have to examine the points made by Senator Douglas very carefully.  We have to see whether the Bill is or is not desirable.</P>
