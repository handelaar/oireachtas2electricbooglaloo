    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening, the burden of my remarks was that we were not investing sufficient in self-sustaining investment.  I now want to suggest briefly some ways in which we may ensure that result.  In my opinion, there are two ways in which we can expand self-sustaining investment. Firstly, we can do it by allowing to the factories and to the farmers sufficient money for reinvestment in their vocations, if we allow what is generally called ploughing back. People say that there is little or no income-tax imposed on agriculture, but I know part of my county where the rates are as much an impost as £3 per acre and, without being too dramatic, I believe it is true to say that landlords were shot for less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I think we can get this additional money for self-sustaining investment by a complete overhaul of our Government expenditure.  The great Departments of State are spending enormous sums of money, and is the money they are collecting from this small country, poor in natural resources, commensurate with the value <Col N="318" /> they are giving to our economy?  I contend that in no measure is it commensurate. They must cut out the dead wood.  I believe there is not a Department in which there is not a number of redundant officers and various sections which at one time had some very useful functions but to-day probably have none and are there merely as sort of supernumeraries.  I was heartened when the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech said he was setting up a special branch and seconding certain officials of the Department for the purpose of looking into and overhauling the complete machine on the executive side of the Government.  The country and every one of us are looking forward hopefully to good results from the efforts of the Minister who is a man of energy, drive and purpose.</P>
    <P>I think also, in the general sense, if we look, on the one hand, at the small farmer and farm labourer and, on the other hand, at the State and local government servant, we must say that the small farmer and farm labourer are underprivileged and that the State servant and local government servant are overprivileged.  I know that many of the higher civil servants and local government officials give good service and work long into the night, but generally the conditions of the young man who stays at home in agriculture and those of his brother who goes into the Civil Service or local government service are weighted very much in favour of the man who takes employment with the State rather than the man who remains as a self-employed person.</P>
    <P>If we are to create healthy conditions for export and productivity, we should try to see that that balance is changed and that the emphasis is in favour of the person who stays at home to work on his farm and that he will enjoy better conditions and a better way of life than he is enjoying at the moment. We must bear in mind that most public servants are now permanent and pensionable at an early age, that we must carry them from the age of 65, even though the advance of science has increased the expectancy of life.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there would <Col N="319" /> be taxation on expenditure rather than on income.  Why not reduce the standard rate of income-tax and impose a purchase tax on luxuries?  There are all sorts of luxuries available in this country.  Many of them are being enjoyed by all types of people and many of them are imported.  The Government, the Minister for Finance and his officials ought seriously to consider the introduction of a purchase tax on luxuries.  A family that experiences sickness or other emergencies has to avoid luxuries in order to pay for these misfortunes.  With the heavy rate of income-tax at the present moment, the money which people would wish to spend even on necessities is very often taken away in taxation.</P>
    <P>I am interested in a factory that sells luxury toys.  It is not always the so-called well-off people who purchase most of these toys.  Very often they are bought on hire purchase in districts where people seem to have spare money to spend.  Although it may do me personal harm, I think utility goods ought to be encouraged and that luxuries ought to be taxed.</P>
    <P>The same applies to agriculture.  If a man is reinvesting the return from agriculture in fertilisers, machinery, stock and equipment, he has no money to spend on luxuries.  If there is a purchase tax on luxuries, the man who is merely mining the land will be caught within the net, as will also the person who evades taxation and who spends the money.  A purchase tax has much to commend it and I would ask the Minister for Finance to consider the question of lightening the burden of income-tax and the systematic imposition of a purchase tax on luxuries.</P>
    <P>There are still a few people in the country who are not convinced, even after the reports that have been published recently by many reputable economists, on the question of allowing the retention of sufficient money to sustain and expand production in industry. On Sunday, 3rd June, I read a report of a meeting in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, headed &ldquo;Revise the Income-tax Code&rdquo;.  The report said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="320" />&ldquo;It was agreed to ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance not to implement the recommendations of the Industrial Taxation Committee until the general system of income-tax has been revised.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>After three years' examination, the Committee on Taxation on Industry published its report and, without qualification, they stated that allowances should be made to industry to help industry to expand our economy, to expand exports, and so on.  I was surprised that the local government officials thought fit to ask the Government not to implement the report until the commission that was about to be set up had reported.  Since then, other information has come to light which would suggest, with even further emphasis, that we ought to encourage people to plough back money into their industries and to develop them.</P>
    <P>A very interesting paper was read before the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland on 25th May, 1956.  On page 18 of that paper, under the heading &ldquo;Mode of Application of Savings&rdquo;, it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Because current savings are insufficient to maintain even a low rate of capital formation and therefore of economic growth, it is all the more desirable that they should be applied in ways which would give the maximum immediate increase in real incomes, thus enlarging the community's capacity to save more and enjoy concurrently a higher living standard.  It can scarcely be claimed that this test is met by the manner in which we have used our limited supply of savings; the proportion devoted to increasing basic production in agriculture and industry has obviously been too small.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a pity that persons still persist in asking that the very meagre allowances such as were introduced by the Minister in his recent Budget should be set aside, until such time as we have a report from the commission which is to be set up.  It must be understood that at this commission will have very wide terms of reference and, if it is to be effective and if it is to get the help <Col N="321" /> it ought to get from all sections of the community concerned, it will be surprising if we have a report within two or three years.  As an interim measure, the Minister has given 20 per cent. initial allowance to industry.  Many people believe that anyone who is engaged in industry is making millions and that there is a climate here which produces industrial conditions which allow wealth to be accumulated.</P>
    <P>On page 19 of the paper to which I have referred there is a paragraph under the heading, &ldquo;Capital for Industry and Commerce&rdquo; which ought to convince anyone that sufficient of the product of industry is not being allowed to industrialists for reinvestment in industry.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The requirements of public authorities being in excess of the total personal savings available, internal financing ... is the only source of capital on which industry and commerce can safely rely.  This emphasises the desirability of curbing the growth of taxation and of a more liberal attitude towards profit-making; in this way, the conditions for economic development of national resources by private enterprise would be made less difficult.  Few will invest their money in schemes which may or may not succeed if they get only 7 per cent. or so in the event of success and nothing in the case of failure, while at the same time they can get a safe 5 per cent. on Government or Government-guaranteed stock.  The need for the change is all the more apparent when one considers the inadequacy of the present rate of investment in manufacturing industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At the end of that page, it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The emigration commission put the point well when they said &lsquo;the mind and spirit of the people must change so that they possess the necessary degree of resolution not only to develop the economy fully but also to accept readily the sacrifices and hard work which this would involve&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have been endeavouring to prove, if that is necessary, that the life-blood of industry, that is, the money which industry <Col N="322" /> earns, must be allowed to be used for the purpose of expanding industry. Industries engaged in the processing of raw materials for export, the processing of agricultural produce, must be allowed the life-blood to export its products.  They must be permitted to export this agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>Let me return to another aspect of the debate last night.  Some people are still convinced that many of our industries and many of our people are still very well off.  I think Senator Hickey is one of the people who are inclined to hold that view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  I believe that the distribution of wealth is quite inequitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that is the point Senator Hickey made last night and which I wish to answer to-day. Let us take as an example one of the big State enterprises&mdash;C.I.E.  I believe that one of the difficulties about that company was concerned with the fifth round of wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be an opportunity on the Appropriation Bill to discuss the affairs of C.I.E., or any other organisation for which money is appropriated, but, on the Finance Bill, we are dealing with taxation.  I do not want to restrict the debate and neither do I want to widen it unnecessarily at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not develop that point.  I want to make a point on the general question of wages and prices. A very interesting article was written recently by Edmund A. Grace in the spring issue of <i>Studies</i>, 1956, and I want to quote briefly from page 18 of that magazine:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There are approximately 7,000 people liable for surtax in this country.  The liability for surtax attaches to all personal incomes of £1,500 a year and over.  If all personal incomes in excess of £1,500 a year were entirely confiscated they would yield only another £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 approximately for distribution among the rest of the community.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If all the well-off people in the country had all their incomes completely confiscated <Col N="323" /> and were given nothing, it would put into the pool for distribution amongst everybody £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 a year.  What would that do?  It is reputed that some of our State-aided enterprises might lose as much as £2,000,000 in one year.  These people are among the most energetic, hardworking and progressive people in the country.  If we destroy them, it would be an enormous national loss. The produce of their incomes is such that they would not improve the position about which we are speaking to any material extent.</P>
    <P>I think we will all have to turn our eyes towards really hard work.  We will have to ensure that those who produce goods for export will be encouraged in some way and allowed more of the produce of that work than any other section of the community.  It is really a change of emphasis.  With regard to people who went into a speculative enterprise such as exporting some manufactured products in the past, I do not think that conditions were created to allow them to remain in that enterprise.</P>
    <P>As an employer and as a member of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, I believe I have a duty to say that both workers and employers will have to get down to some of these basic facts.  We have only half the wealth per head of the people in Britain and one-fifth the wealth per head of the people in the United States.  Can we get together to give industry reasonable security and give the people who are working in industry reasonable security?  That is what we want.  I believe that the element of insecurity amongst the workers in industry and amongst the employers is one of the basic problems.  If we can restore confidence amongst Christian men, whether they are in State enterprises, private enterprise, on the farm or elsewhere, we will be doing a great day's work for the country.</P>
    <P>We must drop the idea of thinking that the leprechaun has millions of pounds somewhere which, if divided, will make things right.  That is not so.  As a country, we are not that well off, but we have great potentialities, <Col N="324" /> if we are prepared to work together to get on with the job.  Holland and Belgium are two countries which together are not as large as ours and have a population of over 20,000,000. Holland has no natural resources, but there is a co-operative will to work in Holland, and the trade unions and employers have got down to the job of producing the goods.</P>
    <P>Take the case of tomatoes.  How can they sell their tomatoes in the City of Dublin and elsewhere throughout this country and make a profit, while we have people here looking for protection? I should like to ask the Government economists and students of economics to examine the position in the Low Countries and endeavour to bring back some of the ideas there. Both workers and employers have to bury a great deal of prejudice and see in what way they can help to answer the challenge that is thrown at the feet of every one of us.</P>
    <P>Ours is the responsibility and we have to answer for any of the deficiencies which we have in the year 1956.  I feel we would all like to help. We can do so, and, through goodwill, we will ultimately reach a solution of our problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before developing some of the points raised by Senator Burke, I should like to draw the attention of the House to an aspect of this subject which has not really been brought out before.  No Budget springs forth readymade from a Minister like Jonah from the whale. He has to work on previous Budgets. It is like modifying a house.  Eventually a stage is reached when a Budget must inevitably suffer from previous Budgets and we are reaching the stage when the Budget is obstructing itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can emphasise that in just one example.  In this Budget, we are not only taxing the drinker but the drink and what we are paying with one hand, we are taking away with the other. With regard to the petrol tax on motor cars, some years ago, the car tax was increased on the basis of the size of the car engine.  We were told that the large engine was uneconomical <Col N="325" /> and would have to be taxed accordingly. As a result, the unfortunate owners of the American cars assembled here who paid £15 had to pay £30. They were told that they were very lucky to get off with the £30 as their cars were extravagant.  We see in the present Budget the petrol tax increased, so that the large car is taxed and also the petrol that it consumes. We should have the tax of £12, which they have on the other side of the frontier, and the people who have large cars but who can only license them for part of the year, would take them out again.  Do not tax the drink and the drunkard at the same time.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a point raised by Senator Burke.  It is, of course, one that the Minister mentioned, that one of the main objects of the Budget was to encourage savings&mdash;savings versus spendings.  To talk about savings is almost regarded in some circles to-day as being morbid. It would be interesting to know how successful our methods were to encourage savings in the past.  We have savings encouraged by posters&mdash;which seem to have disappeared, by the way &mdash;and occasional articles in the papers. What is the use of trying to encourage savings, on the one hand, when we are encouraging spending on the other?  We read about the need for savings on one page of a newspaper, but the rest of the page is decorated with seductive advertisements for the luxury articles which Senator Burke has referred to.</P>
    <P>If the Government is going to try to regulate spending on luxury goods, it should try to regulate luxury advertisements. I would almost suggest taxing the luxury advertisements. These luxury goods must have an enormous amount of money behind them.  We see advertisements for watches and, literally, time is money. The advertisements are beautiful, and beautifully illustrated.  When I read the paper myself, I do not know how I can keep from purchasing the latest type of razor or the latest portable radio.</P>
    <P>With that kind of attack being made on us to keep on spending, it is extremely hard to save.  I think that <Col N="326" /> sort of spending might be mitigated by a tax on luxury advertisements.  What are we going to do with that tax? The person who writes advertisements is an advertisement writer and the person who writes on the back of the advertisements is a literary man.  I should like to see the day when our Government sets an example to the Governments of the world by taking tax off the profits made by the painter and the writer.  We have a reputation to maintain in the arts and the people engaged in them should get a small amount of encouragement.  Work of this sort should be exempt from tax.</P>
    <P>I also hope that we will see the tax taken off musical instruments that we have never made in this country and never will.  We hear about so much being done to encourage music that we should certainly do something to take the tax off imported musical instruments, such as oboes, to give encouragement to musicians.</P>
    <P>We must put the brake on the urge to spend, otherwise it is like giving a lecture on temperance in a cocktail bar with all the temptations around.</P>
    <P>The thing has its very serious aspects at the present time.  All these increased demands must make it so much easier to raise wages and the price of commodities and keep the spree going. We have the example put before us of the crumbling pound sterling.  It is, I am told, crumbling away at the rate of one penny a month.  It is dreadful, but let us look at the other side.  Where will we be in ten years' time with the emigration rate as it is at present? We must regard the emigration figures as a pointer dial which is now set towards danger.  There is a certain amount of bleeding, but we are not yet bleeding to death. Those figures will confront us every month and every year as a writing on the wall that something will have to be done for our economy.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Minister did not take much sterner measures. I was very glad to see that he is doing something about income-tax to attract savings, but in far too small a way.  I do think there is one thing which he might do for us.  In the famous legend <Col N="327" /> of Pandora's box, when it was opened and all the magnificent things it contained were taken out, one thing remained within the box, and that was hope.  I should like the Minister, when replying, to give us hope.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday evening some Senators referred to the recent Budget as an unpopular one.  I would think that the reference made to the Budget by Senator Professor George O'Brien was more appropriate when he referred to it as a courageous one, one necessitated by overspending on imports and non-essential goods, to a great extent.  The situation that led to this Budget, and to this Bill, was not peculiar to Ireland alone; it had its repercussions in a neighbouring country and steps taken to correct the overspending there were far more drastic than those taken in this country. No useful purpose can be served by availing of any threatening crisis of this kind by such references as the country being on the verge of bankruptcy.  As Senator Burke pointed out yesterday there is no such danger if advice given by the Minister and his colleagues is followed.</P>
      <P>The credit of this country will always be stabilised.  No useful purpose can be achieved by utilising the semblance of a crisis for political purposes.  Even the best policy may have bad points and a bad policy can have some good points.  There should be enough common sense in the country to get the good points of the good and the bad policies together and to take the best out of them.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes stated yesterday afternoon that one would imagine from the criticisms of the Opposition and the statements they were making now that their Party were never a Government, whereas they had, in fact, been a Government for 20 years during which they could have put into operation many of the plans which they now suggest.  Sixteen of those 20 years were consecutive years when conditions were more favourable for trying out plans which they now advocate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An attack was made yesterday evening on the agricultural policy of the present Government and I think <Col N="328" /> Senator Hawkins said that the present Minister for Agriculture should resign. Yet after 20 years of the administration of that Senator's Party, as has been pointed out on several occasions, the live-stock population in this country was lower in 1947 than in any year since the famine.</P>
    <P>There has also been much talk about broken promises.  Some of us cannot forget the whirlwind of promises made in 1931 and 1932 which led to a change in Government.  I think at that time the Budget, in 1931, would have been about £23,000,000; yet plans were talked about at that time by the Opposition which they stated would reduce expenditure by £2,000,000 without impairing any of the public services.  It was also stated at that time that a corrective was ready for dealing with unemployment and that employment under the new Government would be such that there would not be enough unemployed in the country to take up the new jobs created and that an appeal would have to be made to those who emigrated and to those who migrated to come back home and take up the positions which would be available for them. These plans must have misfired, for after 16 years of rule by that Party, there was a reduction of over 500,000 people in this country.</P>
    <P>I think I heard speakers on the other side of the House yesterday evening say that the Opposition Party had never broken any promises they made and had, in fact, fulfilled all their promises. I know that, in 1951, certain promises were made that, in the event of a change of Government at that time, food subsidies would not be interfered with, nor would the emergency taxes on cigarettes and drink be reimposed. That promise was observed for a year, but it was ruthlessly broken in 1952, with disastrous consequences for the country for some years afterwards.</P>
    <P>I was very much interested yesterday in Senator Hickey's contribution to the debate, but I would not agree with the Senator's statement that conditions in this country have not improved very considerably since 1919.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I said they were considerably improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone going through the country at the present time cannot fail to notice the fine houses which have replaced hovels, the beautiful schools that have replaced shacks and the magnificent hospital accommodation which has been provided.  It can be seen from these things that we have made very considerable improvements since 1919 and, within that period, the standard of living of the people has been raised very considerably.  Even before the recent health legislation was contemplated I, as a member of a local body for 30 years, know that no deserving individual was deprived of treatment outside of his own home in an extern institution because he was unable to pay for it.  Very often we found it far easier to get accommodation for patients who were paid for by the local authority than it was to get accommodation for a patient who was prepared to pay for it himself.  I am satisfied that these changes did make some contribution to the upset in the balance of payments, but the return that they have given was well worth the risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With other Senators, I feel that something more could be done to check over-spending and to effect savings in many respects.  My friend, and I could say my pupil, Senator Commons, made one suggestion yesterday evening, that the Government should ease up on these expensive schemes of water works and sewerage which are at present being carried out in many parts of the country and are in great demand.  Of course, they are in great demand because the system of rating was changed to county at large instead of district rating.  I know about some of these expensive schemes and many of them were not giving a satisfactory return for the money that was being spent.  I think no damage would be done to the health of the country or the people by easing off on such schemes for some time.  It is an extraordinary state of affairs to find a village perhaps with a public house and a few dwelling houses scattered around it having schemes for waterworks put up by architects that would cost up to £13,000.  These architects have no time for small schemes and <Col N="330" /> show no desire to have anything to do with them unless they run into thousands of pounds.</P>
    <P>There are other things in which there could be savings, too, and one which comes to my mind is that of the payment of unemployment benefit. I know of many people who were deterred from investing in the recent loan because of the extravagance which they had noticed had been recently taking place in their towns in the payment of unemployment benefit to many people who certainly had to resort to various doubtful methods to qualify for benefit.  I am not against giving unemployment benefit to <i>bona fide</i> applicants, but it seems to be administered too extravagantly in many cases.</P>
    <P>Another extravagance is the amount of money being spent on main roads and in cutting out dangerous corners. In a great many instances, the effect of cutting off those corners has been to make the roads more dangerous, instead of safer, and we find that many of the serious accidents which now occur in this country take place on the straight.  My own county council have made arrangements for the construction of a new bridge to take off some dangerous corners on the roads crossing over the River Moy.  It might have been safer to leave those dangerous corners there.</P>
    <P>The council agreed to expend over £50,000 on that improvement, but since then many people have drawn my attention to the fact, that, if we put a few more dangerous corners on the main roads, instead of taking them off, there would not be so much need to talk about road safety.  Be that as it may, the main roads are in a good condition at the present time and many of the improvements, or alleged improvements, required on them could very well be put on the shelf for a considerable time, until times are better in the country.</P>
    <P>Speaking yesterday evening, Senator O'Connell made an appeal to the Minister to consider&mdash;and this would be a case for extra expenditure&mdash;the claims of pre-1950 pensioned teachers who at the present time are not in comfortable conditions as a result of <Col N="331" /> the pittances paid.  I am quite satisfied that, as soon as the Government find it possible to do justice to these people, it will be done.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his courage, because it takes courage to introduce an unpopular measure.  Unpopularity has to be faced from time to time.  I am quite satisfied that, in the steps taken by the Minister and his colleagues to effect economy and if the advice they have given is followed by the citizens of the country, as it should be, we need have no fear of not being able to weather any threatened crisis that may face the country in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHartney" hpid="Mr. Hartney Mr. Hartney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hartney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have members congratulating the Minister on bringing in the unpopular Budget he has brought in for the people.  Up to very recently, the people had expected the very opposite.  I will go back only as far as 1954; I will not go back any further. Everything done in the years previous to that was debated during various elections and the people's verdict on it shown.  For that reason, I will not go back beyond 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was stated publicly over the radio in 1954 by one of the leading members of the premier Party in the Coalition group&mdash;not only one of their leading members, but their financial wizard as well&mdash;Deputy McGilligan&mdash;that overnight £10,000,000 could be taken off taxation.  The Budget had just been introduced before the dissolution of the Dáil.  Allowing for the fact that if he had come to that Department again, he could have done it overnight, it is only fair to make allowances for a newcomer in the office and to say that the present Minister could not be expected to know all the corners as well as Deputy McGilligan, and that he could not possibly do it overnight when he took up office.  But the people consoled themselves with the belief that, even though he would not take £10,000,000 off that year, they could at least look forward to a credit balance of the £10,000,000 at the end of the financial year.  They expected that he would probably be able to make use of the <Col N="332" /> finances available from his predecessor and that he would devote a certain amount of his spare time to showing him the way to operate these matters in the best interest of the people and the nation.</P>
    <P>That year passed and there was no credit balance.  In 1955, a Budget was brought in which was completely of the Coalition's making and Fianna Fáil had no finger in the pie.  However, that Budget failed to do anything about the £10,000,000 and it failed to remove the burdens imposed in 1952. These were the burdens about which we heard so much talk and about which members of the opposite Parties had spent sleepless nights worrying.  They went so far as saying that these burdens were imposed merely to impose hardships on our people.</P>
    <P>In 1956, it might have been hoped, if things were as good as we were led to believe they were, that there would be something about this £10,000,000; but when the Vote on Account came along, we were told about the condition of the country and that all Parties should do their best to pull the country out of the morass in which it found itself.  Our Party is as anxious as any other Party in either House to help to pull the country out of its difficulties.  We all have our duty towards our country and we are not going to be found lacking in helping our country in its struggles.  We have not been lacking in the past; we are not lacking at present; and we will not be lacking in the future.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Burke said there was nothing very wrong in taking £500,000 from the Road Fund and handing it over to the Minister for Finance to fill a gap for him.  I think he said that roads and hospitals could wait.  Regarding the Road Fund, if we go back to the time, which was referred to by speakers on the other side, when Deputy Smith was Minister for Local Government and when he altered the system of taxation on cars so that more money was brought in, we find he was vigorously opposed by Fine Gael and Labour, the two principal Opposition Parties at the time.  When he would not give way on that, he was pressed hard to give an undertaking that every <Col N="333" /> extra penny secured as a result of his action would be spent on roads and on nothing else.  If those people are so interested in roads, why can they not be consistent to-day?  If they were consistent and decent, they would have left the Road Fund as it is, especially when they complained so much about the alterations made by another Minister when he considered it in the national interest to make such alterations.</P>
    <P>Apart from the main roads, the secondary roads&mdash;roads which are almost main roads&mdash;are to-day being called on to do a job they were never built for.  The people who have to travel over them in various types of vehicles, be they tractors, lorries or vans, at least expect that, in return for the tax they pay, we will try to make those roads passable for them. They are fully entitled to that and they are not unreasonable in demanding it. We must face up to the question of roads.  It is only two or three days since the manager of C.I.E. called all the representatives of the workers together and told them quite plainly that traffic was being diverted completely from the railways to the roads. He has the figures before him; he has the statistics and he knows by how much the amount of goods carried by the company has dropped over the years.</P>
    <P>Every pound of goods that is diverted from the railways has to be carried over a road system that was not built to carry the present volume of traffic. It is most unfair to take that £500,000 from the Road Fund.  An effort could be made to find that £500,000 elsewhere. In all the services carried out by all Departments of State, it ought to be possible to find £500,000, instead of taking it from the Road Fund, and depriving the Twenty-Six Counties of so much less this year.  It will mean so much less road work done and so many more worse roads next year and the year after.  The one hope is to carry out road works as quickly as possible.  Every mile done this year as against next year is good economy.</P>
    <P>Yesterday Senator Kissane quoted <Col N="334" /> the words of the Taoiseach about strengthening our economy.  It is rather strange, in view of the soaring price of coal, that an effort was not made by the appropriate Department to make arrangements this year for the production of a great deal more turf.  Turf production could keep the men in the boglands employed for four or five months.  There will be an assured market for turf this year, because of the increase in the price of coal.  If turf production was carried out efficiently, the cost of fuel would be very much reduced.  There is no guarantee that our needs will be met by Britain.  It is quite possible that she will call on her good friend across the Atlantic to send us coal and, if so, the demand for dollars will be increased. There is a sufficient problem in that regard already without adding to it.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that if we are to be pulled out of the rut, it is increased agricultural production that will do it. As one who was born on the land and who has lived on the land, I am most anxious to know in which branch of agriculture this great expansion can take place.  Reference is made merely to agriculture, as if it were the same as drapery or any other business.  There are many branches of agriculture.  We should be told in what branch expansion should take place and we would be only too delighted to recommend to farmers an expansion in that branch, if we saw that they would be paid for their trouble.</P>
    <P>Is it suggested that the number of store cattle should be increased?  Is it suggested that it would be better to increase the number of dairy cows and produce more butter?  At present sufficient butter is being produced to meet home requirements.  If that is exceeded, what will happen?  Are we to go to the Minister for Finance, who is already overburdened, and say: &ldquo;There is a surplus of so many cwts. of butter this year.  We require a subsidy of so much to sell it on the British market&rdquo;? That would be adding to the worries of the Minister for Finance instead of relieving them.  Even assuming that the number of cattle could be increased what is the point in increasing the <Col N="335" /> number of cattle, seeing that they are a falling commodity?  The losses in cattle from last year to the present day are well known.  Cattle have lost over £20 per head, plus their feeding, in those 12 months.</P>
    <P>Take the tillage farmer.  How can you face the tillage farmer and ask him to increase the acreage under tillage, having broken faith with him in the past?  In the bad 1952 Budget, there was relief given of a halfpenny in the loaf.  Although it was claimed that it cost the Exchequer £990,000, the price of wheat to the producer was not interfered with.  Since then, the price of wheat has been slashed and no relief has been given to the person eating the bread made from the cheaper wheat.  If wheat, barley, and so on, were grown in sufficient quantities to meet home requirements, these commodities could come off the list that has led to the adverse balance of trade.  It is very hard to face the man whom you have let down and ask him to expand production.  It is not too long since we were told that it was better business to buy abroad than to produce at home.  I hope the people who were convinced of that have examined their consciences and that God has given them the light to see that there is more in self-sufficiency than they have realised up to now, and that we will return to the position mentioned by Senator Hickey last night when he referred to the democratic programme of 1919.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the volume of employment that could be created by turf production to the extent carried out in the emergency years.  Turf production would give four to six months' constant employment to men badly in need of it, working men in the various small holdings in the boglands.  When that work ended, there is no reason why they could not be put to the preparation of land for afforestation. The afforestation of land that is not fit for agriculture would be a good national investment.  Timber will always be required.  It is better to put such land under forests than to expend twice its value in trying to make it fertile.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> One does not need to be a great economist to know that the increased turf production to which I have referred is a matter worthy of consideration. It is a pity that it was not put into operation this year, but it should be considered for next year.  I hope the matter will be referred to the proper authority for consideration.  If men were put to work on increasing turf production, the number on the dole would be reduced and possibly a few would be saved from the emigrant ship.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many of our existing industries have potentialities for export.  When people see our products exhibited abroad, or when foreigners visit factories here, they are very impressed.  If any of our existing industries can find an export market, especially with a country with which we do other business, and especially where it is a question of dollars, every conceivable pound's worth of goods should be shipped into it.  It will be very late in the day when some of the new industries can get going.  If we cannot get out of the present morass in the meantime, it will be very unfortunate for us.  We should specialise in the products of our existing industries for which we find an export market. We will have to produce more of these commodities than will meet home requirements and send the surplus to the markets with which it is to our greatest advantage to trade.</P>
    <P>I can say from this side of the House that any measures that may be taken to put the country on the straight road will have our support.  Every measure that we are satisfied is in the national interest will have our approval.</P>

      <P>The Finance Bill gives the Seanad the opportunity of discussing the Budget recently enacted by the Dáil and the general achievements of the Government during the past 12 months.  A stage has been reached where it is fairly well accepted that this Budget is not an unpopular Budget.  Even Fianna Fáil speakers have come to accept that and have ceased to tell us, as they told us in the Dáil, that this was an alarming and most unpopular Budget.  We have to realise that the Minister had to meet a situation in which, according to the summary of receipts and expenditure, this year he would have to secure some £9.7 million extra receipts to meet the estimated expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the Budget speech in the Dáil, the Minister indicated that he proposed to increase expenditure further by the sum of £300,000 for increased social welfare benefits and by £120,000 for assistance to State and local authority pensioners.  All sides of the House welcomed those extra <Col N="338" /> provisions.  What was particularly welcomed by the Labour Party and what, I suppose, alarmed Fianna Fáil, was that, in providing for the extra expenditure and in trying to secure extra income, the Minister did not make any attempt to cut the food subsidies. That was in contrast to the situation in 1952, when a somewhat similar extra expenditure had to be provided for.  At that time, an effort was made to save on the food subsidies. The Minister's approach to the situation has been to tax less essential forms of expenditure, particularly imports.  He said that in doing that he was hoping to stimulate economy in regard to imports.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not it is very sporting on an occasion like this to refer to the Finance Bill and the provisions of the Bill which we have before us, but I should like to do so, and I think I am quite in order in referring to the measure which is before us.  The first item there that strikes me is the provision made under Section 4 for an increase in the personal allowance for a married man from £300 to £310.  I welcome that increased allowance very much, even though I must express some disappointment that the increase is only £10 per annum.</P>
    <P>It would be right also, as I am on the question of income-tax, to ask the Minister to review his attitude to the appointment of a commission on income-tax generally.  The Minister said in the Dáil that he will give attention to the question of a more general commission on taxation immediately the examination of the industrial taxation committee's report has been concluded.  It seems to me that the Minister accepts, and that it is accepted by everybody, that there is a need for this general examination into income-tax and I am wondering, once that is accepted, why work cannot start very quickly.  It seems to me that a lot of time will necessarily be spent on getting people who will agree to serve on this very onerous commission.  A lot of time will necessarily be spent, when you have got those people, in providing them with the necessary data to read up on <Col N="339" /> income-tax, educate themselves on it, if they are not educated already, before they can come down to the actual work of preparing recommendations. There will inevitably be a great deal of preparatory work.</P>
    <P>Some speakers visualised that between the time of the appointment of the commission and the receipt of its report some two or three years might elapse.  That would be alarming. I think the Minister should take the bull by the horns and get on with the preparatory work of appointing this commission.  The difficulty of implementing recommendations of the Commission on Industrial Taxation will be increased if the Minister has not in hands the general commission on income-tax generally.</P>
    <P>The announcement by the Minister of the setting up at some distant date of this commission has given rise to a cry in some quarters that income-tax as such should be abolished in this country and that it should be replaced by a tax on luxuries.  I suggest that if any people have in mind that the income, or the revenue, now collected in income-tax should in future be collected by a tax on cigarettes, they would want to think again, because a luxury&mdash;some people call cigarettes a luxury&mdash;of this sort is consumed by all people, irrespective of their income level.  I do not think any evidence exists that the people with higher incomes necessarily smoke more cigarettes and in doing so contribute more to the revenue.</P>
    <P>Income-tax, as such, is based on the theory that those who can better afford to pay should pay, and, by doing so, should assist in some redistribution of income within the State.  What has gone wrong with the income-tax since the ending of the emergency is the fact that no proper adjustment has been made in respect of the general allowances.  Another fault of course is that it is collected only from one section of the community and I suggest that wishful thinking that income-tax as such can be easily abolished is harmful.</P>
    <P>To come back again to the Finance Bill, I should like to deal with Section <Col N="340" /> 15&mdash;entertainments duty&mdash;ball or dance. Quite frankly, I find it completely impossible to understand this section.  I do not know why sections in the Bill should be drawn up in such a way that nobody can understand them.  To try to understand it, I turned to what the Minister said in his Budget statement. He referred to taxation on dancing and in column 39 of Volume 157, of the Official Debates, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Under general entertainments duty law, dances held three miles or more from towns having populations exceeding 1,000 will be free of tax. Under the same law dances in towns of 1,000 to 2,000 would be entitled to a repayment of half of the duty paid. This latter concession would, however, be difficult to administer and accordingly I am introducing in its stead, for dances in those towns, a separate scale of duty producing approximately the same effect.  With the smaller towns and rural areas excluded, I do not visualise any great administrative difficulty in the collection of this tax.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems to me&mdash;I may be wrong in this for it is difficult to understand and I am sure the Minister will appreciate that&mdash;that the dance halls and the dance hall proprietors outside a three-mile limit of any town are in a somewhat more advantageous position under this tax, than the dance-hall proprietors in towns of 2,000, I think, and within a three-mile limit of those towns.  There is a lot of merit in that approach.  It can be accepted that dance-hall proprietors within the three-mile limit of fairly large towns have probably better custom, and a tax on them would be considered onerous by them, but to reasonable people it might seem a fair sort of tax.</P>
    <P>Certain dance halls outside the three-mile limit running expensive dances should pay a reasonable tax as well.  I do not know whether the Minister has experience of hunt balls. They are not generally held within the three-mile limit, but are usually held in the ballrooms of hotels or in dance halls which would, under this provision, be exempt from any tax whatever. <Col N="341" /> It is unreasonable that such dance hall proprietors should be given an advantage over the proprietors who happen to come within this territorial limit of three miles.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to look again at this problem.  What I am asking him is not to take off any tax, but to put on a tax, in order to have some sort of fair play between the different dance hall proprietors.  I suggest that the position might be met by taxing the expensive dances, whether they are within the three-mile limit or outside it.  I do not know whether a limit of over 5/- would be reckoned as a rather higher level.  The tax on dances charging 5/- and upwards would correct this anomaly and remove, somewhat, the disadvantage which is now being placed on the dance halls within that territorial limit.</P>
    <P>The next point which I want to refer to in the Bill is in Section 11, which deals with hydrocarbon oil.  There seems to be a lot of confusion in regard to this, because my reading of it, and the reading of some other people, is that what is happening here is that for the first time ever the Minister for Finance in this country, and, I think, in Britain as well, has taxed the fuel used by railways on their own permanent way.</P>
    <P>In the absence of any expression of surprise from the Minister, I presume my interpretation is correct.  May I say how surprising such a tax is?  I am sure it will also surprise other Senators here.  The position has been that fuel used on the railways on their own permanent way, which they maintain themselves, has never been taxed. Public transport here has been encouraged by the Government to transfer to more economical fuel&mdash;from coal to diesel oil.  Not alone has it been encouraged, but, of course, the capital necessary for that change-over has been guaranteed by the State.</P>
    <P>I think it would be fair to judge this tax in the light of the general principles laid down by the Minister himself in his approach to the Budget.  As I have stated already, he said he was taxing the less essential forms of expenditure, particularly imports, and he was hoping, <Col N="342" /> by doing so, to stimulate economy in regard to imports.  Does the Minister think that the tax on diesel oil will stimulate economy in regard to the importation and use of diesel oil by the railways in the State, or does he think that there is some alternative type of home produced fuel which could be used instead?</P>
    <P>We know, and we have heard here from time to time, that C.I.E. has been conducting experiments in the use of turf-burning locomotives, but we also know that no great success has been achieved so far.  Is the Minister prophesying that alternative traction can be provided very quickly by turfburning locomotives and is he encouraging a change-over to turf-burning locomotives by using this tax?  Of course it may be stated fairly that the penny a gallon on diesel oil used by railways is not a very onerous burden. I think it would cost C.I.E. at the present time somewhere about £25,000 or £26,000 per annum.  They have not yet, of course, completed their conversion to diesel traction and the amount will be higher in future years. The tax will also cost the G.N.R., with its limited amount of diesel railcars, a considerable amount also, and little undertakings, like the County Donegal railways whose operations are completely dieselised, will be hit rather severely by this tax.  Is there any merit in a tax like this?</P>
    <P>I think I have shown that it cannot be thought to be an encouragement to transfer to some home-produced fuel. There is really no alternative here.  The railways must use diesel oil and we have encouraged the public transport to do so.  The weight of the tax will not be very heavy and I am suggesting to the Minister that it is not really worth his while to impose this tax.  It is not worth his while, in the first instance, by reason of the small amount involved, and it does not appear to be worth his while in that I doubt if he will ever collect it.  If he does collect it, it is merely a transference of the money from one pocket to another, because the Minister must know that public transport in this country is in a very serious position indeed.  It is estimated that C.I.E. <Col N="343" /> must now be running at a loss of £2,000,000 a year and in the case of the Great Northern line&mdash;I do not know where that will end&mdash;I suppose it would not be overestimating to say that its losses will be between £500,000 and £750,000 a year for this part of the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has imposed this tax at a time when his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has been saying to his counterpart in the Six Counties: &ldquo;Do not proceed with the closing of the secondary lines of the G.N.R. but agree with me to turn over to diesel oil which is a more economic form of traction.&rdquo;  It is no wonder in these circumstances that the opening sentence of a leading article in the <i>Belfast Newsletter</i> to-day says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While Mr. William Norton, the Eire Minister for Industry and Commerce, has been protesting against the proposal of the Ulster Government to close down certain sections of the G.N.R., the position of C.I.E. which is of intimate concern to him is very bad.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think we are making ourselves look ridiculous.</P>
    <P>The penny tax on the diesel oil used by the railways is unjustified.  It is a new tax and it cannot be said indeed to be an encouragement to public transport to transfer to home fuel.  It cannot further encourage them to be more economical in the use of diesel oil.  I think that can be accepted because the more diesel oil they can use the more traffic they can carry, and that would be better for all of us eventually.</P>
    <P>It may be said, and I think fairly, that this is only 1d. per gallon tax on diesel oil used by railways and diesel oil used by road transport and petrol used on the roads has always been subject to some measure of taxation, and why should diesel oil used by railways be exempt completely?  The answer to that is, I suggest, shown by the fact, and the argument always put forward, that the taxation of fuel used on the roads helped to pay for the upkeep of the roads.  None of us can imagine or accept that the amount <Col N="344" /> collected into the Road Fund every year does of itself pay for the upkeep of the roads in the Republic.  In fact, less than two-fifths of the total expenditure on the roads in the Republic is met from the Road Fund. The balance of three-fifths is met by the rates.  But of course motorists and lorry owners would say that that is not the full story and that they also pay considerable amounts in fuel taxation.</P>
    <P>I was looking at the position for 1954-1955 and I find that the petrol tax collected for that year amounted to £7,000,000 and it could be argued that that helped to pay for the upkeep of the roads.  The position to-day is that there is a good deal of improvement of roads, and, whilst we refer to millions of pounds being spent on the upkeep of roads, we could best consider the matter from a more down to earth point of view by dealing with the cost in mileage.  It is found that in that year we spent in this little country £213 per mile on roads.  That is pretty good spending, but, as I say, the railways have, on the other hand, to meet all their own expenditure on the improvement and upkeep of the permanent way.  There is no assistance from any other fund.  We have not acted on the advice given by Sir James Milne of having some authority to look after roads and railways generally and the upkeep of the permanent way.  We have not accepted or acted on that recommendation.  Now we tax the fuel being used on that permanent way.</P>
    <P>In view of the financial situation of public transport, there is very little prospect that the Minister will really get any money out of this tax.  All it is going to do, in reality, is increase the already serious losses on public transport, which will eventually have to be met by the Minister in some future years.  I do not think there is any other way of meeting it.  It is ridiculous to say that C.I.E. should be or could be capable of borrowing to meet their annual losses.  I do not know who would ever lend them money to meet their losses in the present situation, and the Minister will eventually <Col N="345" /> have to face up to that situation.</P>
    <P>That may be so.  The Minister may not succeed in collecting this revenue. But I do suggest to him very seriously that, by attempting to do so, he is doing a lot of damage, because the reaction of the employees of public transport, who are being appealed to for economy and who in fact are being asked to stand by, to put up with present conditions and try to bring public transport out of its present situation, naturally, is to say that, if the Minister, in this difficult situation, by one fell swoop puts another £25,000 or £26,000 per annum on the losses of public transport, then it seems a bit ridiculous to be asking them as ordinary employees not to press for improvements and to engage in every possible economy.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is not doing a very good job in regard to this tax.  I think he will damage the morale of public transport employees by attempting to impose this tax, and I am also suggesting that, on the principles he himself laid down in his Budget, the tax is unjustifiable.  I would seriously urge that he should consider this matter again.  I do not know whether I would be hurting his feelings, if I said the tax was imposed in error.  Perhaps it would be wrong to do that.</P>

      <P>If it were not done in error, I suggest it was a wrong decision, and the Minister should now look at it again, and, between now and Committee Stage, I hope he will agree that this tax should not be imposed, that it is not really worth his while, that it would do more damage than anything else and that he should take it off the fuel used in public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of discussion took place on the capital Budget rather than the financial Budget, and I presume I would be in order in dealing, as quickly as I can, with some matters mentioned under that heading.  I noted that Senator O'Brien advocated the curtailing of Government capital expenditure and <Col N="346" /> also pointed out the desirability of investment for production rather than investment for social purposes.  I notice that in this capital Budget investment for social purposes&mdash;investment for housing, hospitals and schools and so on&mdash;comprises only 46 per cent. of the Budget as compared with 54 per cent. last year and 66 per cent. in 1950-51.  So that, in actual fact, there has been a relative cut in investment for social purposes.</P>
    <P>I am wondering whether this was a conscious decision by the Government, whether they have decided that they should curtail investment in housing and so on, or whether it is a decision that has been forced upon them?  Or do they feel that they will not be able to get the money?  This brings me to another point mentioned by Professor O'Brien, namely the setting up of a national investment board.  I think the Minister can have no quarrel with the principle of that.  I know that it is one of the points in the agreed programme for this Government.  Some years have gone by now and some of us hope that the Minister or one of his colleagues will soon announce the setting up of such a national investment board.  It seems to me, however, that the setting up of a national investment board presupposes some control of our banking and credit in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not claim to be a financial expert.  It is unfortunate that, whenever finance or the creation of credit is mentioned, there is inclined to be a smirk and a guffaw.  I do not think it is up to the people who advocate an examination of this proposal to justify or try to prove that a change or control by the Government would, of necessity, improve the position.  As far as I know, we are the only sovereign State that has not control of its own banking and its own credit creation.  I am not trying to tell Senators that, if we had control, everything in the garden would be would be rosy; but I am suggesting that there is a responsibility on somebody to justify our unique position, to show why we are better off in adopting this unique position of having virtually no control of our banking and credit creation in this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> I am not an expert, but, as an ordinary layman, I wonder why we are in this unique position.  I think it is up to somebody responsible to prove to us that we are in that unique position to our advantage, and it is not up to me or to anyone else to attempt to prove that we should join the common herd of other nations and that that would better our position.  I will not go further into that, because, as I say, I am not an expert; but I feel, as an ordinary layman, that it is something that requires explanation.  If we are better off remaining as we are, it should be explained to us why we are in this unique position.  Nobody has done so so far and, in view of our serious position, it is about time this Government examined the problem, came to a firm decision and explained why we should continue as we are, or say we should take power to control our own finances.  Whether we exercise that control later or not, we should, like other Governments, take similar powers and be able to affect or to have some control of our financial situation.</P>
    <P>There is one point I do not think I should let pass, and that is the reference made yesterday evening to the situation in County Mayo.  The Senator is not here who raised a little point of importance, that is, the impression that was created that there are so many unemployed there who are availing of unemployment assistance and who could in fact be working, that work is available for them and that they are not prepared to work.  I do not know County Mayo particularly well.  I am not a County Mayo man. But I seriously doubt that there is over employment in County Mayo, that industries there are clamouring for labour and that the unemployed are not prepared to work.  No doubt there are dodgers in County Mayo as well as everywhere else, but I would seriously suggest that it is unfair and uncharitable to take account of an odd dodger and say that the unemployed there are not prepared to work.  The facts are there.  There is not sufficient work for them.  Granted that some of them prefer to remain idle, they are only a fraction of the unemployed, and it is <Col N="348" /> quite unjust and uncharitable to attempt to put over on anybody that we have people drawing unemployment assistance who will not take work if it is offered to them.</P>
    <P>May I suggest that such dodgers can be dealt with if they do not take work which is offered to them?  There is a method of dealing with them.  I also suggest that if and when they are dealt with, if they run along to a T.D. or a Senator or a county councillor, he will not attempt to move heaven and earth to have them put back on unemployment assistance again.  If there are some dodgers, we should be prepared to accept our responsibility, and, if they are properly dealt with, then we should allow them to be properly dealt with, and not encourage the idea in this country that everything can be fixed by political pull.</P>
    <P>The real point I want to make here is that the facts of the situation are that there is not enough employment, and it is quite uncharitable and unjust to say that the people unemployed are unemployed, because they do not want to work.  The majority of them want to work.  We have failed so far to provide employment for them, and it is wrong, then, to say, because they are unable to secure work, that they are drawing unemployment assistance under false pretences.</P>

      <P>In view of the late state of the debate, I will abridge my remarks to two or three minutes. I had intended to speak at greater length, but I know that the Minister is more pressed for time than I am, probably.  I will make just three remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been discussing very largely how to exploit our natural resources. I should like to ask the Minister a question about this.  What is the state of Government policy on the question of prospecting for oil, and looking for oil wells in this country?  I am informed by an expert that the rock formation in this country encourages the hope that there may be considerable deposits of oil in our country. Has the Government seriously thought of this?  Has it encouraged foreign firms or speculators to come over here and look for this oil, and, if not, why <Col N="349" /> not?  If oil were found here it would completely transform our national economy, needless to say.  I am seriously informed that there is a fair possibility, and I should like to be sure that the Government is paying the fullest attention and doing its best to foster seeking for oil.</P>
    <P>The second thing I should like to stress is the plea already made against the tax on musical instruments.  I think our motto in the future in this country might for the next ten years or so be &ldquo;agriculture and culture&rdquo;. We have been given good land and good brains, and we have not very much else to go on.  One of the products of our brains&mdash;I had intended to amplify this, but I will not&mdash;is our music.  We have been famous for many generations as musicians.  It is a very regrettable thing that our music-makers should have to pay high taxation on instruments that cannot be produced in this country.  I would earnestly urge the Minister to remove that trifling but annoying and discouraging tax as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The last point is a direct question put to me by a constituent.  Perhaps it might be better raised on the Committee Stage, but it may save time if I raise it now.  Suppose one of our citizens wins a premium prize in Mr. Macmillan's sweepstake, will he have to pay income-tax in this country or not?  These prizes are free of income-tax in Great Britain.  Will they be free of income-tax here?</P>
    <P>That is all I propose to say.  Other matters can be raised on the Appropriation Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be very brief and follow the example set by Senator Professor Stanford.  I will not delay the House more than two or three minutes.  There appears to be general agreement in the House on one thing, that is, the necessity to increase agricultural production.  The Minister nods his head, and he, too, is in agreement on it.  If we are all in agreement on this, the next thing we have to agree on is how to bring about that increased agricultural production. Senator Hartney told us that there was no use going to the dairy farmer and expecting him to do anything.  I <Col N="350" /> know that the dairy farmers are in foul humour.  They feel that it has taken four years to find out the cost of producing a gallon of milk, and they are not in such good humour at all that we may expect any great things from them.</P>
      <P>Senator Hartney also pointed out that we broke faith with the tillage farmer and cannot expect anything from him.  The breaking of faith with the tillage farmer, I suppose, referred to the cut of 12 or 15 per cent.  in the price of wheat.  As a result of that cut, the wheat acreage went down 18,000 acres, about 20 per cent., and other grain crops went down about the same amount.</P>
      <P>How are we to get back these things?  I am afraid it lies entirely with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture, and it is a question of economics.  The Minister for Agriculture has a slogan which is a very good one &ldquo;One more cow, one more sow, one more acre under the plough&rdquo;.  The sows are gone, or going quickly, and almost disappearing. Acres under the plough are going down, and the dairy farmers are in no humour to listen to exhortations to put up the number of their cows.  So I think leadership will have to come from the Ministers, and the position will have to be made one that will induce the farmers to do better than they have been doing.  Cutting the price of wheat was bad business. Threats about putting income-tax on the farmers are bad business.  Senator McGuire made a suggestion when he was talking about the abolition of income-tax.  He referred to Jersey as an island where they have 40 millionaires.  We could do with a few here, and that would help us considerably in abolishing income-tax and setting our balance of payments right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read in one of the Sunday news-papers&mdash;I cannot say which&mdash;a short account of happenings in the parish of Goleen in County Cork.  I suppose other members of this House read that account too.  If that account is correct, or nearly correct, it makes very sad reading.  I will not refer to it further, because I hope it is not correct, and, if it is not correct, I hope the Minister <Col N="351" /> will see it is corrected.  I am referring to a statement that appeared in one of the Sunday papers&mdash;I cannot tell which; it might be in one of the imported papers&mdash;about happenings in the parish of Goleen in the County Cork.  The account stated that there were 160 children on the school rolls and that there were 800 old age pensioners. It also stated other things. I do not think the thing is right, nor do I think it should be let go without being contradicted.  I will not refer to the matter any further.</P>
    <P>With regard to increased agricultural production, it occurs to me that I ought to make this suggestion to the Minister.  We are importing millions of pounds' worth of grain each year which we could grow at home.  As I said earlier, it devolves on the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture to give us a lead and create an atmosphere whereby the farmers will produce the goods.  Thirty years ago, we imported Chinese and American bacon and Danish pigs' heads, but that day is gone and now we are importing millions' worth of foodstuffs.  There is no justification for it, I think, unless we are providing cheap food for the smallholders to fatten pigs and poultry, but the reverse is the case.  We are not importing cheap food for these people.  The quality is bad and the price is low. The proper thing to do is to grow our own and it can be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution to the debate will be brief.  I am anxious to avail of the opportunity to refer to some of the points made by previous speakers and also of contributing one or two additional suggestions for the Minister's consideration in dealing with the rather serious position we have been discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to begin by reminding the House that, when the Minister introduced his Budget proposals in the Dáil on 8th May, I think he described his Budget as a realistic Budget.  I think it would be well we should remember in this House that a similar description would fit the situation we are discussing very aptly because we <Col N="352" /> are dealing with a very real, actual situation.  That situation, I think, has been brought about quite clearly by two main factors, and only two main factors.  These have been described quite accurately, I think, as a disequilibrium in our balance of payments and the trends that flow from that which tend to create in our own country a type of domestic inflation.</P>
    <P>Bearing that in mind, I should like at the outset to refute some of the suggestions&mdash;I am sure some other members of the House will concur in this&mdash;advanced that this situation has to some extent&mdash;there were some speakers who claimed it was to a very large extent&mdash;been created by the demands of organised workers, either of the wage earning class or the salary earning class for better conditions.  In point of fact, anyone who has sat out this debate must be absolutely convinced by now that the causes are very far removed from that and that, in fact, the opposite is the case.  We know that the increases, where they have been either sought or granted, have, in fact, followed the appearance of these difficulties in our economy.  Many people will never catch up with the spiral of increased costs which will inevitably leave their standard of living at a lower level than before it started.</P>
    <P>I should like to endorse the sentiments expressed by some Senators in connection with savings.  Every single citizen must obviously welcome the stress that has been laid by the Minister upon the absolute necessity at the present time for increased savings.  I should also like to avail of this opportunity of paying what is a due tribute to the Minister for his own particular regard to ensure that every encouragement should be given to every section of our people to help them save more and encourage savings also by the removal of anomalies where they can be removed from our existing income-tax regulations.</P>
    <P>I had personal experience in the past few months of bringing to the Minister's notice a certain anomaly in the existing income-tax regulations which existed since 1918 and which, to my knowledge, has been the subject <Col N="353" /> of numerous appeals to the Revenue Commissioners.  In addition, I also happen to know that it was the subject of court actions and at least one High Court action.  Despite all that, and despite also the fact that the same anomaly was removed from the British income-tax code as long ago as 1934 and despite the fact that many appeals were made to several of the Minister's predecessors, the anomaly remains there intact and was still being enforced up to this year.  It was only necessary to bring the operation of that part of the regulations to the Minister's notice once in order to have it removed.  As the House will observe, Section 2 of the Bill now clearly removes what was an unjust, unfair and a totally unnecessary anomaly.</P>
    <P>Despite all that, however, we must obviously take cognisance of the fact that the volume of savings is still far too low to supply anything like the country's requirements at the present time.  More serious still is the fact that, if we are to judge by the latest returns, the trend is towards even less savings.  I believe that to be an even more urgent matter for immediate concern. All that, of course, we must admit, is not very surprising.  We know that the inflationary trend for the past ten or 15 years has adversely affected every form of thrift or good management.  Money has depreciated in value and is still continuing to depreciate, whether we like to admit it or not.  Consequently, people are and will remain, I am afraid, very disinclined to save, except possibly for pleasure or some immediate want or luxury, but that, to my mind, seems to be the real explanation why the total volume of our savings has been falling and will continue to fall.  That is one of the problems the Minister was faced with in this Budget.</P>
    <P>I suggest in all seriousness that if we panic in this situation, we are facing an even greater danger.  I was very glad to hear Senator O'Brien allude to the very fact that deflation in itself, with its consequences, would be an even worse position than the position we have been discussing for the past two days.  On that account, I would urge the Minister to consider some fresh and courageous remedy.  I <Col N="354" /> believe that, in advancing this suggestion I am now about to make, I am voicing not only my own opinion but the opinion of quite a number of other people as well.  I would urge upon the Minister the advisability of considering the complete exemption from income-tax up to a maximum of one-twentieth of personal incomes, provided that that amount of the personal income was invested in Post Office savings, in Government or municipal stocks, insurance or any other type of approved investment.</P>
    <P>I offer that suggestion for two reasons.  First, I believe it would provide one of the best incentives we could offer at the present time to the largest body of our citizens who have always supported that type of self-independence. I believe it would also help to convince them that the Government are really sincere in asking for increased savings.</P>
    <P>Having made that suggestion, however, I should also like to make this point as I think it is very important. We have all got to realise that increased savings alone will not provide a complete solution to our present difficulties. From the picture presented to the House by the Minister and subsequently in this debate, I think it is obvious to everybody by now that other remedies should and must be found for our present difficulties.  There are clearly many avenues of exploration open to us.  Some of them have been suggested by many Senators. That makes is quite unnecessary for me to repeat them.  However, I should like to endorse the various appeals for a cut in governmental expenditure.</P>
    <P>There is another point that suggests itself to me and it is one to which I should like to allude very briefly. Again, bearing in mind the fact that the root cause of all our trouble lies in the fact that we have an adverse balance of trade with countries abroad. I should like to point out that, in one aspect of our industrial economy here, we are spending now no less than over £10,000,000 per year in insurance premiums under different categories.</P>
    <P>I had personal experience of this problem.  I watched the figure grow from a total of £4,000,000 in the year 1938 until it reached the staggering <Col N="355" /> figure of £10,033,000 last year.  I think it is very important that the House should clearly appreciate this point. That is an annual export.  That amount of money is flowing out of this country every year and has been doing so now for a good many years past and is likely to go on doing so for a very long time to come.  That is happening, despite the fact that we can provide&mdash;in fact we are providing&mdash;a service in the same industry which is second to none in any country in the world to-day.</P>
    <P>The greatest portion of that £10,000,000 is extracted from our citizens here by foreign insurance companies controlled from outside this country, who are hostile either to Ireland or Irish interests.  I suggest that as long as we are content to sit back and watch that happening and do nothing about it, we deserve what we get.  I submit the time is ripe at the moment for the Government seriously to look into this problem. These people are in competition&mdash; unfair competition&mdash;with our own Irish companies.  That is a fact and had I the time I could debate it and show it to be so.  I make that statement and I am prepared to stand over it and I will be prepared to prove it, if necessary.</P>
    <P>These people leave nothing in this country by way of employment except the barest minimum.  Printing, stamp duties and benefits of that type are not left in this country at all.  I anticipate it will be suggested that the £10,000,000 is not entirely lost to the country, but that is not the point. That is the stock answer that has been advanced by those people who have stood over that type of transaction for many years.  The important point to remember is that Ireland is deprived of that amount of money every year, when it should be available in the country for capital development.  I suggest that there is an unanswerable case at the present moment for the Government to take some effective steps to see that these foreign companies are compelled, if not to come into the country and compete here on equal terms with our own companies, at least to maintain in Ireland sufficient <Col N="356" /> of their capital reserves as would cover at least the total amount of liabilities they have incurred to Irish policy holders in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest, I never suggested and I am not now suggesting, that they should be forced out or that anything like a monopoly be given to Irish companies.  On the contrary, I am satisfied, from practical experience that, in this line of business, or in all branches of insurance at any rate, competition is, in fact, the elixir of life, so to speak.  All we ask is that where these foreigners are allowed to compete here, they should be compelled to compete on fair and equal terms and be prepared not only to provide decent employment but required in all reason to maintain inside the country at least sufficient assets as will cover their liabilities at any time to their Irish policy holders.</P>
    <P>It is apparent from this debate that the position generally throughout industry and the country at the moment warrants some exceptional thinking on the part of every section of the community. I think it is apparent that what we need more than anything else at the moment is faith and confidence in our own ability to utilise the brains and resources that God gave us to surmount our present difficulties.  I certainly agree with several Senators who suggested that the present position is a challenge.  It should be a challenge, in my view, to the pride and patriotic sentiments of every Irishman worthy of the title, but I suggest that it will require a lot more than that. One step has, indeed, been advocated as being necessary&mdash;it is a step I endorse&mdash;and that is that the problem should be taken immediately right out of the realm of Party politics.</P>
    <P>I think that the Government are entitled to and ought to be assured of the whole-hearted co-operation of every Party in this country and of every organised section, either of industry or agriculture, and for that matter of labour.  Speaking for the conference which I represent, I think I can assure the Minister and the Government, without question, that anything we can do to help by way of consultation or otherwise, we will be <Col N="357" /> glad to do.  Some of the remedies which have been suggested now, have been in the forefront of the policy of the people for whom I speak.</P>
    <P>I welcome the suggestion made by Senator Professor O'Brien, and other Senators, for the early establishment of some type of investment council.  I would go further and suggest that the idea could perhaps be developed in order to examine the best and most practical means of increasing agricultural productivity.  I believe that my conference&mdash;the Irish Conference of Professional Services Association&mdash;has taken a small step in that direction already.  Some of the initial consultations which were held were encouraging. The idea is good and ought to be taken up seriously by the Government in some shape.  The necessity is really for something to be done in that direction quickly.</P>
    <P>I also welcomed the note that has been sounded both by the Government speakers and other speakers in this debate.  If the present generation of Irishmen can claim to have achieved as great an amount as has been achieved in this country over the past 30, 40 or 50 years, then I suggest that there is no lack of initiative, and that we have all the brains we need, all the ability we want.  I believe all we are lacking is the determination at the moment to work together as a team in order to solve the difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Seanad for enabling me to fulfil another engagement later on this evening and I am particularly grateful to those Senators who cut short their contributions. Because of that reason, Senator Stanford put, very tersely, three questions to me.  I should like to deal with them first.  He asked us whether we had considered the possibility of there being oil in this country.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce the other day indicated, when he was introducing his Estimate, that there were certain proposals to explore the possibility of finding oil and natural gas here being examined at the moment in his Department. I know rather more about it than was indicated but I think that the <Col N="358" /> House will agree that it would be wrong for me at this stage to give any further indication than that.  With Senator Stanford I sincerely hope that those possibilities will become a reality.  If, perchance, oil was found the task of the Minister for Finance would become a relatively easy one.  He also mentioned existing custom duties on musical instruments.  That was one of the McKenna duties imposed in 1916, or thereabouts.  It is not a very great amount in total and is a duty which some Minister for Finance might consider, or which I might consider, changing favourably at a time when reductions of taxation are possible.  It would be all wrong, no matter how trifling such a tax was, that there should be any question of remission against the pattern in which we framed our Budget this year.</P>
      <P>He also asked if anyone here drew bonds in the new British scheme would he be liable for taxation here on the benefit of the premium that he would receive.  Speaking in my personal capacity&mdash;I have, for the moment, left the profession in which, as a lawyer, I would be in a position to advise Senator Stanford on that brief&mdash;I would not think it quite correct for a Minister to endeavour to give an explanation of the law.  I am afraid I will have to ask him, and the House, to excuse me from giving such an explanation because we have not had a full opportunity of examining the details, which were only announced the other day, of the British scheme.</P>
      <P>As I am mentioning premium bonds, I will refer to the suggestion made by Senator Professor O'Brien that we should utilise a similar scheme in relation to the provision of capital here. We are, of course, in a slightly different position from the British.  We have here the Hospitals' Sweeps which contribute (a) to the revenue by reason of the stamp duty on their proceeds and (b) very substantially indeed to the provision of hospital facilities. Were it not for the assistance towards the Hospitals' Fund from the proceeds of the sweeps, it is easy for all of us to see what the position would be and the enormous cost that would have to be met from the revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> The benefit which the Exchequer receives from the Hospitals' Sweeps is a real one and we would want to be very sure before taking up a scheme, or instituting a scheme, of premium bonds that we would not merely be effecting a transfer of funds and that we were in fact getting new funds.</P>
    <P>Various Senators referred to matters with which perhaps I might deal more completely on the Committee Stage and I would ask the House to excuse me if I do not refer to some of the detailed matters which we can discuss on the other stage of the Bill next week. The Second Stage of the Finance Bill, I would suggest, is more the time for discussing broad general principles rather than the detailed implementation of those principles.</P>
    <P>Members on every side of the House, I thought, as far as I could follow the discussion, agreed with me that our fundamental trouble at the moment is that we should get increased production. If we do not achieve increased production both in agriculture and in industry then we have no hope of maintaining, much less of improving, our present standard of living.</P>
    <P>Certain Senators suggested that we should concentrate more on production for export.  I think that, if we concentrate on raising the level of total production, it will have the effect that more will be available for export and that it is better that we should concentrate in that way on production as a whole rather than that we should try to develop it selectively for export. When I say that, however, I do not want to be taken as suggesting that there must not be a vigorous drive for export markets.  There must be, and particularly by those people in every walk of life who have the home market successfully reserved for themselves. There is a duty on them, because of the circumstances by which the home market is reserved for them, to follow up their real obligation of coming out and doing their utmost to find and secure export markets and so ease our difficulties.</P>
    <P>Agriculture, of course, is the main <Col N="360" /> basis on which we can increase production as a whole.  Senator O'Callaghan suggested that those engaged in agriculture were not of a mind to do so.  I do not agree with him.  I have the utmost faith in the farmers of Ireland.  I firmly believe that if the difficulties of the situation are brought home to them, and if the way is pointed out to them in which they can assist, then they will do their utmost in every respect to meet the difficulties with which we are all faced.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I may add in parenthesis that the Senator referred to Goleen.  I am afraid I cannot &ldquo;off the cuff&rdquo; answer him as to whether what he said is correct.  I have been in Goleen only once, more than five or six years ago, and therefore I am unable to tell him whether the statements to which he referred were correct or otherwise.  I have no doubt that if he would have a discussion with the Senator from West Cork in this Assembly, he would be able to test the accuracy of the statement as regards the numbers of children, etc.  It is very unfortunate indeed that many statements are made, not in this House, that are without foundation and are taken up and are quoted outside this country as being the gospel truth, when in fact they are completely without any foundation.</P>
    <P>There was a reference made by Senator O'Callaghan and other Senators to wheat.  Let us be quite clear on what the position is in respect of wheat.  I have referred to it on many occasions before, but I should like to lay stress on it as it has been mentioned here in connection with the general agricultural production.  We use approximately 450,000 tons of dried wheat every year.  Those who are in a position to assess these matters&mdash;I frankly accept that I am not&mdash;suggest that it is impossible to make bread from native wheat, that is, machine bread, except on the basis that we mix with it sufficient hard wheats and dried wheats from abroad.  That means that our native wheat harvest should be fixed at approximately 300,000 tons a year.  That is the amount of wheat, by and large, that was obtained last year.  The reason that more wheat was <Col N="361" /> imported last year was not any drop below the required 300,000 tons, but that in the previous year we had, unfortunately, dreadful harvest weather and the native grain was, through no fault of the farmer or anyone else, in such a condition that it was necessary to dilute it to a greater extent than normal with imported wheat.  On that occasion, more native wheat was carried forward from the previous year than would otherwise have been the case.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that 300,000 tons were the approximate amount of dried native wheat that would be required. That was a formal decision of the last Government, a decision of which I approve.  As I say, in the season just passed, it was the approximate amount that was obtained.  It is therefore untrue to suggest that any action of the present Government or any action whatever depressed the amount of native wheat below the figure which it was determined by the previous Government could usefully be utilised. There is no sense in endeavouring to increase agricultural production merely by switching from one crop to another. We want to ensure that the total production is increased.</P>
    <P>Senator Cogan mentioned that the Minister for Agriculture and I seem to differ violently in our estimation of the total output, but it is entirely a matter of which way you look at the question. When I was speaking, I was referring to gross output and when the Minister for Agriculture was speaking, he was referring to net output, allowing for the changes of live stock.  There was no question of any differences whatever such as the Senator has suggested. However, as he did mention it, it might be as well if we looked at the facts in relation to the volume of gross agricultural output, even allowing for the changes in live stock.  If these changes in live stock are included in the volume of gross agricultural output, we find that in 1955, it rose by 3.3 per cent.  The other method did not allow anything for additional stock on the land that is held on the land to carry forward on 1st of January. That additional stock will come in, or, I should say, will go out, this year, and <Col N="362" /> it will come to hand in our statistics for 1956, but we had in terms of trade in relation to sales of agricultural products a drop as compared with last year.  It is on account of that movement in the terms of trade that our exports in the first five months of this year have not been up to the peak of last year.  I only mention that so as to make it clear that the prospects in respect of our agricultural exports this year are not a matter for complacency, but they are nevertheless not as unsatisfactory as one might otherwise believe, or as certain Senators ask us to accept.  We must definitely increase our total agricultural production.  We must ensure that we get that additional production and not merely get production of one type at the expense of another.</P>
    <P>Senator Commons, in what I must frankly describe as a most comprehensive and courageous speech, made it clear that, in his view, one of the ways of doing this would be to increase the pig population&mdash;to increase pig production.  I agree that not merely is it one of the ways, but I think it is the way in which there could be most quickly achieved an expanded output in agriculture.  The arrangements the Minister for Agriculture, on behalf of the Government, announced recently, by virtue of which we are going to guarantee a floor price for Grade A pigs will, I believe, materially assist towards this end.  Up to this, it has aways been the feeling&mdash;it was more than a feeling: it was a fact&mdash;that, when pig prices were good, farmers rushed into pig production and that, immediately they rushed in, the prices fell and they went out of production. There was all the time this ebb and flow in pig production.  The floor that is now being put under the price for Grade A pigs should, I think, enable people to plan their production in a much more satisfactory way and give them the confidence they need.</P>
    <P>I stressed that it was for Grade A pigs, and one of the reasons I stressed that particularly is that it is, perhaps, on feeding barley and skim milk that Grade A pigs can best be fed.  There is no market now for the old type of bacon that used to be popular&mdash;the <Col N="363" /> oily, fat, greasy type.  That was produced satisfactorily enough on yellow meal, maize, but the public taste has changed entirely to a different type. With skim milk, feeding barley is the best means of producing the pig now suited to the public taste and to be classified as Grade A.  With the new varieties of feeding barley that are available, it is possible, and it should be encouraged everywhere, that people will do their utmost throughout the country, no matter in what part of the country they are, to go in in a much bigger way for pig production based on growing their own requirements of feeding barley and feeding it to their own stock with skim milk.  That is one of the quickest ways in which we can expand our agricultural production.</P>
    <P>Other Senators, when they were speaking on the question of production, seemed to suggest that it would be possible to arrive at a system in which agriculture would be taken out of politics.  Senator O'Brien was the first person to suggest that.  He followed it by saying that, whenever he discussed the subject, he heard so many policies that he was somewhat confused and that, therefore, he wanted people to sit down and produce one policy.  But the very reason people cannot sit down and produce one policy is that they have different views.  There is no use talking about taking a thing out of politics to get an agreed view, when the fact remains that different people have different policies with regard to the subject.  In every walk of life, it is easy enough to get agreement, if the other people come to our way of thinking, but when it comes to asking each of us individually to accept agreement on any problem, on the basis of going over to the other fellow's point of view, the solution does not seem quite so pleasant.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why it may be difficult to do as the Senator suggested, and as others suggested, is that there are fundamental differences in the approach to agricultural policy between the present Government, for example, and the Opposition.  While I accept unreservedly that all political <Col N="364" /> Parties should and, I am sure, would, co-operate for the betterment of the common good in achieving an increase in agricultural production, which we all accept as being so necessary, nevertheless I think that there might be such a difference in the method of approach to that increase that we would find that, in endeavouring to get a unified policy in that respect, we were in fact achieving no policy at all.</P>
    <P>The appropriate method seems to me to be for the Government of the day to take advice, to take help, and to take assistance from those and to co-operate with those who are engaged in agriculture throughout the country; and having ascertained views in that respect and with the special knowledge that any Government must have about circumstances, particularly in regard to export markets and so forth, then to endeavour to frame proposals best suited to the facts as they see them and best suited to the circumstances of the time.  Co-operation and harmony and advice, both from the Government and to the Government, by the various farmer organisations is the keynote upon which this Government proposes to push forward its agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>Before I go to the general discussion there was on finance itself, I might just perhaps mention one or two other matters.  Certain Senators mentioned the question of income-tax and many on one side said a valedictory prayer to it.  Other Senators on the other side were not prepared to take leave of it so gracefully.  I do not know whether the people who are talking of the abolition of income-tax are thinking purely in terms of the abolition of personal income-tax, as apart from corporate income-tax.  Income-tax and surtax, corporate and personal, cover approximately £25,000,000 out of our total tax revenue of approximately £90,000,000.  It is a very large proportion, and if people are thinking in terms of the abolition of that, they would want to do an awful lot of thinking also in terms of what is going to be the substitute.  Certainly there are things that could be substituted&mdash; turnover taxes, sales taxes and so forth&mdash;but they would have to be on <Col N="365" /> such a wide variety of things and at such a rate that they would, I am afraid, frighten the people who proposed them, if they were thinking in terms of total tax.</P>
    <P>I think myself that they are only considering it from the point of view of personal taxation, as apart from corporate taxation.  We are not the only country in which there is this somewhat strident controversy going on in relation to income-tax.  I happened to pick up a magazine from America the other day and I found there exactly the same arguments being advanced on both sides&mdash;perhaps even more stridently and more vociferously than they are being put here. Similar discussions have appeared from time to time in England.  But I have obtained a long list and, as far as I know, income taxation of some sort or another is in existence in almost every country in the world.  I obtained a list of the countries in which some type of income taxation was in existence, but the list is so long that I am not going to weary the Seanad by reading it out.</P>
    <P>However, that does not mean that I accept that the system is perfect.  I do not.  It is because I feel that the system may require variation and may require examination that I indicated I was prepared to consider what type of commission it would be best to set up to examine the matter, what type of examination would be the best, and what would be the most suitable terms of reference, when I had concluded my examination of the report of the Committee on Industrial Taxation.  Senator Murphy asked me why I would not do it at once.  The reason is very simple. The examination of the implications of the report of the Committee on Industrial Taxation will take some considerable time.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy appreciates that the provision of the data for a new commission would require a great deal of work.  There will have to be a good deal of research work, too, before one can finally determine the exact terms of reference and the best manner of completing this examination.  Quite frankly, there are not sufficient skilled personnel available in the Revenue <Col N="366" /> Commissioners to enable that examination to proceed contemporaneously with the examination of the Industrial Taxation Committee's Report and, at the same time, to be able to carry on the ordinary and very onerous duties the Revenue Commissioners and their staff have to carry out.  It is a question of dealing with things in an orderly way, and the orderly way surely is to conclude the work on the report of the commission that has just come to hand rather than to leave that undone and start something else first.  We shall conclude what has been reported on first and, when we have concluded our examination of it and its implications, then we will move on to the other problem.</P>
    <P>I am gratified and flattered by the number of people who say now that this general examination of our income-tax code is long overdue.  I am gratified and flattered by the implication that I am tackling something long overdue, but it would be very bad economy, and a very bad headline to set, to tackle that before we had completed the other task that was initiated by my predecessor.</P>
    <P>In regard to the economic situation in general, Senator Walsh, I noted yesterday, said that I had delayed far too long in dealing with that situation. Other Senators on that side of the House complained violently about the method by which I had dealt with it, and that I had been much too severe. Senator Hawkins, I think, particularly took that line.  It would be very much easier for the country to understand where Senators on the other side of the House stood if they would deal with the matter with a united voice.  One says I waited too long, the other says that I was too severe.  Let us take the first criticism first.  I certainly mentioned in the other House but I cannot remember whether I mentioned it before in this House, that we might make a comparison with what Deputy MacEntee as Minister for Finance suggested was his problem in 1951.  He did not take the line I took.  He took the line of waiting until the annual Budget and doing nothing whatsoever about it until the annual Budget, though in his case&mdash;I am not going to comment on <Col N="367" /> whether that course was right or wrong&mdash;the problem then was even worse than the problem with which I had to contend last March.  I took the view that it was not desirable that the annual Budget alone should be the only occasion on which one should introduce measures, fiscal or otherwise, for the purpose of dealing with a particular economic situation that might arise.</P>
    <P>The present manner in which the economy moves in any country is such that it is so fluid that you cannot merely deal with it from Budget to Budget.  It is not a problem that calls only for annual treatment.  There are problems with which in every country whoever is entrusted with the task of being Minister for Finance must grapple almost from day to day, and it would be, I suggest, quite wrong to adopt the same method that was adopted by my predecessor, of merely waiting until the Budget to do it.  On the contrary, I stepped in much earlier than he did, and took the measures I did take in March.</P>
    <P>Senator Professor O'Brien, speaking of the Budget, termed it a good Gladstonian Budget.  I am not exactly clear on all the implications that he intended by that.  There are two implications which I could draw from it.  I will, however, suggest this, that, as I have said a second ago, the Budget is not the only occasion upon which it might be desirable to deal with economic trends.  I think Gladstone would have thought it was the only occasion, and to that extent I am afraid the suggestion is more Gladstonian than the Budget itself.</P>
    <P>It is right, however, that we should appreciate that while it is not the only occasion, it is the occasion upon which the framework should be set, and that the Budget itself should not be out of pattern with the general framework one expects throughout the financial year or one has visualised as the result of economic events in the previous financial year.  I think I can say that this Budget is in that general framework, putting its stress on expenditure and on imports in so far as taxation is concerned and, in so far as the other side of it is concerned, endeavouring <Col N="368" /> to do something, albeit small, for production and for savings.  I do not suggest at all, however, that any Budget a Minister might bring in should be free from criticism.  It could not. The circumstances in which we are here are obviously circumstances in which the margin available to alter the economy and shape it is very narrow indeed.  The Senator's suggestion was that I should have budgeted for a very heavy surplus on current account.  I think the Senator, however, was perhaps not quite fair when he made that criticism without, at the same time, making it clear that the transference of the proceeds raised by the special import levy to capital account would, to that extent, have had somewhat the same effect.  Whether additional sums should have been taken out of current revenue and transferred to the capital account with the additional taxation that that would involve is a matter about which we could have discussions for a very long time indeed.  It depends on many things.  It depends on the trend particularly of savings during the coming year.  It depends on the trend in relation to total production. But, as I say, it would be a matter for discussion over a longer period than is available to us this evening.</P>
    <P>I do stress in that connection as heavily as I can that in the present day the one thing we must always remember is that the economic situation will require changes to be dealt with more quickly than in the past, and that there must be greater flexibility by those in charge of the economy of any country in dealing with and reshaping financial policy.  I hope that my mind, as time goes on, will not be as rigid as perhaps others were in the last century.</P>
    <P>I want to say this in relation to the speech made by Senator Hickey and, to a minor degree, by other Senators: no monetary, no banking, no credit systems can, of themselves, create an economic Utopia, and, by suggesting that all our problems arise from monetary, or banking, or credit systems, we are diverting the attention of the people from the real problem, which is production.  It must be towards that problem of production <Col N="369" /> that we bend our energies, our minds, our efforts.  I do not think it is right for Senator Hickey&mdash;I know him for a long time as a sincere man and one who believes in what he says&mdash;to suggest as he suggested, in all good faith, I have no doubt, that we were transmitting through exchange control personal applications to the Bank of England.  It is not true.</P>
    <P>The difficulties that may lie ahead in the financial field are difficulties that can be overcome, if the people appreciate those difficulties, and make up their minds they are going to do their part towards overcoming them. The first basis upon which they can be overcome is that we ensure there will be adequate savings to carry out a productive capital programme.  If there are not adequate savings in the community, then, no matter who is in Government&mdash;whether it is the present Government, the Government that was there before us or the Governments that will be there in future&mdash;it will not be possible to do the things we would like to do to ensure the proper development of our country.</P>
    <P>It is, to some extent, an unfortunate vicious circle that the underdeveloped countries must necessarily find it more difficult to set aside savings towards their capital development than the developed countries, but, if they do not do so, then they fall further and further behind in the economic race. We must first of all endeavour to convince our own people that we are determined to do what lies in our power to prevent depression in the purchasing power of our money.  We must do that to ensure that there will be an atmosphere in which our people will think it worth while to save.</P>
    <P>We must, at the same time, make it clear that those who save are not putting aside from current consumption portion of their means for sterilisation purposes but for the purpose of being able to get productive investment in the country that will inure to the benefit of the country as a whole and to everyone in it at a future date.  We must make it clear to our people that savings will be used in such a way as will assist production; that these savings will be utilised to the fullest <Col N="370" /> extent, to the whole extent, here in Ireland in building up our resources.</P>
    <P>We must also make it clear to them that if they are not prepared to assist in that building up, we will not be able to do any of the things that we should do and that all of us might consider desirable.  That is the first fundamental that our people must realise at the present time.  I have no doubt that when it is brought home to them that the development of our country depends on the proper productive use of savings and that sufficient savings should be made available to put through the capital programme of the State, everyone on all sides and in every part of the country, without distinction of class or creed, will come together for one common purpose&mdash;to try and ensure that we develop to the fullest extent such resources as we have in Ireland to-day.</P>
