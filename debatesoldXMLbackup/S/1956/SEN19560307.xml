    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. P. O'Donnell) Patrick O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. P. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes an improved code of superannuation benefits for the officers and servants of local authorities.  It is a measure which, to a large extent, brings together for consolidation the series of Acts which begins with the Union Officers Superannuation (Ireland) Act of 1865 and ends with the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1948. The Bill was already foreshadowed when the Act of 1948 was being enacted as it was appreciated at the time that the novel scheme provided for in that Act for the superannuation of local authority servants would in all probability give rise to the need for amending legislation as experience was gained of the operation of the scheme and suggestions for improvement presented themselves.  Thus, while the present Bill is a comprehensive measure dealing with both officers and servants, it differs from the 1948 Act principally in <Col N="1216" /> Part III, the servants' part, which represents an attempt to simplify and improve, so far as practicable, the unique provisions of Part III of the 1948 Act.</P>
      <P>I shall deal first with the provisions relating to officers which are mostly concentrated in Part II.  The Bill aims at providing for the superannuation of all officers of local authorities who are entitled to superannuation rights whether they are at present under the Act of 1948, the Local Government Act, 1925, or the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1919.  It does not apply to officers of mental hospital authorities who have always had a superannuation code separate from the rest of the local government service.  The Act of 1948 provided that existing officers at the 1st April, 1948, could, within a period of six months, opt for the benefits of that Act in lieu of the benefits to which they were then entitled under other Acts.  Some officers who elected to retain their existing benefits regret their choice, because the older schemes did not provide for the death gratuity which under the 1948 Act may be granted to the legal personal representative of an officer who dies while in the service.  The present Bill offers to those who were existing pensionable officers at the 1st April, 1948, a second chance to choose whichever set of benefits suits them best but the alternative sets of benefits will be provided for in the Bill and none of them will, for the future, derive from earlier Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exemption from superannuation contributions is a question which has been raised with me in its various aspects by very many interested parties since this Bill was introduced in the Dáil.  Under the Bill, as under the Act of 1948, officers are required to contribute 5 per cent. of their remuneration towards their superannuation but provision is made for exemption from contributions for certain classes of officers. Exemption from contributions is based on the principle that officers who enjoyed superannuation rights, free of contributions, under earlier enactments such as the Local Government Act, 1925, or the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1919, are specially exempted from <Col N="1217" /> contributions under this Bill as they were under the Act of 1948.  Officers appointed in a pensionable capacity before the 1st April, 1948, had the benefit of a free pension scheme and have had this right preserved to them under the 1948 Act and under the present Bill.  Many claims for exemption from contributions have been made on behalf of officers whose present period of pensionable service began on or after the 1st April, 1948, but it has not been found possible to admit any of these claims.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in the Bill that the expression &ldquo;pensionable officer&rdquo; will henceforth apply only to an officer whose name is entered on the register of pensionable officers kept under the Bill; and that his name will not be entered on that register until he is clearly a permanent officer.  Under the Act of 1925 the question of whether an officer was pensionable or not was usually determined only when he came to retire from his office.  This was an unsatisfactory position both for the officer and the local authority.  The Act of 1948 dealt with this problem by providing that officers who came under its terms should be entered on a register of established officers, but it did not exclude the possibility of there being pensionable officers who were not entered under the register.  When staffs are being recruited for the future their status must be properly declared.  If they are permanent whole-time officers, or permanent medical officers, their names will be entered on the register of pensionable officers.  That entry will be their title to a pension.  It is proposed in the Bill that all existing officers entitled to pension will be entered on this new register of pensionable officers.</P>
    <P>Under the Act of 1925, no scale for the calculation of a pension based on years of service was laid down, but every pension had to be sanctioned by the Minister.  The Act of 1948 remedied that for the normal pension where no question of added years arose.  There was a fixed scale under the Act, of one-eightieth of remuneration for each year of service up to 40, and a pension so calculated did not <Col N="1218" /> require sanction.  In certain specified circumstances or where the local authority were of opinion that &ldquo;special reasons existed&rdquo;, years could be added under the Act of 1948 up to a maximum of ten.  The Act did not specify those &ldquo;special reasons&rdquo;, but practice has for a good while determined what they are and what scale of years should be taken in calculating them.  In Section 13 of the present Bill all the headings under which years might be added are specified.  The section proposes to give the Minister power to make regulations, which will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, governing the precise additions that may be made in each circumstance.  In this way the practice governing added years will both for local authorities and for local officials, be made explicit and each officer will know, when his pension is being calculated, what he might reasonably expect to get in the circumstances of his case. This permits the sanction of the Minister to be dispensed with entirely in the awarding of superannuation benefits to officers.  Ample provision is, however, made in the Bill for appeal to the Minister when an officer is aggrieved in relation to his superannuation.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that Section 13 does not involve any diminution of the rights of officers in the matter of added years but merely sets out in statutory form what has for long been accepted practice.  It is an effort to set out clearly the circumstances in which an officer may expect to be allowed added years by his local authority and to eliminate any suggestion of secrecy or unequal treatment as between one officer and another.  I may say that it is intended that the regulations to be made under the section will be based on existing practice in relation to &ldquo;added years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In Part IV of the Bill, Section 50, there is provision whereby an officer may agree to give up part of his lump sum or death gratuity in consideration of a pension for his widow.  This rearrangement of benefits is to be self-financing and to involve no extra burden on local authorities.  It is proposed that regulations to be made under the section will provide that in the normal <Col N="1219" /> case two-thirds of the lump sum or death gratuity will be given up in return for a pension of one-third of what the officer's pension would have been had he retired on grounds of ill-health instead of dying where death occurs while he is in office or one-third of his pension where death occurs while he is on pension.</P>
    <P>A further improvement in the Bill&mdash; it applies to both officers and servants &mdash;is the provision to link up various branches of the public service for pension purposes.  The Act of 1948 linked up service in the Civil Service, harbour authorities and teaching service with service under local authorities, but the present Bill goes a good deal further in that respect.  It is thus a considerable step towards the achieving of a single public service for all public authorities just as a single local service for local authorities was achieved after 1925.</P>
    <P>A matter that gave a good deal of trouble under the Act of 1948 was how to calculate the remuneration on which a benefit under the Act could be based.  The Act of 1925 provided that it should be the average of pay during the three years preceding cesser of office.  The Act of 1948 said that it should normally be the pay on cesser of office, but in any exceptional case the average of the three preceding years.  The Act did not give precise effect to its intentions, and gave rise to considerable difficulty and diverse interpretations in some exceptional cases, for example, officers paid wholly by fee or poundage.  Section 27 of the Bill endeavours to resolve these difficulties on the general lines of the intentions of the Act of 1948.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill contains the pension scheme for servants of local authorities and is intended to supersede the scheme embodied in Part III of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1948.  Prior to the 1948 Act there was no statutory pension scheme for servants, except in respect of the county borough corporations of Dublin, Limerick and Waterford and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire where provision existed for the grant of pensions to servants whose service was, like that of pensionable officers, permanent <Col N="1220" /> and fully continuous.  Such provision would obviously not benefit the majority of road workers and other servants of local authorities whose service is in many cases frequently intermittent. Accordingly, if pensions and other superannuation benefits were to be provided for road workers and other servants of local authorities whose service was broken a radical departure from the type of scheme applied to officers was required.  Part III of the 1948 Act represented an attempt to devise a superannuation scheme which would suit the employment conditions existing amongst local authority servants.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the scheme was that permanent servants who were not absent for more than 60 days in any one of three successive years could be enrolled in a register of &ldquo;established servants&rdquo;. They could then reckon their future service for superannuation purposes in each year in which they worked at least 200 days for the local authority. The scheme was hedged around with many restrictions, limitations and prohibitions, which had in practice the effect of preventing many servants from qualifying under it or, if they did qualify, of reducing the length of service which could be reckoned towards the benefits payable.  It has been the objective in drawing up Part III of this Bill to eliminate as many as possible of these restrictions, limitations and prohibitions, to make the scheme as simple and straightforward as possible and to ensure that it will be effective in providing benefits for those whom it was designed to benefit.</P>
    <P>Under Part III of the 1948 Act, a servant had to comply with the following conditions before his name could be entered in the register of servants who were eligible for superannuation benefits:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  He had to be deemed by the local authority to be a permanent servant.</P>
    <P>2.  He had to complete three successive years' service with his local authority with not more than 60 days' absence in any year&mdash;any absences within the limit of 60 days had to be involuntary.</P>
    <P>3.  He had to come within the maximum <Col N="1221" /> figure of permanent servants fixed by the local authority.</P>
    <P>4.  He had to be under the age of 60 years.</P>
    <P>The present Bill proposes to drop all these restrictive conditions and to substitute one straightforward test of fact for enrolment in the register of pensionable servants.  If a servant has 200 &ldquo;service days&rdquo; in a local financial year his name will, under the Bill, be entered in the register as from the following 1st April unless he applies during the month of April to have his name removed from the register.  A service day is, briefly, a day on which the servant has worked, or for which he has been paid; a day on workmen's compensation, subject to a limit of a year, or a day on which he has been doing Reserve Defence Force training.</P>
    <P>Under the Act of 1948, a servant whose name was on the pension register ran the risk of having it removed if in any of the first five years in which his name was enrolled he worked for the local authority for less than 200 days.  This provision has been deleted in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Further improvements are made in the Bill as regards the periods which a servant can reckon for the purpose of computing the various benefits.  Under the 1948 Act, working days which did not reach a total of at least 200 days in any year were not reckoned.  In this Bill, the restriction to &ldquo;working days&rdquo; is modified and the minimum annual requirement is to be 200 &ldquo;service days&rdquo; instead of 200 working days. This is a much more liberal requirement since, as I have mentioned above, the expression &ldquo;service day&rdquo; covers many days on which the servant does not actually work.</P>
    <P>Under the 1948 Act, a servant could not reckon the following periods towards superannuation benefit:</P>
    <P>(a)  The three-year period which a servant, who was not an existing permanent servant at the commencement of the Act in relation to him, spent in qualifying for enrolment in the register.</P>
    <P>(b)  All his previous service, if, before he had completed five years of <Col N="1222" /> pensionable local service, he worked for less than 200 days in any year.</P>
    <P>(c)  Any period before he reached the age of 18.</P>
    <P>(d)  All service prior to certain kinds of strike unless reinstated by the Minister on appeal by the servant.</P>
    <P>(e)  Possibly all service if he were not working (e.g. because of illness) when he made his actual claim for superannuation.</P>
    <P>(f)  Service before ceasing to be a permanent servant in a case where the servant subsequently resumes.</P>
    <P>All these limitations on the reckoning of service are being removed in this Bill and the only vestige of them which may be said to survive is the single year with 200 service days which a servant in future must serve to qualify for entry on the register of pensionable servants.  The service days in that year are not reckonable in the present Bill, but otherwise all the limitations mentioned are being removed.</P>
    <P>To return to what has been called the &ldquo;200 day rule&rdquo;; this is the minimum requirement in the direction of permanency and continuity in this unique superannuation scheme.  There is no other scheme known to me where the employer provides pensions and other benefits for employees who are not in regular employment.  The universal rule in other pension schemes both for office staffs and manual workers is that the employers accept no liability to superannuate any of their workers who is not in their permanent, regular employment.  The 1948 Act and this Bill break new ground in providing full-scale benefits for employees whose service is broken, who may in fact at times be working for other employers or for themselves.  The principle of requiring full and regular service of at least eight months out of the 12 for the local authority is an indispensable minimum requirement. No matter where the line is drawn there will always be unlucky individuals who find themselves just on the wrong side of the line.  To lower that requirement any further would impose <Col N="1223" /> on local authorities an unwarranted liability in respect of persons who could not be regarded as being their regular employees in any realistic sense.</P>
    <P>The benefits proposed to be payable under Part III of the Bill are the same as those in Part III of the 1948 Act and the contribution rate is also unchanged. The contribution rate is 4? per cent. of remuneration (½d. in the shilling) and the benefits are:&mdash; (a) a pension of one-sixtieth of pay for each year of pensionable service, or (b) a short service, or death gratuity, or (c) a marriage gratuity for women.</P>
    <P>In endeavouring to graft the proposed new scheme for servants on to the 1948 Act scheme, the general idea has been to apply the improvements so far as possible to the past service of existing servants.  So far as persons who were formerly servants of local authorities where Part III of the 1948 Act had been adopted are concerned, there is provision in Section 54 enabling local authorities, in their discretion, to grant allowances in certain cases where the persons concerned make application for the benefits of the section.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that Part III of the Bill will overcome the difficulties which arose in connection with the administration of Part III of the 1948 Act and which only experience could have revealed, and that the superannuation scheme for local authority servants will in the future work smoothly and simply and to the satisfaction of the local authorities and their employees.</P>
    <P>We now come to Part IV of the Bill, and I have already referred to the new provision in Section 50 by which an officer, by surrendering portion of his lump sum or death gratuity, can provide for a pension for his widow.  In Section 51 there is a further new provision enabling an officer or servant on retirement to surrender any portion of his pension, not exceeding one-third, in consideration of a pension for his widow or one specified dependant, or alternatively a pension for his wife while he lives which will be doubled on his death.  The amount of the pension to be paid to the wife, widow or specified dependant, as the case may <Col N="1224" /> be, is intended to be actuarially equivalent to the amount surrendered by the officer or servant, so that the section really provides for a rearrangement of existing benefits which may appeal to some officers and servants as a handy device for making a certain definite provision for a widow or other dependant in the event of death.</P>
    <P>The other new provision, in Part IV, apart from those mentioned, is that in Section 53 which permits a part-time officer, who is not a pensionable officer, to be granted a gratuity if his office is abolished or if for some reason, apart from his own misconduct, he has to be asked to resign from it.  This remedies a small, but definite, defect in the existing law inasmuch as it provides for the grant of compensation in the rare case where a part-time officer who has a permanent tenure of his office but who has no pension rights must be removed from his office through no fault of his by the local authority.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill contains a number of sections to deal with financial arrangements between various authorities concerned with awarding pensions. There is nothing new about the provisions except in subsection (7) of Section 57, and Section 58.  These provide that two or more of the various authorities concerned can enter into an agreement to abandon claims on one another in relation to pensions and contributions.  This will enable some rather elaborate accounting procedures to be dropped, and make for some economy of administration.  Obviously, payments of this kind taken as a whole cancel each other out but from the standpoint of a single local authority there may be some difficulties.  The entering into an agreement is, accordingly, left on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Part VI of the Bill call for little comment.  They are almost all, subject to relatively minor modifications, re-enactments of provisions of the Act of 1948.  Section 69, however, contains special provisions to deal with a certain situation which arose in Cork City.  It was a general principle in the 1948 Act, as it is in this Bill, that exemption from superannuation contributions should be allowed to servants (as well as officers) who <Col N="1225" /> were already in the enjoyment of rights under an existing superannuation scheme free of contributions.  In practice it was intended that the permanent servants of the four county boroughs, the Borough of Dun Laoghaire and certain servants of the Dublin City Vocational Education Committee who were the only servants who had existing &ldquo;free&rdquo; pension rights should be exempt from contributions.  To achieve this in the four county boroughs, it was provided in Section 63 of the 1948 Act that where a person's name was entered in a register of permanent employees when Part III of the Act was adopted he would be exempt from contributions.  No register of permanent servants was maintained in Cork, and accordingly the servants of Cork Corporation became liable for contributions.  The issue was taken to the courts, and it was eventually decided against the local authority servants by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>It had not, however, been the intention under the Act that these servants should pay contributions and they are accordingly exempted from this liability under paragraph (c) of sub-section (5) of Section 48 of the Bill. These contributions have, however, been collected since 1948 from these servants and the problem of a refund of them arises.  The total amount involved is considerable, and in the Bill as introduced I proposed in Section 69 to deal with the problem by arranging that servants who had retired before the passing of the Bill would have any contributions that they had paid returned to them at once and servants still in employment following the passing of the Bill would have the contributions returned when they came to draw a benefit under the Bill.  In this way the incidence of the repayment would have been spread over a number of years.</P>
    <P>The section was, however, unanimously amended on the Committee Stage in the Dáil so as to provide that the return of contributions would be made within a period to be fixed by the corporation by resolution.  Accordingly the question of the return of contributions will now be a matter for decision by the members of the Cork City Council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1226" /> I have tried to make this Bill as comprehensive as possible so that it would provide a complete superannuation code for officers and servants of all local authorities other than mental hospital authorities and so that it could be read and administered without reference to earlier enactments.  A certain amount of reference to previous legislation has, nevertheless, been found to be unavoidable.</P>
    <P>An explanatory memorandum was circulated with the Bill on its original introduction in the Dáil explaining the detailed points as clearly as possible. This memorandum still holds good except in relation to Section 69, which deals with the return of contributions to certain servants of Cork Corporation, and which was amended in the manner I have mentioned above.</P>
    <P>I would like, if I may be permitted, to ask the House for a speedy passage for this Bill, so that it may be enacted before the 31st March.  It is my intention, if the Bill becomes law this month, to fix, in accordance with Section 4, the 1st April next as the day on which Part II of the Bill, which relates to officers, will come into operation. This will have the effect of giving to officers who are at present under the 1925 Act for pension purposes the opportunity of availing of an alternative set of benefits which includes a death gratuity to the legal personal representative in the case of an officer who dies in office.  Nothing is payable under the 1925 Act to officers who die in office.</P>
    <P>So far as servants are concerned the enactment of the Bill before the 1st April is even more important than it is for officers.  Part III of the Bill (the servants' part) will come into operation on the 1st April next after the passing of the Act in respect of every local authority which has adopted Part III of the 1948 Act.  Thus the operation of the pension scheme for servants would be put back to 1st April, 1957, unless the Bill is passed this month. This would be unfortunate, as it is virtually certain that considerable numbers of road workers and other servants will be eligible to have their names put on the register of pensionable servants as soon as Part III of the <Col N="1227" /> Bill comes into operation.  As soon as their names are on the register they have the assurance of certain benefits for themselves or their dependants in the event of permanent incapacity or death which, of course, they cannot get until the commencement of Part III of the Bill.  In the interests of these people, therefore, I would respectfully ask the co-operation of the Seanad for the passage of this Bill in time to have it enacted before the 31st of this month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>This House has over a number of years been very considerate in the matter of legislation by reference.  When the Party sitting on the opposite side of the House were on this side of the House, they made reference at many times to this very undesirable procedure.  Seldom, if ever, has this House been presented with a Bill containing so much reference to previous legislation as this Bill.  It is a very important Bill, and one which should be made as clear as possible, because it involves the future of so many people.  Their position should be made as clear as it is possible to make it.  What we find the Minister presenting to us, however, is a Bill in which every section refers to some past legislation.  A person employed by a local authority who is anxious to know what his or her position might be as a result of the enactment of this Bill will be compelled to look up, or have a member of the legal profession look up on his or her behalf, all the legislation passed through the Oireachtas in relation to this question since 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, as the Minister has pointed out, sets out to clarify some of the proposals incorporated in the 1948 Act. There is nothing new in it.  There are no provisions being made for the servants or employees of a local authority. The Bill arises, in the main, because of a misunderstanding that has arisen particularly in the mind of the City Manager of Cork and no one else. There are no new provisions being made.  But I would like to put two or three questions or points of view in relation to this whole question.  The Bill that we are discussing and the <Col N="1228" /> 1948 Act made provision for superannuation for the employees of local authorities.  To my mind, the employees of local authorities are very important persons.  They have a very important influence on the operation of the works carried on by local authorities. By their diligence and by the way they apply themselves to their work, they can contribute very much to the efficiency of the local authority.</P>
    <P>But there is another group of persons, that is, persons who are now pensioned under local authorities, and on their behalf, I should like to make a special plea to the Minister.  While it is not possible under this Bill to make very definite provision for them, I should like&mdash;and I am sure the House will agree with me&mdash;to see some very sympathetic consideration being given to their present position.  The persons I have in mind are those who were public servants in local authorities from the period 1919 to 1921.  That was a very important period in the history of this country.  The persons employed by local authorities during that period played a very important part, and while we might pay great tribute to those people who, by force of arms, achieved the freedom we now have, that freedom could not have been achieved without the co-operation and assistance of the people employed in our local authorities.</P>
    <P>When this question was put to the Minister in the other House, I think he passed it off by saying that there was provision made by the Minister for Defence that these people would be entitled to military service pensions. That is not the case.  The people I have in mind were those people who accepted the Orders of the first Dáil and who acted under those Orders and, because of acting in accordance with those Orders, helped and contributed in a very large way to achieve the position that we are in to-day.  I ask the Minister to give very serious consideration and very sympathetic consideration to the people coming within this category.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, there is very little new in this Bill.  There is nothing new that the servants or employees of local authorities can hope to gain, except clarification of the position as <Col N="1229" /> it existed under the 1948 Act.  I should like to draw the Minister's particular attention to Section 7 (1):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A local authority shall maintain a register to be known as the register of pensionable officers (in this part of this Act referred to as the register)...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This section makes it obligatory on local authorities to provide a register; but there is no provision made whereby an employee, who after all is the person most concerned, should be notified as to whether or not his or her name is recorded on that register.  I think if a provision of that kind had been made, the question that has arisen and that has given rise to so much controversy in relation to the position in Cork would never have arisen.  I think it is only right that, where this register is being compiled&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is no provision being made whereby, if a person's name is not on the register, he is notified, and if he is not so informed, he cannot take the necessary steps provided in the preceding sections to make an appeal to the Minister.  While I appreciate that there is provision being made in this section for a person whose name is recorded being notified, it is more important still, I think, that the person whose name is not recorded should be notified, because we are making provision in the Bill whereby that person, if he has a grievance, may make representations to the Minister. He cannot make these representations regarding his superannuation and conditions of employment which he feels entitled to make, unless he is <Col N="1230" /> notified accordingly.  Not alone that, but he is also given no reason as to why his name is not recorded on that register.  If the Minister pays attention to Section 30, he will find that the persons I have in mind will be completely removed from the benefits of this Bill, as there is no opportunity given to them to make the necessary representation to the Minister inside the prescribed time.</P>

      <P>In so far as this Bill is an improvement on the previous measure, I welcome it; and I do not entirely agree with Senator Hawkins that it contains no improvements or that there is nothing new in it.  There are some substantial improvements in it, but it would be foolish for me to say that it is really satisfactory, or that it will not be a source of disappointment to many of those affected by it.  This Bill deals with several classes of people &mdash;classes who differ very considerably in the conditions of their service and appointment and work generally&mdash;and I doubt the wisdom of trying to bring all these classes of people with varying interests and varying conditions under the cover of this one comprehensive superannuation scheme.  The result, of course, is what we have before us, a very highly technical Bill which is extremely difficult for an ordinary layman to follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the kind of Bill that one would normally find should be dealt with in Committee, but unfortunately it is also the kind of Bill to which a private member cannot move any effective amendment because it will be ruled out of order, because any amendment that one wished to move by way of improvement in the measure would be deemed to be calculated to increase the payments either by the State directly or from the rates.  Therefore, they are ruled out.  I understand that in the other House a score of such amendments tabled by Labour Deputies were ruled out for that reason.  We can only hope, therefore, to do our best during the Second Reading to induce the Minister himself to make the improvements in the Bill we would like to have seen.  Since those who are members of local authorities are in the best position to deal with this measure and its numerous details, I <Col N="1231" /> shall confine myself in the main to dealing with a body of whose conditions I have some knowledge, the vocational teachers.</P>
    <P>They are officers under this Bill, and as I said, I shall confine my remarks mostly to their position.  I think it would be more appropriate if a body like the vocational teachers were excluded from this measure altogether and if a separate pension scheme were provided for them.  We have in the country three classes of teachers, or four, if we include university professors. In the case of the other three classes, national teachers, secondary teachers and university professors, each has its own separate system of pension scheme suited to its own special conditions and circumstances; and I think it would be more appropriate in the case of vocational teachers than trying to lump them in with a lot of other bodies whose conditions and circumstances are very different. There may be one or two other sections in this Bill to which the same thing would apply.</P>
    <P>The vocational teachers are not directly under the county council or the county manager.  The county manager has very important duties in this Bill.  The vocational teachers are under a committee of the county council and this committee is not financed by the Local Government Department. As a matter of fact, these teachers have very little contact at all with either the Department of Local Government or the Minister for Local Government.  Their whole professional lives, if I may put it that way, are concerned with the Department of Education and the Minister for Education. Their appointments, the fixing of their salaries, their promotions and so forth are financed from funds provided to a very large extent by the Education Vote.</P>
    <P>I know, of course, that it is not possible to change that now and I do not pretend it is, but I should like to put that on record and to ask the Government to see the compelling reasons which are in favour of the suggestion I make.  I believe it would commend itself to the teachers concerned and to <Col N="1232" /> their organisation, and that it would be a saving also in administration, because if the teachers transfer from one part of the country to another, there has to be some agreement or some arrangement between the different counties to pay different portions of contributions and so on, whereas if there was one uniform scheme, they could be dealt with with much less administrative difficulty.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides on retirement a lump sum for teachers and other officers, too.  It sets out what the pension is to be; this includes a lump sum, equal to one-thirtieth of their pensionable remuneration multiplied by the number of years' service.  That would be the lump sum.  It provides that the maximum lump sum will be one and a half times their pensionable remuneration, but, before that maximum can be obtained by an officer, he must have given 45 years' pensionable service, assuming that the retirement is at 65 which, I think, is the normal age for retirement.  He must have that service before he can get the maximum lump sum provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>So far as vocational teachers are concerned, in any case, that maximum is purely illusory, because no vocational teacher can ever get his maximum. It would mean that he would have to enter the service at the age of 20 and have continuous service for the next 45 years before he could get his maximum lump sum, but no vocational teacher can enter at 20 years of age and, therefore, would not be qualified. As a matter of fact, the minimum age at which such an officer can enter is 21.  We know that very many of these vocational teachers, especially those engaged in manual work like woodwork teaching and metal working, do not enter the service until very much later.  These teachers are drawn generally from people who have served an apprenticeship to their trade and who have acquired special skill in that trade.  They then undergo a course of training for two years or so and are often up to 27, 28 and even 30 years before they enter the service.</P>
    <P>I understand that the average age for entrance for a vocational teacher is 25 or 26 years, so that the one-thirtieth <Col N="1233" /> for each year of service on which the lump sum is calculated should be something like one-twenty-fifth or one-twenty-sixth, if it is intended that they should ever get the maximum lump sum.  There is not very much in putting it down in black and white that it is the maximum, knowing that they can never get it.  That is one of the things which, if vocational teachers had a separate scheme for themselves, could be taken into account as meeting their special circumstances.  I know, of course, it could not very well be taken into account in this Bill because I suppose you have a number of local government employees in clerical grades who would enter round about 20 years of age and would be in a position to get the maximum sum.  The same might apply in the case of their pensionable allowances.  It would be very difficult for many of them to get even the full half of their salaries, which is the pensionable allowance.</P>
    <P>There were some minor points mentioned in the other House and I should like to mention them again.  They refer to the question of the calculation of the pensionable service and contributions. Contributions came in with the 1948 Act.  By the way, it struck me that this matter of contributions is something of a misnomer, except in the case of people who have back contributions to pay.  If you think of a contribution, you think it is a contribution to something.  You think you put it into a fund, for instance, from which you can draw it thereafter.  This 5 per cent., however, is a deduction from the officer's salary.  It does not go anywhere&mdash;except for the purpose of reducing the rates, or something of that kind.  In some pension schemes, there is a special fund into which contributions are paid and which undergo actuarial investigation.  I am not complaining about that.  I am just pointing out that this contribution is merely a reduction in the officer's income.</P>
    <P>I am told that quite a considerable number of vocational teachers gave long periods of temporary full-time service prior to the 1948 Act.  That has been taken into account in this Bill for pension purposes, provided it is immediately prior to the teacher's permanent service, but while a man <Col N="1234" /> who had permanent service before the 1948 Act is not asked to pay a contribution, the person who has had a temporary employment is&mdash;and I think it is rather hard on him.  Another class is the manual instruction teachers.  Some of these manual instruction teachers were in training just immediately before the 1948 Act.  They, also, are penalised in the matter of contributions.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter to which I wish to refer before I go on to something which I regard as more serious.  There was a parenthesis&mdash; the Minister will remember it&mdash;in Section 11, paragraph (g).  I think that, in the other House, the Minister promised to look into it.  I think it was ambiguous.  There is a parenthesis there about the conditions under which some teachers will pay contributions. The Minister said it would relate only to the payment of contributions. The inclusion of that parenthesis does not seem to have any great effect, except to leave the position ambiguous. I think it does leave it ambiguous and that other regulations might very well be made&mdash;rather than the ones the Minister intended&mdash;which should be confined to contributions alone.</P>
    <P>There are one or two things in this Bill that I consider a very serious blot and I would press the Minister very strongly to remove them before the Bill becomes law.  I refer to Section 10, sub-section (1) (f), and also to Section 15, sub-section (b).  I would refer members of the House to Section 10 (1) (f).  In my view, this provision should not be in any Bill leaving this Parliament in this day and age. Section 10 sets out the service which a man is entitled to calculate, but he must not calculate any period before a date after the commencement of this Part of this Act on which he absents himself from the place where he performs his duties under a local authority or refrains from performing those duties, such absence or refraining being deliberate and unauthorised. That means that if a man absents himself from duty deliberately and without authority, and if that man has given say 20, 25 or 30 years' pensionable service, he wipes out all his service, even <Col N="1235" /> though, as far as I can gather, it does not say that he will be removed from the service.  He may come back again after being a day or a few hours absent.  He can go back to his job, but for pension purposes, his 20, 25 or 30 years' service is cancelled.  That is entirely unfair and altogether too great a punishment for what might possibly be a small offence at the most.</P>
    <P>It may be said that this provision was drawn from the Civil Service (Superannuation) Act that was passed some 100 years ago or thereabouts. Here, however, is a strange thing.  In the 1948 Act, this same provision was enacted.  I do not know how it came to be passed at that time, but the fact is that it was.  I have not looked up the records to see whether or not there was any objection to it.  However, the point is that it applied both to officers and servants.  Now, it is dropped, so far as servants are concerned.  One can see the reason for that.  The servants are generally organised in very strong trade unions.  They can go on strike.  There is nothing to prevent them from doing so.  Their previous service, when they go on strike, is not cancelled.  They may absent themselves without authority and their previous service is not cancelled.  However, this penal clause remains so far as the officer is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am acquainted very closely with another teachers' pension scheme, the scheme for national teachers.  Teachers not only in this country but in other countries go on strike occasionally&mdash; but only for very sound or strong reasons.  The national teachers went on a one-day strike as far back as October, 1918, under the British. Senators will, perhaps, be surprised to hear that not only did the British authorities not penalise the teachers for that one day's absence by cancelling their previous pensionable service, or even cancelling their service for that particular day, but they actually paid them their salary for the day they were on strike and allowed their pension for that day, too.  There was another one-day strike in 1933.  On that occasion, the salary and the pensionable service was stopped, but only for that one particular day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1236" /> As Senators know, there was a much longer strike by the Dublin teachers in 1946.  It lasted for eight months.  There was no question of cancelling their previous pensionable service.  They lost their salary and pension in respect of the period they were out on strike, and no one complains about that, but there was no question of cancelling the previous service they had earned. That was credited to them when they got back to work.</P>
    <P>Let us take an example to see how this will work.  Take, for instance, a teacher or other officer&mdash;I am more acquainted with the teachers' pensions and that is why I mention them.  Take a man who has a dog running in the Kingdom Cup or at Clounanna. Because his C.E.O. or his headmaster is not on the best of terms with him, he does not ask his permission to go, because he knows he would not get it. He goes and is away for two days without authority.  Then he comes back.  According to this paragraph that man&mdash;because he has gone without authority and gone deliberately&mdash; has his whole previous service, which may be 20, 25 or 30 years, cancelled.</P>
    <P>I am wondering how it operates. What happens?  The man comes back to work again.  When is he told, for instance, that it is cancelled?  There is a record of absences, I suppose, but it may be only in ten or 15 years' time when he comes to get his pension that he finds out that his period of service has been cancelled.  There is nothing in the Bill to show how it operates.  It just says there in black and white that his service is cancelled. Even though there may never be a necessity for vocational teachers to go on strike, they are a trade union and are entitled to go on strike, if they feel they have no other remedy to right their grievances.  But suppose they do not, you may have this happening: you may have a strike by the servants attached to a particular institution, say, like Rathmines Technical School, or one of the big schools, and are the teachers then expected to break the picket?  It is a well-known trade union principle that one trade union body will not go through a picket when <Col N="1237" /> there is a strike by another trade union body.</P>
    <P>This may happen: laboratory attendants, or caretakers, or somebody else may be on strike, as they are entitled to be, and there is no penalisation of them, if they go on strike.  Their previous service is not cancelled.  But one of the teachers in the school may be asked to do something which those men were doing, and he may say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No, it is not my job.&rdquo;  Therefore he refrains, and by so refraining, renders himself liable to have all his previous service cancelled.</P>
    <P>The Minister says it does not happen, but I have mentioned cases in which it could happen.  In any case, if it does not happen, why is the provision there, held over the officers' heads as a threat?  I think it is quite wrong and something that should not appear.  I cannot see the purpose of it.</P>
    <P>There is another thing that is unusual in the case of officers especially, something that says that they must, at the end of their service, have been working with diligence and fidelity, and if they have not, their pension can be reduced, or possibly stopped altogether. These are peculiar conditions to appear in a pension scheme.  If a man is not giving proper service, there is a way of dealing with him&mdash;penalise him by stopping his increments or his salary, and finally, if he continues to be unsatisfactory, sack him, but do not say: &ldquo;You can continue to work away as you always have been working, but, because you were absent for two days or a couple of days all your previous service is gone.&rdquo;  That is not right.  I appeal to the Minister, who I know is a man with a lot of fine commonsense and a realist, and who, I believe, will see that this is something in the nature of degrading men in the position of officers, not only teachers, under this measure.  I would press as strongly as I can that he should drop that condition. There is nothing to be gained by it, and I do not believe there is any member of this House or the other House who would object if it were dropped.  As I say, I most strongly appeal to him to drop that offensive sub-section (f) in the Bill and those others I mentioned.</P>

      <P>I should like very briefly to support the remarks of Senator O'Connell.  The Bill is a good one in many respects, but Section 10, sub-section (f) does seem to be rather a dangerous section.  The whole thing is better discussed on the Committee Stage, and for that reason I will content myself with simply urging the Minister to look into that section particularly, before the Committee Stage is reached.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill as a further attempt to improve local Government law.  I do not intend to speak at any length on the matter, more than to point out that there is one particular improvement that certainly appeals to me.  That is the provision made by which an employee entitled to a lump sum may provide for a pension for his dependents in the event of death by surrendering part of that lump sum.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Connell that there are many points in the Bill in which it could be improved, but as far as that is concerned this is a case of legislation where we will have quite a big number of people satisfied and a big number dissatisfied.  As far as vocational teachers are concerned, I would agree with him that they should come in a separate category, because they are not employees of a local body in the same sense as the other different departments of county councils.  The vocational education system is operated by a committee set up at the inaugural meeting of the county council after its election and that committee functions during the lifetime of the county council.  Of course it is quite true that, out of the rates, a substantial sum is provided for the financing of the vocational education scheme, and county councils now, with the consent of the Minister, are empowered to expend 1/3 in the £ on vocational education.  I am quite satisfied that this Bill, if given speedy enactment&mdash;and I hope it will, so as to carry out the Minister's wish and bring it into operation on the 1st April&mdash;will certainly bring benefits to a very large section of the people concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has gone out of his way to remedy the defect in former Local <Col N="1239" /> Government Acts that many of us had reason to refer to, namely, legislation by reference.  It would need quite an amount of research which many representatives in the Dáil and Seanad had not an opportunity to carry out before one could familiarise oneself with other Local Government measures that have come before this and the other House.  So far as this Bill is concerned, with the White Paper issued with it on the first occasion, personally I did not find much difficulty in analysing it and familiarising myself with what it purports to do.  I congratulate the Minister on its introduction and I hope that it will get a speedy enactment.</P>

      <P>I should like to join other Senators who have welcomed this Bill, but I should like to say at the outset that, while I sympathise with the Minister's intentions when he asks us to give him this Bill before 31st March in order to enable him to implement it as quickly as possible, I cannot help feeling that, in a sense, he is putting a gun to our heads, asking us not to propose amendments because, if we propose amendments, the chances are that the Bill may drag on beyond March 31st.  I remember also that when speaking to us last year, on the 20th April, the Minister gave us some kind of promise as to when he hoped to be able to introduce this Bill.  He said in column 1190 of Volume 44, No. 13, that it was his hope that he would be able to introduce this Bill before the summer recess.  That was his hope and nobody will blame him for not having been able fully to realise his hope.  I do not want to suggest any element of blame.</P>

      <P>In that case, I will moderate what I am saying about the Minister and I will change it into a compliment, that he did, in fact, introduce it before the summer recess.  Nevertheless, I feel that, as Senators, we should get a better chance than here in three weeks to consider what amendments we think necessary and then hand the Bill back to the Minister before March 31st in order that he may with all speed implement it.  I think the Minister will sympathise with the Seanad if some of us feel that we would like just a little bit more time to consider it and that we should like time to have been given to us before now, rather than to have to force the Minister to delay implementation of the Act by taking up the weeks of April to consider it.  I with draw my reproach to the Minister for not introducing it earlier, but express regret that he did not come to this House earlier.  Probably through no fault of the Minister we find, conse quently, that we are more or less put into the position of either not amending it at all or delaying its implementation and also the benefits accruing from it to the people concerned.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Connell said he felt that this is more or less a Committee Bill but that he thought our hands were tied, because, if we try to improve it, we shall find we are imposing additional charges on the State, and will not be allowed to consider that kind of amendment.  He also said&mdash;I sympathise, and perhaps even more than he&mdash;that, for the layman reading this Bill, it was not always possible to know precisely what is meant, even if we read it slowly.  I would refer the House, for instance, to Section 50, sub-section (7), paragraph (b), which says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;in any other case&mdash;the appropriate one of such fractions (less than the fraction referred to in paragraph <Col N="1241" /> (a) of this sub-section) as, at the time when such sum or gratuity becomes payable, stand specified by regulations as the proper fractions for the purposes of this section in those cases.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have read that three or four times. It may, of course, be a legal necessity, but it looks to me like what is usually called Civil Service gobbledegook.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>And it represents existing facts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that a lot of the legal jargon which represents &ldquo;existing facts&rdquo; may lead one to deplore, not only the legal jargon, but the existing facts.  This leads me to another point&mdash;to put the question to the Minister: are not many of these regulations over-complicated? Is there not another background&mdash;a sort of feeling that somebody might be getting a halfpenny too much or a fraction of a year's benefit where he did not, in fact, have that amount of service completed?  Is there not overconcern for saving the halfpenny throughout this Bill in calculating benefit?  If there is any case of doubt, if, for instance, a person works for a fraction of a year&mdash;it might be 11 months and 20 days&mdash;then that whole fraction of the year is to be &ldquo;disregarded&rdquo;. It seems to me that in every case the State is very careful in drafting this Bill not to give away too much and, wherever they recoup, they recoup to the last halfpenny and sometimes even more, as I propose to show later.  Therefore, I suggest that some of this jargon is necessitated not so much by the nature of the facts, but because we are not prepared to have a simplified code which might occasionally be generous, and we are too concerned to be saving money all the time, and perhaps spending more money in tracking down fresh ways of saving halfpennies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer specifically in this case to Part IV, Section 50 and 51, which concerns what might be called the widow's mite&mdash;not what is to be received from the widow in this case, not the widow's alms, but what is to be granted with a great air of <Col N="1242" /> generosity to her.  It is a very complicated section, but, as I read it, it seems to me to mean that, if the pensionable officer declares before he gets his allowance that he is going to give up a certain proportion of it, then the local authority, in its generosity, will be prepared to give a similar proportion to his widow when he dies.  They do, of course, devoutly hope that he himself will live for a long time and that his widow will not last very much longer after him, because, although he personally is giving up this money, the State is not prepared to run the risk of handing out to her very much more than what he has sacrificed.  If he, for instance, gives up a portion of his allowance for the ten years which he lives after starting to draw his pension, the State contracts to pay for the rest of the widow's life pretty well what it had taken from the man before he died; but it is not prepared to take a very big risk.  This reluctance to take any risk is shown, for instance, in Section 50, sub-section (5), which sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A local authority shall have a discretion as to whether they will or will not enter into an agreement for the purposes of this section, subject to the proviso that they shall not enter into the agreement unless they are satisfied that the officer is in good health.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If there is any chance of an officer wishing to provide for his widow, and being so treacherous as to be on the point of death or to be seriously ill, and consequently having very real need to provide for his widow, in that case the State steps in and says: &ldquo;We are sorry we cannot give you this kind of arrangement; that is absolutely precluded by this section&rdquo;&mdash;that they &ldquo;shall not&rdquo; enter into such an agreement unless they are satisfied that the man is in good health.  I suggest that that sub-section is penalising the man for bad health, and penalising his widow, and is in conformity with the grudging spirit which I see throughout this section, which deals with allowances to widows.</P>
    <P>I find in sub-section (7) of the same Section 50:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may make regulations <Col N="1243" /> for the purposes of this section and the regulations shall be in such terms as, in the opinion of the Minister, secure that deductions from lump sums and death gratuities are, in general and taking one period with another, not less than sufficient to meet the liabilities of local authorities under such agreements as they may enter into under this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister wants to make regulations to make quite sure that local authorities will not be giving out more than they get in from the unfortunate man who is dying.  They do not mind if they get in a bit more than they have to get in, but the one thing that they want to make absolutely sure of is that what they take by way of deductions shall not be &ldquo;not less than sufficient,&rdquo; not merely that it shall be sufficient, but their one concern is that at all costs they do not give just a little bit more to the unfortunate widow, though they are being saved the lump sum and the allowance to the pensioned officer.  Again, I say that this seems to me to provide an example of the grudging spirit in which this whole section is drafted.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to consider also the position where the officer has not found it possible or reasonable to ask for such an agreement. The position of the widow in that case is simply that she does not get anything at all.  The local authority should recognise that it is under an obligation to a widow, other than what is provided by those officers who make this type of agreement.  It seems to me to be equitable that where a person by reason of his services, very often very long services, gets a pension from his employers, just as his salary is considered to be for the benefit of himself, his wife and his family, so, too, ought his pension be considered to be for the benefit not only of himself but of his wife, and consequently of his widow.</P>
    <P>Therefore, since the pension should be taken, in equity, to be also for the benefit of the wife as well as for the man himself, I suggest that, in equity, there should be a duty to see that the wife gets at least half of the full pension <Col N="1244" /> as long as she survives her husband. I say &ldquo;at least&rdquo; half, on the contention that a man and a wife may perhaps live together slightly more cheaply per person than the individual surviver will be able to do.  In those circumstances, I think that the widow should get at least half of the full pension for the period during which she survives her husband.  That would be a better and simpler system than this system of calculation and cross-calculation which is provided for here.</P>
    <P>There are three other points which I wish to make and one relates to Section 64.  In that section, we find that, &ldquo;where a person has been convicted on indictment of any offence&rdquo; and sentenced to terms of imprisonment or hard labour for a period of 12 months or more and at the time of the punishment is in receipt of a pension, thereupon the pension is cancelled and ceases to be payable, unless, under sub-section (3) of this section, the local authority, with the consent of the Minister, decides to renew the payment. That means that such a convicted person, when he comes within the Bill, is being punished twice.  That seems to me to be very much against all the principles of equity&mdash;that a person should be punished twice for some offence for which he has been convicted and has served the sentence imposed by the process of law.  It seems to me to be most unjust that such a person should be deprived of his pension.  It might be reasonable, of course, to recall that that person was living at the expense of the State in jail, but the pension is for the benefit of himself and his family, and his family has not been sent to jail.  I do think it is a monstrous injustice that his pension should be taken from him, if he has paid the penalty recognised by law and purged his offence.  I think the Minister as a lawyer would take a sympathetic view of this point and I appeal to him to take steps for the removal of this section.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to Section 17 and Section 22, both of which have been referred to by me earlier.  Section 17, at paragraph (a), says that, at the termination of his office, &ldquo;any fraction of a whole year will be disregarded&rdquo; for the purposes of pension. <Col N="1245" /> If a person works for the whole year, he is entitled to an allowance in respect of the whole, but under this section if he works only for six months of the year, then those six months are to be disregarded by the local authority for pension purposes.  I suggest that we should rather err on the generous side, which would be the just thing to do, and say that any fraction of the year should count as a full year. I think, in all equity, that that should be the position, and it is unfair that a fraction of a year which has been worked should be discounted for the pension computations of the officers concerned.  I think it would be far more just to count in any fraction of the year worked as being a whole year for the purposes of the Act.  The same thing applies to Section 22 and I suggest that these two sections should be amended.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make is in relation to that so well made already by Senator O'Connell and supported by Senator McHugh.  That is in relation to paragraph (f) of sub-section (1), Section 10, which makes a person sacrifice his pension rights if he absents himself deliberately from work. I wonder what was the attitude of mind behind this paragraph which provides that a man has to lose his pension if he has absented himself from his work for a few hours, or a day or two.  It may be for a trivial reason, or a quite important matter which has caused him to absent himself, and yet he can be deprived of his full pension rights if he does so.  It seems quite obvious that none of these officers can go on strike, for instance, or be involved in a stoppage of work, not necessarily a strike, but he may have sympathies with some particular idea or code, and, if he does find himself with such sympathies, he is running the risk of losing his pension rights. I suggest that that paragraph is calculated to encourage a craven attitude in our public servants, which I would deplore.  This seems to me to be a monstrous penalty to impose and I think that that paragraph should be deleted.</P>

      <P>This Bill is welcomed by most of us as an improvement on existing legislation, but there are still <Col N="1246" /> a few points which could be improved even further.  In the Bill, the Minister has differentiated between officers and servants.  In regard to the coming into operation of the Bill, it will be imposed on local authorities with or without their consent, in so far as officers are concerned, but it will apply only to servants where Part III of the 1948 Act has been adopted by resolution. Would the Minister consider amending Section 5 on Committee Stage, so that Part III would come into operation, say, not later than 1st April, 1957, in cases where Part III of the 1948 Act has not been adopted, and on 1st April, 1956, in other cases?  The Minister may remember that amendments to that effect were tabled in the other House, but were ruled out of order.  It would be very helpful if the Minister would again consider those points and, if possible, table an amendment which would ensure that the Act would apply to all servants, whether or not the local authorities pass the resolution referred to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know rightly if there is <Col N="1247" /> justification for the fears expressed by Senator O'Connell in connection with Section 10, but if there is, I must say that the section itself is rather complicated as, indeed, are many other sections. Even though the Minister was kind enough to circulate an explanatory memorandum, I must say that still there are certain provisions of this measure that require further clarification.</P>
    <P>If it is a fact, as Senator O'Connell seems to think, that an officer of a local authority, as distinct from a servant of the local authority, would be in danger of having his superannuation rights curtailed because of a stoppage in his service, that would be a very serious thing, because it could, as the Senator said, mean that all the years' service that such an officer had given to the local authority prior to that hiatus would have gone for nought.  It is such a serious thing that it should be given very careful consideration by the Minister before this Bill is enacted into law.</P>
    <P>There is another section which proposes to amend previous Superannuation Acts.  It is the section dealing with added service.  The Minister seeks for the first time to define the circumstances in which added years will be given to a person going out on pension. I really do not know whether that is an improvement or not.  It could well turn out to be the very opposite&mdash;a disimprovement&mdash;because the Minister is tied by having the circumstances set out in the Bill, whereas heretofore the Minister could exercise his discretion.</P>
    <P>I must say, of course, that there is a lot to be said for not leaving too much discretion in the hands of a Minister. It has been our attitude sometimes in approaching these measures to try to ensure that everything to be done would be set forth in the Bill and that nothing would be left to the discretion of a Minister.  But this is a case where I think the Minister's discretion would be necessary because it could well happen that cases would arise, apart entirely from what has been set forth in this Bill, when it would be right for the Minister to exercise his discretion <Col N="1248" /> and give added years to the officer or servant in question.</P>
    <P>There is also the question, as Senator O'Connell mentioned, of diligence and assiduity in the work of the servants. The question is: If diligence and assiduity are to be taken into account, who will be the judge when the time comes as to whether the person was diligent or not?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesOGorman" hpid="Mr. O'Gorman Mr. O'Gorman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Gorman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very comprehensive Bill and a very lengthy one. I had an opportunity of perusing it, but not to the same careful degree as my friend, Senator O'Connell.  I listened very carefully to the Minister's opening statement.  I was unaware that, under Section 10, severe penalties could be imposed on any teacher&mdash;that was the particular category mentioned by the Senator who was speaking about the matter&mdash; for breaking faith with his employers or his manager.  I was unaware that, for taking a day off without permission, a teacher's pension rights could be forfeited, even though he had served his profession and his country most assiduously for ten, 15 or 25 years.</P>
      <P>This is a good Bill.  It has been introduced by a Minister who, as Senator O'Connell said, is a realist and a very humane person.  The Minister understands everyday life in his ministerial and professional capacity. To me, at any rate, it seems to take the gilt off an otherwise perfect Bill that, in this age, such severe penalties can be imposed on people who, for perhaps 20 or 25 years, have served their profession and their country very well.  It does seem a pity that the gilt should be taken off an otherwise perfect Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt the Minister will look into the viewpoints expressed here by various Senators.  I want to refer to Section 17 with reference to the 1948 Superannuation Act which the present Bill proposes to amend.  In Section 79 (a) there is a provision for granting an increase to officials already receiving a pension.  The omission from this Bill of a corresponding section is disappointing. It seems most unfair that a superannuated officer should not receive the cost-of-living bonus which is being <Col N="1249" /> granted to his colleagues who are still in the service and which he himself would also enjoy if he had not been obliged to retire&mdash;usually due to reaching the age limit or for health or some other such reasons.  In most cases, an officer's retirement can be attributed to circumstances outside his control. The problem has grown in recent years due to the number of cost-of-living bonuses awarded to local officers.</P>

      <P>Most local authorities throughout the country are aware of the situation and some have considered resolutions requesting the Minister to make appropriate provisions. Members of the Oireachtas are also fully conversant with the matter and from time to time Parliamentary Questions have been tabled about it in the other House.</P>
      <P>The considerations regarding cost-of-living bonus also apply where adjustments in salary are concerned.  While it is appreciated that an officer could hardly claim adjustment of his pension where his successor is subsequently awarded a salary revision, cases have arisen where approval to a particular revision was not received until after the officer had been forced to retire even though the claim had been submitted and locally approved long before retiral date.  That applies particularly to many men in the public service throughout the country.  In my experience in public life, it applied to some clerks, urban councillors, and so forth.  This aspect arises in the case of older town clerks who had sought a revision of scale as far back as 1950 and when subsequently approved only operated from the 1st January, 1953. Officials retiring in the interim period were pensioned on the lower scale.  In my view, that is not quite fair to men who have given a lifetime of service to the public throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can all well appreciate the understandable demand for a reduction in local taxation at the moment. Personally, I am of the opinion that it has soared to heights which it is beyond the capacity of the ordinary <Col N="1250" /> man in the street to cope with.  There can be little fear of my opposition to remedial measures such as this.  On moral grounds alone, I am firmly convinced that a man who has devoted a lifetime to local service is entitled to a just and fair reward.  The cost in this case would be very slender.  In my opinion it would not amount to a great deal.  Time takes its toll.  Death intervenes. Looking back over the past 15 or 20 years, we see that when men of that type get their pension they usually pass out in the course of five or six years.  I would ask the Minister to take the necessary steps to remedy this matter as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House. There are many other points but I know they will be dealt with by other Senators in the course of the debate. I again appeal to the Minister to give favourable consideration to the points I have made.  If he does, then many public officials who have given a lifetime of service to local government throughout the country, particularly since the inception of the State, will be very grateful to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBergin" hpid="Mr. Bergin Mr. Bergin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bergin</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say quite frankly that I am disappointed with the Bill. I am glad it has been introduced because it indicates that a certain amount of thought&mdash;I suppose a great deal of thought&mdash;has been given to the provision of pensions for a very lowly paid and very much maligned section of the community.  The fact that such thought has been given is, of course, good.</P>
      <P>The Bill purports to improve the 1948 Act and it goes a little bit of the way.  My major disagreement is that it goes such a little bit of the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senator O'Connell and other Senators who have spoken before me, my first disappointment relates to Section 10 (1) (f)&mdash;the strike clause, as I would call it.  When I read it first, it seemed not unreasonable, but, later, it seemed to me that it was designed to prevent officers of a local authority from going on strike.  In modern times, the right to strike is recognised.  We recognise that right and the collective bargaining that is a feature of modern employer-worker relationships.  A group of men may collectively, on the instruction <Col N="1251" /> of the trade union, withdraw their labour or service for a certain specified period in order to win certain rights to which they feel they are entitled.  A section that takes away maybe half a lifetime's service from a man because he exercises that right to go on strike in an organised way is, to me, reminiscent of 1913 and of &ldquo;Murphyism&rdquo;. Suppose that a man over a long period absents himself from work without a reason, he is more or less resigned, but, if he does that, he is not penalised and his service is not withdrawn. In my opinion, this section does nothing but threaten people that, if they organise and take the next logical step in the case of any injustice, go on strike, their service will be withdrawn. I appeal to the Minister to bring the local authorities into line with modern thinking in these matters and to withdraw that section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>One other thing I am disappointed in is the percentage of wage contribution a servant will have to make.  The biggest section is the road workers who are notoriously lowly paid.  There is only one other section of men in the community, farm workers, who are paid more lowly than the road workers. The average wage at the present time of road workers would be about £5. They do not work full time, of course, or for the full year, as the Minister admitted when he read his explanatory memorandum in his introductory speech.  They are paid once a fortnight as a rule, and their contribution to the pension scheme will be 4/2 a week or 8/4 from the fortnightly cheque.  That, added to the ordinary social insurance contributions, will be a sizeable deduction from the wage packet, and the take-home wages would be very small indeed.  I suppose that at this stage there is very little that can be done, but I appeal to the Minister to have it provided, where it is thought necessary, that there will be some reduction in the percentage of contribution for those lowly paid workers.  Such a reduction would be a great encouragement to more workers to insure themselves for their old age.</P>
    <P>Another major disappointment is that the Bill is still an adoptive Bill. <Col N="1252" /> As Senator Miss Davidson says, we in the Labour Party, in particular, would feel far happier if it were not left to the discretion of each local authority to use it or not.  I think it is bad enough to have local authorities, perhaps in two counties adjoining each other and in some cases with the same manager, paying road workers different rates of pay.  For example, in Carlow and Kildare, groups of workers meet at the boundary on construction works, and the men from Kildare have a higher rate than the men working with them from Carlow, though their cost of living is the very same and the same man manages both counties.</P>
    <P>That situation is bad enough, but it will be far worse if we have groups meeting on the Border in which one section is provided with a pension and the other is not.  The Minister, speaking on the final stages of this Bill in the Dáil, said that he hoped each local authority would make use of it, but we all know that the Minister has no power under this measure to compel any local authority to do so.  Maybe he does not want the power.  He said himself that it was better to leave it to each local authority to say whether or not they could afford it.  It is a very good job, to my mind, that the Minister for Health did not take the same point of view when introducing the Health Bill.</P>
    <P>One other point was made, I think, by Senator Hawkins, about the notification of entry on the register of service. The Minister pointed out that notification for officers is fairly clear in the Bill, which says that officers will be notified within one month, I think, of the date of the insertion of their names on the register, but, in the case of servants, there appears to be no such notification at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBergin" hpid="Mr. Bergin Mr. Bergin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bergin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought it was more important to have, say, road workers notified than a clerk, because, in the first place, a clerk is in a position to have easy access to the register to be kept in the centre of administration, but the road worker may be working constantly many miles away and will have very little chance of finding out whether he is on the register.  I recommend to the Minister that he would amend that.</P>
      <P>I should also like to make a plea on behalf of the ex-employees of local authorities.  I do not know whether the Minister could possibly insert any clause to help them in this Bill, but, from my personal knowledge of those people, some of them find themselves in very sore straits indeed.  The pensions they are in receipt of are not sufficient at all to keep them in any sort of reasonable comfort.  People such as those, not foreseeing the grievous devaluation in money that has occurred, and knowing that they had a pension coming to them, were depending on it and had not made any other provision for their old age.  Because of this devaluation of money, they find that their pensions are completely inadequate. I would ask the Minister if he could give power to the local authority whereby, if it thought it could afford it, it could make more provision for improving the conditions of these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that, while I was reading this Bill&mdash;and it is one in which I am, naturally, very interested&mdash;I was reminded all the time of the great loss that working-class people suffered when the section of Deputy Norton's social welfare scheme to provide retirement pensions was withdrawn.  That section was deleted by Deputy Dr. Ryan when he adopted the same Bill and, to my mind, that was one of the greatest losses the workers ever suffered.  If that clause had been left in and the pension scheme had been carried out, we might very easily have one central pension <Col N="1254" /> scheme, which could be administered far more economically than will all the pension schemes spread through each county council and each employing firm and everybody else.</P>
    <P>Apart from that benefit, it would have meant that the State was carrying the responsibility from the Central Fund, instead of putting on to the local authority the responsibility of putting this big load on the ratepayers.  To my mind, this is a pretty clever piece of work from the revenue point of view, because the central authority knows that if the road worker, in conjunction with the local authority, provides himself with a pension, that takes away the responsibility from the Central Fund to provide him with an old age pension.  In other words, it is a relief to the Central Fund but a burden to the rate-paying public, Deputy Norton's scheme, to my mind, was an example of very fine, progressive thinking.  Under it, the thing would have been reversed and the load taken from the local authority and placed on the Central Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point which I want to raise, and it is in connection with registered servants.  A number of people in this class failed to register after the passing of the 1948 Act.  I understand that the present Bill will automatically bring them in, but I was just wondering if it would be possible to make the position retrospective, if they so desire.  I know a number of people who failed to opt under the 1948 Act to have their names entered on the register.  They did so because, as the Minister pointed out here to-day, the 1948 Act was a very complex measure and many workers thought that there were unexpected or unseen snags in it.  For that reason, they were rather cautious about availing of it.  Having failed to avail of that Act in 1948, they have lost a number of years' service for which pension might be paid.  I should like to know from the Minister if any provision could be made for such people so that they would be brought in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There might be some people who would wish to do that rather than to avail of the pension rights.  That is only one point.</P>
      <P>I should like to say also, in connection with the point raised by Senator Bergin, that I think that sub-section (2) of Section 30 is a little vague, inasmuch as a worker who is not pensionable ordinarily becomes entitled to registration under this section, if he has 200 working days in the previous year.  He can, on the other hand, opt not to be registered, or, at least, he can notify the local authority that he does not wish to be put on the register, but in the case where he is not informed as to whether he is entitled to be registered or not, I think there is a little uncertainty, and it would be right and proper that, in each case, such a person should be notified that he is not being put on.  If he is an employee of a local authority, he should be notified whether or not he is being put on the register.  He is entitled to that, because, as I say, the section appears to be a little vague.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole position in regard to this Bill is not quite as satisfactory as some Senators seem to think.  The burden, imposed on the worker, in the first place, and on the local authority, in the second place, is rather a heavy one, but, in addition, there is a good deal of inconvenience and confusion caused to local authorities, particularly in regard to men employed on the roads by the county councils.  It is of course the natural desire of every local authority, as a good employer, once a man comes on the register as a pensionable servant, that he should be kept there, if possible; but when we have regard to the fluctuations in the number of workers employed on road work by county councils, it will be recognised how difficult it is in many cases to keep those men on the register; and very often a good deal of inconvenience and a good deal of additional clerical work is entailed in estimating <Col N="1256" /> how many hours a man has got or how many hours he would need to get in order to keep him on the register.</P>
    <P>In addition, we have the position in which, in order to comply with the superannuation scheme, it is necessary to put men working on the roads into a number of classifications&mdash;to grade them so that those with the longest service come first and those with the shorter service take their place in the queue.  This grading of men, mainly for the purposes of this Act, does cause a good deal of, shall we say, bitterness sometimes, disappointment in other cases, and a sense that men are not being treated fairly, because, in many cases, if a man is lucky enough, during a period when there is a considerable amount of work being done, to get on the register, while he is still single, he will then take precedence over a married man in the same district. That does cause a good deal of confusion and rancour and, sometimes, a little bitterness.</P>
    <P>I mention those matters merely to indicate that measures of this kind, framed with the best intentions, do not always confer benefits upon all the people they are intended to benefit and often cause just as much disappointment to the workers concerned.</P>
    <P>As Senator Bergin pointed out, this Bill does impose a substantial burden on workers, and I think it would have been better&mdash;of course, it is too late to say it now&mdash;to have postponed this whole measure at least in so far as it applies to men not in constant employment, until a more comprehensive scheme could have been worked out to cover all types of manual workers.  It certainly does add very considerably to the burden on local authorities, in regard to endeavouring to ensure a high degree of efficiency in the road services, and also imposes an additional burden on the clerical workers in the offices in keeping accounts of days of service and in keeping the proper classifications of workers.</P>
    <P>We all recognise that a pension scheme is always appropriate to people in constant, permanent public work, but it is very difficult to apply it to such people as road workers, and there <Col N="1257" /> is always an element of injustice done, particularly to men who, from some temporary cause, may become unemployed and may have to seek work from the county council, perhaps only for a temporary period.  But, because of this superannuation scheme, they may find themselves pushed to the lower end of the queue and having to give precedence to people who have always been employed by the county council.</P>
    <P>I mention this particularly in regard to circumstances which can arise.  For example, if a local industry had to close down temporarily, a number of men would be thrown out of work.  It might be possible for the local authority to give them employment, but this superannuation scheme to a certain extent restricts the power of a local authority to relieve such conditions.  I know that this is a subject of more general rather than specific interest in regard to this Bill, but it is nevertheless a feature of this legislation that cannot be overlooked.</P>

It has received almost universal praise in this House, and if I take a line that is somewhat different from that of the speakers who have gone before me, because most people who have spoken have spoken on behalf of people who were aggrieved.  I propose to take a line on behalf of those people who will have to provide the money to redress the grievances of those who have been aggrieved.</P>
      <P>We are all very glad that these causes of anomalies have been removed and I should like to join Senator O'Gorman in asking the Minister that the very severe hardship that may be imposed on public servants for absenting themselves from work for one day without permission be reconsidered.  I think the principle should be that the punishment should fit the crime.  That is on the point made by Senator Bergin in speaking about &ldquo;Murphyism&rdquo; in 1913.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the position to-day is that <Col N="1258" /> the trade unions have become so well organised that we will have to encourage young men to go into private enterprise and to put their case against the strong trade union case, if they hope to be able to argue against the case made by the organised trade unions.  We all know the amount of courage and ability of the labour leaders which brought about the opposition to &ldquo;Murphyism&rdquo; in 1913, and maybe at the end of this decade, we will have arrived at a balance between the strength of the trade unions and the employers, but I think the balance is on the side of trade unions to-day, as it was on the side of the employers in 1913.</P>
    <P>The introduction of social legislation of this sort places a great burden on local authorities and it affects the bulk of the rates.  These rates are paid to a large extent by the small farmers, many of whose incomes, together with that of their adult help, are below the wage paid to agricultural workers.  We would all like to see higher wages paid to these workers, but I think Senator Bergin was wrong when he gave the rate of wage for the agricultural worker and the road worker.  The general rate as far as I know in the south is £5 8s. to £5 10s. and I am sure that, as one moves nearer to Dublin, it is still higher.  I know in the south and the east it is certainly higher than the figures he mentioned and I believe also that it is higher in the west.  It has to be remembered that the local authorities provide cheap houses for these people, and if these people were in Dublin, they would pay at least £1 a week more for the houses.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain the position regarding the 200 days required of an employee of a local authority to qualify.  I can quite envisage, with the very rapid increase in the rates, and with no increases in world prices for agricultural produce, that it might be necessary to employ fewer men in local authority work. What then is the position of a man employed for 200 days in 1956, who finds that the local authority is not able to employ him for 200 days in 1957, or possibly not able to employ him at all?  Will the local authority <Col N="1259" /> then be required to give him a pension, even though they have not been able to employ that person in subsequent years for the required number of days?</P>
    <P>Another anomaly I should like to see removed, and about which I propose to put down an amendment on the next stage, is that concerning rate collectors.  Their work in most cases does not occupy them for more than one month in the year, but they are being compulsorily retired at 65.  I know that in our county it cost over £20,000 to collect the rates, and I have been informed by people who have experience of running offices that the rates could be collected through the banks, or through central offices, for probably half or a quarter of that figure.</P>
    <P>I propose to put down an amendment urging the Minister to induce the county managers to retain these people in office from year to year.  I think it is a scandal that persons are pensioned off from jobs which they can do in one month every year and that their sons should then be given the same job and live in the same house as the original rate collector on pension.  These are not the sort of things that we want to see covered in a Bill like this.  I do not believe that Senator O'Connell or anybody else wanted to provide that type of pension.  What they had in mind was the provision of pensions for people who had given good service to the community.</P>
    <P>I propose putting in an amendment providing for the retention by the county managers or city managers of officers over 65 years of age on a year-to-year basis.  I think that will have a beneficial effect, because then the managers could retain men of great merit and let go those whom they did not want to retain.  In that way, they would be able to keep these people working and it would be a good thing, because, in a small country like ours, we must encourage people to work.  If we reduce the pension age to 60, our whole economy will fold up and we will not be able to exist.  To-day we have inflationary forces at work and to reduce the retiring age to 60 would increase those forces.  I think we must <Col N="1260" /> bear in mind the interests of the the common good and give some consideration to those who have to pay the taxes to meet these pensions. These taxes will have to be met by the small or medium-sized farmer in this country, who could find much better uses for that money.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill for its meritorious things and because it removes anomalies and hardships.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryGuinness" hpid="Mr. Guinness Mr. Guinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Guinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like very much to be clear on the effect of the Bill, from the financial point of view. As I understand it, the maximum pension which an officer can obtain is one half of the salary and emoluments which he received during the period of service, and, in the case of servants, they can receive up to two-thirds of their wages.  The contributions which they make are 5 per cent. of the salary and emoluments in the case of officers and 4?th per cent. in the case of servants. I have some little experience of these contributory pension schemes organised by corporations, and there, if the pension fund is to be solvent, a contribution of not less than 10 per cent. must be made by the employer and the employee.  I admit in this case it applies to the employee only.</P>
      <P>If, in the case of an ordinary contributory scheme, a 10 per cent. contribution is necessary, it would look as if the 5 per cent. and 4?th per cent. in these cases are inadequate.  The Minister, when speaking in the Dáil at column 395, Volume 154 No. 3, said that the total amount of wages paid by local authorities was £17,000,000, of which £9,000,000 was for officers and £8,000,000 for servants.  That gives us some measure of the pensions that will be payable in respect of these services. If we assume as correct that the contributions are inadequate, it follows that what we are really doing to-day is providing for future payments in respect of services rendered now.  I think that is a questionable thing to do, and, from the pension point of view, is seriously wrong.  Perhaps the Minister will clear up that point.</P>

      <P>Right.  I will content myself with drawing attention to it at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to thank the House for the manner in which it welcomed the Bill and for the very constructive criticism given.  I think it is but right that I should here pay tribute to my late Parliamentary Secretary, the late Deputy Davin, for the amount of work which he put into this Bill in the preliminary stages.  I am sorry he did not live to see the Bill enacted.  I should like to put on record in the Seanad, as I did in Dáil Eireann, how deeply grateful I am to him for the work he put in on the early stages of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I shall briefly deal with the various points raised by the speakers.  First of all, Senator Hawkins referred to legislation by reference.  There is no person abhors it more than I.  I have said that on many occasions, both in this House and in Dáil Eireann, but the Senator did not give careful study to this particular Bill for, if he did, he could not possibly say that this is legislation by reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fully self-contained Bill as regards all officers and servants of local authorities.  The only section in which you find references to previous legislation is where certain officers had the right to opt under previous Acts, particularly the 1925 Act.  This Bill incorporates the relevant sections, so far as persons still remaining under that Act are concerned.  That is about the only part of the Bill in which there is any reference to previous legislation. <Col N="1262" /> The Bill is certainly a completely self-contained one.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins also referred to Section 7 which deals with the obligation to maintain a register and the obligation to tell a person whose name is not on the register.  For instance, there is provision to notify officers of their entry into the register, but the Senator referred to the fact that there was no provision for informing servants. Some officers are paid quarterly and others monthly.  Salaries vary, but the servant is in a completely different position, as he is usually paid weekly. By merely opening his pay packet, he will know whether he is registered or not.  If he is not registered, he has the right to appeal.  His pay packet is the notification as to whether or not he is on the register.  No better notification can be given to a servant of a local authority than that.  I think that should answer the point made by a good many Senators.  Suppose a casual labourer is employed.  Nobody knows, when the employment is first taken up, the duration of the employment. Should such a person be notified that he is not entered on the register?  I think the pay packet, so far as the servant is concerned, is the ideal answer.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Connell raised a number of points which deserve consideration. He, first of all, referred to the word &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; in Section 11, sub-section (g) (ii).  I am satisfied that &ldquo;conditions&rdquo; will not be applied in any wide or penal sense.  The Senator went on to refer to vocational teachers. He would like to see vocational teachers taken out of this Bill and a separate superannuation code introduced for them.  The Senator is inclined to forget the very important fact that the ratepayer is the person who will contribute towards the superannuation of the vocational teachers. We must never overlook that.  So long as the rating authority is the person contributing, I am afraid we will have to bring it into a Local Government Superannuation Bill, whether we like it or not.  I am afraid I cannot sympathise with the Senator's suggestion in this matter.</P>
    <P>However, down through the years, there has been an association between <Col N="1263" /> the local authority and technical committees and between vocational education committees and local authorities. In view of that and in view of the fact that the rating authority are the people who contribute towards the superannuation, I think we must retain them in a Bill such as this.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to strikes.  The cancellation of service before a strike can be the subject of an appeal to the Minister.  The Senator appreciates that it is, of course, there for a very good reason.  I presume the Senator refers to officers, and not to servants?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>To officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose the doctors of Kerry, Limerick and Meath and all surrounding counties decided to have a day or two, or even three days, at Clounanna, what will happen to the unfortunate patients?  Suppose the nurses in the hospital decide to take a few days off for a carnival in Kilkee, what will happen to the poor unfortunate patients?  There must be something there to prevent these people taking serious steps such as those suggested by the Senator.</P>
      <P>A servant can go on strike.  It is an inconvenience, but it is nothing very serious; but one can imagine how serious the situation would be if a person such as a surgeon decided to have his day's coursing or racing, or to attend some other such social event.  I think that, if the Senator seriously considers the matter, he will agree with me that it is a good thing to have this method of punishment.  If they are not satisfied, they may appeal to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Senator went further and said that perhaps a vocational teacher might wish to take a day off, and that he might not be on very friendly terms with the C.E.O. who, if he were asked, would not give him the day off.  It is a very simple matter of taking that day and having it deducted from his holidays at a later date.  That may be done without any difficulty whatsoever. I do not think that one could disagree with the fact that a Minister will take a very broad and generous view of these matters when they come before him for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1264" /> For instance, a few years ago the cleansing department of Dublin City went on strike.  In the ordinary course, they would have lost their service, but they appealed to the Minister. He took a very lenient view and restored the service.  It is only in very glaring cases that he would do otherwise. An officer can have his leave granted to him retrospectively if he wishes a day off or, alternatively, he can appeal to the Minister if a C.E.O. would take such an unreasonable line as to break his pension rights.</P>
    <P>The Senator gave the impression that he had no remedy whatsoever.  That is not true.  He has (1) appeal to the Minister, and (2) a day granted to him by way of holidays, retrospectively.  He used the words &ldquo;diligence and fidelity&rdquo; with regard to assessing the pension rights of an officer.  The Senator went so far as to say that an increment could be stopped, or that he could be suspended or sacked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is for absence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, for absence. In my opinion, this clause is inserted to save a man from being sacked on such a petty excuse.  It enables the local authority to give him a pension, even though it is reduced.  It is much better to do that; it is much better to give him a pension for what he has done than sack him.  I do not see any harm at all in having the words &ldquo;diligence and fidelity&rdquo; inserted.  They ensure that a person will give diligent and faithful service to the local authority and, if he does not, he may be penalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authority.  So far as I know, it is an executive function.  I think you will agree that some person must certify that the man did serve the local authority faithfully and diligently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>He is completely responsible for it.  The manager is responsible for the service of every <Col N="1265" /> member of the staff.  It is he, acting possibly on the advice of the immediate superior of the individual concerned, who gives the certificate.  I think it is not unreasonable that he should inform the local authority as to how the man did serve.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington said he had not sufficient time in which to consider the Bill.  I can assure him that that is not my fault.  I did my very best to get this Bill into this House, not this week, remember, but last week.  I was most anxious to get it here.  I do not think I can be blamed for it.  I have no objection to his discussing this Bill for another week, or for two or three weeks.  I am merely pointing out the consequences. I do not wish to stampede the House, but I am thinking of the consequences. The unfortunate servants will not derive any benefit under the Bill before 1st of April, 1957, unless it is passed before 31st March.  I will not put any closure on the debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington also said that the Bill was not over-generous.  He said the local authority had an option, say, in the case of a man in ill-health, to refuse a gratuity or, rather, to refuse &ldquo;the widow's mite&rdquo;, as he describes it.  I am sure the Senator has some experience of insurance companies.  They are very slow to take on a life liability without first having a medical examination.  I do not think it is being not over-generous that, in a case such as this, a similar certificate should be sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington also referred to the section where there is forfeiture of pension or pension rights in the case of a conviction and sentence of penal servitude in respect of an indictable offence.  It is optional. The officer or servant may, on appeal after his release, have his superannuation rights restored.  However, it may be a continuing offence.  I do not wish to go into what such an offence could be or might be, but I think it is right that he should still have that held over his head.  The Senator did say that, once a man is penalised for a crime, the matter should end there and that no second penalty should be imposed; <Col N="1266" /> in other words, that his pension should be restored.  For instance, if he had been convicted before securing his pension rights, he would have been sacked without any right of restoration whatsoever after serving his sentence.  Here he will have certain rights of appeal to the Minister and of having his superannuation restored to him after his prison sentence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">

      <P>He has a method of disproving it by appealing to the Minister.  Senator Miss Davidson referred to the adoption of this Bill by local authorities.  One of the 12 points of the present inter-Party Government was that they would hand back to local authorities as much power as they possibly could and as much power as they had prior to the passing of the County Management Act.  Surely it is not suggested that we should now compel them to adopt this measure.  They have to pay the piper.  Let them call the tune. They have provided the money.  If they want to adopt the Bill when it becomes law, let them do so.  I am against compulsion, so far as local authorities are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Health is national rather than local.  Senator Kissane said the old method of adding years to service was more equitable than the present system.  I do not think so.  It is well that officers should know in advance the number of years which will be added to their service when they retire rather than that they should have to depend entirely on the imagination, I think, in some cases, of a Minister.  He should know in advance. Senator Kissane did not press the point.  He said it would be equitable in some cases, but that in other cases it might not.  I think this will strike a better average.  An officer taking up employment with a local authority knows when he will retire and the number of years that will be added to his actual service.  That is good, because it enables him to budget for his life after he retires.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Gorman referred to the question of strikes.  This matter is not one that primarily concerns me as Minister for Local Government.  The provision is not likely to affect the major officers, and most of the minor officers come under the supervision of the Minister for Health.  Of course, certain considerations apply, such as the matter of essential hospital services, and perhaps the Minister for Health himself may be able to consider the matter in the future.  In referring to strikes, all the Senators appear to have overlooked the fact that servants and officers will have the right of appeal to the Minister, and that right is enshrined in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Bergin said he was disappointed with the proportion which servants have to contribute.  I think that Senator Burke was the only person who referred to the fact that the ratepayer is the person who must bear the burden.  We must be reasonable about this.  I was a bit apprehensive about introducing this Bill originally, as I thought that there would be considerable opposition to it.  We are now in the month of March, and we read in the papers every day where the local authorities, and particularly the estimates committees, are now preparing <Col N="1268" /> the rate.  We hear outcries about the amount of rates.  Let us be reasonable; let us understand that this is going to have a serious effect on the rates.  I do not think I would be justified in lowering the contribution by the employee and increasing that of the employers, in view of the fact that the ratepayer has to pay.</P>
    <P>Senator Bergin said he felt the Bill should be obligatory on the local authorities.  I have already dealt with that point, and also with the point he mentioned of the person being notified of non-entry in the register.</P>
    <P>Senator Cogan mentioned that a number of servants failed to register under the 1948 Act.  I think I have answered him.  They now have the right to register under the present Bill, provided that they pay the arrears of contribution.  I think it is right that they should not be placed in a more advantageous position than those who did register.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke spoke of the ratepayer and wanted a definition of the &ldquo;200 service days&rdquo;.  I referred to that in my opening speech on the Second Reading here and have clearly defined what the service days are. They need not necessarily be working days.</P>
    <P>Several Senators referred to the fact that some former officials of local authorities were paid very small pensions. I will refer now to what I said in my Second Reading speech in the Dáil on this particular subject.  I quote from Volume 153, No. 11, 15th December, 1955, column 1674:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think I should say a few words about a provision that is not in the Bill.  I refer to the question of existing pensioners of local authorities.  I am well aware of the representations that have been made for giving these pensioners compensation for changes in the value of money.  I know that in the Act of 1948 (Section 79) some provision of this kind was made for certain pensioners.  However, this is not a question that can be considered in isolation.  Just two-thirds of the Ministers in the Government have direct concern with the superannuation of staffs.  Quite obviously if any <Col N="1269" /> change is to be made that will have to be extended to all of these pensioners generally the change itself must be general.  I have on a number of occasions told Deputies who have raised the matter by way of parliamentary question that I was having the whole question examined. I did have the matter examined very carefully indeed with a view to seeing whether it was practicable for me to deal with this question in isolation. I was conscious of the fact that the Act of 1948 did deal with it to some extent; but the position is that the Act only applied, to some pensioners, a concession that had already been generally approved of for some Civil Service pensioners in the Superannuation Act, 1947.  The Minister for Finance has already said that he will consider the whole question&mdash;the Exchequer is, of course, mainly involved&mdash;in connection with next year's Budget.  It is not practicable for me, therefore, to include any proposal in this Bill in advance of that consideration.  In 1950 when, under the Pensions (Increase) Act of that year pension increases were given generally a comprehensive Bill, dealing with all kinds of pensioners, was introduced.  In the circumstances, it would be quite impracticable for me to deal with local pensioners in isolation in this particular Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think I need refer to it further than to say that I hope the Minister for Finance will see his way to make an announcement on it later.</P>
    <P>Senator Guinness referred to the contributions of 5 and 4? per cent. and said 10 per cent. was the contribution for outside pension purposes.  I think the Senator was referring to the 10 per cent., which is a joint contribution of both employers and employees.  Therefore, it is 5 per cent. for officers.  I think he will be satisfied with that.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the House, as I said at the outset, for their very constructive criticism of the Bill.  As Senator O'Connell rightly pointed out, it is a very technical Bill, and more a Committee than a Second Reading Bill, and I shall be happy to consider the various points raised on it.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principles and details of this Bill, have, as the House knows, been already very widely discussed and, accordingly, it does not seem necessary that I should burden the Seanad by traversing at length the ground covered when I was introducing the Bill in Dáil Eireann.  I shall, however, be prepared to enlarge upon any particular aspects of the Bill later in reply to such questions as Senators may see fit to address to me.</P>
      <P>The basic principles of the Bill are simple and straightforward, but, as taxation is involved, drafting these principles into legislative form has resulted in some degree of complexity.  The basic principles may briefly be stated as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The Bill applies to profits from mining non-bedded minerals, which operations involve risks and expenditures quite different from those arising in the case of bedded minerals;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) As the purpose of the Bill is to act as an incentive, the benefit is given to new mining operations, while, at the same time, existing operators whose present business commenced in the relatively recent past are given the benefit of certain provisions of the Bill from now on but without retrospective effect.  To be eligible for relief new mining operations must commence production within the next five years, commencing on 6th April, 1956, thus <Col N="1272" /> providing an inducement not to delay development unduly;</P>
    <P>(3) The relief is confined to Irish companies.  The restriction of the concession to companies, which is administratively necessary, does not create any hardship, for the reason that it can scarcely be expected that persons would work non-bedded deposits of minerals on a scale of any magnitude without the protection of limited liability;</P>
    <P>(4) The concession takes the simple form of exemption from tax on profits for the first four years after production has commenced and for the next four years thereafter, a 50 per cent. exemption from tax on profits.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the underlying principle of the Bill.  In operation, income-tax and corporation profits tax will, subject to certain modifications, be assessed in the ordinary way as if the proposed legislation had not been passed.  The income-tax assessed for a year of assessment to which the legislation is to apply will, for the purpose of arriving at the amount which ranks for the total or partial relief, be reduced by income-tax on debenture interest, royalties and similar charges from which income-tax may be deducted and retained by the company in making payment of the interest, royalties, etc., to the persons entitled to receive them.  Income-tax on so much of the profits as represents the amount of the interest, etc., is essentially the liability, not of the mining company, but of the persons entitled to the interest.  It, therefore, does not properly qualify for the relief.</P>
    <P>The income-tax assessed, reduced by income-tax on the charges, is the amount of income-tax which the mining company would effectively bear were it not for the Bill; and such income-tax&mdash;called in the Bill &ldquo;net income-tax&rdquo;&mdash;is the amount which ranks for total or partial relief.  The amounts of corporation profits tax assessed for periods to which the legislation is to apply are similar in nature.</P>
    <P>The dividends payable out of the profits to which the Bill applies will be taxable to income-tax in the hands of <Col N="1273" /> the shareholders only to the extent, if any, to which income-tax has been suffered by the company for the relevant periods.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains in Section 1 the main definitions necessary for its interpretation. I do not think that I can, at this stage, usefully expand those definitions.  They are as clear as we can make them, but if anyone would wish, as I have already said, any amplification, I shall be happy to endeavour to give it.</P>
    <P>So far as the other sections are concerned, the only one I might make any reference to is Section 11.  Section 11 is the section which provides that a resident Irish company working an existing mine, as defined, may be given relief, computed on the lines laid down in the case of new mining operations; but the relief in any case will extend only to any balance, as at 6th April, 1956, of a period of eight years reckoned from the date on which the company commenced to work the mine. If there was, in relation to an existing mine, what is termed a &ldquo;permanent discontinuance&rdquo; of operations, then the commencement date would be the date on which operations were begun again after such discontinuance.  No relief will be given for any year or period prior to 6th April, 1956.  This is, of course, because such relief would be retrospective, or, perhaps, retroactive would be a better word.  Thus, where a company has begun to work an existing mine on, say, 6th April, 1952, it may be given relief for a total period of four years from 6th April, 1956.  For those four years, the company may be granted relief to the extent of one half of the income-tax and corporation profits tax which would otherwise be effectively borne by it.</P>
    <P>We had in the other House some discussion in respect of the difference between &ldquo;temporary cessation&rdquo; and &ldquo;permanent discontinuance&rdquo;.  I think it would be quite impossible that the present Bill would cover and grant relief in respect of temporary cessation, but the Bill does, in fact, grant relief where there has been permanent discontinuance. I should, perhaps, explain the phrase &ldquo;permanent discontinuance&rdquo;. It is a phrase that has a <Col N="1274" /> well-known connotation in the ordinary income-tax law and it will be that connotation that will govern the interpretation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill will act as an incentive to people who would be interested at all in mining enterprises to move along within the limited territory provided by this Bill to see what minerals there are in our country that can be gainfully obtained.  If it is successful&mdash;I believe it will have some success in that regard&mdash;then, I think, it will have fulfilled a useful purpose as an incentive.  I certainly commend it to the Seanad for that reason.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that the Bill is designed to offer inducements to people to develop the mineral resources of this country.  I think we are all in favour of the development of our mineral resources.  It has been the policy in this State for a number of years that every effort be made to develop the mineral resources of the State and the principles enshrined in this Bill are those which were enunciated in bygone days by the architects of Sinn Féin.</P>
      <P>It was the policy of Sinn Féin that the mineral resources of this country should be developed, but, while we are all agreed that it is very desirable from a national point of view to have the mineral resources of this State exploited and developed, perhaps we are not in agreement as to the best methods to be employed towards that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that I have rather mixed feelings about this measure.  As I have said, I am wholly in favour of any measures that would be taken by the Government, whatever Government <Col N="1275" /> would be in office, to encourage the development of our natural resources, but, at the same time, I am sceptical as to whether the method employed by the Minister and the Government is the best.  We are offering inducements to people to come in here, and, while the Minister may say that the measure is of general application, we know, of course, that this Bill had its origin in certain negotiations that took place between the Government and a Canadian firm of mining experts, and certain concessions&mdash;very generous concessions, indeed, I would say&mdash;are being given to these mining experts to come in and exploit the mineral resources of this country, beginning with, I take it, the Avoca mines.</P>
    <P>They are to get a complete remission of taxation, so far as I can gather, for a period of four years and a 50 per cent. remission for a further four years. I would say that these are generous concessions.  It would be relevant to inquire what financial benefit will accrue to the State as a result of the operations of this Canadian mining company.  It was mentioned in the other House that a sum of £2,250,000 is to be put into this work.  That is a large sum and the money has, I take it, been got through public subscriptions from Canada.  But, as I said, it would be well if we were in a position to know what financial benefits will accrue to the State as a result of this policy.</P>
    <P>I know also there is the question of labour, the provision of work in connection with these mining undertakings. If there is to be a sum of £2,250,000 as I think it is, sunk into these operations, it would be expected that the labour content of the undertaking would be very great indeed.  I do not know if the Minister is in a position to give us any figure, or any approximate figure, for the amount of labour it is expected will be employed in these mining operations.  I understand that in other countries this policy of giving a remission of taxation in connection with mining undertakings has been practised, and, I suppose, with a certain amount of success, but of course it can be said that <Col N="1276" /> what would be a satisfactory method of approach in one country might not be suitable for another country.</P>
    <P>I have already said that we are all in favour of developing the mineral resources in this country.  However, I should like to inquire what exactly the Minister and the Government have in mind in connection with Section 11 of this Bill, which deals with existing mining companies.  Am I to understand from the Minister that there is to be no relief, no connections, to existing mining companies, unless they embark on new undertakings?  Perhaps I misunderstood the Minister.  As the Minister stated, this matter has been fully discussed in the other House and I do not want to go into the subject in any detail here this evening.  At the same time, I should like to find out from the Minister exactly what concessions are to be given under this Bill to existing mining companies that have been struggling here for a number of years on their own initiative.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the length of time, the period, over which these tax remissions will be given to a company engaging in mineral exploitation in this country.  It is quite possible, of course, that a big firm like this Canadian firm&mdash;to which reference has been made in the other House&mdash;would bring in powerful machinery for a period of four years, enjoy the tax remissions that are to be given under this Bill and, if it suited them after this period, go away and leave the mine or mines in a derelict condition. I rather think it may be a better policy not to give a full remission, even for the first four years, but to extend whatever remissions are given over a longer period so as to make sure that the mining operations of this company, or whatever company or companies engage in the work, would be carried on over a longer period, from the point of view of the continuity of the work and also the preservation of whatever level of employment would be reached in connection with the undertaking.</P>
    <P>I welcome any and every attempt that is being made here to encourage the exploitation of our mineral resources. They are great national assets.  It is a pity that, for lack of <Col N="1277" /> capital or lack of enterprise, their development has not achieved the success that we should all like; but I want to emphasise that a good deal has been done already.  This is a highly technical Bill and requires very careful study which I hope we shall have an opportunity of giving to it between this and Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone will agree that the best possible thing for this country is the development of our mineral resources. However, the question has got to be considered now of whether the means provided in this Bill are the best means to achieve that development. In this Bill, we are giving a complete remission of taxation for four years and a 50 per cent. remission for a further four years to any new company developing our mineral resources.</P>
      <P>The first question that might arise in the mind of any Senator is this: Should that concession not be spread over a longer period of time?  By giving a concession for a short period, we might possibly encourage the worst form of mineral development, that is, a rapid exploitation of the resources of a particular mine and the complete closing down of the works after four years or, at the outside, after eight years.  What we should like to see happen in this country with regard to our limited supply of ores is that they be developed to the fullest extent, that is, that the ores not only be raised, but, as far as possible, be processed within the country also.  There is, however, no incentive in this Bill as far as I know for that continued processing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, this Bill provides exactly the same concession to a completely foreign company as to an Irish-owned company.  One would imagine that, if the taxpayer is to be called upon to make concessions&mdash;as is undoubtedly implied in this measure, because, when we are relieving a company from taxation, we therefore impose possibly a heavier burden on the taxpayer&mdash;our first consideration should be to give an added incentive to an Irish-owned company.  Whatever general concessions might be given, they should be increased if the company is Irish-owned. <Col N="1278" /> If I were asked to suggest what would be the best type of development of our mining resources, I would say, first, that it should be developed by Irish private enterprise.  If that is not possible, the second course would be by Irish public enterprise, that is, by a State or semi-State company.  If, again, that were not considered possible, then the third would be a foreign company in which there is a considerable amount of Irish capital invested, so that Irish interests would partly, own that company.  I would say that the last alternative would be a completely foreign company.</P>
    <P>It would be unrealistic to consider this Bill without having reference to the development of the Avoca mine, because it is generally understood that this Bill has its origin in the agreement entered into with the Canadian company for the development of that industry. As far as Irish people generally are concerned, and particularly people living in County Wicklow, it is a matter of pleasure to find that this mineral area is now about to be developed on commercial lines.  I remember distinctly that, when the proposals were first introduced in 1947 for the provision of a very substantial amount of public money, £85,000 per year, mainly for the exploration of this area, there was a good deal of scepticism in regard to the wisdom of that expenditure, and many people thought at the time the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, was throwing the Irish taxpayers' money down into a mine shaft from which it would never be recovered.</P>
    <P>In the following year, the Minister for Finance announced his intention to withdraw the grant for that particular purpose, and I was one of those who attended a protest meeting in Avoca to appeal to the then Government to allow this work to continue.  I am glad to say that the representations made by the people of that area and by the representatives of Wicklow constituency, and by other people who had the general interests of the country at heart, induced the Government at that time to reverse their decision and to make the money available.  There was undoubtedly a delay of nearly 12 <Col N="1279" /> months, during which very little exploration work was done, but the work went on after that, and it has now been completely justified.  The wisdom, foresight and courage of Deputy Lemass in this respect have been completely vindicated, and I think it is satisfactory that we find that the entire sum of £500,000 which was spent by the State in the exploration and development of those particular mines will now be recouped in full to the State.  That is something which must cause pleasure.</P>
    <P>But the concessions that are being made in this Bill are undoubtedly generous.  As I say, I would have no objection whatever to them on that ground, but there is a possibility that, in shortening the duration of the period in which those concessions are available, we may encourage the kind of development which is not desirable, that is, the complete clearing out of the mineral resources in the shortest possible time and their export abroad. It is estimated that it will cost the Canadian company £2,500,000 to develop this mine on a commercial basis.  At least, I understand that they are committed to that expenditure and to the employment of 500 workers.  In exchange for that, they may possibly secure a gross income of up to £13,000,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by experience.  The main point I want to emphasise is that this type of development is, as I say, the least desirable method in which to achieve a very desirable objective, the development of these resources.  The objective is the most desirable, but the method, viewed from every angle, is probably the least.  I do not think that the Government have been wise in <Col N="1280" /> their failure to ensure that this new company being established does not include a certain percentage of Irish capital.  It is true that the foreign company would naturally, in entering on an enterprise of this kind in a country such as ours, be inclined to control the industry from the outset. No one could blame them for that, but at least strong representations should have been made to them to permit of the investment of at least one-third Irish capital.  That would give Irish interests a substantial measure of control in this industry.</P>
      <P>Such a measure would be extremely valuable, because as I have pointed out, it is desirable not only that the ores should be harvested from the mines, but that they should be processed as far as possible in this country.  The Irish interests in the company would press very strongly for that processing of the ores, and for any measures that might make for the continuity of the industry.  Local interests involved, capitalists, industrialists or business people interested in the company, would be extremely anxious to ensure that the entire work of this company would not cease at the end of four or eight years, but that it would go on and, if possible, go on indefinitely with fresh development and with the establishment of subsidiary industries, based on the raw material secured from the mine.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the Government did not consider, in the first place, the offering of inducements, and strong inducements, to Irish private enterprise to undertake this work, and, if they were not entirely successful in that, did not consider the establishment of an Irish company, partly State-owned and partly owned by private capital.  In the last resort, it is a pity that they did not secure an undertaking from the Canadian company that they would permit Irish shareholders to own at least one-third of the capital of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not mentioning these things with any view to destructive criticism, but rather in a constructive spirit, because it may be still possible to rectify this mistake&mdash;if a mistake has been made&mdash;by ensuring that, if there <Col N="1281" /> is a further expansion of capital in the development of this industry, it will be provided by Irish capital, thus giving over some time in the immediate future a share of this industry to Irish enterprise.  That may be a feasible proposition still and I think that, if it is, it should be considered.</P>
    <P>I remember when this project of exploration and development was mooted in the Dáil in 1947, when the Minerals Act of that year was being enacted, the late Deputy Davin made a very strong appeal for the development in the future of our mineral resources by public enterprise.  I believe that private enterprise would be better, provided it was Irish, but in the event of Irish capital not being forthcoming from private sources, then I think it should come from the public purse, because I think nothing would be more important than to retain as far as possible control of this industry in our own hands.  I think it is satisfactory to know, at any rate, that experiments and the expenditure of public money have proved that our country is not completely derelict as far as mineral resources are concerned and it may be possible that, if someone with the courage of Deputy Lemass will undertake in the future further exploration work, even at the expense of the national exchequer, then we may reap equally satisfactory results.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the Canadian company proposes to hand back to the State the entire sum that has been expended on mineral development in the Avoca area.  That means that the Minister will have at his disposal a sum of £500,000 for further mineral development and I hope that that money will be used for that purpose. I think it was earmarked originally for the purpose of mineral development and, now that it has been recouped to the State, it should be used again in further exploration and investigation.  The scepticism that was displayed in regard to Avoca has been proved to be without justification or foundation, and there is no doubt whatever that there may be other areas in which there may be similar resources available, if we only have the <Col N="1282" /> courage necessary to exploit them.</P>
    <P>I think that what has been done is done and it may not be possible to revise it at the moment.  I should like to stress again the point that I have made that, if further capital is needed to expand this work in Avoca, that capital will be forthcoming from Irish sources rather than from foreign sources, so that at least we will be able to gain some measure of control in this important industry&mdash;even though it may not be absolute control, at least there will be a substantial interest in it &mdash;because I think it would be a pity to hand over and to continue to hand over control of such a vital industry as this to a completely outside interest.</P>
    <P>As I say, this Bill makes no additional concessions to Irish interests.  It gives the same relief to foreign capitalists as it does to Irish capitalists. That is a criticism of the measure, but, as I say, the measure was probably dictated by an agreement which has already been entered into and, therefore, it would be extremely difficult to alter it.  I think, however, if that were not so, this House should consider an entirely different type of measure in which the concessions made to mining companies would be not limited to a period of four years or eight years, but would be available as long as the company remains in production.  As a matter of fact, they should be encouraged rather than discouraged to go in for long-term production.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we hear it said that foreign companies are better for the development of industries here than our own native enterprises; and in this connection the development of the sugar industry in Carlow was cited.  I think anybody who knows anything about that industry knows that the foreign company that came to develop it was entirely unsatisfactory and had to be cleared out at the earliest possible date, and that they trampled on the interests not only of the producers &mdash;the farmers and beet growers&mdash;but of the workers.  I hope that that example which was cited will not be followed by another foreign company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I welcome this Bill and the principles enshrined in it.  I think the principles enshrined <Col N="1283" /> in it have been put there for the purpose of attracting capital development to our country.  I welcome it for another reason, too, because I hope that the concessions made in this Bill are indicative of a new outlook and a new approach generally to industrial development. If we are to develop further industries I think we have reached a stage where financial inducement has become necessary, whether the capital be coming from outside or from within the shores of this country; and that is one of the reasons why I also welcome what is in this Bill.  I trust that perhaps it will be an indication of what may happen in other fields of industrial development in the future.</P>
      <P>I confess myself flabbergasted by the attitude taken by Senator Cogan towards this Bill.  From what I remember, Senator Cogan comes from Wicklow, or from the borders of it.  If he does not come from that county, he at least always claims to take an interest in the constituency of Wicklow, and this is not the first time that I have heard him here and elsewhere speak on behalf of Wicklow.  I understand that not only will there be a very heavy labour content in this enterprise, but that, in addition, it is very likely it will result in the improvement and development of at least one or two of the Wicklow harbours.  Both of these harbours, though good, suffer sadly from a lack of modern development and, above all, they are in sore need of dredging.  Senator Cogan really put his finger on the matter when he used the term &ldquo;speculation&rdquo;. It is well known that mining enterprises of all kinds are highly speculative, because, notwithstanding all the modern ingenuity and skill, the persons undertaking these operations can never be 100 per cent. certain of what they are going to find when they get to work underground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to point out to Senator Cogan that we must remember that any wealth this country possesses lies in what we can get from the top six inches of soil, or what may lie underneath the soil, and I think we should all welcome this Bill as being the first serious effort at developing <Col N="1284" /> our mineral resources.  Should these mineral resources prove to be rich, it will benefit us, but should they prove not to be as rich as we all hope, we have lost nothing in finding that out.</P>
    <P>One other point, in conclusion, which I wish to make is that it is quite ridiculous to state that any such enterprises are likely to clear out after a very short time.  As regards the question of processing the minerals that may be mined in County Wicklow, or elsewhere, surely, if any company were getting such generous tax concessions, they would find it paid them to process the minerals here and to take their profit here rather than export the raw material and do their processing, taking their profits elsewhere, subject to the taxation of the countries in which the processing is done.</P>

It seems to me that we are making very big concessions, purely on the basis of an agreement, the terms of which apparently, have not yet fully been placed before the House.  Tax concessions, I know, are common enough in this type of enterprise and those which we are giving here are similar to the concessions to Canadian law.  I am also aware of the fact that, in defending the making of such concessions, the Minister is entitled to say that any other company could have come in and taken up the work.  Nevertheless, I feel that the resources of our country might be more courageously developed by ourselves, under a system of Government enterprise, rather than under this system which will syphon off, in all probability, a quite considerable profit from this country&mdash;although, as Senator Crosbie has said, we will be &ldquo;safe&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised by the two contradictory attitudes taken up by Senator Crosbie, because, on the one hand, he spoke boldly in favour of speculation, and, on the other hand, he said we were not risking anything because, if the company made a lot of money, we would have the benefit, and, if they did not make as much as we hope they will, we still do not lose anything.  I <Col N="1285" /> suggest that that is not the spirit of the pioneer speculator at all, and I am afraid Senator Crosbie was in disguise when he spoke of being in favour of speculation.  I suggest that if this is a worthwhile piece of speculation, and in so far as it is speculation&mdash;I think that the element of speculation involved is limited by the work of the prospecting company&mdash;in so far as there is speculation, I feel that the people who ought to do the speculation are ourselves as a community.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into detail in these matters.  I cannot pretend to know a lot about the detail, but I read with interest the debate in the other House in which Deputy Lemass produced a number of figures, none of which were denied, so far as I could see.  He mentioned in Volume 154, No.2, column 94 that the target of the company appeared to be the production of something like 1,000,000 tons of rock per year with a copper percentage of 1.12 per cent.  He estimated that while the company could not count on getting 100 per cent. extraction, it would get something like 9,000 tons of copper per year from that.  With copper at £240 a ton, on the basis of those figures the company would break even with that amount of copper production. But he went on to say that the price of copper now was not £240 per ton, but nearer to the £400 per ton mark. Consequently, he estimated, and he was not contradicted, that the company would be getting something in the nature of £1,300,000 profit per year tax free.  It would get that tax free for the period provided in the Bill, the first four years, plus the additional supplementary profits from lead, zinc and other products which might also be available&mdash;I will not mention gold, because that is being kept a secret.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass suggested that the Canadian company was going to invest initially something like £2,000,000 and he pointed out that on the basis of his figures, the company investing £2,000,000 would hope to get in the first four years, working tax free, a profit of £5,000,000.</P>
    <P>I have no competence at all to judge those figures, but I note that they were not controverted in any major way in <Col N="1286" /> the Dáil, and the position as I see it is this: the preliminary work of prospecting, what I would call the dangerous, risk-bearing work, was carried out in this country at the taxpayer's expense, and now that it has been discovered, at the cost of, I think, nearly £500,000 to the taxpayer, that there is a possibility of extracting valuable one from these mines, at that very moment, we say: &ldquo;Right; since the element of major risk has been removed, we now pass it over to private enterprise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I look back to the early days of this State when the Government closely allied to the Party represented by the present Minister had the imagination to establish the Shannon scheme for the development of our electrical resources. It was open to them to give the scheme out on tender to some foreign country and ask them to make what profit they could out of it.  They preferred the alternative method, the method of a State corporation employing a foreign company&mdash;the Siemens-Schukert Company&mdash;to come over to place their expert skill at the disposal of the State and to develop our electrical resources in that way.  I also remember that the Government was quite hotly attacked and that they withstood the attack.  They were undaunted by the suggestion that the scheme was a white elephant or a green elephant, and I think we can all recognise that, in the event, they were justified in the confidence they showed in the capacity of a State organisation to develop our own resources.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I regret that the present generation of the same Party seem to be lacking in the pioneer courage which was theirs in those early days, and which, I suggest, has been fully justified.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he would offer some explanation, perhaps, as to why there is this apparently new fear of State development. After all, it was not only electricity, but turf and forestry&mdash;forestry in which, I understand, the Canadians are also pretty big experts.  In these fields, we are still content to have development by companies entirely under our control, non-profit making companies, <Col N="1287" /> organisations or departments&mdash; for the benefit of our own people.</P>
    <P>I am aware, of course, that, in relation to mining, there might be certain disadvantages in the running of such an enterprise by a State company.  It would have the disadvantage of what might be called the Civil Service attitude of caution, of &ldquo;playing safe&rdquo;, the kind of attitude that lies behind this Bill&mdash;in fact, the fear of taking any major risk&mdash;and I would suggest that if a State company were to be developed along those lines of fear and caution, then it would not be as well run as if you had people coming in with a sharper incentive, but I see no reason why, as in the Turf Development Board, there might not be a series of organised incentives, not merely at the lower level, but throughout the level of the company, which, if it was well run with imagination and drive, could develop our mines, using foreign technical aid, but employed by us, and not merely requested by us to come in to remove a profit.  I believe that that would be of more benefit to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Senator Crosbie has told us that he welcomes this idea of attracting foreign capital investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Senator's correction of my grave misunderstanding of his words.  He said that he welcomed this method of attracting capital investment, and he was of the opinion that this type of speculation&mdash;and he praised Senator Cogan for using the word&mdash;was a good thing, and, although he did not use the word &ldquo;foreign&rdquo;, he did not say that he wanted the capital to be exclusively Irish, unless I misunderstood him.  I understood him to welcome the investment of&mdash;I am afraid to say &ldquo;international capital&rdquo;&mdash;but, at any rate, capital, be it Irish or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember Senator Cogan making <Col N="1288" /> what seemed to me to be a very apt point in relation to that.  He pointed out to the Minister for Agriculture, who when talking about wheat prices, had said that one of the dangers of having the price too high was that it attracted foreign speculators, that it appeared to be a very bad thing, according to the Government, to attract foreign investment into farming, but that in industry it seemed to be a thing to be welcomed.  The Minister for Agriculture did not reply to that.  In fact, he left the House. He was called elsewhere.  My hope is that perhaps the Minister for Finance might venture to give us some kind of explanation of the Government's philosophy in that regard, why they should cry out when somebody comes in to invest money in land, and why they should feel it is a very good thing, on the other hand, when somebody comes in to invest money in what is under the land.</P>
    <P>I should like him also, if he would deign to do so, to explain to us why it is that he and his Government are afraid of national enterprise in this regard.  He himself put a query to Deputy Lemass in the Dáil, as recorded in Vol. 154, No. 1, Col. 102: did Deputy Lemass want State enterprise in this case?  Mr. Lemass's reply was: &ldquo;No&rdquo;, that he himself had no confidence in State enterprise.  That leaves me wondering, on the one hand, just what is the basis of the Opposition's criticism of the Bill, since they do not accept the obvious alternative, and it leaves me further wondering why it is that all our Parties, apparently even including the Labour Party, have now suddenly become afraid of State enterprise &mdash; Irish national companies and corporations&mdash; to develop these resources as our other resources, such as electricity, turf, and forestry are being developed.</P>
    <P>I should like to offer, tentatively, one possible explanation and that is the consideration of what the effect would be upon the country, supposing the project went wrong; supposing the Government were to set up a State company and supposing it was to turn out in fact to be a white elephant. That would be a loss for the country, but I have a feeling that some of our <Col N="1289" /> leaders in the world of politics would be prepared to suffer that loss for the country.  More serious in their eyes would be the fact that it would mean a loss of votes for the Party or Parties that engaged upon such an enterprise, and I have a feeling that it is Party considerations that make us now so very much afraid to develop this on a national scale in the national interest. I would suggest that that is one point upon which Party interest is placed before national interest.</P>
    <P>The position, then, as I see it, is that the taxpayers of the country have taken the major risks of prospecting, and the mining company is now going to take the minor risk of exploiting, secure in the belief, on the basis of the preliminary work carried out by the prospectors, that there is a not inconsiderable profit to be made.  I, personally, would prefer to see a State company develop the community resources for the benefit of the community, employing necessarily all the foreign technical aid required, but maintaining the ownership and the control of the profits, if any, of this mining company here in this country.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I am opposed to this Bill.  I am aware, of course, that, by all appearances, it will go through, because the Government, in a sense, is tied to it by an agreement which, I think, one may recognise they necessarily had to negotiate more or less in private.  But I would like to ask the Minister one final question and I should like to direct his attention to this point.  I understand that this Canadian company intends exporting the copper concentrates to Canada and having them smelted down in Canada. It is quite obvious that this operation, from the point of view of transport, is a considerable one and that the actual costs of transporting this copper concentrate will be considerable to the company.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether in his agreement it has been foreseen or, if not, whether it is now not yet too late to foresee, an arrangement with the company, whereby an Irish company, a State company preferably, would be allowed to buy as much of this concentrate as would <Col N="1290" /> represent their normal use of copper in this country on favourable terms at the pithead?</P>
    <P>It would seem illogical from any world point of view to export this concentrate to Canada and buy back in the world market refined-copper, some of which, perhaps, has been considered; Canada.  So, I would ask the Minister whether this has been considered; whether the agreement covers it, and, if it does not cover it, whether he will give very serious consideration to the proposition of allowing an Irish company to buy at favourable pithead terms whatever copper concentrate it might require, and which it could have smelted down, possibly in Britain, with considerably less transport charges, if necessary, on a sort of drawback system.</P>
    <P>I would direct his attention, in this connection, to the figures given by our trade returns.  For instance, in 1953, we imported copper to the value of £768,000; in 1954, we imported copper and copper alloys, wrought and unwrought, to the value of £923,000.  You will notice it went up from £768,000 to £923,000.  In 1955, according to the latest figures, we imported not £923,000 but £1,232,000 worth of this copper, alloys, wrought and unwrought copper, copper wire and so on.  I am aware that not all of this could be represented by the copper concentrate that we might get on favourable terms from this new company.  But I feel it ought to appeal not only to the Minister for Finance but to the Government and the country as a whole as a possibility, particularly at a time when we hear so much talk about the unfavourable balance of trade and the regrettable fact that we import so much, it might be worth directing the attention of the Government to the possibility of deriving this extra benefit, if you like, from the agreement with the new mining company, and, in relation at least to the import of copper, cutting down our foreign expenditure on this material which is almost certainly in the next 20 years or so going to be increasingly expensive.</P>

      <P>My intention was originally only to ask the Minister one small question in connection with <Col N="1291" /> this Bill.  In Section 1, sub-section (4), I note that the section prescribes that certain matters shall be laid before Dáil Éireann.  For information, I should like to know if that is the usual procedure and that it is usual for the Seanad not to have information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other point I should like to touch upon.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington is my friend and colleague, but I think he has been unfair to the promoters and supporters of this Bill.  I think that, in being strictly logical, he has been illogical.  I will very briefly give my own opinions on that.</P>
      <P>I do not think it will get anyone any further in this House to suggest that the motive behind the Bill is simply that of Party politics.  I think the only way we can progress here is to assume that we are all working for the good of the nation, until, and if, it is plainly proved that we are not.  I think it is rather a pity that such an accusation should be made on a Bill of this kind. Secondly, I think it is foolish to be over-logical in matters of this kind.  It is quite true, as Senator Skeffington pointed out, that we object to foreign enterprise in developing the surface of the land, while in this Bill we are encouraging foreign enterprise in developing what lies beneath the land. I suggest that is what any of us would do in our own personal lives.  In some cases, we take a certain principle and act upon it, and, in other cases, we act on a different principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this stigmatising of the Oireachtas, or the nation as a whole, for being apparently inconsistent in a matter of that kind is pressing logic too far.  The situation seems to be that we believe we can develop the surface of our land fully and well by our own personal resources: we also believe that in delving beneath the surface we need help from outside. Surely it is reasonable and sensible that we should&mdash;even with the appearance of inconsistency&mdash;adopt different principles in that way.  If I may say <Col N="1292" /> so, I think that some of us who have been at Strasburg at the Council of Europe have run into something of that kind in the debates there.  We noticed that many of the continental politicians think in terms of a logical principle, a grand design, and everything must follow by strict logic from it, while, on the other side, are the statesmen and politicians who prefer to be empiricists, that is, to take each matter on its merits without being bound by any general, grand design and act upon different matters and different conditions in each case.</P>
    <P>I think that this empirical attitude, which our Irish representatives generally adopt, is the sensible one.  I think that strict logic and strict consistency in matters of this kind do more harm than good.  I should like to say that I personally think the Minister is doing the best in the circumstances in this Bill.  I think it will enrich the country, and I congratulate the Government on the courage they have shown in putting through a project of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to say very much on this measure.  I want to congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  I think it is very gratifying to find, at a time when everybody is talking about the desirability of foreign capital being brought into the country for the development of Irish industry, that one particular concrete example of it has actually come to fruit.  This Bill is doing what everybody is looking for to-day.  It is attracting foreign capital into the country, foreign technique and foreign &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; in order to develop our natural resources.  The philosophy behind the Control of Manufactures Act, 1932, has been, for all practical purposes, dropped to-day.  From the time it was passed in that year, it has been subjected to criticism and it has been regarded as being unduly restrictive in the development of Irish enterprise.  It put up, in some people's opinion, the price of capital.  I do not wish to go over the whole of that controversy now.  The Act did more harm than good.  That was the considered opinion of the Banking Commission Report and, on separate occasions <Col N="1293" /> since, the Control of Manufactures Act has been regarded as an impediment to the development of Irish industry. The whole tone nowadays has completely changed and, instead of foreign capital being regarded as something to be despised and rejected, it is now regarded by all Parties, as far as I can make out, as something to be attracted and something to be favoured.</P>
      <P>This Bill does actually attract in foreign capital and, for that reason, I think it deserves the welcome of this House.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been touring the U.S.A. trying to attract other industrialists to invest in this country. Important delegations of Irish businessmen have been abroad trying to interest foreign investors in possibilities of investment here.</P>
      <P>Here is one concrete proposition put before this House where foreign capital has been attracted.  A very large enterprise is about to be launched to develop our natural resources&mdash;an enterprise of a kind that requires not only a large amount of capital, but also a large amount of technical knowledge and technical ability, which is not at the moment available in Ireland.  Therefore, I think that to oppose this measure or criticise it on any ideological ground shows a certain lack of realisation of the state of affairs in the country.</P>
      <P>Everybody agrees that the country is under-capitalised and that there is not enough saving or investment.  To criticise a Bill of this kind which attracts in foreign capital at a time when most people are agreed that sufficient native capital is not being invested in Ireland is, I think, unrealistic, dangerous and harmful. Therefore, I think the Bill should be welcomed and should be given a Second Reading by the Seanad tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to give the point of view of an old Sinn Féiner about this measure.  It has been opposed on two grounds.  In the first place, it has been suggested that this is the wrong type of measure.  The official Opposition in the other House, and here, have taken the view that, <Col N="1294" /> while they are in favour of this particular idea, it is not being done in the right way.  The answer is simple. They had 20 years to think of a better way and they did not.  They did not even think of this particular way. They did not do anything about it at all.  This measure has been adopted now and they are flapping about in an endeavour to find something to say against it&mdash;and not very effectively.</P>
      <P>The other objection comes from Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  He says we should do this ourselves; in other words, that we should adopt State socialism.  There is a fundamental difference between the Shannon scheme and speculative mining.  The Shannon scheme was there&mdash;visible and measureable. We got it measured by foreign experts and, having got the measurements tested by other experts, we got a State scheme which is different from a State scheme for speculative mining.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not.  The Shannon scheme and the Avoca mines are different.  That is the point.  I left school about 50 years ago.  Before I left school, I heard a great deal about our mineral resources from my father, who had read Sir Robert Keane's book and was very enthusiastic about Irish resources and what was generally called the Sinn Féin policy.  In the past 50 years, very little has been done about that&mdash;and that period includes 34 years of native government.  Nothing was done like this.  It has been contended that this measure is not genuine progress; this is just in the realms of speculation, of course.  The State has already paid a certain amount of money for prospecting and there have not been satisfactory results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been nothing at all in the way of a result which could give us any indication of the extent of our mineral resources. There have been no starting results. There have been no results comparable with those which we hoped for and talked about long ago in the Sinn Féin <Col N="1295" /> clubs when we spoke of our natural resources and of what would be done when we got native government.</P>
      <P>Here is a completely new idea; here is an endeavour and a plan and a concrete scheme for bringing in a commercial mining company who have experience and machinery and, as Senator O'Brien said, the &ldquo;knowhow&rdquo; and skill.  They are a hard-headed people, unlike the Sinn Féiners, who are not inspired by nationalistic ideas and who are not working on any theory.  They have skill and equipment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have them still and I put them into practice, which some people did not do.  These people are hard-headed.  They have skill, experience and money.  They will spend their own money in developing these mines.  If they succeed, they will give a great deal of employment and, after a period of eight years, they will pay taxes.  Therefore, not only will they benefit employment, but they will create wealth and help the State and pay taxes.  If they make a profit, they will have deserved it, and they will have given us once and for all a genuine mining industry, with all the ancillary employment and manufactures which go with successful mining of that character.  If they fail, they will have lost their own money, not ours, and they will, once and for all, presumably dispose of the idea that we have really exploitable resources in that place.  That is a most excellent scheme.  Nobody else has suggested any other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the commercial exploitation of mines, it is obvious to anyone who has any experience of scientists that when they have something that is feasible, it is one thing&mdash; but it is quite different to bring business people on the spot and ask them if it is commercially exploitable.  A scientific investigation for minerals is not the same thing as the exploitation this firm will undertake.  As Senator O'Brien says, we should be very glad indeed that this dream of successive <Col N="1296" /> generations of Irishmen is being realised. We will certainly either have success, or we will know precisely where we stand.  Therefore, I am delighted with this Bill and welcome it. I think it should be approved by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that, to some extent, Senators have been talking to-night about two very important things&mdash;State control and the extent to which foreign enterprise should be encouraged here.  I feel that the actual Bill we are discussing does not directly bear on either of these two things.  The Bill we are discussing is, I take it, a general Bill which would apply to all mining industry.  It is an endeavour to encourage mining industry by certain tax allowances which would apply equally to a State industry or to a private enterprise.  After all, even if we were dealing with a State venture, it might be well to make a provision that, in the first years of its existence, it would be relieved of part of that burden.  In my view, the main subject that should be discussed to-night is whether or not it is a good thing to give encouragement to new enterprises by a relaxation of taxation in the early years.  I certainly think it would be a very good thing, and I would congratulate the Minister and the Minister for Industry and Commerce for bringing forward this proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that this beginning has been made, the same idea should be explored in other industries also.  To start a new industry is a very heavy task, and, particularly in the first years, it is necessary for the industry to be able to feed itself by putting on a little fat.  The Minister's idea in bringing forward this Bill is to introduce that conception into our industrial efforts, that is to say, that there is a possibility that new industries will be helped by reliefs from taxation.  It seems to me to be quite confusing the issue to go off into a discussion about State enterprise, on the one hand, and bringing foreign enterprise here, on the other.  As regards State enterprise, it does seem to me that, on the whole, whether by good planning or by chance, this country has been rather wise.  A certain number of big projects have <Col N="1297" /> been adopted as State projects, and apart from that, the effort has been to encourage private enterprise.  It does seem to me that that sort of mixed economy is probably a very much wiser one than to go out completely, either entirely for private enterprise or entirely for State control.</P>
    <P>As regards allowing foreign enterprise to come here, or attracting foreign enterprise here, I certainly think it is the path of wisdom for any Irish Government to endeavour to interest in this country people abroad who have capital and knowledge.  I have seen a good deal of the working of the Control of Manufactures Acts, and as far as my experience enables me to judge, the only real effect they had is to keep out of this country some people and some quite substantial industries that might have been willing to come here.  We were unwise in the beginning.  As I have said on a previous occasion, they were quite easy to get around, but the general effect has been considerably to slow up the expansion of this country.  As long as we retain by legislation the power of control of taxation, we should be as wise as other countries are, and very glad to see people coming in to help.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like very briefly to welcome this measure.  I do so because I trust it is an indication of progress to be made by the inter-Party Government in industrial expansion. We all agree on the need to create employment and to stem emigration, and, agreeing as we do on that, it is regrettable that we should be raising a hare about foreign investments.  I have read criticisms lately of this Government inducing foreign investments and foreign capital, and a comparison made with the absentee landlords. Where the comparison comes in is quite beyond me.  This evening in the Seanad, we have got a further objection to foreign capital being invested in this industry, and it is said that such exploitation and investment should be done by a State undertaking here.  My approach to this is rather simple.  I would, candidly, prefer to see the exploitation done by Irish <Col N="1298" /> capital, either State capital or private investment, but if it can be done or should have been done by these methods, why was it not done all along?  I am driven to the conclusion that it was not possible and not practicable, and that it was necessary to exploit and expand the industry and invest in the means decided upon in this agreement and this Bill.  Because of the reason that it will give badly needed employment and will create wealth here, I say that the investment is very welcome, whether it comes from Canada or elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I have been very interested in the philosophical content of the debate here this evening.  I was elected on the Commercial and Industrial Panel in the Seanad, and I do not believe that I am obliged to advocate purely private enterprise.  I think the Government is right.  It is particularly interesting and fascinating to see that a Labour Minister for Industry and Commerce believes that private enterprise is the best form of enterprise for a venture like mining.  He is no doctrinaire.  That is why he departs from some of the conceptions that have been advocated here this evening.  His approach is quite correct, even if you consider the experience that has taken place in some mining ventures in this country.</P>

    <P>In the early 40s, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, charged with responsibility and the desire to get fuel during the war period, engaged in State enterprise in raising coal in the Slieveardagh area in County Tipperary.  Money was poured into that venture, and eventually it was decided to sell out the Slieveardagh mines to a private company.  The result is that about twice as much coal is being raised to-day in Slieveardagh as was being raised there before, and very recently the owner of the mine was able to give a very substantial increase in salaries and wages to everybody working there, and in every way to better their positions.  It is well to see that a Labour Minister would not be tied by doctrine, that he would say he believes that private enterprise is by far the best way to work a mining venture.  He has <Col N="1299" /> the experience of the wonderful success in the case of Slieveardagh.  I only hope that he will be as successful in Avoca.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous to say that there were any Party considerations in a matter of this nature.  The whole idea was, as Senator Hayes said, to give effect to some of the things which Irishmen have been hoping and wishing for, since the beginning of this century.  I want to say here that I congratulate the Tánaiste on his foresight and enterprise and energy.  It is well that we have a Minister for Industry and Commerce like him and, as a business man, I am delighted to see that he has that enterprise and energy.  You want it in business and you want it in government, and you want it in every project that is going to be successful. He has given that type of leadership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bergin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill also, and I think the explanation for the method of exploiting these mines adopted in this case is that something had to be done in a hurry about our two national problems&mdash;the problem of unemployment and the problem of emigration.  This area had been examined and it was considered by the experts that there was a considerable amount of copper there&mdash;a sufficient deposit to make it profitable to mine the copper and the other minerals. There were two ways open to the Government to go about this job.  One was to appeal for Irish people who would invest their money in the venture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been said in this debate, it is a big gamble when you go underground for minerals, and I think it will be agreed that Irish people who have money are notoriously bad gamblers in that sort of venture; and I think it will be agreed also that, from the beginning, it would be impossible to get money from them without a guarantee.  Even if the State wanted to borrow money, with a State guarantee for such a venture, it is doubtful if Irish money would have been made available.  But, even if it were available, the starting of the enterprise would have been delayed very considerably. It always appears to take a great deal of time before the State can get in, and, in my opinion, the big necessity <Col N="1300" /> at the moment is to get started on enterprises that will give a large amount of reasonably well-paid employment. Personally, I must say that I would prefer if this mine were owned by the State, if it were to be developed by the State and if it remained State property.  That happens to be my philosophy in this philosophical argument that appears to be developing to-night.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">

      <P>What did your Party do about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBergin" hpid="Mr. Bergin Mr. Bergin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bergin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that State enterprise in the country generally has proved that Irish people appear to have a particular bent for that sort of enterprise.  As Senator Cogan said, when the sugar industry was started here, we were led to believe that only people from Czechoslovakia and Belgium could run the factories.  They did not last very long here.  They were found to be inefficient in comparison with Irish technicians, with people who had comparatively little knowledge and training in that industry.  In spite of that, the industry became a completely Irish industry, and at the moment is as efficient as any industry run anywhere else, and it is being run completely by Irishmen.</P>
      <P>There is one very good thing about this mining development, that is that, up to the present, we have had very little mining tradition.  It appears from old records that, not so many years ago, there was an extensive mining tradition in Wicklow, but for some reason or other&mdash;the people who knew anything about it having died, or emigrated, or gone away in some other manner&mdash;we have very few people here now with any knowledge of it. As Senator Hayes said, if we are to develop any further minerals we have, it is imperative that we train some of our own people, and I think this Avoca mining venture might well be looked upon as a training school for future technicians.  Not only that, but it will bring into this country machinery that can be used and knowledge that can be used for the further examination and testing of our deposits in places where we think they exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one thing I am worried <Col N="1301" /> about.  As things stand, the major benefit we will get as a nation from this venture is its employment content; and, if the development turns out to be as big a venture as we are led to believe it will, then we should have a great number of people employed in a variety of jobs.  I find that, when the Shannon scheme was started, it was considered that we had to have a very large number of tradesmen coming in from Germany; when the sugar industry was started, we had to have a very considerable number of tradesmen and labourers from Czechoslovakia and Belgium; when the cement factory was started, it was considered we had to have a great number of people coming in from Scandinavia&mdash;from which particular country I forget now. If an industry starts here, we seem to have far too high a regard for the skill of the persons who come from outside and we seem to consider that our own technicians and craftsmen are not fit to take up jobs.  I would appeal to the Minister to use every power he can&mdash;if he has any power&mdash;in seeing that such a thing will not happen in this case and that only the minimum of people will be imported for employment, because, if we lose the employment content of industry, or a substantial part of it, then there will be very little indeed in it for us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to the welcome that has been accorded to this Bill and to congratulate the Ministers responsible for bringing it before the House.  I cannot agree with the objection that has been taken to the introduction of foreign capital to develop our resources.  I am quite satisfied, if any body of Irishmen or Irishwomen got together and raised the capital necessary to carry out the exploration of our mineral resources, they would get equal, if not more, encouragement than that which the Minister is giving to foreigners.  I also welcome this Bill because it will keep a large number of people in employment and will make its contribution towards stemming the tide of emigration that is draining many parts of this country of the best of its manhood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mining, as we know and as has been <Col N="1302" /> pointed out, is a very risky proposition. It is a bit of a gamble, and when we find that there are foreigners&mdash;I do not care who they are&mdash;who are prepared to gamble £2,000,000 on the exploration of this mine in Avoca, I do not see why we should not give them every encouragement.  In encouraging them to carry on exploration there, we are helping to get some value for Irish money that has already been put into such development.  State grants were made available at other times for the same purpose, but the State could not afford to carry on that way.  Now that we have foreigners prepared to come into this country and to explore our mineral resources, I do not see why we should not give them every encouragement.</P>
    <P>As Senator Hayes has pointed out, it will satisfy some of us of the old Sinn Féin school as to whether there was anything in the theory we were led to believe in, that this country was very rich in minerals, but, because of our nearness and subjection to a country rich in coal and iron, we were kept under the heel.  This will be an experiment at least to satisfy us as to whether any useful purpose can be served by looking under the ground for wealth&mdash;wealth of a kind of which we have not found much so far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful, indeed, to those Senators who indicated their appreciation of the principles enshrined in this Bill and of its general provisions.  We had a discussion for the last couple of hours or so that roamed over some aspects that were not included in this Bill, and some that were.  There was, if you like, to some extent, a philosophical argument, or partly so as to whether it was more desirable to have this type of activity carried out by private enterprise or by the State.  I think one of the last speakers who spoke, Senator Bergin, gave the answer to that himself, although he went on to say that he did not altogether agree.  The mining of non-bedded minerals is a very big gamble. The gamble may come off; it may not. But the mining of non-bedded minerals, in any event, means that a great deal of money has to be laid out on the chance and on the speculation that the enterprise may be a success.  I do not <Col N="1303" /> think that gambling and speculation of that sort is a proper job for State enterprise, and I think that was not merely the reason why we in this Government did not wish this enterprise carried out by the State.  I think it was also the reason why the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, took the same view. It is inevitable in dealing with State money through a State board or company that there must be a more conservative and cautious approach to the expenditure of that money than there would be in the case of people dealing with their own funds, or the funds of their own company.  That, I think, is the prime reason which, in my view, would render this a completely undesirable thing for operation by a State company.</P>
      <P>Some of the Senators who have spoken have dealt at length with Avoca and to some extent discussed in this House, as was done in the other House, the position at Avoca rather than the Bill.  Noticeable amongst those were Senator Cogan and Senator Sheehy Skeffington who spoke on the Wicklow project in a manner which I could only describe as &ldquo;counting the chickens before they were hatched&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Let us be clear about this and about what has happened so far.  Mianraí Teoranta in their work found that there was a certain amount&mdash;12,000,000 tons&mdash;of copper ore there of very low grade compared with many of the copper mines throughout the world, but Mianraí did not complete the exploration work necessary for anyone to be able to come in there and find a commercial proposition.  The proof of that is that one of the fundamental terms of the agreement is that the Canadian company are bound first, to expend a further 500,000 dollars, roughly about £180,000, on further exploration work and if that does not have results, they will have to spend beyond that up to £450,000 on still further exploration work.  That means, in fact, that we still have a long way to go in exploration work before it is proved that the mines are capable of commercial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taken generally, it means that it is necessary for someone to expend <Col N="1304" /> money on further exploration work roughly to the equivalent of what has already been expended.  That shows that the enterprise is far from being a cast-iron certainty.  At the end of that exploration work, it may be found that it is not an economic proposition, or, rather, that it is not possible to proceed, and that, in turn, of course is dependent to a large extent on what will be the world price of copper.  On the results of that will depend whether it is possible to bring the Avoca mines into commercial production.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington stated that everybody knew that copper is going to be increasingly expensive in the next 20 years.  If he is right, he could make himself at least two fortunes at the present time and those interested in copper could make many fortunes at present, but the metal market is not as certain as Senator Sheehy Skeffington believes.  There are without question two views on what the price of copper is likely to be 12 months from now.  Expert opinion is divided on that.  It is not for me to come down on one side or the other as to what the prospects of the market are, nor do I think it proper for me to make any comments in respect of the possible profits that were enumerated by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  I must be quite fair to Deputy Lemass. Senator Skeffington was mistaken when he said that Deputy Lemass gave certain figures as his estimates of the profits.  He said nothing of the sort in the other House, but he was merely quoting some sales promotion made by other people, and the Deputy made it quite clear that, in expressing those views, he was giving them not as his own opinion but as from another source.</P>

The term capital dollars is a term used in exchange control.  If I were to give any opinion favourable, I might perhaps be inducing our own people to go into an enterprise that must be considered purely speculative.  Equally, if I were to offer a non-favourable opinion, I could, with fairness, be accused by the promoters of saying something that was going to prejudice the prospects of the development and the hope which we all have for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cogan started off along a lane and I am rather tempted to follow him down but I will resist the temptation.  I will not follow him into the reasons for the 1948 decision by my predecessor, Deputy McGilligan, in relation to the temporary stoppage of work at Avoca.  Sufficient to say that if my predecessor, Deputy McGilligan, had not had the foresight to ensure by his decision at that time that the royalties in relation to these minerals would be vested in the State, and not in certain individuals, I doubt if these royalties could have been reserved to the Irish people in this lease.  It seems to be extraordinary that there could be any suggestion of expending State money in the exploration of minerals belonging to somebody else.  Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, took steps to ensure that the ownership of the minerals would be vested in the Irish people, and it was because of that step that he, very properly, took at that time that we now have the royalties in this lease being paid to the State, if the operation is the success that I know that everybody on <Col N="1306" /> both sides of the House would wish.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington has asked whether we have made any arrangement in respect of smelting the concentrates here.  You cannot operate smelting economically, except on a large-scale basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was not that we should smelt, but that we should buy on favourable terms the concentrate and have it smelted, perhaps in Britain, on a drawback basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator had not been quite so touchy, he would have heard what I was going to say in a minute.  It would be utterly impossible to produce any type of smelting that would be economic in Ireland for the concentrates produced in Avoca.</P>
      <P>We have made in this agreement, as I outlined in the other House, an arrangement by which we can get back 50 per cent. of the refined copper from Canada, and I have no doubt whatsoever that that would, and will be, a better proposition&mdash;getting it back in that way&mdash;than that we would have any right, as the Senator suggests, to take the concentrate and use a different method of delivery to another smelter somewhere else.  Obviously, in smelting, the real advantage is to be able to get economic costs as low as possible by the largest scale production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the transport both ways to Britain would be cheaper than to Canada.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There are cases where that does not operate, Senator, and, even apart from that, I do not know, and I do not know whether Senator Skeffington knows, what smelting excess capacity there is in Britain waiting for the pleasure of receiving concentrates from here.  There is, I know, a smelter in Sweden that might, perhaps, be available.  I use the word &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; quite deliberately, because anybody who is operating the enormously expensive plant that smelting entails must, if he is to get back his money on that plant, keep it going to maximum production.  It stands to <Col N="1307" /> reason, therefore, that the person who has sunk so much money in a smelter will have, in making his arrangements for raw materials for that smelter, so made them that he will have no spare vacancy to take in other concentrates. If his smelter is not running full time, it is not going to be an economic proposition for him.  If his smelter is running full time then it is going to be a more economic proposition for him and the purchaser is going to get the benefit of the economic factors that are inevitable and desirable and realistic in large-scale working.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I know quite clearly this, that there is only one way of running smelting economically and that is to ensure that the capacity of the smelter is used to the maximum; that only in that way can one get the metal produced at an economic cost.  I know that any smelting concern which knows its business must operate on the basis of being able to ensure that it will be kept working at full capacity.</P>
      <P>The arrangements in this case are that we can get on terms that I believe are realistic up to 50 per cent., if we want it.  We are not bound to take it &mdash;we have the option to decide whether we want to take it or not&mdash;but if we want to take it, we can take up to 50 per cent. of the refined copper that comes out of the rock in Avoca.  I believe that is a far better proposition inevitably because it means certainty of supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> Before I leave Senator Sheehy Skeffington, he suggested that the Minister for Agriculture objects to foreigners in agriculture and that we welcomed them in relation to this.  The difference between Senator Sheehy Skeffington, on the one hand, and the Minister for Agriculture and myself, on the other hand, is that we like foreigners mining minerals, but we do not like them mining our agricultural land.  That is the simple difference.</P>
    <P>Senator Cogan suggested that there was a danger under the provisions in this Bill&mdash;and I think Senator Kissane touched on it briefly&mdash;that the people concerned in any non-bedded mining enterprise&mdash;I do not think he was referring to Avoca alone&mdash;would, by reason of the tax concessions, come in, do the job quickly, and skip away again.  The whole reason for non-bedded minerals being treated in a different way from bedded minerals and other industrial concerns is that they need the establishment of machinery and plant fixtures of such a nature as entail very heavy capital expenditure in the beginning.</P>
    <P>The big expense in this case is, of course, the building of the concentrator, which will cost £1,000,000, and possibly somewhat more.  Obviously, once that has been built there at the pit-head, it is going to be in the interests of anyone owning that concern to ensure that the concentrator in which his money has been sunk will be utilised to the fullest possible degree, because if it is not utilised to the fullest possible degree he will not get back his money.  That would also be the position in respect of non-bedded minerals in places other than Avoca and I suggest that anybody who reflects on that will agree that the real essential, if we are to get these minerals extracted, is to entice the capital to set up the heavy costly plant and machinery of the size necessary to do the job.  Once that is there, the inducement to go ahead is there and will flow from that.</P>
    <P>So far as the Bill itself is concerned, Senator Cox by his statement tried, I think, to lead me in a direction which I am most certainly not going to travel.  The Senator suggested that <Col N="1309" /> this was a good idea and that I should consider it in relation to other industries.  Let me be quite clear in regard to this Bill.  I have introduced it in relation to the mining of non-bedded minerals, because I believed that, in relation to those minerals, special taxation provisions were justified. I quoted in the other House the various countries throughout the world where that view was also prevalent.  I think it is a good view and one on which I propose to stand.  In regard to the other industries we must remember that there is the possibility of ordinary industry being given protective tariffs to nurse it over its teething troubles.  There is no such possibility in a mining industry such as is covered by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Kissane asked me to explain in slightly more detail the meaning of Section 11 and the manner in which it will apply to existing enterprises.  In respect of any existing enterprise, the Bill has no effect before the 5th April next.  In respect of any such enterprise it starts its currency as from the 6th April next, which is the first day of the next income-tax year.  I am not for the moment speaking of new mining operations, but where we are dealing with existing mining operations, Section 11 provides that we can go back to the day upon which they last permanently commenced mining.  Any part of the period of eight years that still has to run as from the 6th April next will be available for those existing enterprises to obtain relief under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The enterprises themselves, when they saw me, agreed with my view that it would be unrealistic that they should ask me for any retrospective effect to this legislation.  What I have done in the Bill is to provide that in so far as these future years are concerned they would get any benefit still to come just the same as if the concession had been operating at the time they commenced permanent business.</P>
    <P>In relation to a stoppage, the essential thing to consider is whether any stoppage was a mere temporary cessation or a permanent discontinuance. If A company started permanently in 1942 and stopped <Col N="1310" /> temporarily&mdash;I am purposely naming years that have no reference to any particular company&mdash;for a year from 1950 to 1951 and resumed after that, then that company's period for consideration under this legislation starts in 1942.  The period has expired, and accordingly, there is no relief.</P>
    <P>If company B started in 1942 and permanently discontinued its business in 1950, then having permanently discontinued in 1950, restarted in 1952, in that case 1952 will be the operative date which is considered for the purposes of computing the eight year period under this Bill.  In fact, I have provided in the Bill that the fact as to whether it is temporary cessation or permanent discontinuance is governed by the ordinary income-tax code.  That means that it would be determined, first of all, between the taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners.  If they cannot agree, it will go to the Special Commissioners of income-tax and if they cannot agree whether it is temporary cessation or permanent discontinuance, it will go on to the courts. I did not think it was a proper thing that I should take on myself or leave to Revenue the determination of whether a stoppage was temporary cessation or permanent discontinuance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If the company had permanently commenced in or prior to the 6th April, 1948, then it does not come in under Section 11.  Indeed, I think that none of the existing companies felt I should go back on that. They accepted the point of view that what had happened in earlier years was not my fault and that it would be utterly impossible, as a principle in tax legislation, to go back over the tax position as it was in previous years. Whether it is temporary cessation or permanent discontinuance must always be a matter of fact for determination in the courts, in the last analysis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had also some discussion about foreign capital.  I do not propose on this Bill to enter into that discussion in a very full way, except to say that all of us, no matter on what side of <Col N="1311" /> the House we are, would prefer, when something was to be developed and was to be developed as a success, that it would be developed by Irish capital, if Irish capital were available.  There is, unfortunately, not very much tradition in relation to mining enterprises undertaken by Irish capital.  One of the good things that I think may transpire as a result of this Bill and of the Avoca lease is that our people may become more mining conscious and that we may see more interest in mining operations than there has been for many a year.</P>
    <P>Both sides of the House will agree that there has been much more mention of Irish minerals, such as they may be, in the past six months than there was for many a year before.  If, on the other hand, we cannot get Irish capital to go into any industry, be it mining or anything else, then the Tánaiste, the Government and I take the view that it is infinitely better that we should get foreign capital, if it is available, and willing to do the job, rather than that we should leave the job undone or the copper still in the ground in County Wicklow.  It is much better to get the work done.  If our own people have not got the technical &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; and have not got the facilities, have not even got the capital or the desire to expend the capital on that type of work, then I think on all sides of the House we would prefer that foreign capital should do the job rather than that it should not be done at all.  On that basis&mdash;even though there are other reasons&mdash;I think we must all welcome the efforts the Tánaiste has been making to get people interested in exploiting and in developing our mineral possibilities here in Ireland.</P>

      <P>This Bill is a smallish Bill, in one way, <Col N="1312" /> putting on a permanent footing the legislation we have had on a temporary basis to deal with export smuggling. Members of the House will be aware that, when our customs code in relation to inwards smuggling was being built up, there was no necessity to prohibit any exports.  In fact, the prohibition of exports only became a real necessity during the period of the last emergency.  That prohibition was dealt with first by Emergency Powers Order and subsequently by the Customs (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1945. That Bill was for a period of five years and, following its enactment in 1945, was renewed again in 1950 for a further period of five years.  Last year, I asked the Oireachtas to renew it for a period of one year to give me an opportunity of studying and bringing forward a more permanent measure. The measure now before the House is that more permanent measure.</P>
      <P>I should explain to the House that, with one exception&mdash;the provisions of Section 7&mdash;there is nothing in this Bill that was not in the earlier legislation. Section 7 relates to the service of process under the customs code where claimants of seized goods reside outside the State.  While, as I say, there is nothing in the Bill, with the exception of that section, that was not in the temporary legislation, I have omitted in this Bill certain provisions that were in the temporary legislation. These provisions in the temporary legislation were necessary perhaps in the emergency conditions of 1945, but I hope that they are not now necessary in relation to the control of exports and, therefore, I have omitted them from this Bill, because, notwithstanding everything that people say from time to time about the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance, we do not like taking any more powers than we feel are really necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is framed on that basis.  It contains the minimum powers necessary for the effective enforcement of export prohibitions and restrictions. Perhaps I might finally add, in relation to export prohibitions and restrictions, that the Revenue Commissioners are not acting as custodians of revenue, so to speak, or in relation to taxes, as <Col N="1313" /> they act perhaps mostly on the inwards side.  They are acting more as custodians for other Departments of vital supplies which are necessary for the protection of the national economy. Therefore, I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. O'Higgins) Thomas Francis (Jnr.) O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. O'Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to eradicate the abuses which at present exist in the sale of spectacles and it is proposed to achieve this aim by providing for the registration of opticians and by restricting to registered persons the prescription and sale of spectacles. The Bill will not of course, affect the testing and treatment of eyes and the provision of spectacles by registered medical practitioners.</P>
      <P>Opticians may be divided into two classes, ophthalmic opticians and dispensing opticians.  Ophthalmic opticians normally test sight and prescribe glasses and many of them are qualified by the possession of diplomas issued either here or in Britain, to carry out these limited functions.</P>
      <P>Dispensing opticians do not test sight nor prescribe spectacles, but confine their activities to dispensing the prescriptions of registered medical practitioners or ophthalmic opticians, and for most of them this is a part-time activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there are no restrictions on the practice of optics and it is open to anyone to describe himself as a &ldquo;qualified optician&rdquo; or a &ldquo;qualified eye specialist&rdquo; and to go round the country testing, or purporting to test, people's sight and prescribing glasses for them.  People without qualifications have for years past been doing this and are still doing it.  Unscrupulous persons have taken advantage of the lack of control over prescribing and supplying spectacles and, by trading on the gullibility of the public have <Col N="1314" /> made considerable profits for themselves. I am quite certain that considerable harm is being done to people's eyes by these quacks.  Persons in need of glasses attend them, attracted perhaps by their flamboyant advertising and extravagant claims, and in due course are given glasses. The customer is led to believe that his eyes have been tested by a fully qualified optician&mdash;but in many cases the glasses which he gets are useless or harmful.  The assumption of spurious professional titles has not been the only undesirable aspect of these persons' activities.  Documentary evidence has been made available to me which shows beyond doubt that these itinerant spectacle vendors have been guilty of other frauds on the public. In a number of cases they have sold spectacles with plain glass lenses to members of the public and charged grossly inflated prices for them.  Other cases have also been brought to my notice of persons paying money in good faith to travelling spectacle sellers who failed to forward the glasses for which they had been paid.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that abuses of the type which I have mentioned exist at present and occur in such numbers that it is necessary to take action to eradicate them.  The measures which will do so are contained in this Bill.  It is proposed to establish a board which will include representatives of medical practitioners and ophthalmic opticians, a dispensing optician and a neutral person.  This board will be given power to establish registers for ophthalmic opticians and for dispensing opticians. It will be empowered to recognise optical qualifications awarded both within and outside the State, to organise courses of training or to recognise courses of training organised by other bodies.  In this manner it will be ensured that the persons who will in future be registered either as ophthalmic opticians or as dispensing opticians will possess the training and experience necessary to equip them to discharge their respective functions properly.</P>
    <P>Initially, of course, arrangements must be made to cover the cases of persons who have been practising as <Col N="1315" /> opticians in this country up to the present. A considerable number of those at present practising as ophthalmic opticians have been doing so ethically and satisfactorily for a long time and it is obviously undesirable that they should be prevented by this Bill from continuing to provide a service which has been found satisfactory in the past. There is, therefore, power in the Bill to provide for the registration of persons who at present have not technical qualifications but who, through the experience they have acquired over the years, are capable of satisfactorily working as opticians.  Accordingly it is proposed that there will be admitted to the register of ophthalmic opticians, on its establishment, not only persons possessing recognised qualifications, but persons whose principal means of livelihood during the preceding seven years was the business of ophthalmic optician, and persons who, during the five years before the board is set up, will have engaged to a specified extent in prescribing and dispensing spectacles and who pass an examination held by the board in these subjects.</P>
    <P>The first register of dispensing opticians will include persons who have recognised qualifications, those whose principal means of livelihood for seven years before the establishment date was the business of dispensing optician and those who, having engaged to a specified extent during the five years before the establishment day in dispensing spectacles pass an examination in that subject.  An additional class was added to these by An Dáil, namely opticians who on the date of introduction of the Bill were recognised by the Department of Social Welfare as competent to dispense spectacles under that Department's scheme of optical benefits.</P>
    <P>These provisions ensure that persons who were <i>bona fide</i> practising as opticians before this Bill came into operation will not be deprived of their livelihood.  I am satisfied that the provisions I have outlined are an adequate safeguard both to the public and to those at present practising optics.</P>
    <P>When the Bill comes into operation, the position will be that only registered <Col N="1316" /> medical practitioners and registered ophthalmic opticians will be allowed to prescribe spectacles.  Only these two classes and dispensing opticians will be entitled to dispense spectacles.  It will be an offence for any other person to prescribe or to dispense them, or to hold himself out as being capable of doing so.  The board is given power to make rules governing the supply of spectacles by registered opticians and is also given power to make rules governing advertising by them.  Standards of prescribing and dispensing will be established by the board and it will be necessary for all registered opticians to conform to these standards.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this Bill will achieve the ends for which it is proposed. It will terminate the abuses in the prescription and supply of glasses which are at present occurring and which I am satisfied should not be allowed to continue.  It will also ensure that the standard of prescribing and supplying glasses will be considerably improved.  It is for these reasons that I recommend it to the Seanad for a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench O'Carroll Dr. ffrench O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation which the Minister has outlined for us here this evening, that anybody at the present time, irrespective of whether he has any technical or professional training, is in a position to prescribe and sell spectacles, is, of course, outrageous, and it is overdue that legislation should be brought forward to prevent it.  Despite that situation, I personally do not welcome this Bill, because I imagine that if I had to make the decision which the Minister has had to make, I would have made it in rather a different way.  Personally, speaking as a doctor, I cannot see how the Minister can be satisfied that an ophthalmic optician is a suitable person to prescribe and sell spectacles.  The Minister, in drawing up this Bill, was in a position that he could decide that in future spectacles would be prescribed only by a doctor who specialised in this work, an oculist, or he could have taken the course he has taken, that the prescribing of spectacles would be left to somebody with a technical rather than a professional training, a man who, as an optician, would <Col N="1317" /> have a training course possibly of about three years.</P>
      <P>Now let us take the position of the two.  On the one side, there is a man who has had three years' training, who is a technician.  On the other side, you have a doctor who has spent six years in a university, a further year in a hospital before being even registered as a practitioner, and, if he is to become an oculist, has had to spend over and above that period at least five years and has taken one extra qualification at least, has had special training and experience during that time, and passed very difficult examinations in that work.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand how the Minister should decide, he who is responsible, naturally, acting in the best interests of the health of the people of the country, that, in these circumstances, it should be the technician with the three years' training who is to prescribe spectacles for the majority of people in this country.  &ldquo;Prescribe&rdquo; is an important word, because a man cannot prescribe, unless he can diagnose.</P>
      <P>The position is, under this Bill, that in future the majority of the people of this country are to have spectacles prescribed for them by a technician with some three years' training.  I think it is a very serious matter indeed.  I do not see how the man with limited training can be in a position to decide that failing sight is merely due to a minor error of refraction. I do not see how he can possibly be in a position to decide if there is not present the more serious conditions associated with the pathology of the eye which it takes long training and experience to be able to diagnose. I would suggest to the Minister that there is a very definite relation between technical men and professional men in the field of medicine, and in the field of health in general. There will be many other circumstances where this relationship exists and it has been worked out in an entirely different way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me take for example the question of the pathologist.  The pathologist is in charge of the laboratory. The vast majority of the work in the laboratory is done again by a technician&mdash;a <Col N="1318" /> man with much the same amount of training.  It is very probable that, in doing the routine work of the laboratory&mdash;what I would call the tests in the laboratory&mdash;the technician is probably much more efficient than the pathologist.  But there is one important aspect of pathological work which is left entirely to the doctors&mdash; the pathologists&mdash;and that is diagnosis. A laboratory technician may be a first-class man in doing the tests, in doing the routine work of the laboratory, but he cannot look down a microscope and tell you whether he is looking at a normal tissue or a tissue of cancer. And that is where the ability to diagnose and the training of clinical judgment comes into force.</P>
    <P>I believe the same position holds in regard to diseases of the eye.  I think it is absolutely wrong that a man with three years' training, who is not a doctor, should be in a position to look at somebody's eyes and tell them: &ldquo;No; all you need is a simple correction of an error of refraction.&rdquo;  I know it is set out in the Bill that the ophthalmic optician is prevented from treating people, but the position of diagnosis cannot be got away from.  Diagnosis is the whole point of the lengthy training of a doctor and the specialist training and the special qualifications which the ophthalmic surgeon takes.</P>
    <P>Again, we have the same position in regard to the chemist and the doctor. It is perfectly in order for a chemist&mdash; he is perfectly competent to do it&mdash;to dispense a prescription.  But a chemist is not in a position&mdash;and a chemist does not do it&mdash;to say to somebody who comes into his shop: &ldquo;You have a cough.  I think that for that cough the best thing for you to take is cough mixture X or Y.&rdquo;  He may volunteer information on proprietary preparations and tell somebody who comes into his shop that one preparation is used more than another.  That is all right, but, when it comes to prescribing treatment, he cannot prescribe unless he is in a position to diagnose.  I feel that the proper relationship exists between the chemist and the doctor; the proper relationship exists in medicine between the pathologist and his technician; but the most improper circumstances are going to be created here <Col N="1319" /> in so far as the ophthalmic optician is concerned.</P>
    <P>Why should the Minister take this course?  I expected that he would give us some reason for choosing that the optician rather than the oculist should decide in this matter of spectacles.  I could understand it if the case were put forward that people could not afford to have the opinion of an ophthalmic surgeon every time they felt there was something wrong with their eyes. But the Minister, according to his own statement, is in the process of introducing the institutional services under the Health Act and those institutional services will mean that, I suppose, 75 per cent. of the people in this country will be in a position to have free ophthalmic services in so far as a competent oculist's opinion on their eyes is concerned.  Why, in those circumstances, when we can give the advantage of a doctor who is a specialist in eye work to so many people in this country, should we pass over this whole question of the prescribing for spectacles to opticians?</P>
    <P>I do not say this in any spirit of jealousy as between doctors and technicians. I do not say it out of blind loyalty merely to other doctors or because this attitude has been taken up by the Irish Medical Association.  I say it from conviction, because I believe that, so far as diseases of the eye are concerned and so far as preservation of sight is concerned, nothing can be more vital, and it has been shown throughout the field of public health that early expert opinion on eye conditions is absolutely essential and is a basic part of the school medical services, as we have them today in relation to the care of eyes and teeth.</P>
    <P>I believe that where we set out in this Bill and give over, not only this work, but the control of the training of ophthalmic opticians to opticians under this Bill, the natural tendency will be for the vast majority of people to consult, in the first instance, an optician, where they have a headache or where they feel their vision is not as good as it might be, rather than a doctor who has specialised in eye <Col N="1320" /> work.  I would ask the Minister to put before the House what reasons prompted him to make such a choice. I personally cannot see them, and I think it is a retrograde step.  It seems to me, too, that the position of the dispensing optician is a very poor one under the Bill.  It looks to me as if both the ophthalmic surgeon and the dispensing optician are going to be squeezed entirely by the ophthalmic optician.  The constitution of the board is most unsuitable.  As I said, it is not a matter of prejudice or mere professional loyalty.  My view differs from the majority on both sides of the House.  The Minister and his predecessor are apparently quite satisfied with the Bill, but I fail to see why a retrograde step should be taken in this Bill and why services vastly inferior to what could be made available, in so far as the prescribing of spectacles is concerned, are about to be offered to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the necessary technical knowledge to follow the line of country of Senator ffrench O'Carroll, although I must say that, as an ordinary lay man, I am greatly impressed indeed by his arguments. That being so, I am also concerned, like Senator ffrench O'Carroll, with the position under this Bill of the dispensing optician, whom we may regard as what Senator ffrench O'Carroll described as a competent and qualified technician who specialises in the dispensing of what is prescribed by the doctor.  There is grave cause for anxiety by this body, this professional body of dispensing opticians, on their position under this Bill in view of the constitution of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill, the Minister does make provision that one member of the board shall be a dispensing optician, in both Section 5 and in the subsequent sub-section (10).  However, the method of election, as laid down under Section 10, gives grave cause for fear that, when this form of election comes into operation, the dispensing opticians' profession, in effect, may find themselves squeezed out.  It is my intention, therefore, and the intention of some of my colleagues to introduce, on the Committee Stage, an amendment <Col N="1321" /> to both Section 5 and Section 10, designed principally to ensure that this one seat should be held by a dispensing optician and by no other member of the three professions named in the Bill. It would, of course, be preferable if the Minister were to see his way to meet us on this and perhaps to introduce a Government amendment to this section.  Failing that I give notice that some of my colleagues and myself intend to table such amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBergin" hpid="Mr. Bergin Mr. Bergin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bergin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say just one or two words about Section 49 which deals with restrictions on the sale of spectacles.  I think the section is far too severe.  This is a personal opinion only, and I have not consulted my colleagues on it.  I cannot see why it should be made altogether impossible to buy from a shop the type of glasses used by very many of the older and poorer people.  To my mind, such glasses should be available to those people.  I was consulting some opticians about this Bill, and I noticed that they were all in favour of this section. I asked them what was the minimum price for which they could sell spectacles, and they all said that it was in the region of 25/- to 30/-.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is fair to prevent the poor people in the country from buying spectacles where they used to buy them.  Those were spectacles which were merely an aid to reading and were, in reality, only magnifying glasses.  When a person gets old, there is very little that can be done to improve the eyesight, and I would appeal to the Minister to consider easing this section in some way.  I know it might be difficult to alter it in such a way as to enable these people to buy that type of spectacles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>It struck me on reading the Bill that Section 48 seems rather difficult to understand.  It prescribes that registered opticians shall not do certain things.  I thought it would have been more in keeping with the Bill, if it stated that no person shall do those things, but apparently the section leaves it open to people with no qualifications whatever to do the things which a registered optician is forbidden to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1322" /> On quite a different point, the Bill provides for appeal from the disciplinary committee set up and provides that that appeal may be taken either to the High Court or to the Minister. It seems to me to be rather questionable, certainly in view of litigation at present proceeding in the courts, whether an appeal to the Minister would be held to come within the Constitution.  I think the principle there, providing for appeals from a professional body to the courts or to the Minister on a matter such as erasure from the register might be a rather dangerous precedent to establish and the Minister should consider that.</P>
    <P>I was rather struck by the provision that if, on appeal, it was found that there had not been proper grounds for erasure from the register, the committee might have to pay damages.  It would seem to me that that is the introduction of a rather strange principle. Presumably, the people who would try these professional cases would be persons who would be acting in a more or less judicial manner, and it seems to be a rather novel principle that, when a lower court hears a case, it might be called upon to pay damages in the event of its decision being overruled in a superior court.</P>
    <P>Another point I would make is that provision is made to register at the outset people who have been for a certain number of years in practice, who are of good character, and that is confined to Irish citizens.  There is a provision as regards the new register that they must be citizens, but surely anyone qualified can be registered, if he has the necessary qualifications.  It does seem to be rather harsh, if there are persons who would be otherwise qualified, that they should not be admitted merely because by some chance, though they have been resident here for a number of years, and have in that time carried on business, they are not Irish citizens.  That seems to be taking away the livelihood of people who might not have expected to be involved in such a matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I happen to be a member of a branch of the Labour Party which for years has been advocating <Col N="1323" /> that the sale of spectacles should be prohibited, except by properly qualified people.  In this respect, you will see that I am in complete disagreement with Senator Bergin.  Our view on this matter was that, whilst spectacles could be purchased cheaply in certain shops, it was false economy, and was dangerous and injurious to the eyes of poor people, that they should be able to purchase these spectacles, or so-called spectacles.</P>
      <P>In so far as this Bill has prohibited the sale of spectacles by unqualified people, by stores and shops, I welcome it.  I do not want to enter into the discussion as to how the representation on the board should be divided, but my interest lies in that one particular aspect, namely, the sale of spectacles by other than properly qualified people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not detain the House very long in concluding and in dealing with the points raised by Senators who took part in the debate.</P>
      <P>First of all, I thank Senator ffrench O'Carroll for his interesting contribution to the debate.  He raised a number of matters with which I would like to deal.  First of all, he said he felt that there was a problem involved, but he felt that this was not the way to deal with it.  The problem which exists and which affects the public good is the problem created by the peregrinations throughout this country of a group of well-advertised quacks, who, at the moment and for years back have been defrauding innocent people throughout the country. That is the problem.  These quacks advertise themselves in the provincial newspapers as being &ldquo;Dublin's leading eyes specialists&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dublin's famous sight testers&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Belfast's boon to the blind&rdquo;, and down the country they go, well advertised, to meet the unfortunate people in some country town.  Before their arrival, they make it clear that their visit is for one day only.</P>
      <P>One day only is frequently sufficiently long to collect from these gullible people sufficient money to maintain them until they go to the next town on the circuit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1324" /> That is the problem and I think any member of this House who has experience of Irish provincial towns will realise that it is a very real problem. Not only is there wholesale defrauding of innocent people, but there is also considerable harm and injury done, I am advised, to the health of these people.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in my speech when introducing the Bill that frequently unfortunate people, instead of getting spectacles, obtaining proper glasses, frequently get plain glass for an eye condition that does need spectacles and often they get spectacles completely unsuited to their condition.  That is the problem and I can conceive of no other way of dealing with that problem than establishing some system whereby the prescribing and the dispensing and sale of spectacles will be subject to some supervision.  I do not think it would be right that it should be subject to supervision or control by a Department of State.  I think it should be supervised and controlled by those who legitimately offer themselves to the public as being experts in this matter, and it is for that reason that it is proposed that this board be established, comprised of members drawn from the medical profession, from ophthalmic opticians and with a member from the dispensing opticians.</P>
    <P>I can well appreciate why Senator ffrench O'Carroll says he does not believe that an ophthalmic optician is the most suitable person to prescribe glasses.  That is quite an understandable expression of view.  Perhaps a number of people would prefer to go to a doctor in order to get glasses prescribed, but the position is at the moment, and has been for years back, that a person can go to anyone and get a prescription for glasses.  At the moment, the doctor is only one of many people who, in accordance with our law, is quite entitled to prescribe glasses for any eye condition or complaint, real or imaginary.  Under the Bill, no effort is being made to suggest that one can go only to an ophthalmic optician, if one needs a prescription for glasses.  All that is being provided is that under the Bill you must go either to a doctor or an ophthalmic optician, and I think that is a fair way of <Col N="1325" /> dealing with what is a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>Senator ffrench O'Carroll went on to say that the question of diagnosis, the diagnosis of a medical condition of the eyes, was open to grave objection. Under the Bill, care has been taken to ensure that an ophthalmic optician will be prohibited from engaging in the treatment medically of any condition of the eye.  These provisions are contained in Section 48 of the Bill.  In addition to the prohibitions there contained, there is a specific provision that a registered optician, who is not a doctor, shall not suggest by any written or oral statement, or by any action, that he has made or is capable of making a medical diagnosis of a disease of the eye, or that, in relation to the treatment of the eyes, he has done or is capable of doing anything other than (1) in the case of a registered ophthalmic optician, the prescribing or provision of spectacles, or (2) in the case of a registered dispensing optician, the provision of spectacles. I think that that is a clear indication that it is not the intention, that it is not my intention, as the proposer of the Bill, that ophthalmic opticians or any registered opticians should be entitled to engage&mdash;in fact, he is clearly prohibited from engaging &mdash;in medical diagnosis.  That is a matter entirely for a doctor and I think that the Bill in that connection makes a fair and reasonable provision.</P>

      <P>That is one of the difficulties.  The Bill as drafted did not contain the express prohibition on medical diagnosis.  That was inserted in Committee in the Dáil, but I am advised that there is a clear distinction between deciding the kind of spectacles required for an obvious eye condition and holding oneself out as specifying what that condition is.  It is intended to ensure that the ophthalmic optician does not hold himself out as saying what is wrong with the eyes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator ffrench O'Carroll also mentioned, as did Senator Crosbie, the position of dispensing opticians.  I do not want to discuss that in detail, but, as I said in the Dáil and I repeat it here, this Bill would never have been introduced into the Dáil or here were it not for the concern repeatedly expressed over years by the ophthalmic opticians with regard to these grave abuses.  The abuses I mentioned frequently were the concern of the Department of Justice and the Garda authorities, but it was the consistent effort by the ophthalmic opticians over the years that eventually induced my predecessor to consider the introduction of this legislation.</P>
      <P>After the introduction of this legislation, the dispensing opticians became concerned about it, and I am well aware&mdash;at least, I hazard a guess&mdash;that most members of this House received <i>billets doux</i> from the dispensing opticians under one guise or another.  I have very little sympathy with that.  I am concerned that this board should not be used in the cause of any section exclusively, in the interest of the ophthalmic opticians, dispensing opticians or the medical profession.</P>
      <P>The board, as constituted, provides that no particular section will have a majority, to the exclusion of other interests, and it will be in the interest of the three sections to work together in order to provide proper standards. The board consists of five ophthalmic opticians, one dispensing optician and four medical practitioners, with a chairman to be nominated.  I think that kind of board is best constituted to deal with this problem and to provide proper standards for all those engaged in the prescription and sale of spectacles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Bergin mentioned the question of the prohibition of the sale of spectacles.  I can conceive of no better answer to Senator Bergin than Senator Murphy's contribution.  That is one of the problems the Bill is designed to deal with.  The purchase of spectacles by poor people just from a frame in a shop or a store at times, I am advised, can cause serious damage to the eye. <Col N="1327" /> Poor people now will have available from the health authority a supply of spectacles properly prescribed in accordance with their medical condition. No hardship will be imposed upon them and I do not think that any real disservice is being done.  An effort has been made to provide for supervision and for proper standards for something which, after all, is of importance to health.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox mentioned a number of matters which, perhaps, we might deal with in Committee in more detail.  He mentioned the question of those entitled to come in on the enactment of the Bill as persons already engaged in this business and that that should not be confined merely to Irish citizens. The position with regard to that, of course, is that the provisions in the Bill in relation to Irish citizens apply only to those engaged on the operation of the Bill.</P>

I can see no way of dealing with this problem, except by providing a form of legislation and supervision by people engaged in this business doing it themselves, in the hope that proper standards will be established and that the business will be conducted properly from now on.</P>
