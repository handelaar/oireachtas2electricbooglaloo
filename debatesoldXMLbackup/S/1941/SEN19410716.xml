      <P>The Sugar (Control of Import) Act, 1936, empowers the Government, by order, to prohibit the import of sugar save under licence issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and provides further that licences may not be issued except to Comhlucht Siuicre <Col N="1786" /> Eireann.  The prohibition order was made on the 29th April last, and that order, as in the case of previous prohibition orders, has to be confirmed by both Houses.  Otherwise it will cease to have effect.  The motion now is to confirm that order, so that it may continue in force until 30th April next year.</P>

      <P>Why is it undesirable to allow a person to import sugar from the Six Counties?  I am not saying that there is not good reason for confining the right to import to the Sugar Company, but I think the Minister should explain the reason briefly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter has been discussed at some length in the House.  The concentration of power to import in a single concern has had the effect of equalising the price of sugar all over the country.  As there is a monopoly in the manufacture of sugar, and as on occasion foreign-manufactured sugar has been imported at prices which were above the cost of manufacture here&mdash;and which sometimes were below the cost of manufacture here&mdash;it was felt desirable, in the general public interest, that everybody should have the benefit of the economies which could be secured from large orders placed for imported sugar by one concern.  It is due to this, in fact, that foreign and home-manufactured sugar can be distributed in equal proportions all over the country, and that sugar, generally, can be sold at a uniform price.  This position has been particularly advantageous since the outbreak of the war, because in the period between the 1st May, 1939, and 30th April, 1940, so large a quantity as 89,000 tons of sugar was purchased by the sugar company.  That was supplemented by further purchases of about 28,000 tons from the 1st May, 1940, to the 30th April, 1941.  As the Senator is aware, that has constituted a very valuable sugar reserve which has enabled practically a free distribution of sugar to be maintained in this country, while it has been necessary drastically to ration sugar supplies elsewhere.</P>

      <P>Would not the Minister's purpose be achieved by fixing a <Col N="1787" /> price for sugar?  What harm would be done by a person importing sugar if he were compelled to sell it at the price fixed by the sugar company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unlikely that any other person here would be able to buy sugar on the same advantageous terms as a company able to place an order for 80,000 tons.  Apart from that, in the circumstances of the time it is doubtful whether it would have been possible to secure shipment of sugar in anything like the quantities which, at the outbreak of the war, were deemed to be necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move Recommendation No. 1, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 1, page 3, after sub-section (2), that a new sub-section (3) be inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) Where the total income of any individual exceeds £1,500 and the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the whole or part of that income is derived from director's remuneration on which corporation profits tax is chargeable under the provisions of Section 36, sub-section (4), of this Act, surtax shall not be chargeable on that part of such income on which corporation profits tax is chargeable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I frankly admit that if the principle of my recommendation were adopted it would require expert drafting.  My object in putting it down is again to draw attention to what I am satisfied is an inequality and a hardship which is being applied to a limited number of persons under this Bill.  The main subject matter was <Col N="1788" /> dealt with under a different type of recommendation on the Committee Stage, notably recommendation No. 3, which is carried forward to the Report Stage. If the Minister was quite unsympathetic, and if he had stated that it was his desire and his intention to place the additional taxation on these particular types of persons I would not have gone any further, because I would have recognised that it was Government policy and that there was no use in attempting to defeat it here.</P>
    <P>But, I am not at all satisfied, particularly on reading the report of the debate, that the Minister himself realises the extent to which what I contend is unfair taxation is being put on a limited number of persons.  The only crime of these persons is that having a certain amount of money to invest, they invested it in limited companies which they themselves controlled.  If they invested in businesses controlled by some one else, they would not have been caught.  The effect of the Bill is that these persons will have to pay on their income in excess of £1,000, if they are caught by the provisions of Section 36, 10 per cent. on the first £500, and on the amount over £1,500, they will have to pay 10 per cent. plus 6d. surtax, and so on, as the surtax increases.</P>
    <P>Why these particular persons should have to pay 10 per cent., plus surtax, I cannot see, because the only grounds given for the proposal are that they happen to be persons who receive fees as directors from their own companies, or are managing directors of companies which they do not control, but into which they happen to have put some of their own money.  Neither of these seems sufficient ground for placing this additional taxation on them.</P>
    <P>The case made by the Minister, in so far as I understood it&mdash;and I think he will absolve me from any intention if, by any chance, I do misrepresent him &mdash;was that this had been the position prior to this Bill.  When I replied to that and stated that it applied to a very much smaller number of individuals before this Bill and then only to those where the total profits of the company were in excess of £5,000 and, therefore, hit <Col N="1789" /> only a small number of wealthy persons, he then, in effect, suggested that it had been the law in England until the corporation profits tax was abolished in 1923 or 1924.</P>
    <P>I should point out to the Minister that these few wealthy persons who owned and controlled a company which made profits in excess of £5,000, that is, after deducting their salaries up to £1,000, are only hit now by the increased income-tax.  In the case of people who are now caught by this Bill, not only have they to pay income-tax at a higher rate but, as already pointed out, they will have to pay 10 per cent. on the amount of the salaries which they did not have to pay last year or for many years previously. It may be said that the 10 per cent. comes out of the company, rather than directly out of the individual salaries, but as it applies only to companies owned and controlled by directors, it is the same thing in effect and, as they will discover in next year's profit, it means that there will be an equivalent reduction in their actual income.  If it applied to companies not owned and controlled by them, it might be argued then that it was paid out of the company.  If you go back to the time when corporation profits tax was abolished in England, or to the year when it was practically abolished here&mdash;it was continued only for companies that had profits of £10,000 and over&mdash;at that time the rate of corporation profits tax was less even over the £10,000 limit.  The income-tax was lower and surtax was payable only on incomes over £2,000. It is misleading to compare the positions theoretically.  The fact is the individual had very much less to pay then.</P>
    <P>In spite of the attitude taken by the Minister on the Committee Stage, I still think it was desirable to try to get him to meet the situation in the way I suggested.  I know that it would not have wholly met the difficulty, but it would have confined the hardship to persons with incomes over £1,500.  I thought I would try another way by suggesting that these persons should not be subject to sur-tax.  It seems to me, and I still maintain, <Col N="1790" /> that it is unreasonable that they should be subject to both taxes.  I cannot say that I put this amendment down with any great optimism, as the Minister stated in the course of his remarks that he had not yet received any complaints.  At that, I am not at all surprised, because the number of persons who are going to be caught and who have already discovered it is few and far between.  It will not be until corporation profits tax is assessed on the profits for the next trading year that they will discover it, and I felt that when these people find that they have to pay this inequitable and additional tax, they should know that there were some Senators who did see what was happening and did their best to remedy it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a comfort to know that Senator Douglas was not too optimistic. I might as well put him out of pain at once by saying that I cannot accept the recommendation.  Nor can I accept that it is inequitable and unfair, or agree to any of the other adjectives the Senator used with regard to this particular tax on this type of individual or company.  If anybody has an income that is subject to surtax I do not see why that individual should be specially treated, and that is what the Senator is looking for in this recommendation. It deals, as do many of the other recommendations in the Senator's name, with a type of private company, that, as the Senator admitted when speaking on other stages on the subject, is practically the same as a partnership, but there are advantages and considerable advantages, not necessarily to the State, but to the individual, in having his private company or partnership registered as a limited company.  There are some disadvantages&mdash;corporation profits tax is one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Only now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, there has been an advantage in the past.  It is now an advantage, and it has always been a great safeguard to the individual, that, even though the company he is interested in might fail or go bankrupt, he <Col N="1791" /> can still be a rich man and his assets cannot be touched.  There is a considerable advantage in having his business registered as a limited company.  As we have a number of recommendations in the Senator's name on the same subject, I would like to go into the matter rather fully. It raises some questions that, at any rate from the point of view of the Minister for Finance, are fundamental. It will be convenient, in the first instance, to consider the inter-relation of corporation profits tax, income-tax, and surtax by reference to the case of the public company.</P>
      <P>The nett profits of such a company in excess of the exempt margin are liable to corporation profits tax.  The amount of corporation profits tax payable is treated as an expense in computing the profits for income-tax purposes but, subject to this, the profits are also chargeable to income-tax and in so far as the profits are distributed in the form of dividends to individuals in the surtax range they also pay surtax.  I do not propose to discuss the question whether this is equitable.  It has been the policy of every Government in power in this State since 1921 and that policy has been endorsed by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Now, in arriving at the nett profits of a public company of the usual kind, the fees of the directors and the salaries of managing directors will of course be allowed as an expense.  No difficulty arises because the shareholders have power&mdash;and must be presumed to exercise it&mdash;to see that the remuneration of the directors is not more than their services are worth. The directors get their fees or salaries and such fees and salaries are allowed as an expense in computing the profits of the company.  They also get their dividends out of a fund on which corporation profits tax has been paid and they are liable to surtax on those dividends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you come to the case of the private company in which all or nearly all the shares are held by the directors, the position is quite different.  The company, as Senator Douglas has pointed out, is in many respects similar <Col N="1792" /> to the private firm, the directors being more or less in the position of the partners.  They have, of course, the very important advantage that if the concern fails their liability is limited to the assets of the company, and their personal resources cannot be touched by the creditors of the concern.  But their control over the affairs of the company is virtually as absolute as that of the partners in the firm.  They can, therefore, if they please, pay themselves the whole of the profits of the concern as remuneration for their services and show no profit balance, or only a nominal profit balance on the profit and loss account of the company.  So that if the statute did not impose a limitation on their remuneration they could evade payment of corporation profits tax altogether.  I have no doubt that is what many of them would do.</P>
    <P>To meet this difficulty the following provision was inserted in the Finance Act of 1920 by which corporation profits tax was first imposed:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Section 53 (2) (c)&mdash;Any deduction allowed in respect of the remuneration of any director, manager or other person concerned in the management of a company who has a controlling interest in the company, whether directly or indirectly, and whether solely or jointly with any other person shall not exceed an amount calculated at the rate of £1,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>It is important to observe that when the Finance Act of 1920 was passed the exempt margin was £500 as against £2,500 in the present Bill.  Of course, for some years past it has been £5,000 here.  The effect of the provision has been somewhat anomalous.  Senator Douglas, last Wednesday, referred to the case of the one-man company, and was obviously under the impression that the £1,000 limit was now being made applicable in such a case for the first time.  In fact the limit has operated in that type of case ever since 1920.  The provision was for some time interpreted as applying also to the case in which the directors between them held a majority of the shares, but in 1938 it was held by one of the Special Commissioners of Income-Tax here, on <Col N="1793" /> an appeal, that the wording of the section was not sufficiently explicit to bear that interpretation, and since then the results have been anomalous.  The provision clearly applies to the one-man company, but it was regarded as not applying to the two-men or three-men company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that apply under this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It will apply in future.  If the Bill goes through it will apply to the one-man and two-men company alike.  Two brothers, neither holding more than half the capital, but between them holding all the capital, could arrange to pay themselves any salaries they pleased within the limits of the company's profits, and such salaries had to be allowed when computing the profits for the purposes of corporation profits tax unless it could be shown that the payments amounted to artificial transactions designed to reduce the company's profits&mdash;a very difficult undertaking as a rule.  If one of the brothers died and his shares passed to the other so that the company became a one-man company, the survivor's salary came under the operation of the limiting provision. Sub-section (4) of Section 36 of this year's Bill is designed to remedy these anomalies.  It is designed to make the limiting provision applicable to cases in which the directors between them have a controlling interest whilst leaving the figure of £1,000 as the maximum admissible as an expense in respect of each director's remuneration when computing the profits liable to corporation profits tax.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to accept the Senator's recommendation.  It would mean a loss of surtax in cases in which we are getting it at present.  If you take the case of the one-man company making £10,000 per annum the proprietor could pay himself the whole of the profit as remuneration for his own services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that point later.  Take the case of a one-man company making £10,000 per annum, the proprietor paying himself the whole of the profits as remuneration for his own services, under the Bill as it stands corporation profits tax will be payable on £6,500, that is, £10,000, less £2,500 exempt margin and £1,000 admissible remuneration. The Senator's proposal is that this £6,500 should not be liable to surtax. Out of the proprietor's £10,000 income from the company, surtax would be payable only on the £1,000 allowed for corporation profits tax purposes as proprietor's salary, and possibly, but not certainly, on the £2,500 of profits exempted as marginal allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whilst the question of increasing the amounts admissible as a director's remuneration in the type of case we are discussing is the subject of separate recommendations, I may perhaps be permitted to say at this point that I have, as I promised, carefully considered the question of increasing the figure to £1,500.  I have felt compelled to decide against it.  In the original Act the figure was put at £1,000.  At that time the exempt margin was only £500.  The value of money in relation to goods was lower than it is at present. The Act proceeded on the basis that £1,000 should be regarded as the maximum admissible as remuneration for the services of a director in the circumstances we are considering, and that anything further which he got should be regarded as a distribution of profit.  In so far as salaries in excess of £1,000 have been admitted in certain cases in which there has been joint control by two or three directors, I am satisfied that this was the result of a drafting flaw in the original Act. <Col N="1795" /> This is borne out by the fact that the limiting provision was originally interpreted as applying to such a case both in England and in this country.  We are remedying that flaw and in the present emergency I do not feel at liberty to incur the loss of duty which the increase of the limiting figure from £1,000 to £1,500 would involve.</P>
    <P>I have deliberately got this written out so that those interested would have an opportunity of studying the matter, because I am sure it will come up again, not on this Bill, of course, but it is bound to come up at a later date. I have gone into it with the officials of my Department in a very definite and full way.  I am satisfied that we would lose a considerable amount of money, because there is quite a number of these companies in existence, and that the limit that already exists and that has existed for a considerable time is a fair limit in the particular type of class that we are dealing with, where the directors control their own company and can distribute the profits of that company as they please.  They are getting fair consideration in the limitation of the directors' fees to £1,000.  They are escaping a certain amount of tax on that.</P>
    <P>The balance of the profits will normally in that type of company go to the individuals.  It does not mean depriving them of anything in an improper or unfair way, such as the Senator suggests.  There are advantages to the partners who desire to have their company registered and to protect themselves in the way the law permits individuals to protect themselves by forming themselves into a limited liability company.  It is only fair, in my opinion, that they should pay something for the protection that they get there and this is one way that does not put an undue burden upon them.  If they have an income over £1,500, when every other individual in the country pays surtax on such an income, I do not see why, merely because they are owners of a private company that can make big profits which they can have entirely for themselves, subject to corporation profits tax, they should escape the surtax.</P>

He has adopted a practice which is not unusual in debate, as far as at least half of his speech is concerned, in proving the undesirability of something that was never proposed.  At no time in any speech made by me or in any recommendation made by me did I suggest there should not be a limit as to what might be charged as directors' fees in the case a private limited company.  I did suggest a different limit but at no point in any of the recommendations did I suggest there should be no limit. Consequently, with half of the Minister's arguments I find myself in complete agreement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I still adhere to the statement that I did not propose that there should not be some limit. Recommendation No. 1 indicated the principle which I endeavoured to set up, that persons should not be charged both taxes.  If it had been accepted&mdash;I confess I did not expect it would be accepted&mdash;it would have required a certain amount of technical drafting but I did not, in Recommendation No. 1, propose to change Section 36 and in all the recommendations I have put down to Section 36 there is a limit.  I think I am quite entitled to say I did not propose and certainly I can say I did not intentionally propose to abolish all limits.  I can say with absolute truth that from the very beginning I appreciated the reasons why there must be a limit.  I do not think the Minister should go to the trouble, but if he has a doubt, I suggest that he read the debate last week where he will see that I made it perfectly clear that I was in favour of a limit.  If his advisers say Recommendation No. 1 would remove the limit, I do not see how, but I am quite willing to accept that statement if he will accept my statement that I intended there should be a limit.  That point is relatively unimportant.  I only want to dispose of that fact first.  I do not, however, agree with the Minister that this position which he has set out has existed for a considerable time for the persons coming under it in this Bill. <Col N="1798" /> He has emphasised the fact that this has existed for a considerable time.</P>
      <P>I do not know of any way of leaving the position the same for the persons who have been paying this tax up to the present time and not putting the new tax on a new person who has been, shall we say, a managing director of a company in which he had 5 per cent. capital which he did not control.  Take the case of an individual who is managing director of a company, who is paid £1,500 a year and has been paid it for several years.  He now finds himself subject to income-tax plus 10 per cent. on £500 and, if he received £2,000, to surtax as well.  My first recommendation was only to draw attention to the fact that he was under the Bill subject to three taxes.</P>
      <P>I am not concerned with the persons to whom this has applied for a considerable time, the persons who were affected when the limit was £5,000 or £10,000 but I think that it is very definitely unfair to place the imposition on a number of individuals in smaller companies.  The Minister referred back to the circumstances when the limit was £500.  That was introduced, to the best of my recollection, during a war.  But apart altogether from that, at that time, as far as this country was concerned, there were not nearly so many limited companies.  The last Government did not, I think, hold the same views as those enunciated by the Minister now. They did not abolish fees chargeable on the formation of a limited company, but they considered it desirable to encourage the formation of new limited companies and they reduced the percentage rate from, I think, £1 to 5/- and that has been continued by the present Government even though, apparently, the present Minister does not really approve of any such encouragement, by way, at any rate, of equal taxation on a limited company as against a partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to take up the time of the House, nor have I fully prepared myself, but I would be very glad at some time to discuss the desirability, from the point of view of the public generally, of running most businesses by partnerships or by <Col N="1799" /> limited companies, and I would be surprised if I could not in the long run persuade the Minister that, taking it all round, there was better control from the State point of view and much more difficulty in evasion of tax by a limited company than by a partnership. However, the Minister does not, at the moment, take that view, judging by his speech, and I do not think I ought to take up the time of the House in debating it.  My case, in fact, is this, that persons have been receiving an income as a result of companies, many of which&mdash;those I am most interested in&mdash;are small industrial companies set up in the last six or seven years.  I think the State encouraged them, at any rate, to set up the industries or the trades.  It may be argued whether or not they encouraged them to form limited companies, but I would be prepared to argue that they did encourage them to form limited companies, if only for the fact that unless they were limited companies they could not get certain facilities such as trade loans, and that was because of the impracticability of controlling that type of loan to an individual or to a partnership.</P>
    <P>However, be that as it may, the State definitely encouraged them, and now the directors are placed in the position that they must submit to heavy taxation as far as their own particular salaries are concerned. My sympathy is with the managing director who has been foolish enough, apparently&mdash;I would have said, prior to this Bill, &ldquo;wise enough&rdquo;&mdash;to invest 5 per cent. of his own money in the concern.  He can, of course, evade the tax in some cases by selling those shares, as they are not of much value to him and do not give him any active control. Probably, the Minister would say that would be the best way to do it.  As far as other directors are concerned, however, if they find this too onerous they will be driven to a method for which the Minister has not provided, that is, instead of being directors of the company in which they control the shares, they will become employees, and some <Col N="1800" /> employees will become directors.  The directors, as he has said, must do what the shareholders tell them, and the control cannot well remain the same.</P>
    <P>The fees paid to individuals will not be caught in this but, I suppose, if that happens, the Minister will try to find some other way to deal with it. In effect, all he will do is very definitely to discourage individuals putting money into a business which they intend to run themselves.  They will say there is no use in doing that if the State's attitude is that, as soon as things are going well, they will be harshly treated, and a very large portion of their income will be taken away which could not be taken if they did not invest their capital in a business run by themselves.  They will not want to pay 8/9 tax if an ordinary individual pays only 7/6.  I think the net result will be definitely to discourage them.  However, I do not propose to press this particular recommendation any further, as the Minister has made it quite clear that he will not accept it.</P>

      <P>I move Recommendation No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 36, sub-section (4), page 20, after the word &ldquo;annum&rdquo; in line 35, that the words &ldquo;or the amount of the remuneration paid to such director in the trade year which ended in the year ending December 31st, 1940, whichever is the greater&rdquo; be inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This deals with a specific point.  When you come to excess corporation profits tax, this point is conceded, that is, if the directors were paid a certain rate of remuneration in the years preceding the years in which excess corporation profits tax is chargeable, they can be paid the same rate now.  I think that is perfectly fair, but I am not at all clear as to why if it is fair in that case it would not be fair in the case of ordinary corporation profits tax.  The Minister will appreciate&mdash;and if he does not I will demonstrate it to him on a later recommendation&mdash;the extreme difficulty of an individual Senator in drafting recommendations to the Finance Bill without the technical <Col N="1801" /> advice which the Minister himself finds necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally, I would always welcome any Senator coming to me with a recommendation and asking the advice and help of my officials in the drafting of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that.  I appreciate very fully that the officials would be quite willing to help.  I am not making an attack on the Minister now, but wish to say that, in the case of amendments which are in the form of recommendations, the same technicality is not essential as, if the principle were adopted, the drafting would be put right elsewhere.  This is not in any sense a complaint.  With this Minister and other Ministers, I have never found anything but readiness to assist in drafting, though it is not generally wise, on the Committee Stage, to waste time, but better for a Senator to introduce the matter himself and, if he sees a chance of acceptance, to get in touch then with the officials or with the Minister and endeavour to reach agreement.</P>
      <P>What I really want on this particular recommendation is to get from the Minister the reason why this principle is wrong in the case of ordinary corporation profits tax and right in the case of excess corporation profits tax.  My point would be entirely met if the salaries which had been admissible before where they were in excess of the £1,000 were allowed&mdash;I would go even further, though it is not specifically in this recommendation and agree that they should not exceed a maximum of £1,500.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I cannot meet the Senator on this recommendation either, as it would mean a loss of revenue.  All these points and difficulties arise&mdash;the changes from the exemption of £5,000 down to £2,500 that are introduced in this Bill&mdash; because I need additional revenue. Speaking a few minutes ago, the Senator said he would like the position to be left as it was before, but is it not the same for everybody? All those who pay income-tax, and most people who pay tax of <Col N="1802" /> any kind, are paying additional taxation this year.  The same applies, generally speaking, to the owners of private companies and to the owners of shares in all sorts of companies. They are all being asked to pay additional tax this year, because the State needs additional revenue.  There are hardships involved, not alone for directors and shareholders but for those who are not in the happy position of being owners of shares in any company.  They all have to pay.</P>

      <P>In Section 36, sub-section (4), line 41, page 20, that the word &ldquo;five&rdquo; be deleted, and the word &ldquo;twenty-five&rdquo; be substituted therefor.</P>
      <P>I presume the Minister will say the same thing in this case.  He will admit that it is not quite equitable, but will say that he must have more money. Probably he will give the same answer as in the last case.  However, I wish to repeat that a managing director who does not himself control the business should not be penalised just because he has 5 per cent. of the capital; 25 per cent. would not in any sense give him control and would be a more equitable amount.  As I take it that the Minister's attitude is the same, I do not intend to press this recommendation.</P>
      <P>Recommendation, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>The following Recommendation appeared on the Order Paper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 39, sub-section (2), page 23, at the end of paragraph (c), that the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; be inserted.&mdash; (Senator Douglas.)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>This recommendation is consequential on Recommendation <Col N="1803" /> No. 7 and depends on whether Recommendation No. 7 is accepted or not. I move Recommendation No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In Section 39, sub-section (2), page 23, at the end of the sub-section that a new paragraph (d) be added as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(d) a sum equal to 3 per cent. of the paid up ordinary stock or shares of the company.</P>
      <P>I should point out again that this deals only with the substituted standard. The substituted standard is applicable to a new company, but it also is applicable to a company in existence for two or three years which may have made very small profits or may have had losses. The Minister will agree with me that some companies were started with the very best intentions as a result of the industrial development scheme, but failed to make profits and in some cases had losses.  At the moment I am fortunate enough not to be interested, in an individual capacity, in any of those companies, but I am interested in them in a general way, as I believe it is highly desirable, from the point of view of the success of industrial development generally, that those companies should get a chance to survive.</P>
      <P>If they have to use the substituted standard, and if 75 per cent. of their profits from now on are to be taken from them&mdash; that is, 75 per cent of any excess of the bare standard of an amount that would equal 6 per cent. on their shares and the requisite amount on debentures or preference shares&mdash;I suggest to the Minister that these companies never will be able to make up for that loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I argued on the Committee Stage in favour of a provision for a reserve. I feel very strongly that any company &mdash;I am referring to a new company or a company which is being started &mdash;must calculate on profits which it believes it will make after having a reasonable reserve set aside.  But in the case of the reserve the Seanad was totally opposed to me and is quite out of sympathy with my view.  Consequently, I cannot debate that again, <Col N="1804" /> but I would emphasise that what I have now proposed only deals with the substitute standard in a limited company. I am simply pleading the case of a company, of which there are cases, which had losses or was not able to make a profit and saying that the substituted standard is too meagre and that 6 per cent. is not sufficient.  I have suggested a further 3 per cent.  I am not asking for the payment of dividends.  I do not approve of the payment of dividends even to the extent of 6 per cent. in companies of that category.  Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order would prevent that in any case and we may assume that that order is likely to remain in force during the emergency.  I am completely in favour of its remaining in force during the emergency.  I am concerned with the profits which should be retained for the purpose of keeping business safe and in that connection because of the remarks of the Minister I was very much surprised at the attitude of Labour members although not so much surprised at the Fianna Fáil members.</P>
    <P>I was very surprised at the Labour Party seeing that it is only possible for companies during the present emergency to maintain their labour for a longer period than is absolutely justified by the actual operations of the companies if they have reserves out of which to pay salaries.  The Government have rightly begged employers&mdash;and employers here are almost entirely limited companies&mdash;to try to keep their people employed as long as they can.  I am sure that there are some employers who would reject that recommendation out of hand.  The people I met in the Federation of Irish Industries have made an effort to do it, but they could only do it out of reserves, not out of increased profits. You cannot get increased profits, and if you try to get them the Government probably would not let you, but you can only keep people employed because you have reserves.  In the case of companies affected by the substitute standard, the Government would not agree to increase the figure of the reserve.  I am now asking them to agree to the figure of another 3 per cent. although if it were applied <Col N="1805" /> only to those companies that had a loss it would not be enough.  In this case I am trying to establish what is a very vital principle.</P>

I know there are difficulties, and in the case of the companies that, perhaps, the Senator has in mind and that I had in mind, this section might make difficulties.  I am anxious to help these companies over these difficulties.  I hope to do something next year, but I cannot this year. <Col N="1806" /> I hope to do it next year and I hope to make it retrospective.  The Senator objected to the retrospective aspect as well as to the suggestion that I should leave it over.  I certainly intend to try to find a way out of these difficulties, for certain companies may be injured in their business as the result of this.

The recommendation now before the House is long, <Col N="1808" /> intricate and involved.  I doubt if Senator Douglas, or Senator Douglas and I together, or any other member of the House, would have been able to draft an amendment which would satisfy the draftsman. This is his own draft to meet the case put up by Senator Douglas, which I had explained to him.  It fully meets the points raised by Senator Douglas and, at the same time, it does not open the door to evasion.</P>

I do hope that the Minister will not allow the respite during the holiday season from this laborious, troublesome business to interfere with his appreciation of the precarious position in which these companies may find themselves after the emergency.  If they run into periods of loss and the bulk of their previous profits have been taken from them in taxation, they will be in a position far worse than that in which companies were after the last war, because during the last war the machinery introduced provided for relief. Nothing of that kind is provided now, and I hope the Minister will be alive to the serious dangers of the future if he does not mitigate his present intentions.</P>

      <P>I said in the Dáil, and I think I said here, that the position <Col N="1809" /> of companies when this emergency is over, would have to receive the serious consideration of the Minister for Finance.  The type of allowances Senator Sir John Keane has in mind in relation to corporation profits tax and excess profits tax was not introduced simultaneously with the introduction of excess profits tax and corporation profits tax during the last war.  After the war amendments were made in the law whereby allowances of various kinds for loss, renewals of machinery and so forth were made available.  When the time comes for review of this special taxation arising out of the emergency, companies which have suffered loss and have not been able to put by reserves for renewals will have to receive special consideration.</P>

      <P>There is not much profit in joining issue with the Minister on many of the points he made on Second Reading in reply to my comments but I cannot feel convinced that the Minister is sufficiently appreciative of conditions in the country at present. I suppose it is a good thing to be able to take things as the Minister takes them but the country is not getting from the Minister and his colleagues that kind of leadership which it expects. While it might be conceded that the Minister has shown a considerable amount of imagination in the manner in which he stretched out his tentacles in this Bill to gather in taxes &mdash;it may have been his advisers who were responsible&mdash;one cannot feel convinced that there is any inspiration behind the method adopted in trying to gather this taxation nor can one feel convinced that we shall be in a <Col N="1810" /> better position as a result of this taxation in another year.  We have reached a stage in which our income is dropping and there is no evidence that the Minister expects our total income to be any better than it is. Nothing in this measure gives evidence that the Minister has taken steps to ensure that the national income a year hence will be of such proportions as to enable him to get anything like the amount of money from the taxpayer which he is asking this year.  It is quite clear that his method of taxation and Government policy generally, will leave the country more impoverished, with a lower income, a lower productive capacity and less money in circulation.</P>
      <P>There will be a general weakening of the national morale in a way that can be disastrous.  I am saying that because I believe it is true.  I would prefer to be in the position of applauding the Minister for the imagination and courage which he and his colleagues were displaying in relation to financial policy as applied to the work of national government generally.  In this Bill one cannot feel that confidence one would like to have in the policy of the present leaders.  There is a great need for those leaders to be more progressive than they are. The shortages which the country is going to experience in the next twelve months are due to the lack of imagination on the part of the Ministry and the lack of courage to provide essentials which we could have had in abundance if they had exercised more foresight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is how I view the situation.  We know it is quite easy to have a good deal of money, perhaps, in circulation and to reach the stage they have reached across the water in which they are ensuring that the people will not spend money on the kind of goods they want to spend money on, rather than on the kind of goods the Government want them to buy.  We may have money here during next winter and spring and yet we may not be able to provide ourselves with sufficient food or fuel. That is a situation which we should never have permitted to develop.  I think it was avoidable if the Government <Col N="1811" /> had made the effort.  There was a great weakness in Government policy, or a lack of foresight among the leaders.  Even now when we are restarting exports of live stock, I am wondering what we are getting back for them. In the days when we were very concerned to get them out&mdash;we are concerned to get them out to-day&mdash; during the economic war period, the British attitude was that they would take our goods provided we took their coal.  I do not know what we are doing about that to-day.  It seems to be a line on which we ought to proceed. Their coal would be better than their pound notes to us.  I feel we have reached that stage, both with regard to the sending out of meat and cement. Even if we are smuggling sugar across the Border or any other goods that are being sent out we ought to try to get goods back, inasmuch as we are short of a considerable amount of things that are essential to life here.  In that respect I urge on the Minister that when we send out food or goods of another kind, we ought to try a policy of barter and get other goods back.  I have said already, that we have here the raw materials for the production of food and fuel in such quantities to-day as to remove the danger of being cold or hungry.</P>
    <P>It is because Government policy does not show definite imagination that we are going to be short of these things. There are great and grave dangers of a shortage in our cities, and even in the towns.  That is a situation which none of us can afford to face with equanimity.  No matter on what side of the House we sit, none of us can fail to wonder what use we are making of our liberty.  I know that the Minister can come back, as he came back the last day, and try to indicate that I have some wild cat scheme at the back of my mind.  Perhaps the Minister might think that at times I have been too conservative, but we have reached a pass when it would be much better for the Government to realise that this is a particularly abnormal period and that the normal method of handling our affairs is not going to keep order, or peace or stability, or provide our <Col N="1812" /> people with the essentials they require.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has, possibly, the most responsible office of all. It is his duty to oil all the machines that are operating to keep the institutions of the State sound and stable, and I think he will agree if I suggest that he could have done much more. I am not making the charge that he is not anxious to do more, but he is losing some of the fire he used to have in the old days, and I feel that it would be much better for the State if, instead of growing conservative, he could recapture a little of the old revolutionary spirit.  I think one of my colleagues, Senator Hayes, is murmuring disapprovingly at that.</P>

      <P>The people who are able to turn on the Shannon scheme will tell you that very blandly, but if they were living in the country like the majority of the people who have to provide the food, I can tell them they would be very discomfited.  The men who work the machines are perturbed about the position of the harvest.  What answer can one make to these people? I am afraid that one cannot offer them anything that is very consoling. Generally, we might have been in a much stronger position than the one we now occupy, if Government policy had been different.  There is no hint in the Bill now before us that Government policy is not going to continue <Col N="1813" /> in the old narrow rut.  At the end of another year, we will probably be poorer in supplies, and people may want more money to spend without being able to find it.  I believe that the responsibility is on the Minister for Finance to find credits to put people working who are now leaving the country.  Put them producing the goods that could be produced if the credits were available.  We could have produced a great deal more in the 1941 period, if policy in 1940 and 1939, in regard to credits had been different. The Minister's predecessor was as reluctant as the Minister to do anything in that direction.  It is very difficult to make people realise that you have to rear a calf for three or four years before she becomes a cow. I always feel about financial policy that the men who are responsible for it never had sufficient contact with agriculture to enable them to get that long view which is requisite in a sufficient financial policy for a country predominantly agricultural.</P>
      <P>We had, at some time, a statement and a great many people are wondering what exactly was meant, or what is being done about it.  The statement was made in some place by the Taoiseach, either in the Dáil or at a public meeting, that the Government intended to introduce a measure for the establishment of a central bank. As we have not heard anything about that since perhaps the Minister would enlighten us as to the stage which that measure has reached.  We certainly ought to have some indication of it. It would enable the people, more correctly to diagnose the position and find out whether progress is being made, or whether they are being given information which indicates that something is going to be done when, perhaps, it is being put on the long finger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyway, we want something fresh and something new.  It is not in this measure which the Minister is putting through this House and, because it is not there, I think myself the country and many of us here are not as optimistic about the future as we should like to be.  We could, had the circumstances been otherwise, be optimistic because <Col N="1814" /> we have the means and the grounds for optimism if we got the leadership which the country deserves and requires.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking I am still of the opinion that the biggest mistake the Government made in this Bill was in endeavouring to get money out of industry rather than out of individual incomes.  When you are up against an emergency, even if it does mean smaller incomes, it is better to get the people to face frankly what they have to pay on their incomes.  It may be suggested that that attitude is inconsistent with my efforts in regard to other aspects of the Bill, but I do not think it is.  I think that it was, and it is, a mistake to attack industries or trades which employ people, and to try to get revenue in the way in which this Bill does.  As the Bill was introduced, it would have created chaos, and, as the Minister more or less admitted, it might have killed a certain number of industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I spoke on the Second Stage, I asked the Minister a question in all seriousness, in order to get some assistance from him, on a certain point, but I think he forgot to answer it.  I propose to repeat the question now.  It is, what attitude a trader or manufacturer should adopt if he finds himself in the position that his trade is reduced as a result of want of supplies or for other reasons?  If he is in the dilemma that he is faced with the alternative of increasing prices and maintaining a fair amount of employment, or selling at the old prices and substantially reducing employment, which should he do?  I know that that is a problem which has to be faced at the present time by a very considerable number of people, and I find it extremely difficult to know what answer should be given to them.  It is very difficult for individuals or firms who are anxious to do their best in the emergency to make up their minds on that policy without getting some indication from the State.  The nearest approach to guidance we got came from the Minister for Supplies when he stated some time ago that it might sometimes be necessary to increase prices a little so as to maintain employment. I do not know whether the <Col N="1815" /> Minister for Finance has any views on that matter, but I hope that somebody in authority will be in a position to deal with that very serious and genuine problem which faces many people at the present time.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter with which I should like to deal.  On the Second Stage Senator Hawkins made a statement in relation to the general financial policy of the Government.  I think I might be allowed to take this opportunity of dealing with it for, although I think the Senator made the statement in perfect good faith, he completely misstated the facts.  I must say that Senator Hawkins' contributions to the deliberations of this House are generally helpful, and I hope that what I have to say will not be interpreted as an attack upon him, for nothing is further from my mind.  The Senator gave expression to a statement indicating that he is under an impression that appears to be very widely held throughout the country, but that is, nevertheless, quite erroneous.  He stated that when the emergency arose the Government had taken steps to provide credit to enable manufacturers and traders to lay in stocks and that those people had not taken advantage of that credit and had not laid in stocks.  Now, the fact is that the Government did not provide any such credit and, for my part, I think the Government were quite right.  What the Government did was to advise the purchase of substantial stocks, and they asked the banks to give as many facilities as possible to traders for that purpose, and the banks, as far as I know, did so, always provided that the assets of the particular concerns were sufficient to warrant increased credit facilities. Such facilities as were given were given entirely on the credit worthiness of the companies or the individuals concerned.  I think that that was quite correct.  The impression, however, has been created that the Government guaranteed credit or in some way gave an assurance to the banks to enable them to give credit to people who were not otherwise creditworthy.  That, of course, was not so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1816" /> I should like to say that in my opinion the vast majority of manufacturers and a very considerable number of traders did borrow up to the hilt and did lay in stocks&mdash;not all of them of course.  You cannot get perfection all round.  The very fact that this country is only now beginning to feel the pinch is proof positive that substantial stocks were brought in.  I want to make it clear that that charge made by the Senator&mdash;if it can be interpreted as a charge against the Government, he really meant it as praise, though I regard it as a charge&mdash;is not correct.  Similarly, the charge against manufacturers that stocks were not laid in is not, to my own knowledge, correct.  There may be some few cases in which it would be correct, but they are very few.  It is true that there were certain weaker firms that could not get facilities.  It is not true that the Government guaranteed credit for merchants or firms to enable them to buy in stocks.  If it had been considered desirable to provide such stocks, the Government could have bought in these stocks themselves and there would be no necessity for their guaranteeing credit such as Senator Hawkins suggests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that Senator Baxter's contribution to the debate left me rather bewildered.  I gathered that the Senator criticised the Government because the taxation which they had imposed was not sufficiently high.  I think the tenor of his remarks was to the effect that the Government was to be censured for not inflicting more taxation.  It is all very well to indulge in criticism but what exactly could the Government have done?  How better could the Government have dealt with the extraordinary situation arising out of the war?  We talk very loosely about credit, but do we really mean by credit that the Government should have gone in for inflation at the beginning of the crisis, should have issued more currency and, by the issue of that currency, enabled farmers, for instance, to purchase increased stock? Does the Senator mean that the Government should have financed <Col N="1817" /> every importing firm in the country and by such financing enabled those firms to purchase more stock?  I do not exactly know what Senator Baxter wished the Government to do unless it was something along these lines.  He criticised the Government for not doing one thing or for not doing another thing.  I do not know that Senator Baxter in the past was very enthusiastic about the Government's programme.</P>

      <P>One hates to have to repeat oneself to defend a situation that does not need defending, but were it not for the amount of protection afforded in the past, we would be in a far worse situation now. Senator Baxter speaks of the future. None of us can know what may happen in the future.  Nobody in this world is wise enough to make provision against what may happen from week to week in such an international crisis as we are now going through.  The wisest men cannot foresee what may happen in six months' time or what effect it may have on the lives and fortunes of every country in the world.  We are accused of not having taken precautions to guard against these untoward events.  In regard to the matter of providing credit, what exactly do we mean by credit?  Does it mean, as I have said, that we should issue more and more bank notes and thereby incur inflation?  If there is one thing on which I agree with Senator Baxter it is his suggestion that for any goods we export at the moment&mdash; cattle, corn or butter&mdash;it would be far better for us to get goods in exchange than to get English bank notes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is any danger in the future as a result of this international situation, it is the danger that the bank notes that are being issued to-day may be worth far less 12 months from now, and if the war is not over then at the completion of the war they may be worth far less again.  To that extent I agree with Senator Baxter that <Col N="1818" /> for any goods we are exporting it would be far better for us if we were to get coal and the materials for the manufacture of our own goods here in exchange.  The taxation that is being levied in this Budget is certainly very severe, and it is likely to be extremely severe on our own young companies, but when you have to incur extraordinary expenditure you have got to resort to extraordinary means to get the wherewithal to meet that expenditure. If anyone can suggest any alternative policy it would be a very useful contribution to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points I should like to raise on this final stage.  One is the question of the taxation of the so-called allowances to members of the Oireachtas.  Does the Minister realise that there is a very considerable feeling in the country on that point?  Many people one meets casually say, &ldquo;Why are not these salaries or allowances taxed, or, at least, why are the expenses not vouched for and why is what cannot be proved as being expenses not taxed?&rdquo;  It does seem strange on the face of it that people should be voting taxes a large number of whom do not pay any taxes themselves.  I feel that this is a matter that is arousing very considerable feeling in the country and one that the Government should consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter I wish to refer to-the Minister has heard me on this before, or his predecessor has&mdash;is the position of what I call, for want of a better name, the remnants of the demesne-owning class, many of whom are living under extremely hard conditions at the present time.  They are overhoused; they have expenses out of all proportion to their income; and the only way they can avoid those expenses is to sell their places at a great sacrifice, in many cases at prices which would not enable them to buy even a modest villa.  Does the Government consider that that would be a good position to force in the national interests? Whatever may be the record of these people as a class, they are leaders to a great extent in their districts. They are leaders of sport, and I would go so far as to say that in some districts they are almost outposts <Col N="1819" /> of civilisation.  They are a desirable asset to maintain.  They are a class of people who are being taxed on money they never receive.</P>
    <P>Only a few demesne owners are fortunate enough to have much outside income, investment income.  Very often their investment income is in trust and they cannot touch the capital.  The only way many of them can now save themselves is either by selling their places at a sacrifice and letting all those social amenities go by the board or by reducing employment.  I do not think for a moment that any Government who looks at this matter fairly would say that is a desirable course to compel these people to adopt.</P>
    <P>It would be possible, I believe, to treat that class of property owners in a way that would not embarrass or would not affect the general principle that the Government seem bent upon, that those who live in fairly big houses say, near cities, shall not get the relief for repairs that they have got in the past.  These people who farm their own property and who have considerable grounds to keep up do deserve special treatment.  They have been exceedingly badly treated in the past by this Government.  I do not want to keep on repeating this but the Minister will know that when that socialistically disposed Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Lloyd George, was putting heavy tax of a socialistic character on the community he made exception in these very cases I am pleading for.  He looked into the case of those people who live on their own properties and who spend a very large percentage of their income in outgoings and he said: &ldquo;They are entitled to special relief and I will give them relief in this Bill.  I will allow them exemption from income tax on all the money they spend on the maintenance of their places.  By maintenance, I do not mean their living but repair of their houses and upkeep of their places.&rdquo;  That has been virtually all swept away by our Government and there is an increasing burden of taxation on these, what I call, remnants of demesne owners. They are no longer landlords.</P>
    <P>I do not want anyone to believe I <Col N="1820" /> am making a plea for landlords.  Landlords have ceased to exist.  These are remnants of the land owners, living in these places, who cannot get any rent.  They are leaders of sport, leaders of local society, leaders, very often, of the Local Defence Force, who are being taxed on income they never receive.  There is a way of giving them relief and I hope the Government will consider it.  I make an earnest plea. that there should be some restitution of the reliefs that they had in the past, which were given by a socialistically disposed Government, before the countries were separated, and which now is the only means by which many of them can be saved from, practically, economic extinction.</P>

I had no reason to find fault with the criticisms of the financial policy, at any rate, in the remarks of Senator Hayes.  I could not accept all that he said.  I could not accept his point of view in many matters but I could not say that his speech was an unreasonable speech.

      <P>That is how the Senator's speech impressed me&mdash;that it was not at all unreasonable, and that it would be worth while having a debate on the matter that he dealt with. I would be happy at any time to debate it here or elsewhere.  The type of speech that Senator Baxter made that day was one that deserved the type of answer that he got.  I do not think it is correct for Senator Baxter to say, as he said this afternoon, that the Minister for Finance is not sufficiently wide awake to the conditions of the present time.  The very fact that we have had such a Bill brought in here, such additional taxation and such a long and detailed discussion on the subject of the Finance Bill, means that there has been necessity to change matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Baxter that there is no great originality.  I made a similar remark the last day and I repeat it to-day, in regard to the type of taxation that is embodied in this Finance Bill.  I said the last day that <Col N="1822" /> I would be very happy and obliged to any Senator who would provide anything in the way of a new or original suggestion for taxation.  It would help me very much as I have not been able to think of anything unique or original.  All the taxes embodied in this Bill have been used elsewhere at some time or other.  Some of them&mdash; the excess corporation profits tax, for instance&mdash;certainly are new, but not new as far as the Minister for Finance is concerned.  I could not find fault with the Senator's statement that there is no inspiration in the method of collecting these taxes.  There may not be inspiration, but there is a good deal of efficiency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, perseverance and efficiency.  The general complaint is that our tax collectors are too efficient.  The net is wide and anybody who should come within the net cannot escape.  Anything the law allows the revenue people to take in the way of taxation, they make sure to get.  I agree that we have not advanced as far as we might have in the way of industrialising this country, but we have gone a good distance on the road. We have in existence now industries that were not thought of 20 years ago. Some of them were not thought possible for this country even ten years ago Some of them are making good profits and earning good wages for the people employed in them.  If we had got more encouragement of the type that Senator Baxter gave us this afternoon, in regard to that matter, we would have still more; but every effort that was made got nothing but the most hostile criticism from Senator Baxter and those associated with him during the last nine years.</P>

      <P>The list would show that while we were building up the industrial arm on one side&mdash;though we may not have been doing so as rapidly as the Senator now would wish&mdash;we were not neglecting agriculture on the other side.  Agriculture had gone through a hard time&mdash;no one can deny that&mdash;in the trying period from 1929 to 1932.  That was a particularly depressing time, when prices were not merely falling but tumbling down rapidly.  The value of our agricultural produce of all kinds was practically halved in a few years.  Then we had the economic dispute with England and the restriction on our agricultural produce.  That certainly did not help the farmer, either, to get a profitable return for his goods.  This Government tried to meet that and did meet it to some extent.  However, there is no use in going into all that, as it is ancient history, but I do not want to let the Senator get away with the statement that we were not doing our duty to the country during the last nine years, either on the industrial side or the agricultural side.  We may not have done all that was required of us, and there is bound to be argument on that point.  Certainly there was no lack of activity or imagination, and there was no lack of goodwill for the farmer any more than for the industrialist.</P>
      <P>I have just got the figures for the last three years for the value of our agricultural production, as given in the last issue of the official <i>Trade Journal</i>, showing the total value as follows: 1937-38, £49,662,000; 1938-39, £53,481,000; 1939-40, £60,799,000.</P>

      <P>It may be that I have not the courage I had then, but perhaps because of my grey hairs, what little of them I have left, I look at things a little more carefully, and at the consequences of acts a little more carefully than when I was more hotblooded, 25 or 30 years ago.  Maybe I am a little slower in action, but I do not think the country will be any the worse off because I hold such a responsible position as I hold to-day.  The ideals of this country and the ideals <Col N="1826" /> that were then dominant in my mind I have not forgotten, and with my colleagues I try as best I can, when we believe that they will be for the benefit and welfare of the country, to put them into operation.  I agree with Senator Baxter that our people are suffering through not having supplies.  They cannot get coal, paraffin oil and candles in some parts, and, of course, the Government is there to blame for all that.</P>
      <P>The Government does not deserve the entire blame for the lack of these things, because there is nothing that this Government or any other Government could do under present circumstances that would get as much coal as there was here even 12 months ago. It cannot be got in the home of coal, Great Britain, the best coal country in Europe.  They are short of coal and they cannot get it for vital industries. They are taking men out of the Army and out of the Navy and out of the munition factories and trying to put them back to get coal.  When that is practically our only source of supply, how can we expect that they will give us coal?  I should like to be in a position to say, as Minister for Finance, that no cattle would go to England unless they would give us something like coal.  It would be a very happy position, as far as the supplies of coal and petrol are concerned, but it would be no use.  We would be told very quickly: &ldquo;Keep your cattle.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is the problem.  I believe the Government, under present circumstances, could not find a solution of that difficulty.  We are trying.  We have some coal in this country.  We have certain hard coals, such as anthracite, at Castlecomer, and the people there tell us they are working to the fullest extent.  That is what we are told.  We have founded a company to mine coal at Slievardagh. The Government has provided the capital.  As no private enterprise was found to come along to develop that coalfield the Government has undertaken the task.  The Minister for Finance, out of the Exchequer, is to <Col N="1827" /> provide the money to do it.  Perhaps the Senator agrees that it ought to have been done long ago.  That may be so, but when we did try anything of that kind in the last nine years we all know what sort of reception it got from the Senator's Party.</P>

      <P>Were it not for the activities of the Turf Board and the drainage of bogs that the board completed in the area where they are operating, we would be much poorer by hundreds of thousands of tons of turf than we will be.  The work of drainage has taken years.  If they had not done that we would be much poorer to-day.  They got very little help from the Senator's Party.  That is putting it mildly.  I know we are short of a great many of the raw materials that the Senator refers to.  Our main source of supply was Great Britain.  We are still getting some supplies, and I hope we will continue to get them so that employment may continue and that our people may be able to live and to an extent enjoy the comforts that they are used to.  But the Senator admitted <Col N="1828" /> that these were abnormal times. They are quite abnormal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know that these are very difficult times and we realise that the people who used supply us with raw materials and fuel are going through difficult times.  We have tried reason and argument with these people as to the advantages that are here readily accessible to them.  They <Col N="1829" /> have not seen fit to accept that point of view.  Over and over again, it has been put up to them.  I do not want to say any more on that subject.  I do not think that it would be the least bit helpful.</P>
      <P>In reply to a remark by Senator Douglas, that he would prefer an increase in income-tax to a tax on industry, it would certainly have been much easier for the Minister for Finance to have put an additional 2/- on the income-tax and drop all the other taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Senator did not mention a specific figure but I have to think of the figure. I could have put an additional 2/- on the income-tax but I wonder what sort of reception I should have got here if I came in with that proposition.  The war may not be over before next year and, so far as I can see, when the next Finance Bill comes along, I may be in a position to please the Senator by increasing income-tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little hope of that.  It is natural that, as the war goes on and expenses become greater, taxation will increase.  We shall be looking for taxation in almost every direction.  The taxes are heavy at present.  I have no desire to minimise the burden the country is bearing.  The country should be told what it is bearing and how the money is being spent. Everybody in the country should know and feel that.  It seems to me that, if the present emergency continues and if the demands for expenditure continue, the likelihood of reduced taxation next year is remote.  On the contrary, taxation will, probably, be heavier next year than it is this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of employment, mentioned by Senator Douglas last day, and to which I omitted to reply, I should personally do everything I could to keep my own staff in <Col N="1830" /> employment.  I should take any step in reason to keep them in employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator referred to the provision of credit.  He is quite right.  Up to last year, the Government did not directly provide credit but they did go to the standing committee of the banks and to the governors of the Bank of Ireland and asked them to provide credits for people who wished to lay in stocks.  So far as my information goes, the banks compiled with that request readily and generously.  Stocks were laid in all over the country but by, as the Senator said, people who had credit.  It is quite true to say that not until the past few months did this country suffer because of the emergency to any extent.  We were living our normal life until the past few months.  It is only in these days that, to quote Senator Douglas, we are beginning to &ldquo;feel the pinch&rdquo;.  That we did not do so previously was due to the foresight of manufacturers and traders and, if I may say so, to the foresight of the Government, who, long before the war, had arranged with the banks to provide the necessary credits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the statement that the Government had arranged with the banks to make the necessary credit available misled Senator Hawkins and other people. They did not arrange credit with the banks.  They asked them to do their best in giving credit.  The people concerned did not get credit otherwise than on their own assets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>

      <P>I know something of the difficulties of demesne owners, to which Sir John Keane referred.  I have had a few cases of that type before me since I became Minister for Finance.  We have done everything possible in these cases.  I have had letters from two owners, with whom Senator Sir John Keane is, probably, familiar, thanking me for the considerable help given and for making things light for them, so far as that could be done within the law.  I have had letters thanking the Minister for Finance for the time, energy and help given by the officials to work out ways and means where the burden on them could be lightened. That has been done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is the third of the three measures under which the system of local government will be changed and reorganised. The first of the three measures was the Public Assistance Act, 1939, which made further and better provision in relation to public assistance and which assumed the establishment of the county manager system.  The second was the County Management Act of last year which extended the council manager plan of local government at present in operation in the principal cities to the remainder of the country.  Having regard to the explanatory memorandum which was circulated with the Bill I do not think it is necessary at this stage to refer in detail to its provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Part II of the Bill it is essential, in view of the necessity for having a proficient personnel at the service of local bodies, to establish a system of recruitment and control calculated to achieve that result.  Conditions of service will be placed on a uniform basis and much of the detail which at present is dealt with by the central authority can under the Bill be dealt with locally under general regulations.  An important change was made in the Dáil in regard to officers and servants of vocational education committees and committees of agriculture by excluding them from Part II of the Bill as it was felt that they should continue to be dealt with in separate Acts.  Section 23 contains new provisions with regard to age limits on retirement.  At present there is no limit for retirement of local officers and in practice officers remain in service <Col N="1833" /> until well advanced in years unless they become permanently incapacitated.  It was suggested to local bodies some years ago that they should fix age limits but they felt uncertain of their powers and very few took any action. Experience has shown that it is desirable that there should be some rule with regard to compulsory retirement on the ground of age.  The same age of retirement may not be suitable for every class of office and so it is proposed to allow the retiring age to be fixed by grades and classes, as well as for particular offices.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides safeguards against arbitrary and unjust actions against local officers.  Section 25 lays down the procedure to be followed before an officer can be removed.  It gives statutory recognition to what has become the practice in cases of this kind.  Every officer who is charged with dereliction of duty in relation to his office is given an opportunity of answering such charges.  This customary procedure will be given statutory force.  Section 10 gives a right of appeal to the Minister by any officer who is aggrieved by a decision in relation to his remuneration, duties or conditions of service.</P>
    <P>There is a small amendment of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, under which certain posts are filled on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commissioners.  Under that Act the commissioners prescribe qualifications with the concurrence of the Minister. Under the Bill the Minister will prescribe the qualifications after consultation with the commissioners.  Section 27 of the Bill is a re-enactment in slightly amended form of Section 11 of the Act of 1926, relating to the suspension of officers which will cease to have effect except for those local officers and employees such as officers of vocational education committees that do not come within Part II of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with the constitution and procedure of local authorities.  As the executive functions of local bodies will be carried out by county managers it is proposed to effect a reduction in membership.  Where the number of members of a county council is less <Col N="1834" /> than 30 the number of members will be not less than 20 and in other cases not less than two-thirds the present membership.  For urban areas the Minister will fix the number of members in accordance with an amendment introduced in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It will be possible, within the limit of the reduction of the total membership proposed in the Bill, to keep a fairly standard ratio between population and membership, and at the same time preserve the representative character of the council, since it will be elected by county electoral areas.  Within a county the ratio between population of each county electoral area and the number of members to be returned therefor will be as far as practicable the same.</P>
    <P>From an examination of the last census figures it is unlikely that any general alteration of the existing county electoral areas as fixed in 1925 will be found necessary.  Where the population of any particular electoral area has fallen substantially since 1926 the number of members may be reduced by more than one for that area, but generally the reduction may be taken as one member for each county electoral area.  There will be not less than three members for any electoral area.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for the making of a fresh division of the county into county electoral areas.  Any general alteration of existing county electoral areas is not contemplated, and only such changes will be made as are essential to keep the representation of the areas as far as possible equal within the county.  Section 43, relating to the election of mayors and chairman, is designed to overcome the deadlocks that have occasionally occurred in connection with such elections.</P>
    <P>Part IV is in substitution for the present law enabling local authorities to be dissolved.  Under the new provisions only the members are removed while the legal continuity of the corporate body is preserved.  No other important change is made.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Section 57 in Part V is to disqualify rate defaulters for membership of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Section 61 with regard <Col N="1835" /> to the rating of divided hereditaments are intended to meet the case of divided holdings which do not appear as divided on the valuation list.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Part VI confer borrowing powers upon the public assistance authorities similar to those exercised by boards of guardians under the Local Government Act, 1898.</P>
    <P>Part VII deals with the audit of the accounts of local authorities, the fixing of fees for such audits and clarifies the law with respect to the recovery of surcharges. It is proposed to introduce a yearly period of account and audit as the normal period, while leaving it open to the Minister in special cases to provide for a half-yearly period.  This change is made on the ground of administrative convenience.</P>
    <P>Part VIII of the Bill deals with approved local councils.  Last year the Seanad debated at some length the question of the establishment of parish councils and it is not necessary for me now to retrace the ground covered then.  The Bill contains four sections under which local councils established in rural areas may be approved by the county councils and can be assisted in the provision of a building for the use of the local council and in equipping it and paying in whole or in part the cost of caretaking.  The county council may utilise approved local councils by delegating functions which can be suitably entrusted to them.  The present emergency has, I think, brought home to the people generally the necessity for acting together in voluntary cooperation in order to promote their own interests.  There is much work to be done which voluntary bodies can more appropriately undertake than statutory bodies.</P>
    <P>As stated in the explanatory memorandum it is intended to bring the Bill, when it becomes law, into operation at the same time as the might be rightly described as a Public Assistance Act, 1939, and the County Management Act, 1940.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to bring the Managerial Act or this Act into operation until after an election. If there is not going to be an election, I am afraid the position is that we must bring the managerial system into operation, and if I got this Bill passed now, before the Recess or Adjournment, it would take until the first of the new year before the necessary preparations were completed for the bringing into operation of this measure and the managerial system.  We would have to get the Local Appointments Commissioners to hold interviews and to select the managers, and there are other difficulties in the way of making Statutory Rules and Orders to operate this Bill.  The intention in this Bill is that the manager should have certain powers over staffs.  He will be guided by regulations or orders issued in the ordinary way.  Acting on these regulations, he will be entitled to appoint the staffs himself.  That will have the effect, in my opinion, of removing many obstacles that are impeding to some extent the local government machine. A good deal of work will, however, devolve on the manager and the council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, I suppose, might be rightly described as a machinery measure to put into operation the previous Act which the House passed.  With regard to that measure, and this Bill, which is complementary to it, I have the same view as I held when that measure was before the <Col N="1837" /> House.  I am against the principle of both of them.  I do not believe that local government in this country is going to benefit by this alteration in the law.  I think that there were faults and weaknesses possibly in the law, as there were faults and weaknesses in certain local authorities, but I do not think that the measures which the Minister has introduced are going to bring any considerable improvement&mdash; if any improvement at all&mdash;in our system of local government.  That is my conviction.  If I had the slightest feeling to the contrary I would say so just as frankly.  My view about this is that instead of the old system we are going to get through this Bill what one of my colleagues here described as a type of local government civil service. I agree that it is of very great importance to have the officials in our local services competent, trustworthy and reliable.  If there is, however, one thing more than another that terrifies me it is the proposal to pass over into the hands of officials, completely and absolutely, almost full control and an absolute right to govern in local affairs practically without reference to the people governed at all.</P>
      <P>I think that after a few years' experience of the operations of these Acts we shall find that the affairs of the people in the country are being run by a group of officials.  I am not suggesting that they will not be competent officials.  In fact, they can become too competent.  So competent can they become that they will be removed almost beyond the supervision or even the contact of responsible local citizens.  You can build up in rural districts a sort of aristocracy amongst officials.  They can get into groups and circles, and they will run the machine in the way they want to run it.  They can draw into the circle those men they want and exclude from it those men whom they do not want.  The management of local affairs can become a completely closed borough, with the result that very few will be brought into that sufficiently close and intimate contact with the administration of local affairs to get the thorough understanding of them which they should have.  Personally I am against that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1838" /> In addition, I am not anything like so optimistic as to believe that in these staffs which you are going to build up, you are going to have no failures.  You will have failures; just as all humans have weaknesses, faults and failings this organisation which you are building will have its weaknesses and failures.  But we shall not hear so much about these failures and failings as we hear about them now.  This new officialdom will have methods and ways of its own of throwing its cloak around failures, weaknesses and mistakes. The net result will be, in my judgment, to create in the minds of taxpayers, ordinary citizens who should be intimately interested and associated with all that is happening in local government, a sort of contempt. They will feel that the system and they are not part of the same human organism at all, that it is something removed from them, something in which they have no part and for which they will not take responsibility. It is true that they will not have responsibility.  They will not have that close contact which all responsible citizens should have with the government of local affairs.  I think that is definitely bad.  I think that eventually there will develop a mentality and an atmosphere in which the country people will become more distraught, disturbed, impatient, and intolerant of the system, and that the action which they take to upset it may upset more than local government.</P>
    <P>I think it is a sign of definite weakness for the State to make up its mind that it must in this fashion centralise authority as we are doing.  We would be making the foundations of the State far more solid by placing trust and confidence in the people locally, by inculcating a better civic spirit than by taking away responsibilities which in themselves develop that type of mind and that type of citizen which are good and in fact essential for the country to have.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, it is proposed to reduce the membership of county councils.  In a way I do not know why they should be called county councils.  You are going to give them authority to levy a rate and advise the county manager <Col N="1839" /> but, as I see it, the county manager will be advised by the engineers, the doctors and the other local officers, and the share the county councils will have in the management of affairs will be so trifling and so unreal that I am just wondering how it will work out.  The Minister proposes to reduce the number of county councillors, but I think the experience at present is that ratepayers and the poor generally are too far removed from their local representatives.</P>
    <P>In fact, a great many people are questioning the wisdom of the amalgamation scheme which was put through after the establishment of our national Government.  A great many are arguing, with a certain amount of truth, that attention to the treatment of the poor is much less marked to-day than it was 25 years ago.  Now we are going further to reduce the number of people who are supposed to have any kind of direct contact with the great masses of the ratepaying public and the people generally.  We cannot be helped by any form of organisation which we have in existence at the moment in our local authorities.</P>
    <P>While it may be true that in some counties the numbers are too great I question the wisdom of that decision. In fact, by reducing the numbers and making the areas larger which an individual is supposed to represent, you are making a bigger break between the tax-paying public and the authority to which they pay their taxes and with which they are supposed to maintain contact through local representatives. I think the reduction which the Minister is suggesting is a weakness in the measure but if that is to be, then I think the only possible hope of maintaining interest and having your local authorities in any way responsive to local feeling is to go definitely in for a policy of organising parish councils everywhere.  The organisation of parish councils is absolutely as essential and as complementary to the operation of the legislation which is embodied in the three measures to which the Minister referred, as this measure we are passing to-day is to the previous one. <Col N="1840" /> When you are establishing a county manager in place of the county council with all the authority and power which we are vesting in him by legislation, when you are reducing the numbers of councils and thereby the number of people who are going to have direct contact with the rate-paying public and the poor who want assistance of various kinds, unless you can create something new, something which does not exist at the moment, to take the place of the organisations that existed in the past, you will not be able to maintain any sort of reasonable contact, any sort of sympathy and understanding between the new organisation that is supposed to be a local authority and the poor and the ratepayers of the county.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential that the Minister should take action to secure that you have in every parish the ratepayers of the area organised, that they are active and alert and that they keep an intelligent eye on what is being done by the county manager and by the officials, that they should keep informed, through their representatives, as to the reasons why various decisions are being arrived at and various lines of policy are being pursued.  If that were done you might be able to put something else to take the place of the structure which has existed up to the present.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be very optimistic about the managerial scheme, about the saving to the ratepayers, about the more efficient administration of public services of one kind or another and so on.  You may think you are doing much better.  On paper, from the reports of inspectors and so on, it may appear that it is a success but, at the same time, as far as the public may be concerned it might be that it was so remote from them that it would be a hopeless failure.  I think, in the first place, it is a great mistake to depart from the principle of responsibility that was enshrined in the legislation which we have operated up to the present in this country with regard to the management of local affairs.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that some local authorities have not been as competent, as efficient or as satisfactory as <Col N="1841" /> one would like them to be.  I am equally satisfied that the new system which is going to replace these will prove just as faulty and weak in spots as the old one, but what I fear most is that, when these faults are discovered, the desire to overthrow it all and to get rid of it all will become so strong that there will be reactions of a far-reaching consequence that we ought not to run the risk of having to face. In so far as it is possible to avoid this loss of contact between the people who are to be governed locally and the people who do the governing, I urge that the Minister should make it part of his plan, if he wants his scheme to be reasonably effective, to have organisations in every area&mdash;in the parishes preferably, as far as rural districts are concerned anyhow.  There should be organisations in every area where the voice of the ratepaying public and the voice of the charitable, who could speak on behalf of the poor, could be heard.  I think if that form of organnisation were brought into existence there would be reasonable contact between these officials and the local people.</P>
    <P>No matter how well-meaning the officials may be, after a certain number of years in high office we know what kind of development must come about and how far they will get not alone from having respect for the people whose money they are spending and whom they are expected to govern, but from the point of view even of the men who will sit down beside them at a table to advise them.  I think that is inevitable when men are put in as county members to be there for a period of 15 or 20 years, and who can only be removed by the Minister, and when he has around him a number of others in the same strong position.  As far as the ratepayers and the poor are concerned the officials will be in such a strong position that unless the people are organised in a way they are not at the moment the relationship between the governed and the government will become so strained that local government will get into a much more unsatisfactory position than it is in to-day.</P>
    <P>Personally I have no enthusiasm for <Col N="1842" /> these measures at all.  I do not like this bureaucratic method.  I think, when all is said and done, there is not much between totalitarianism of one type or another on the Continent, and this sort of organisation which we are trying to construct.  In fact, it is all leading towards the same end, leading away from the people.  I do not know, whether in the name of democracy or not, you are justified in going on with it.  But I do feel that when you are taking this step you must provide every possible safeguard to see that the worst may not happen and that the point of view of the ratepaying public and the poor will be listened to and respected as we have been accustomed to have it respected in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I am quite satisfied, will have his measure.  He must, in view of the fact that the other Bill is passed, but I suggest to him that there is no such urgency at the moment as would justify asking that the Committee Stage of this Bill be put through the House in a week or two.  It is a colossal measure.  In fact, what study I have been able to give to it leads me to believe that you can only study it satisfactorily by reference to a number of Acts.  The Minister is asking a great deal.</P>
    <P>In view of the Minister's decision to introduce a Bill postponing the elections, I do not know what he thinks is going to take place that he wants to get this measure this side of the adjournment of the Seanad.  I suggest that nothing would be lost by leaving the Committee Stage until the House reassembles in the autumn.  In the meantime I think we would have a better opportunity of examining it because although from a cursory examination it seems very complete in every detail, one may discover later that in fact the measure is altogether too complete.  That, I think, would be a much greater mistake.  While we admit that local government at the moment is perhaps in the same lethargic state that exists in affairs generally, I do not believe that it is going to be improved by clamping down the managerial system on county councils <Col N="1843" /> that have been many years in office.  I doubt very much if it would be a wise decision on the Minister's part to introduce the managerial system in the atmosphere that must prevail in most of these councils that have been functioning for a number of years.  I put it to the Minister that he ought to consider that point of view.  In my opinion it might be rather a mistake. If the Minister intends to make this change he had better make it at a time when he is making a complete change, so that he can see that the whole thing gets a fresh start by fresh minds approaching the problem in a fresh way.</P>

      <P>There is much reason in Senator Baxter's appeal not to be in too great a hurry in disposing of this measure finally.  As he suggests, it is a highly complex Bill which contains a vast mass of difficult detail&mdash; difficult to digest and apply&mdash;and it is probably the last measure, in these days of local government reforms, that we shall be called upon to deal with for many years.  In view of these considerations, it seems to me to be not an unreasonable request that we should be allowed more time to study it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to an ambiguity, as it seems to me, in one of the sections.  This has a peculiar interest for the citizens of Dublin.  It is in Section 43, dealing with the procedure at the election of a lord mayor, mayor or chairman.  When I read this first, I guessed that its purpose was to put an end to the possibility of a recurrence of such things as were witnessed in Cork and Sligo.  I was pleased to hear from the Minister that my guess was correct, when he said that it was due to the deadlock that had occurred in certain elections.  I would point out to him that, while the purpose is highly commendable, perhaps, he has overlooked that there is a scheme with regard to the lord mayor of this city which has worked admirably.  It was devised in connection with the Greater Dublin scheme and, strange to say, everyone was satisfied with it, and stranger still, <Col N="1844" /> everyone is perfectly satisfied that it meets the equities of the situation.  I would respectfully suggest that to supplant it by this would be a mistake. When you have a local government procedure acceptable to and praised by everyone, and working with excellent efficiency, why not allow it to continue&mdash;even though it is an exception to the procedure that obtains everywhere else?</P>
    <P>The ambiguity to which I refer occurs in sub-section (a) of Section 43, which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the proceedings shall begin by a member or members being proposed and seconded and no person who is not then proposed and seconded shall be a candidate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is the word &ldquo;then&rdquo; to which I refer.  We are not being told the stage at which, or the method by which, the proposing and seconding of candidates is to take place.  What we are told is that no one who is not then&mdash;that is, at some unspecified time&mdash;proposed and seconded shall be admissible as a candidate.  I can see that the intention is to cut off the possibility of new proposals of candidates later in the proceedings. If that is what is meant by &ldquo;then&rdquo;&mdash;namely, that when some two candidates or more have been proposed the list is full, final and definitive and that at no later stage shall other candidates be proposed&mdash;I can see that that will effect a change in regard to the City of Dublin which is undesirable.</P>
    <P>I point out to the Minister, for example, that there are more than two parties or groups representing various public interests in a particular council. It is obvious that if Section 43 becomes the law of the land, no representative of a small group has an earthly chance of becoming Mayor, as he must be proposed at whatever time and in whatever circumstances the representatives selected by the larger groups are proposed as rival candidates. The voting takes place immediately, and he receives the smallest number of votes, as is naturally to be <Col N="1845" /> expected, and then, by the sub-section providing for elimination he immediately is eliminated and his chance is gone.  There is no survival.  Everyone who becomes a member of the corporation of the capital city, no matter how great his public spirit or how devoted his services to the community, is left without any chance of ever becoming the Lord Mayor if he belongs to one of the minor parties or groups.</P>
    <P>At the present time there is a possibility&mdash;a bare possibility, but still a real possibility&mdash;of an arrangement being made, by compromise and exchanges, which might mean his reaching the object of his ambition and the reward of his public service.  Moreover, as we have seen, it contributes to more amicable relations between the different groups and that is a blessing in a corporation which used to be remarkable for the series of scenes which were the delight of the reporter's heart and which almost every week&mdash; and sometimes several times in the week&mdash;resulted in captions such as &ldquo;Another Scene at the Corporation Meeting&rdquo;.  There are better relations between the different representatives and different Parties ever since the Greater Dublin Scheme began to function. I would ask the Minister to take that into account.  An exception could be made in the case of the city, as it is exceptional in many respects.  At any rate it is the capital of the country.</P>
    <P>Speaking of that brings me on by easy transition to the managerial system.  I have advocated the managerial system persistently as well as consistently, but I do admit that it is subject to the charge that has to be made so frequently, that it tends to the creation of personal dictatorship in the functioning of the manager.  I have always been ready, therefore, to admit that, in the perfection of the local government system, the counterbalance was required of developing a local authority in which the individual membership would count for much in respect of local knowledge of local requirements, that the necessary set-off or corrective of the managerial system was the emergence of the parish council <Col N="1846" /> as local authority.  I had counted on this Bill as providing for that, and I regret to find that there is no such provision.</P>
    <P>There is one other item with regard to which I would not detain the House, were it not that it seems to be somewhat academic.  Section 23 begins:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The appropriate Minister may declare any specified age to be the age limit for all offices in relation to which he is the appropriate Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is giving a certain autocratic discretion to each Minister which seems to me somewhat at variance with the care and insistence with which each appointment to office is dealt with in the Bill.  In Section 21, and especially sub-section (10) of that section there is great stress laid on the qualifications relating to character, age, health, education, experience, residence and so on.  There is what appears to be unnecessary repetition in sub-section (10):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Local Appointments Commision shall before recommending a person to a local authority for appointment to any office, satisfy themselves that such person possesses the requisite knowledge and ability for the proper discharge of the duties of such office&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Now these are undoubtedly very satisfactory provisions, an assurance to the public that no one is appointed to an office who is not a fit and proper person to fill such office, and that all care would be taken to secure that this ideal is satisfied, but then side by side with this the Minister is to declare artifically, and because artifically, arbitrarily, I suggest, that this highly qualified appointee is to go out of office.  Surely if he has all these qualifications his continuance in office should be so long as he exhibits these qualifications.  In other words, I am protesting not against this particular measure, but against the whole system that we took over from the British régime of getting rid of a man, not <Col N="1847" /> because he is no longer able to fulfil a position but because his birthday is such and such.  It is leading to additional taxation on a highly taxed people and merely because the calendar says this is the 16th July, 1941, we say &ldquo;out you go&rdquo;.  To-day, according to present requirements we say to one of these eminently qualified officials: &ldquo;Notwithstanding that experience in discharge of the duties and experience of life and of the world and of men is an important qualification and you have got years of service, because to-day is the 16th July, 1941, you must leave and another man shall be advertised for. The Appointments Committee shall vet him and certify that he is a person qualified to begin the discharge of the duties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The outgoing official receives superannuation allowance and the incoming official receives salary for the years in which he is acquiring that capacity. The man who had acquired that capacity is rewarded with dismissal for having acquired it.  I have no hesitation in calling that an arbitrary and unreasonable system which ought to be ended.  In this Bill which is supposed to be the last word&mdash;and in many respects I am bound to say it is the last word&mdash;in the perfection of our local government system it is perpetuated. The only reason I can see for it is that it has been the custom, but if that consideration is to prevail why have any amending Bills?  An amending Bill presupposes that something is being changed.  If the fact that it is the custom is sufficient justification the amendment is not justified.  However, that may be regarded as a comment on an academic principle of government rather than a contribution to discussion on this particular measure.  It is, I submit, relevant because it is perpetuated in regard to what might be called our local civil service as distinct from our national Civil Service.  To me experience is a very high form of capacity.  Enlightened experience is efficiency and efficiency is what we look for in our public officials.  When we have got it are we going to look at the calendar and say this man must go and some other is to come in?  That seems <Col N="1848" /> to me to be a radically faulty system. If we had more time there might be a further opportunity to mature our views on this matter, and I join with Senator Baxter in asking the Minister to give us more time to allow us to digest it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I do not share the doleful anticipation of my colleague, Senator Baxter, with regard to what will happen if this Bill becomes law.  The Bill is an effort to complete the codification of the law governing local government, but that completion when made is only a step, though perhaps an important step, towards achieving what is, I believe, the ultimate ideal of the local government system&mdash;that there should be a fertile and happy association between local democracy and local public opinion on the one hand and expert administration, both central and local, on the other.  Now the great fault of the old local government system which is now in the process of being revolutionised was that it confused the function of deliberation and the decision of policy, which is the proper function of a representative body, and the function of administration, which is the proper function of expert administration. The tendency of our changes in local government has been to find a place for expert administration in local government as well as in central government, and it now only remains to put the coping stone on that process by establishing the foundation of what I hope will be the happy relation between the local representative institutions and the expert officials who administer their affairs.  Now this Bill is an effort to codify the law dealing with local government, and to some extent a successful effort, and it has to be considered not merely in itself but in conjunction with two previous Bills, the Public Assistance Bill, which is now an Act, and with the County Management Bill, which is now an Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to realise that, until this third Bill is enacted, the very valuable provisions contained in the other two Bills which have been enacted cannot be put into effect, so that, unless we <Col N="1849" /> complete the passing of this Bill reasonably soon, the legislative framework of local government is likely to remain in a much less perfect condition than it would be if all three Bills had not only been enacted but put into operation.</P>
    <P>Accompanying this Bill, as well as the other two, there was a memorandum, prepared, no doubt, by the Minister's expert officials, which threw a certain amount of light on the background of the problem which the Bill is an attempt to solve.  Yes, I confess that I read that memorandum at least twice without deriving as much enlightenment from it as I should have derived.  That may indicate either my lack of intelligence or my excessive ignorance of local government affairs from the inside.  I frankly confess that I do not know as much about the inner workings of our local government system as it is desirable any reasonably intelligent citizen should know.  The Minister should, as soon as these three Bills have been enacted and are in working order, endeavour to enlighten the ignorance of persons like me by completing another memorandum in much fuller detail, with illustrations from the concrete working of the local government machine in all its aspects, which would make it possible for a reasonably intelligent person to understand the essential principles of the working of that machine.  That would be a valuable contribution to the education of citizens, not to mention Senators.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is passed, the legislative framework of local government will be complete but, in a sense, the legislative background of local government, though important, is not of paramount importance.  Far more important will be the spirit in which the new local government machine, both centrally and locally, will be administered both by the Local Government Department and the local administrative institutions. There have been serious complaints that the Local Government Department, so far from encouraging initiative and a sense of legitimate adventure on the part of local authorities, <Col N="1850" /> has been inclined to slow down the working of the local machine, and that there have been quite inexcusable delays on the part of the central authority in ratifying the policies which certain enterprising local authorities were anxious to put forward for the good of their areas and of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not know with what justification those complaints have been made but, if they were made, perhaps the answer that could be given by the Local Government Department would be that, not having the confidence that it would like to have in the expert qualities of local expert administrators, it has to exercise a much closer supervision of the doings of local authorities than it would have to exercise if it had that confidence.  If that be the reason for the undue delays that have been complained of, I hope that, once this new machinery is in operation and we have expert administrators operating in every county and urban district, the central authority will leave a good deal of the local initiative and discretion to those authorities, acting in conjunction with their experts, that there will be an end of this pettifogging, grandmotherly supervision, of which so much has been heard, and that there will be a considerable speed-up in dealing with the various problems of local government which, in many parts of the country, are clamouring for solution.</P>
    <P>Our local governing institutions derive their powers from a number of laws, some of which go back as far as 1838 and all of which have, up to now, been scattered at random, more or less, throughout the years that have elapsed since the original Poor Law Act was passed.  The fact that these powers were derived from so many heterogeneous sources must have been a serious complication to the authorities concerned, because the bogey of <i>ultra vires</i> was likely to haunt the conscientious administrator at every turn.  That principle seems to be at the root of local government as it has hitherto existed in England&mdash;the principle that, so far as a local governing authority is concerned, everything it is not specifically allowed to do by law is forbidden. <Col N="1851" /> Consequently, the local authority has to quote chapter and verse of the law for every power which it chooses to exercise.  In my ignorance and, perhaps, looking at the matter from to academic a point of view, I do not see why the opposite principle should not be introduced and given effect&mdash;the principle that everything which is not forbidden a local authority by law is allowed to do.  Why should a local authority not have the same right of adventure within the law that every individual citizen possesses?  Why should their corporate personalities be limited in law in a way that other personalities&mdash;corporate or incorporate&mdash; are not limited?  There may be some answer to that.  If there is I should like to hear it.</P>
    <P>On a former occasion, I suggested that the office of the county council might be not only the office in which the affairs of the county council would be administered but also an office in which a bureau of civic information might be maintained, to which citizens could go and have consultation with reference to their civic rights and liabilities, the kind of place, for example, where a claimant for a widow's pension might be able to get expert advice as to whether or not she was entitled to such a pension.  At present, there are many different sources of information about these matters and no single focus where all these sources are brought together.  In respect of some matters, the citizen must refer to the post office.  For other purposes, he must refer to the Gárda barracks.  The chief contact he has with the county council office consists of his half-yearly payment of rates.  I should like to see all those various aspects of public activity&mdash; central and local&mdash;focussed in a bureau of civic administration attached to the office of the county manager.  Perhaps he would not be directly administering any of these services, but he would render a useful service if he brought together, under one roof, all the information that a citizen could possibly desire to have with reference to his civic rights and liabilities.</P>
    <P>And, finally, if I may have a second <Col N="1852" />&ldquo;finally,&rdquo; in the course of these remarks, I should like to give a special welcome to the proposal to associate the county councils in a helpful way with the parish councils which are growing up throughout the country. There is a great deal of wisdom in Senator Magennis's contention that unless we complement this new local administrative machine by some other institution which will be more closely involved in the daily life of the people, there is some danger of the growth of a bureaucratic spirit.  Personally, I am not inclined to accept it that there is a danger, but, nevertheless, the possibility exists, and helpful, friendly cooperation between the county councils and the parish councils, would assist in bringing a breeze of human refreshment, so to speak, into the relations between the county councils and the people whose affairs they administer.</P>

      <P>The first reaction most of us had when we received this Bill was to thank God that while democratic institutions all over Europe are being threatened, are being tanked and machine-gunned, in this country God has been so good to us that, after two years of what one may call a world war, we can devote ourselves to work of reconstruction and to the strengthening of working democracy.  That is the real significance of the trilogy which the passing of this Bill will complete, the Public Assistance Act of 1939, the County Management Act of 1940 and the Bill we are now considering.  The great importance of these Bills, in my opinion, is that they strengthen democracy. That is their whole aim. Democracy is on its trial.  It must be as efficient as the Totalitarianism to which it is fundamentally opposed, and it is because that is what we aim at, that we are glad the Minister, in the midst of all the heavy obligations and duties placed on him by the present emergency, has found time for this magnificent work of reconstruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those reasons I welcome the Bill, and congratulate the Minister on having introduced it.  There are a few points in which I am particularly interested. <Col N="1853" /> One of them is the training of managers.  I hope that the Universities will play their part, and that they will take their place as leaders of the people and give the future managers an opportunity of being trained in such parts of their duties as can be derived from books and courses of instruction.  We know quite well that a manager is not made in a library but libraries and the experience of other countries where the managerial system has been tried out, will give very efficient help to our future managers, and I hope Universities will be alive to their obligations and opportunities in this respect.</P>
    <P>I am also particularly interested in the position of what are called in the Bill approved local councils.  The term parish council has not been used, and I think there are good reasons for avoiding it, because the definition of a parish presents legal as well as other difficulties. But what gives vitality to parish councils has been appreciated in this Bill.  This work of voluntary cooperation for the welfare of one's neighbours goes on in circumstances in which local knowledge is necessary, and the county councils have been given power by this Bill to help these approved local councils by giving them meeting-places and by helping with equipment.</P>
    <P>I hope that as soon as the Bill is passed, and comes into force as law, parish councils will get this help from the county council.  A great deal can be done in the present emergency. Take one problem before us to-day, the question of light.  In country places, as we have been reminded by Senator Baxter, there is a scarcity of candles. I think it should be possible for these approved local councils with a few very good women&mdash;it is very important that there should be practical women on them&mdash;to arrange for making what our great grandmothers used in their day, tallow candles.  There should be a pooling of parish resources.  That is only one case in which parish councils could serve a very important purpose during the greedy winter everyone expects.</P>
    <P>Another matter in which I am greatly interested is the provision which is <Col N="1854" /> made in the last section for contributions to associations supplementing library services.  It is provided that the local authority may, with the consent of the Minister, pay an annual or other contribution to the funds of any association which supplements the regular library services maintained by local authorities to which the section applies, by providing books specially required by students.  That is a very important contribution to social welfare and the Minister deserves thanks for having thought of it and given expression to it in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODwyer" hpid="Mr. O'Dwyer Mr. O'Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with previous speakers that the Bill is a very complicated one and requires all the examination it can get in the Seanad.  In view of that, it is desirable that it should be held over until after the adjournment. As to the general principle of the Bill, I suppose we must agree that it is necessary in view of the Acts previously passed and which are awaiting this Bill to come into operation.  Personally, I feel sad to think that the general trend of all this legislation is to proceed further along the road to centralisation as the effect, when all is said and done, will be to remove local administration from the people.  It may be said that the Bill is necessary.  We know that there is much to be said in its favour.  There is a very poor public spirit abroad and not that sense of responsibility amongst the mass of the people that is necessary to sustain the life of democracy.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that the remedy proposed will not prove very successful, because the more responsibility is taken from the people, the less responsibility and public spirit will there be in the country.  It is sad to feel that this legislation should be necessary. I feel very strongly on one point, that the Minister has lost an opportunity of reconciling an efficient organisation, such as he has planned with the democratic cooperation of the people as envisaged in the provisions relating to the recognition of local councils.  That is not sufficient to provide a link between the mass of the people and the new bodies that it is proposed to set up in this Bill as well as the preceding Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1855" /> The clause in this Bill dealing with approved local councils seems to be rather vague.  It says that where the inhabitants of a locality in a county health district have, either before or after the commencement of this section, established a council, committee or body, that body may be recognised by the county council but it lays down no means by which such body shall be established.  It does not state how such bodies are to be established.  I think that in that connection a great opportunity has been lost.  It is desirable that there should be established these local bodies commonly called parish councils, but which in reality might be called rural councils, because it is in rural districts they are most necessary.  These councils should be distinct from urban councils.  It is generally recognised that it is desirable that rural localities should have some separate organisation of their own. The value of these organisations has been demonstrated during this crisis. The Minister will have observed the wonderful initiative and energy that have been developed by the voluntary organisations of Muintir na Tire and the parish councils in every district where they have been established.  We can contrast their enthusiasm, their energy, and their readiness to adopt new methods with the rather cumbersome machinery, the red tape and sometimes the silly cumbersome methods which have become general in Government Departments.</P>
    <P>The value of these councils and their general usefulness have been clearly demonstrated.  Everybody believes that it is desirable that such councils should be established in every parish in the country.  What I cannot understand is why the Minister should not have selected the one method by which they could be immediately established by providing that these parish councils should be elected by the people of the parish.  Why not adopt the simple method of compiling a register of the families in each parish and allow these families to elect their own councils? The procedure could be laid down by an order of the Minister under this Bill.  The powers could be defined <Col N="1856" /> afterwards or they could be delegated by the county council.  The establishment of such a council system in each rural parish on an elective basis would create at once a social unit which would be of infinite value in the social and cultural development of the country.  I would ask the Minister to consider this matter because I believe that by simply making these councils elective instead of dealing with them in the haphazard manner in which they have been dealt with up to the present, he would create a revolution in Irish society, a revolution in Irish government, which would give new life and energy to the local government system of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>After a considerable experience of local government, I think that it would be in the best interests of all concerned that this Bill should be passed within the present session. There is no doubt that councils have been elected for such a long time that they have become stale and inattentive to their work.  They are more prone to find fault with others than to look for faults in themselves and, as we can see from the Press this morning, they are very fond of finding fault with the Local Government Department.  I think the real reason for any looseness in administration is to be found at the source and that it is the councils themselves who are not so active in their work as they should be.  The fact is these local bodies have now been in office for seven years whereas the normal period is about three years.  No new blood has come into the councils and, in consequence, they have become rather stale.  At the moment there is little likelihood, and indeed I do not think it desirable that there should be, of an early election.  Meanwhile, I think the managerial system should be put into operation until such time as elections can be held.  That I take it would be in the public interest and to the benefit of ratepayers generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain remarks were made here to the effect that an age limit for officials was undesirable.  I think an age limit is most desirable, and I approved of it on the County Management Bill.  It is quite conceivable that unless there is <Col N="1857" /> an age limit you might find some managers approaching their offices in perambulators.  I do not think that is desirable.  Somebody has remarked that is an exaggeration, but it is nevertheless conceivable.  It is quite possible that a man might be capable of performing very difficult duties efficiently up to the age of 60 or 70, but he would probably be an exception.  I think it highly desirable, therefore, that there should be an age limit.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is relevant on this Bill, but I am very anxious that the Minister for Local Government should consider the present position of urban councils.  Urban authorities have reached a very serious position, inasmuch as one-fifth of the valuation in some urban towns is entirely unproductive. One-fifth of the stores, offices and other buildings has become untenanted, and there is not in these towns the business which was formerly carried on there.  The rates, between town rate and county rates, average about 25/- in the £, some of them more and some of them less.  When one-fifth of the valuation is unproductive, it means that four-fifths of the ratepayers have to bear the rate that should be borne by the unproductive one-fifth, in addition to their own rates.  It is often not possible for them to do so, so that many local authorities are not getting sufficient rates to finance their services. The Minister may tell such bodies that they are not striking a sufficiently high rate, but we have often pointed out that if you strike a very high rate it will be less productive than a reasonable one.  I do not think that any remedy lies in that direction, but something must be done to relieve the position of these urban authorities.  I suggest that the agricultural grant might be extended to such urban councils.  At present they get no agricultural grant, and the agricultural grant represents a reduction in the rate up to 7/3 in the £.  Urban towns get no benefit from that at all.  I hope the Minister in his wisdom will consider doing something similar, but, as things are at present, urban towns are going to the ground.  If that happens, it will be a bad thing for the Government. <Col N="1858" /> They were always good sources of revenue, and it would be a very bad day for the country and for the Government if urban towns were to go down badly, as they seem to be going at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I was not here to hear the Minister's speech but my remarks on this Bill will be mainly from the point of view of the officials of the local authority.  I think we need not be unduly alarmed about the subject matter of the sections relating to local authorities' officials because I believe that most of the regulations and definitions that are given here apply to local authorities at present. They seem to be very detailed and, I might say, ambiguous when put down in black and white but really they are all in existence, or practically all in existence, at present.  When one reads them it strikes one that the Minister has extraordinary powers of legislating by declaration, almost, and the declaration is then given the force of law.  I presume that he has those powers, practically, of making regulations and declarations at present but, however, that is one of the things that struck me in reading the various sections that apply to local authorities' officials. Section 20, for instance, says that the appropriate Minister may by declaration do all or any of the following things in respect of a specified office in relation to which he is the appropriate Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other thing that strikes me about that.  There are different appropriate Ministers and they may make different declarations, which would mean that different officials of local authorities may have even a different retiring age.  I would hope that such is the case.  Notwithstanding what some Senators may think as to why I was elected to this House, I am the representative of the veterinary profession here and I would like to address myself to the Minister about the position of part-time veterinary inspectors throughout the country who are appointed to do public health work, <Col N="1859" /> which is mainly the domain, I might say, of the Minister for Local Government, but who also perform duties under the Diseases of Animals Acts, which is practically entirely the domain of the Minister for Agriculture, so that they more or less have two appropriate Ministers to supervise them, in addition to their local authority.  These men are appointed on a permanent basis but they are not pensionable.  If a retiring age of, say, 65, is applied to them by declaration, it has the force of law straight away.  On reading Section 23 I fancy that we would be better served if we could define in the Bill itself what is the retiring age for the different services. Professional men cannot enter the service of a local authority at the age that a clerical officer enters, 17 or 18 or perhaps 16 years.  He cannot enter until a much later date in his life because he has to go through a professional course in the university or, as I speak on behalf of the members of the veterinary profession, through the Veterinary College.  I think that it would be very unjust if they are not made pensionable officers.  That, I think, requires a further Bill.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers have referred to this Bill as being the coping stone, more or less, of local government legislation. I think another Bill is required and it has been requested repeatedly, a Bill altering the pension regulations for local officials.  If a local official dies at present his salary is cut off the moment he dies.  He is not paid for the next day.  In the Civil Service the widow or dependents of an official&mdash;the widow at any rate&mdash;gets a certain lump sum which is portion of the money which the official has more or less contributed towards his superannuation allowance.  A lump sum is allowed on the date of death to the widow of a civil servant.  That does not apply in the case of a local authority official. The day he dies his salary is stopped. That is a thing which local officials for years have been requesting the Department of Local Government to amend. I think we require another Bill to put the coping stone to the system of local government.  It would certainly <Col N="1860" /> be of great advantage to have a uniform system for local government officials as well as of local government throughout the entire State.  Such uniformity does not obtain at present. You have officials doing similar duties at different rates of remuneration and under different conditions of service.</P>
    <P>Professor Magennis suggested, in regard to the retiring age, that a man was compelled to retire when he was at the peak of his abilities.  That may be so in very many cases and, in that case, it would be a very great hardship on an official of a local authority to be compelled to retire but, of course, there is also the other way of looking at it.  There is the young fellow coming along, to whom Senator Honan referred.  If there was no opportunity for the younger generation, they would become old men before they got a chance of being placed. That cuts both ways.  But my special appeal here is for men who are permanent but not pensionable.  I compare them to the dispensary doctors, who are pensionable.  The dispensary doctor is part-time as much as the veterinary surgeon is and the veterinary inspector is whole-time really as much as the dispensary doctor is.  If they are compelled to retire they should be retired on a pensionable basis.  If they are not compelled to retire, there is something to be said for their remaining on for the period they are suited to carry out their duties.</P>
    <P>I must say that I have not studied the meaning of Section 21, sub-section (5), which states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of the Act of 1926, none of the following qualifications shall be deemed to be professional or technical, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  certification as a midwife,</P>
    <P>(b)  registration as a nurse,</P>
    <P>(c)  any qualification relating to training or experience as a nurse or midwife,</P>
    <P>(d)  any qualification relating to the knowledge required by a nurse or midwife.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1861" /> I think it is unfair to term nurses' or midwives' qualifications as not being professional or technical.  I am rather surprised, if that is so, that Senator Mrs. Concannon did not notice this. Nurses nowadays have to go through a course and become qualified and their qualifications should be regarded as professional and certainly as technical. If it is contained in the Act of 1926, I do not approve of it.  However, as I have said, I have not studied the sections of the Act of 1926 relative to this section.</P>

Most of these detailed regulations mentioned here are in the hands of the Minister already, and to a person reading it, it would seem that everything has become centralised in the Department of Local Government or in the appropriate Minister, as mentioned in the Act.  In the County Management Act there is a clause which empowers the establishment and official recognition of the parish councils, and I understood that the introduction of parish councils would not come into this Bill at all, so that the Senators who have mentioned that can be quite satisfied that there is a provision in the County Management Act for the official recognition of parish councils.</P>

      <P>I endorse what Senator Honan has said&mdash;that there is a necessity for the Bill, and I hope that the Minister will go on with it, and let us get on with the work.  I was on a committee of three appointed by an important body to examine the Bill, and as far as I can see there is nothing controversial in it.  As far as the managerial system is concerned the principles have been agreed to already.  The Bill is necessary, and there is nothing in it which should hold it up.  Senator Baxter seems to think that the Minister would not be justified in reducing the number of members of a council.  I hold the opposite view. I am speaking subject to correction, but I think that until the 1925 Act we had a large number of representatives. Under the old county councils there was a number of co-opted people, and there were the chairmen of the different district councils.  It was a loose system, and the number in the council might run up to 60.  Under the 1925 Act that was done away with, and there were so many representatives from each area.  I would say that county councils were too large, and that we could have done more work if they had not been so large.  I am in favour of smaller bodies.  If what Senator Baxter visualises is that every district should have a member living in it, he would have to go back to the whole paraphernalia of district councils and poor law guardians, and there would be overlapping.  The present system works equally well, with the lesser number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a lot of sympathy with Senator O'Dwyer in regard to parish councils.  I gave my opinions to the Seanad some months ago on that question and still adhere to the definite idea that parish councils could do useful work.  If this Bill is to be put into operation, however, we can let it develop and if it should be necessary to have a new Bill giving statutory powers to parish councils, that could be done.  I do not think there is anything controversial in the Bill.  I endorse what Senator O'Donovan says in regard to the hardships on officials, and one instance came under my notice recently.  When these men give 20 or <Col N="1863" /> 30 years' service and die in office there is no provision for widows or dependants. I believe that is unjust and hope it will receive attention in the future.  I am very anxious that this Bill should go through, and think most public men agree with it, so I hope the Minister will stick to his guns and go on with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJohnston" hpid="Mr. James Johnston Mr. James Johnston">

      <P>I intend to support the Bill.  Some Senators say there is no need to hurry with it, and that it may be left over until after the holiday period, if there is one this year.  In my opinion, the Bill is long overdue.  The present councils&mdash;county and urban&mdash;elected in 1934 are now seven years in existence.  Certainly, they are not, like John Jameson's whiskey, improving with age; they may be mellowing, but not in the same way. I hope the Minister will proceed, and that, when the Bill becomes an Act, he will make provision for the holding of elections before the winter.  Then the new bodies will be able to deal with matters which have been long in abeyance.  From 1898 up to the present time, three years has been the term for county councils, but recently the term from 1934 to 1937 was extended from 1937 to 1941.  I hope that the new bodies will be elected in a short time.  In regard to Senator O'Donovan's suggestion about pensions, although it may not be appropriate on this Bill, I hope the Minister will take cognisance of my suggestion.  It has been recommended very strongly by local bodies in Monaghan and Cavan.  The county council in Cavan state they are in favour of it and in Monaghan we are in favour of it.  The suggestion concerns a contributory pensions scheme for public officials.  The mental hospital officials contribute towards a pension in later years, and that works out very well.  I suggest to the Minister that, if it is not possible to deal with the matter under the Bill, he should introduce one for the setting up of such a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the remarks of Senator O'Dwyer with regard to parish councils, and think there should be <Col N="1864" /> some general system whereby the heads of households would vote or whereby some other election system would be properly defined.  A system has been in vogue in some parts, where parish councils have been set up by a small body of men.  Generally there is no proper publicity when a meeting is called for the purpose of setting up a parish council, without anyone knowing definitely what is about to be done. The result is that very few attend and so some of the parish councils consist of a few people who are not at all representative.  I hope the Minister will take that into consideration and make some provision with regard to the setting up of parish councils.  I hope they will take the place of the old board of guardians as a link between the poorer sections and the higher elected bodies, say the county councils. In matters of public assistance and many other things the parish councils could be very useful, but at the same time they should be representative.</P>
    <P>Section 57 provides that where a member of a public body, a member of a county council, or of an urban council fails to pay his rates within the time allowed, that is a disqualification. I am informed that some members of local bodies and urban councils have not paid their rates for years while they were responsible for the striking of very heavy rates for their neighbours.  It is time that that system was done away with.  I am credibly informed that that goes on in a number of places.</P>
    <P>I do not know what Senator Professor Johnston meant when he referred to the grandmotherly supervision of the Local Government Department. I do not know if in any case it was grandmotherly.  It was in many cases stepmotherly, but I think great supervision has been required in all cases.  I am speaking from 27 years' experience of local bodies.  I have fairly good experience and I am a member of practically all public bodies with the exception of urban councils. Irish people may be very honourable and honest, but we are inclined to be too sympathetic where possibly the law would not allow us to be sympathetic. <Col N="1865" /> I can speak of experience of many things that as a Senator I have been asked to do or to get done, but there is no provision in the law to do them. The people who asked me were representatives of public bodies.</P>
    <P>There is certainly a necessity for supervision.  Senator Johnston asked why public bodies are only allowed to act within the chapter and verse of the regulations and he compared that position with the powers of other bodies.  We may all do what we like so long as we do not break the law, but certainly as public administrators we can only administer the laws set down to be administered.  Senator Baxter made a passing remark that there was no enthusiasm for these measures.  I cannot agree with him that in Monaghan and Cavan there is not enthusiasm.  I do not know so much about Cavan as Monaghan but there is enthusiasm both for the Managerial Act and the present Bill which enables new bodies to be set up to deal with matters which are urgently required.  I thoroughly approve of the measure.</P>

      <P>It is said that this Bill is likely to interest people in democratic rule.  I hope it will, but I have my doubts.  It is a retrograde step to formulate laws that may lead to an attitude of aloofness on the part of the populace towards government. It is well known that we are all politicians more or less.  If the Bill banishes politics from public bodies I should say it is worth its introduction, because my experience is, and anybody who reads the papers knows, that there are distinct political divisions in local bodies much to the injury of the transaction of business.  Economic business should be the first consideration. I regret to say that in the majority of these councils, business is not done for reasons of good government but simply on political lines.  I hope something may be done or some regulations formulated to kill that habit.  In public boards where politics are never mentioned work can be done in perfect harmony.</P>

      <P>Were it not for the introduction of a Managerial Act there would be some.  We have examples at home, and nobody knows that better than Senator Healy.  There is a good deal of alarm among public officials as to how they would be affected by this measure.  I do not know how far that alarm is justified, but they have certain vested rights of superannuation. Public officials have given important service; they are in a manner of speaking managers.  In many cases these officers were performing functions tantamount to those of the modern manager.  Their interests should be carefully considered, and attention be given to the question of superannuation. Perhaps the proper place would be a Superannuation Bill.  I thoroughly approve of the establishment of parish councils, but some device should be adopted in connection with them.  This will be government by orders.  I pity the public officials of the future, because I am alarmed at the number of circular orders that can be issued by the Minister.  I can conceive the letter box being packed with circular orders under this experiment to arrive at a proper system of local government.  It is one of the many experiments embarked upon by the last Government and by the present Government.  I wish it good-luck.  We are fond of experimenting, and if the present Government goes out of power I feel that we will have more experiments in formulating a system of public administration. I ask that some consideration should be given to the formation of parish councils.  They have been formed in haphazard and queer ways, sometimes by individuals and groups of individuals.  In many cases, they were elected on a fairly democratic basis, and they are functioning freely.  In other cases, they were brought into existence by a group of individuals who were called to the first meeting, and who constituted themselves the authorities for the future guidance of parish councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These particular councils have been very ineffective.  Some direction should be given as to the constitution of these <Col N="1867" /> councils.  I would go so far as to give them certain statutory powers but the Government, in its wisdom, thought better to wait and see.  Possibly, it is just as well, because the testing time did arrive sooner than expected and these councils are on their trial.  I hope the Minister responsible will spare the issue of circulars which are tantamount to Acts of Parliament made under the authority given by this Bill.  It is a pity that this Bill should make for centralisation.  Decentralisation, which would bring the people in contact with the public bodies, would be more desirable. I hope the Bill will do everything the promoters claim for it because there is a necessity for change in the present methods of public administration.</P>

I am sorry I was out of the House when the Minister was speaking to-day.  My views on these matters are fairly well known.  I spoke and voted here against the extension of the managerial system. I am not enamoured of this Bill, and I cannot understand the people of this House who have not confidence in themselves to discharge the duties which they asked the public to return them to discharge.  Most of the members here are members of local authorities&mdash;either county councils or town councils&mdash;and it is perfectly clear that they have lost confidence in themselves as administrators.</P>

    <P>I was surprised to hear Senator Johnston's remarks.  He said he was 27 years in office.  I was elected in 1908-34 years next January&mdash;and, during that time, I did not see any graft.  My colleagues in Dublin Borough Council are honest men and women.  They did their duty honestly, without fear or favour.  There are two of them on my left&mdash;two honest men.  They have done their duty and I do not understand the remarks of Senator Johnston at all.  Neither do I understand the remarks of Senator <Col N="1868" /> Cummins.

I have yet to learn that it is not possible&mdash;Senator Cummins may enlighten me&mdash;for honest men to have political views and do their duty in public life.  I have one suggestion to make to the Minister&mdash;that he should appoint a manager for his own Department.  As everybody knows, we, in this city, are in a bad way for houses.  Senators know what happened in the North Strand and Bride Street and two or three houses have now to be dealt with in Upper Bridge Street.  We are in a bad way for housing.  Tenders were received some time ago for a block of flats in Cooke Street.  They are before the Minister's Department for months.  I called down there to ask one of the officials either to kill the contract or to let it go through.  When we want houses so badly, one would expect that we would get some encouragement or help from the Minister or his Department but that contract is held up.  We may be told that the price per flat is high.  That is true but there are other considerations in connection with this contract. Street widening has been taken into the expense and also the question of damage to other houses in relation to previous buildings.  My suggestion to the Minister is that, before he proceeds to place managers all over the country, he should get a manager for his own Department and let us get on with our work in the city.</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter said that this was a machinery Bill.  I agree with him.  It is a machinery Bill.  It is complementary to the Managerial Bill and to the Public Assistance Act.  Many of the provisions in this Bill are already in operation in various ways in the local government code.  Many of the provisions that were in the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, are reincorporated in this Act with certain amendments from the experience that has been gained, where such amendments were regarded as desirable and necessary.  In the operation of those temporary provisions, and also in the operation of other old Acts, it was found that they had often to be operated by way of inference because their meaning was not clearly set out.  What we have tried to do in this Act, in the first place, is to try to clear up the law on the matter and to clear away any doubts that existed and to try to bring in some sort of clarity and order. Some of the old Acts went back for 100 years and we are now trying to do something to lay the foundation of some system of codification of the local government code itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not exactly relevant, perhaps, that we should have had some discussion on the Managerial Act, but I suppose it is impossible to discuss one measure without reference to another. <Col N="1870" /> I do not agree that the Managerial Act has resulted in the taking away of the interest of the people in their local authority.  I think that the essence of democracy is to see that the business is efficiently administered.  I do not think that democracy can ever last by having a system in which the people who are elected are not in a position to carry out their duties themselves, no matter how honest or conscientious they may be.  As I said, when the Managerial Act was passing through this House, you had a certain position since 1925 when the public health was thrown over on the local bodies attached to county councils.</P>
    <P>Since that time and the amalgamation of the boards of health with county councils, you had the position in which it was impossible for any local representative conscientiously to perform his duties in the time that was at his disposal.  I ask: what would a director of a company think if a similar principle was applied to the management of a company?  If we take the position of a body of directors, we find that they are anxious to have the business of that company carried on to the best advantage.  They cannot be there all the time, so they appoint an executive, like a managing director, to carry out the work for them.  It is no use in making play with the argument that the councils have no power.  The councils have the main power&mdash;that is the power of the money.  The manager cannot carry out any scheme or do anything unless the money is voted to him. If that power would not satisfy Senator Healy or anybody else, I do not know what would satisfy them.  If the council want the manager to do a particular thing, then they provide the rates or the money to enable him to carry it out.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter referred to the cutting down of representation.  There have been too many representatives. We have to admit that, although we do not propose, operating under this Bill, to make any drastic reduction.  Before 1925, you had fewer members than you will have when this Bill is brought into operation.  If I might give an example, you had the boards of health established in 1925.  That resulted in two <Col N="1871" /> members of the board of guardians automatically going over, or an allowance being made for them to become members of the council.  Under those Acts the boards of health are abolished and they have the manager to carry out a great many of the duties they performed before that.</P>
    <P>In Cork, pre-1925, you had 32 members. After 1925, as a matter of fact, you had 68.  On their own application, it was reduced to 43, and the allocation that is proposed now is 43, leaving it at the number selected by themselves. Under the other arrangements, they would have got something like 68.  They said it was too big and reduced it to 43.  In Galway, pre-1925, they had 20 members.  After 1925 they had 40.  We propose to leave it at 31.  In Mayo, they had 24 members pre-1925 and after 1925, they had 35 members.  We propose to leave it at 31.  If there is any other Senator interested in a particular county I would be glad to give him the figures for it.  Senator Baxter might be interested to hear that in Cavan, pre-1925, the number was 25.  After 1925, when the boards of health came into operation, it was 32, and we propose to leave it at 25.  All the other areas are in very much the same way.  The reduction proposed is very small&mdash;three to four and five members in many of those cases.</P>
    <P>It has been said that it is much better to leave the number of members as it is, on the grounds that they have local touch.  We are not proposing any such reduction as would take away the local touch from those areas, but, in addition to that, there will be those approved parish councils, and also public bodies will be able to appoint any committee for any particular purpose throughout the county.  If they want to appoint committees which they think can perform useful functions, there is nothing to prevent them; they have the power to do it.</P>
    <P>I referred to the question of parish councils in the debate before in this House, and I pointed out that the view I held, and the view that people who are mainly interested in the councils <Col N="1872" /> held, was that they were quite satisfied to have the least possible interference by statute.  They wanted to be allowed to develop in their voluntary way, and I believe it is the best way they will develop, but if Senator O'Dwyer's point is going to be accepted that they should get statutory powers and duties, then it was better for us not to have any amalgamation in this country at all, because we are going to be back again where we were 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>It is too soon yet to say how those parish councils will develop, and what part they will play in this country. They certainly have fulfilled very useful functions in this emergency, and the great opportunity came at the time, so far as they were concerned at any rate, for them to play their part in performing the functions which they have been performing.  I have heard reports about them, and I have had no complaints. In fact I have nothing but admiration and appreciation for the magnificent work they have being doing, and for their co-operation without creed, class or political viewpoint, and I think that if you introduce the elective principle, you are going to create division rather than unity in the parishes.  I think there is hardly any doubt about that.</P>
    <P>Senator Magennis raised one or two points.  He referred to Section 43, and quoted from it that the proceedings shall begin by a member or members being proposed and seconded, and no person who is then proposed or seconded shall be a candidate.  I think that line 44 in the section refers to &ldquo;begin&rdquo;&mdash;unless they are proposed at the beginning of the meeting it is not permissible for them to be proposed at a later stage.  It may be that the point Senator Magennis has raised is quite possible, but the only experience we have had was in Waterford City.  In Waterford in the first election a man was elected who was not formally connected with any political party. The man who was elected the other day was a Labour representative, a man who was a member of one of the weakest parties in the council. At any rate they were not the majority party.  You will find that this will work out just as well.  I do not <Col N="1873" /> know that there is much to be said for the possibility that Senator Magennis has in mind.  What we are up against is that deadlocks have been occurring in various parts of the country and elections have been absolutely held up. For some time back there have been occasions when councils met and certain people would not vote.  The result was that nobody could be elected because you had not a majority of the members present voting for any candidate. The little experience we have of this system shows that people who are not in the majority party can be elected.</P>
    <P>The Senator also raised the matter of the age limit.  I do not know that it can be said that an age limit is being inserted because it is in the British tradition.  We have heard of a case in this country&mdash;those who were in the Department at the time are personally aware of it&mdash;of a man who occupied the post of inspector up to 90 years of age.  You might find it difficult to get somebody to say that such a man was unfit for duty.  People who have a discretion in that way are reluctant to exercise it, but we have to admit that as people advance in years the output of work deteriorates.  At the same time it is very hard to see, in the absence of an age limit, how you can enforce retirement, or how you can get another person to certify that an official is inefficient.  There may be deterioration in output or a falling off in output but you will find it very difficult to get superiors or anybody else, remembering perhaps the assiduous attention which that man may have paid to his duties in the past, to certify that he is unfit any longer to carry out his duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>It has never been satisfactorily determined at what age in individual cases that deterioration which means inefficiency sets in. That is why I call the limit of 65 arbitrary.  Many judges, both here and in the neighbouring State, were efficient judges when over 80 years of age.  It depends on a great many circumstances. In addition, there is imposed on a small country like this a very heavy burden of excessive <Col N="1874" /> taxation to pay two salaries simultaneously, merely because it is decided that on a given date a man's occupation expires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost is not by any means so great as we are inclined to imagine.  A man who is in a fairly responsible position has a salary perhaps of £900 a year and his successor is appointed at £550 or £600.  If you add the salary of the incoming official to the pension of the outgoing official there is a loss for a few years but the man who is retired normally passes out in a few years so that the monetary loss is not considerable.  I have not gone into more than a few cases and I have not made any extensive examination to ascertain what it would cost in the entire service but if such examination could be satisfactorily made, I am told that the loss would not be by any means so considerable as some people are inclined to imagine.  Coming back to the question of defining the time for retirement, I think it is almost impossible to frame a definition that will fit in with anything except age.  You employ men for instance in the fire brigade and various other services for which there must be an age limit.  If a civil servant is in good health when he reaches the age of 65, in certain cases under the present code, he is allowed to continue from year to year on a certificate of good health until he reaches the age of 70, but I have not heard of many people who have asked to remain in their positions after they reached the age of 65.  They are usually entitled to pension when they come to that age.  I could not see any other way of dealing with this matter except by an age limit.</P>
      <P>Senator Johnston asked for a memorandum on local government.  I would be very glad if such a memorandum could be prepared but it is a very big question.  There was a famous work published years ago known as Vanston's. It is now out of print, and I wish it could be brought up to date and reprinted.</P>

      <P>I am afraid it would be a rather difficult matter to cover everything in a pamphlet.  Something might be done at some future time after this Bill and the other Acts have been in operation for some time, to clarify the position so far as they are concerned.  A system might be adopted such as is in operation in other countries for a codification of the law. A committee of the House might take these Bills after they have become Acts and codify them with other Acts which have been the law for some time. They could all be brought together and formally submitted to the House for approval without discussion, because, of course, we would not be enacting any new principles.  Much could be done towards codification along these lines, but so long as there is a possibility of discussing Acts which have been already passed, it would be impossible to approach it from that angle at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cummins stated that some officials were alarmed by this Bill.  I assure the Senator that I have not heard anything about officials being alarmed because the officials know the position under the provisions already existing.  We are merely removing any doubts that may exist under these provisions. There is no intention, however, to take away any existing rights they may have.  I do not think that they need ever be alarmed about the circulars or orders that will be issued under the Bill.  What is intended under the Bill is that managers will have certain powers with regard to the appointment of officials.  The appointment of major officials will be retained by the Department so that they can be referred to the Appointments Commission who may decide to fill these posts by way of examination or by whatever other method we may lay down in the regulations.  That will save the Department a good deal of trouble and will lessen the burden in that particular way.  But once the regulations are made specifying the type of official that is required in the various offices throughout the country, the manager's position will be quite clear and he will know his duties and his functions in the matter.  It will save circulars going <Col N="1876" /> out every other day and requisitions for sanction, etc., as has to be done at the present time.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan referred to the case of a man holding a double position. The example he gave was the man who held a position under the Diseases of Animals Act.  It is quite possible that so far as one particular post is concerned he may be under the Department of Agriculture and so far as another post is concerned under the Department of Local Government, holding both positions at the same time. In a case of that sort, I can only say there must be consultation between the Departments concerned and if the Departments were so foolish as to fix different retiring age limits, undoubtedly the official would go out of one position at one particular time and out of the other position at another time.  That is a thing that I do not think is likely to happen.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston referred to a bureau of information.  I think that would be very desirable.  That is a matter that could be done in any case without having to make any provision for it in the Bill, but I think it would be a desirable thing if you could have some sort of information bureau that would be available for the people who are in the unfortunate position of having to apply for home assistance, widows' and orphans' pensions, and anything of that sort.  It would be very desirable and helpful if there were such a bureau of information at their disposal.  That is a matter that can be taken up, apart altogether from this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the first section of the Bill calls for any great explanation in detail.  It merely continues for another 12 months from the 1st April last the grants to persons and public utility societies building and reconstructing houses in rural areas.  It also extends the time for completing the erection and the reconstruction, as the case may be, of houses in these areas for which grants have been, or may be, allocated.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932 relating to the acquisition of houses by municipal authorities with the aid of a grant under that Act and the improvement or enlargement of such houses by municipal authorities or philanthropic societies are also being extended by Section 1 of the Bill for another year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to the expiration of the existing Acts, viz., 31st March last, grants had been allocated to the extent of £3,347,655, in respect of the erection by private persons and public utility societies of over 34,000 new houses and the reconstruction by small farmers and agricultural labourers of over 32,000 houses.  Actually on the date mentioned the number of new houses completed under these allocations <Col N="1878" /> was over 31,000, while the number reconstructed was over 27,000. This meant that at the closing date approvals were outstanding in respect of approximately 2,700 new houses and over 5,000 houses for reconstruction. To enable persons to avail of the approvals, in the present financial year, it is necessary to extend the date for completion though it is expected that in present circumstances some of them will not be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>In the second section of the Bill, namely, that amending the definition of agricultural labourer, I hope to remedy an unsatisfactory position under existing legislation.  While it is in itself an important amendment it should not involve any very far-reaching effects.  The present law in so far as a person is not actually engaged in purely agricultural work but is working for hire requires that he should be working for hire in a rural district. Cases have been brought to my notice of persons living in villages just outside the boundary of a city but actually working for hire at non-agricultural work within the city boundary.  Some of these people though instrumental in having a scheme of labourers' cottages promoted by the board of health to remedy what were deplorable sanitary conditions under which they lived found themselves debarred by legislation from getting cottages because they were working just over the urban boundary within the urban area. People situated as they were, were in the unfortunate position of having no claim for housing on either the urban or rural authority.  The definition of agricultural labourer is set out in the first of the Labourers Acts, viz., that of the Act of 1883, in the narrow sense in which the term is ordinarily understood.</P>
    <P>For the past few years there has been a strong movement in favour of providing additional moneys to finance house purchase, especially since the Dublin Corporation a few years ago decided to curtail their loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  Up to a few years ago the corporation had advanced approximately £1,500,000 for house purchase.  For various reasons it <Col N="1879" /> was not possible for them to provide funds for making these loans and at the same time finance their own housing schemes.  Section 3 of the Bill is proposed in order to enable building societies to acquire funds to make loans to persons desirous of purchasing their houses.  The guaranteeing of loans by local authorities is not the establishment of a new principle.  A power of a similar kind was conferred in relation to public utility societies by the Housing Act of 1919, though as far as I can see no actual operations under that Act in respect of the power mentioned took place in this country.  The section confines the guarantees to three Dublin local authorities as the area outside Dublin is reasonably met by the facilities afforded under the Small Dwelling Acquisition Acts.</P>
    <P>Several conferences took place before the Bill was drafted with the representatives of the banks and the building societies, and the matter was also the subject of correspondence and examination with the representatives of the building industry.  The representatives of the banks indicated the co-operation of the banks but, of course, if other lending institutions such as insurance companies are willing to make advances to the building societies they will be free to do so within the terms of the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is entirely praiseworthy.  Sections 1 and 2 simply make necessary adjustments but, with regard to Section 3, I would like the Minister to give us a little more information.  I know that the fact that the working of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act had practically lapsed in Dublin City and the borough has been a matter of concern to a great number of people but, on the face of it, this particular section gives power to the Dublin Corporation, the Borough Council of Dun Laoghaire and the Dublin County Council to guarantee money to building societies for advance to persons to purchase houses.  Ministerial sanction must be obtained.  I wonder if the Minister could tell us how that Ministerial sanction will operate?  I understand <Col N="1880" /> that the power must be given to the corporation, not to the manager, to make the loans, because that is the general position under the Local Government Acts, but is it possible at all that under this provision advances would be made to building societies which may have to be repaid by the corporation and thus increase the burden upon the ratepayers?</P>
      <P>I am wondering whether it would not be possible to put into the Bill that the Minister shall not give his sanction unless he is satisfied that the building societies are solvent?  Perhaps that is the intention.  We have heard here this evening and often see in the newspapers complaints of the slowness with which the Local Government Department acts and, presumably, when a local body is considering the giving of a guarantee under this Bill, when it becomes an Act, the manager will be present and the manager will have power to speak and to make his case on the matter when the councils come to reach their decision.  The Minister will then have to give his consent. Between the advice given by the manager and the authority exercised by the Minister, the ratepayers ought to be safeguarded but one wonders whether merely an administrative safeguard is sufficient or whether something should appear in the Bill as to the principles which will guide the Minister when he is giving or withholding his sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise, of course, the desirability of continuing a scheme such as did such an immense amount of good in the city under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  I entirely agree that that should be continued.  In so far as the Bill continues that, I am all for it but, on the face of the Bill, we do not see what the restrictions or precautions are which will be adopted by the Minister in giving his consent to the guarantees. Of course, public utility societies are not included, and I think that is a good thing.  I would like the Minister to say, when he is concluding, what principle the Department will work on in considering guarantees given by bodies such as the Dublin Corporation, and where the City Manager or the Manager of the Dun <Col N="1881" /> Laoghaire Borough comes in in the preliminary operations at the council meeting when the guarantee is being sought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this new Housing Bill, and I have only one or two points to make.  I will start off where the applicant has to start.  A person in a rural area who intends to erect a house makes an application to the appointed officer, who then issues a certificate of approval.  A number of utility societies are doing very good work.  They issue credit notes on which the applicant can get materials and, as a matter of fact, this method enables the applicant to get the grant really before the house is built.  These credit notes are issued on a certificate of approval by the appointed officer, and then, in a number of cases the first payment&mdash;that is, half the grant&mdash;is given by the Department.  When further investigations are carried out, they find that all the facts stated are not true. The valuation may be over £25, and the grant is reduced.  In a number of cases, the public utility societies have issued credit notes up to £80, on the understanding that the £80, having been certified by the approving officer, will be repaid.  It is a great hardship on them when they have to make up the balance themselves.  I should like something to be done, so that the appointed officer's certificate of approval would hold good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a lot of work to expect from the appointed officer, if he has to carry out inspections and point out sites, etc., and if he is allowed a fee of only one guinea.  That is too small.  One cannot expect a man to travel over a wide area for that sum, choosing sites and giving the necessary instructions in filling up forms by the applicants. The present Bill extends the time to 1942, and here again I think the time should be further extended.  We are now in the month of July, and at this time the people in the rural areas are very busy at agricultural work, and they have very little time for house building.  It is usually in the winter months that the people in the rural areas devote their time to the erection of houses.  The date should be extended <Col N="1882" /> for another 12 months at least.  That would make it 1943 instead of 1942. Otherwise, a number of people who would be inclined to start will not do so.  If a person goes to the secretary of the society, and asks about building a house, he is told that he would be entitled to a grant if he had it built, say, by the 1st April.</P>
    <P>Under the 1932 Act the people in urban areas were entitled to a grant and I do not believe there is any just cause for refusing a grant to such people at the present time.  If there was a case in 1932, there is one now. In an urban area, one of the standard size houses, for which one would receive the grant in the usual way, would take three months to build.  If three men are working on it for the whole 13 weeks, and a plasterer for six weeks, a plumber for three weeks, and three labourers for three weeks each, they ordinarily would have been receiving £1 a week in unemployment assistance, which would be £55 for the three months.  It would be better to spend that £55 in giving a grant in an urban area to a person who would undertake the building of a house.  I know one or two cases of people who think it is better to have the money lying in the bank than in use for house building. As I have said, if house building were encouraged the tradesmen concerned who are now receiving £50 in unemployment assistance&mdash;and more where there are large families&mdash;would receive a greater amount.</P>
    <P>Then there is the case of the agricultural labourer living in an urban area.  I know of a case in Galway where a man has seven or eight children&mdash;as a matter of fact, there are ten living in the house&mdash;and the children are receiving the Gaeltacht grant of £2 for Irish.  There are two rooms in that house&mdash;a kitchen and one other room.  Because that man is living in an urban area, he is not entitled to a grant to build a house&mdash; neither the Gaeltacht grant nor the local government housing grant. Where an applicant derives his living from agriculture, the same provision should be made as for rural areas, if the Minister is not prepared to extend the scheme to urban areas.  After all, <Col N="1883" /> the man is an agricultural worker, just like a farmer.  There are also cases of people with very small holdings in the country, with a £5 or £6 valuation. While a grant of £80 is very beneficial to a man who can get a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation or the Land Commission, the man with the very small valuation cannot build a house with the £80 and so cannot build a house at all.  I have suggested before that, in cases of that kind, where a certificate would be issued by the county medical officer of health and by the local inspector, the Minister should be empowered to give an increased grant.  Otherwise, the small farmers with the worst type of houses and very low valuations cannot get a labourer's cottage, as £80 is not sufficient to build a house even in the best of times.  A few years ago it was worth more than it is now worth.  I know that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has not very much to do with grants, but I think something should be done.</P>
    <P>Usually people who avail of the grants from the Housing Department also send applications for loans to the Land Commission.  There is great difficulty in getting even an acknowledgment from the Land Commission, or a statement that they are prepared to make the advance.  When the house is built and they do give that certificate, the merchant who has given the building materials may have to wait months before the Land Commission pays up.  Some arrangement should be made between the two Departments so that the one inspector would be sufficient.  The local government inspector's certificate, before the completion of the grant, should be sufficient for the Land Commission in granting the loan, and the loan should be made available at once.  Otherwise, the whole system of credits, as far as the rural house builder is concerned, will fall asunder.</P>
    <P>A number of houses have been erected all over the country.  Some of them have been built in Galway, and strange as it may seem in this age of turf, they are making preparations to <Col N="1884" /> instal ranges.  Before there is any further advance in that direction I ask the Minister to get his inspectors to look into that to see that any ranges going into those houses are going to be turf ranges.  Otherwise it will not be easy to rectify the position later.  The Department might consider for houses built later for slum dwellers a more general use of furniture fixtures.  There could be more built-in furniture.  That would eliminate a lot of carting of dilapidated furniture from the old houses to the new houses and if it cost more it would be money well spent, if there were certain furniture fixtures in each scheme.  As regards the giving of grants to public building societies, I think that is a very good idea.  It is one that should be extended because if we are going to cope with the housing demand we can never do it under the present system.  Local authorities have as much as they can do to cater for people in the slums.  Other people will have to be dealt with by private enterprise or by public utility societies. There, again, the rate of interest arises. It is one of the vital things affecting the housing problem.</P>
    <P>In Galway a few houses were built under the Small Dwellings Act, and the rate of interest was 6½ per cent.  That is too great a burden.  We ought to have some system whereby the rate of interest would be much lower.  As regards the raising of loans by banks and public utility societies during the operation of the Small Dwellings Act in Galway City each person made an application to the council through solicitors, and when that was sanctioned they received a bill on account varying from £18 to £20.  I think that amount of costs should not be allowed. A case went to the court, but as it is not finally decided I had better not say more about that.  The Minister should look into the matter to see that there should not be much costs in such applications.  The definition of &ldquo;agricultural labourers,&rdquo; is also desirable. It is a departure from the old system in which everybody gave his own definition. I know many cases where people found that they did not come under the definition for the purposes of the Act.  One definition was that you <Col N="1885" /> could have no more than a quarter of an acre of land.  I think that is wrong. No man should be limited to a quarter of an acre.  Yet, in these cases he did not come within the definition for the purposes of the Act.  Then there were other cases of people&mdash;blacksmiths or village carpenters, and as there were disputes it was difficult to know definitely whether they came within the definition.  The matter seems to be settled now in relation to an application under the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad Senator Hawkins drew attention to what I have myself spoken of&mdash;the very bad system that prevails of having ranges that are made for coal in areas where turf is the natural and traditional fuel.  We had instances of that in Galway and I am sorry to hear from Senator Hawkins that that deplorable custom is to be maintained.  It has been said that these ranges are very bad ranges.  They have been defined as miracles of inefficiency.  These ranges are super-miracles of efficiency with regard to coal but with regard to turf they are useless.  There is danger in taking them out except proper precautions are taken.  They are liable to cause accidents and fires.  Such dangers should be guarded against.  If a grant was made available in turf-burning areas to enable people to adapt these ranges for turf I think it would be very desirable.  Another thing that strikes one coming from Galway is the great waste of opportunity that prevails in allowing some of our magnificent streets of old houses to fall into unsightly ruins.  One particular house, a hotel, has been reconditioned and it just shows what can be done.  It is a great pity that instead of building these houses with the ranges that have been spoken of they do not build flats. These magnificent old houses of cut stone could surely be reconstructed and made into very beautiful and very serviceable flats.  That would improve the city immensely.  I suppose Senators have heard the story of the submarine commander who came to Galway and, after seeing the city, thought it had been shelled.  I suggest that these houses should be reconstructed and turned into beautiful and useful flats. <Col N="1886" /> It would be much better than some of the houses on which much public money is being spent and wasted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielCorkery" hpid="Mr. Corkery Mr. Corkery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corkery</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Minister to try to extend the Act to urban areas. The urban councils, of course, have power to build houses for people living in condemned houses.  There are numbers of people in urban areas, young people who have just got married, and they have no hope whatever of getting a house.  If some grants were given in the urban areas a good many of the derelict sites in our towns would be built on.  The sites are very suitable for building, but they may or may not be acquired by urban councils.  There is a great scarcity of houses in urban areas.  I know people paying from 15/- to £1 per week for miserable hovels, and it is very hard to get them at that.  I know people who are living in one or two rooms and paying high rents for them.  When this grant was extended to urban areas, as it was at one time, many houses were reconstructed and built in the towns.  If that were done now, it would help to relieve the lack of housing in the urban districts.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the Small Dwellings Act.  We put that into force and a few persons tried to reconstruct their houses under the scheme but there were delays.  One man did build practically a new house and he found that, because he had not been notified by the clerk of the council that his house was one that should be reconstructed, he was deprived of any grant.  The fault was not his and I do not think it was the fault of the council either.  The man wanted the house and he started to build.  The wording of the Act deprived him of the grant to which he was really entitled, even if he was not legally entitled to it.  If the Minister has power, he should do something to remedy that and I suggest that he extend the provisions of the Act to urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJohnston" hpid="Mr. James Johnston Mr. James Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Mr. James Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the appeal made by the Senator who has just sat down regarding houses which are not new.  We have had some experience in that connection in County <Col N="1887" /> Monaghan.  Houses which would be very necessary were deprived of the loan under the Small Dwellings Act, because they were only houses for reconstruction. Portion of such a house may be as good as that of a new house, if not better.  Because that old portion is allowed to remain, the person concerned is deprived of the loan under the Small Dwellings Act.  I think it was something of that nature which the last Senator had in mind. I fully support the extension of the Act for another year and I would support its extension for two years more.</P>
      <P>There is one drawback which I referred to before in another place.  I hope the Minister will give sympathetic attention to it.  I refer to the limit of valuation of £25 in respect of anybody who wants to reconstruct a house.  No reconstruction grant is given to anybody with a valuation of over £25.  A person may be living on a farm portion of which is on the side of a mountain. The valuation may be over £25 but the person concerned may be in a much worse position for reconstructing his house than a person with a valuation of £10 or £12.  We have not many cases of that kind in County Monaghan and I suppose there are as many there as in any other place.  To extend the limit of valuation to £30 or £35, or even to do away with it altogether, would not cost very much.  There are many reasonably good houses in which farmers are living who have holdings on the side of a mountain and whose valuations may be over £25.  These men may not be in as good a position as a labourer in constant work and receiving good wages.  If the Minister does not remove the valuation limit, I ask him to extend it up to £40.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Hayes, what we intend is that the corporation will negotiate with some of those societies &mdash;I know only two of them at the moment, but I think there are three&mdash; and try to arrange terms with them, so that they can be placed in a position in which they can guarantee the bank.  With the assistance of the City Manager, they will be able to examine <Col N="1888" /> the finance of the society.  When the matter comes to the Department, they will certainly inquire into the finances of the society.  There is nothing to worry about in the present position. A Bill will be introduced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce which will regulate matters connected with these building societies.  The Civil Service, the Permanent, the Metropolitan and the Educational Societies are the only societies I know which go in for this class of work.  As a result of this Bill, there may be others.  They will have to register and definite provision will be made regarding them in the Bill which the Minister for Industry and Commerce will bring in.  I do not think that there is any necessity to worry on that score at all. I do not think that anybody will be given an opportunity to get away with anything of the type suggested.  I should be prepared to insert a provision in this Bill, but I do not want to curb the corporation or do anything which would make matters more difficult for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department was approached by the Builders' Federation to see what we could do to encourage the building of houses.  Something like the American federal housing plan was suggested. That would not work here because the people who avail of that plan in America are people earning £500 or £600 a year.  People earning that amount here can go to an insurance company for a loan, if they are not able to buy out the houses themselves. We are trying to cater for people of more modest means.  I do not think that there is any necessity to extend the operation of the Act for two years. We have been extending its operation from year to year and I do not think it would be any handicap to continue that practice.  It may happen that work is not completed owing to some unforeseen happening, such as shortage of supplies.  All these things will be considered when the Department is considering the introduction of a Bill next year.  If the prospect is there, then building can go on without it, but I am sure that the Department will do everything they can to see it does go <Col N="1889" /> on, and to encourage it in every possible way.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins raised the point why we allowed the grants for the urban houses to drop.  There was no real demand for grants in urban areas. Builders in the urban areas wanted to build houses for sale, rather than to avail themselves of this grant.  The figures will give some idea of what I have in mind.  Grants to persons in urban areas were provided in the case of 10,979 houses.  Out of that total the number built in Dublin was 6,730, leaving for the rest of the country 4,249, a very small figure for the area outside Dublin in view of the length of the period in which the scheme was in operation.  When it was found that the demand was not there these grants were dropped, and I do not think that any case could be made for bringing them back again.</P>
    <P>Senator Mrs. Concannon raised the point about the re-conditioning of houses.  Provision is made for it in the Housing and Labourers Act of 1937, and we have taken it up with the Galway Corporation.  We have also taken it up with the corporation in Dublin.  When there are difficulties, of supplies, particularly in times like these, if there are houses of that sort available it would be much better, perhaps, to get them turned into flats, and perhaps it would be much easier, too.  We want to encourage that as much as we can, and we are in full sympathy with the points raised by Senator Mrs. Concannon in that matter.  We have already moved in the case of Galway, and we have been moving with the corporation in Dublin. So far as the provision of turf-burning ranges is concerned, whenever it is put up by a local authority it is assented to.  In the case of Galway, which is a turf-burning area, the proposal would be automatically accepted.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston called attention to the raising of the valuation.  That matter has been brought up every year and I suppose that if I put in £120, I would have somebody asking for £121. There must be a line drawn somewhere. I know there are hardships such as those mentioned by Senator Hawkins in cases where the grant is not payable. <Col N="1890" /> The same thing happens about the £25 limit.  There will always be certain cases of hardship, no matter what limit you set.  My predecessor, after consultation with the Department, fixed the figure of £25.  That was a very fair thing, but, of course, hard cases will inevitably arise no matter where you set the limit.</P>

      <P>A strike involving employees of the Dublin Corporation took place in the early part of last year.  About 2,200 employees were affected, most of whom were pensionable.  The breach in service deprived the pensionable staff of the right to reckon their pre-strike service for pension purposes. When work was resumed representations were received from the corporation in favour of safeguarding pension rights.  The purpose of the present Bill is to preserve the continuity of service.  The period of pensionable service before the strike will be reckoned with subsequent service as one continuous period of service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>While there is no objection to the Bill, I wish to bring to the Minister's notice Section 2, (a) and (b).  Sub-section (a) states that the period of absence shall be regarded as not breaking continuity of his service with the corporation but, then, sub-section (b) goes on to say that notwithstanding the provisions of the foregoing paragraph, the length of the period of absence shall not be taken into account in reckoning the length of <Col N="1891" /> his service with the corporation, nor, where an allowance for life or a gratuity is granted to him, in reckoning the amount thereof.  I think it would be desirable if the Minister would agree to the deletion of sub-section (b). I refer the Minister to Section 23 of the Superannuation Act of 1936 where provision is made for analogous circumstances occurring in 1922 in relation to the Post Office service, and in that section the period of absence is not dealt with as the period of absence is dealt with in this Bill under sub-section (b).  I see no reason why the Minister would not agree to follow the precedent laid down in Section 23 of the Superannuation Act of 1936 and omit sub-section (b) of the present Bill.  It will affect the period of service of the individual because it takes away from his service that portion of time in which he was absent from the service of the corporation and might vitally affect his whole pension position.  Therefore, I would be obliged if the Minister would consider that point and agree to take out the sub-section, because it seems to be in contradiction to the previous paragraph, and it certainly is not in harmony with what has already been laid down in the Superannuation Act of 1936.</P>

      <P>I will look into it certainly, but I do not say whether I will consider it.  There are more Departments than mine concerned.  If you are out of service, you are not in service, but so long as the continuity of service is not broken I think that should satisfy the Senator.  Of course they were not paid for it.</P>

      <P>As has been intimated earlier to-day No. 6 on the Order Paper is not being moved to-day.  The next meeting of the Seanad will depend on the position of legislation in the Dáil.  If the Emergency Powers Bill is received from the Dáil this week I shall have the Seanad summoned for next Wednesday.  If it is not, our next meeting will be on the 30th July.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.20 p.m. <i>sine die.</i></P>
