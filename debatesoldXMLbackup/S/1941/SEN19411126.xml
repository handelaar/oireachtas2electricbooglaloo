      <P>I have received notice from Senator Foran that on the motion for the adjournment of the House this evening he will direct attention to the disclosures made in evidence during the recent trial in the Central Criminal Court of the case of the Attorney-General versus Chapman and Town, regarding the operations of Messrs. L. and J. Jordan and Company, Limited, Ennis, and will ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of these disclosures and of the commendation by the presiding judge of the public-spirited conduct of an officer of the company, since dismissed, it is his intention to continue to the company the privileges extended to it by the State.  I am accepting that notice.  The matter will be taken on the conclusion of the business on the Order Paper.</P>

    <P>Question proposed.: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Expiring Laws Bill, as the members of the Seanad know, is a kind of hardy annual.  It used to be a much more formidable affair than it is this time.  Some years ago I think there were as many as 20 Acts which had to be re-enacted about this time of the year.  Now the number is down to six or seven.  The Bill proposes to continue for a further year the same statutes which appear in Parts I and II of the Schedule to the Expiring Laws Act, 1940.</P>
      <P>A memorandum regarding the Acts to be continued has been circulated to Senators, and I hope that the explanations given for continuing the various Acts will prove satisfactory.  Of the nine Acts affected by the Bill provision has already been made for the repeal of three.  I refer to the Poor Relief (Dublin) Act, 1929, the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, and the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1925.  This latter Act will go when the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1939, comes into operation, but as it may not be feasible, owing to the emergency, to give effect to that Act before the 1st January, it is necessary to continue the temporary measure.  As regards the other two Acts, both will be repealed when the Public Assistance Act, 1939, and the Local Government Act, 1941, come into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that the Acts appearing in the Schedule are reviewed from time to time to consider whether legislation might be introduced to give permanence <Col N="11" /> to any of them.  Apart from the three Acts already mentioned, it is not considered desirable at present to make provision for any of the remainder. It will be appreciated that the Schedule of enactments to be continued has shrunk considerably over a number of years and we are now left with a mere handful of Acts which will shrink further as opportunity presents itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suppose there is any Senator who could put up any good case, not against some of those Acts, but in favour of abolishing them suddenly to-morrow or the next day without any other provision.  The principal reason why I intervene is that apparently the Minister is pleased to see this Bill shrinking.  I have been wondering for the last 17 or 18 years why it should be continued in this form.  It seems to me simply a relic of a somewhat ancient British practice which it appears quite unnecessary to continue in our Parliament.  This is not a new idea of mine.  I expressed it a considerable number of years ago. When we find that the Government is considering, amongst others, whether an Act of 1868 or 1869 should be made permanent or not, the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; or &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; takes, to put it mildly, a new meaning.  It seems to me, now that it has shrunk to this extent and that provision is made for three Acts out of the number concerned, it would be better to simply say that the other Acts are continued until repealed and deal with them in the ordinary course.  It has come to the stage now when there is no public gain by bringing them up in or about December each year.  I would like to know if the Minister could tell me the reason against simply altering this and instead of saying that the Acts mentioned in the Schedule shall be continued until the 31st December, 1942, say, &ldquo;until repealed&rdquo;.  I think the time has come when we may do that instead of keeping on what is to my mind an antique and unnecessary practice.  It has never been part of our practice in this country to have annual legislation.  I do not know of a single case of an Act <Col N="12" /> introduced by our Parliament for one year only.  It is simply a matter of British Acts which we have to continue. I may not be right in that, but if there have been such Acts they have been very few.  It certainly is not the general practice.  I suggest that, if not this year, next year, we might have done with it by simply leaving on the Statute Book those that the Government have not time to deal with. Obviously no one who has read them is perfectly satisfied with the Corrupt Practices Act and the Parliamentary Elections Act, but no one thinks we would be better off without them.</P>

      <P>I think, if I may say so with respect, that that is a valuable suggestion of the Senator's.  I am afraid, though, that we could not adopt it this year.  The Bill has already been adopted by the Dáil and, therefore, will have to go through this House.</P>

      <P>I do not know why the idea has not been thought of.  As Senator Douglas has said, he has already expressed himself in a similar manner on a previous occasion.  There may be some reason against it that I am not aware of, but it seems to me that the suggestion is one that should get very serious consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may say in reply to what the Minister has said &mdash;if it would be in order&mdash;that the reason some time ago was that there was a very much bigger list, a number of which it was considered should be brought up each year.  Next year there will not be any left that there is a prospect of their being dealt with, except as general legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Senator Douglas's suggestion I think it would be better if we had a continuation of the present form.  If there is any portion of any Act that we want to have repealed, we would have an opportunity of discussing it and of putting forward the Acts we would like to have repealed, but if his suggestion were adopted we would have no chance of discussing any of the Acts in the Statute Book.  I do not think much of the time of the House or of any of the Departments is taken up by having that Bill coming on in the ordinary way before the Oireachtas.  I think the Minister would be just as well advised to leave the matter as it is and to have a continuation of the Bill in its present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if it would be possible to get from the Minister at this stage a statement of the Government's intention in regard to the Report of the Town Tenants' Tribunal?  At the moment we have before us a proposal to continue the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1923.  Most of us, I am sure, have read, or partly read, the Report of the Town Tenants' Tribunal.  For many years past agitation has been carried on in the country for legislation to deal with this particular interest of the people.  We all know that there are grievances in every town and city.  I wonder would it be possible at this stage for the Minister to give an indication to the House as to when it is proposed to introduce legislation to deal with it. The Act of 1923 was based on the 1914 rents and valuations.  Many things have happened since then and this legislation is completely out of date. Owing to the emergency and the consequent restriction of materials for building purposes, building at present is almost at a standstill.  If this position is allowed to develop for five or <Col N="14" /> six years then the position of housing in the country is going to be very serious.  I believe the best way to overcome the whole difficulty is by providing sufficient housing for the people.  That would probably solve the difficulty in itself, but I should like to know if the Minister would be good enough to give us an indication of what the Government propose to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Counihan's suggestion that this legislation which comes before us here should be continued.  It gives an opportunity of having the various enactments set out in the Schedule criticised, if it is desirable that they should be criticised. If the other suggestion were carried into effect, it is possible that matters might arise in relation to certain of these Acts in the Schedule which the Oireachtas would desire to discuss and which they would not have an opportunity of discussing.  I hope, therefore, that the present system of reviewing these enactments which lapse annually will be continued, because I think it the better system of the two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably more than two, but at any rate everybody does not accept Senator Douglas's view, I note.  I accepted his view because it is certainly much more convenient for Ministers, but I can see the point of view of Senator Counihan and Senator Lynch.  I would see it much more readily, of course, if I were in their position.  However, nothing will be done about it this year.  It will possibly be done next year, but God only knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Hawkins, I am sorry that I am not in a position to say what the Government's intentions are with regard to the report of the Town Tenants' Tribunal.  The report has been circulated, but it has not yet come formally before the Government, and no decision has been taken as to what legislation, if any, might be introduced. In reply to, I think, Deputy Dillon in <Col N="15" /> the Dáil, the Minister for Justice said that he and his Department were considering legislation to deal with certain aspects of the town tenants' problem, that is, in relation to tenement rents. When that legislation will be introduced, however, I am not in a position to say, as it has not yet come before the Government.  It is at present in the Departmental stage.  We discussed this matter last week in the Dáil when it was raised on the consideration of this Bill.  The whole question of town tenant legislation is a very intricate and difficult problem.  The last Government dealt with it and brought in a variety of amendments, which had the effect of bringing the legislation to a certain extent up to date, but the legislation then passed does not appear to have brought a great measure of satisfaction to town tenants.  As to whether they are very difficult people to satisfy or not, I had better not express any opinion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator must be a town tenant.  It is, as I say, a difficult problem, and I think this Government have dealt with some aspects of it by legislation.  As a result of great pressure by town tenants and interested parties all over the country, they set up this tribunal, and, as members know, the report is very voluminous.  In fact, there are a variety of reports.  I think there are as many appendices or minority reports as there were members of the commission, which will give an idea of the complexity of the problem.  However, even though it is as complex as that would seem to indicate, I realise that it is a matter which will have to be faced.  The Government will have to make up its mind one way or another. They will not satisfy everybody and maybe will not satisfy a large proportion of those interested, but certain aspects of the problem will have to be dealt with, and probably will have to be dealt with soon.  I know that the <Col N="16" /> matter is being considered, but I am not in a position to say when legislation will be introduced.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Architects (Registration) Bill, 1941. - Agriculture (Amendment) Bill, 1941-Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is merely to amend certain clauses in the Agriculture Act, 1931. Sub-section (1) of Section 36 of that Act provides that a county council must collect a rate of 2d. in the £ for the benefit of the county committee of agriculture, and may collect another 1d. in the £, if the county committee can make a good case for it.  This Bill proposes to give the county council power to collect an extra 2d., instead of an extra 1d., if they so think fit. A number of the county councils have reached the limit, that is they are collecting the mandatory 2d. and also the 1d. which they are permitted to collect, and some of them, I feel, will avail of the opportunity to collect a little more if they have authority to do so.  In fact, some of the county committees are not able to carry on all the activities which they would like to carry on on the present income.  I need not enumerate for Senators what these activities are. They come under the heading of education and, to a certain extent, of subsidies on production of various kinds, such as assisting the poultry industry and the pig industry in congested districts and also to some extent the growing of vegetables.  On the educational side, there are the services of the instructors in agriculture and horticulture, bee-keeping, poultry-keeping and butter-making.  They also give some scholarships to farmers' sons and daughters which are tenable at the approved agricultural institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the enactment of the Agriculture Act, 1931, all but one of the county committees have succeeded in <Col N="17" /> obtaining from the county councils an agricultural rate higher than the minimum of 2d.  There are nine now on the maximum, that is, they are getting the produce of a 3d. rate from the county councils, and some at least of these county committees are anxious to get more.  At present, from the central Exchequer, each county committee gets £1 for every £1 collected from the county council and last year the amount paid by the Exchequer was something like £96,000.  If every county committee were to get the full rate allowed by this Bill, they would be in receipt of £145,000 from the county councils, and the Minister for Finance has agreed to continue the £1 for £1 principle.  If they do reach this maximum of £145,000, a similar sum will also be contributed by the central Exchequer.</P>
    <P>There are two other items dealt with in the Bill.  There is a special grant amounting to £6,000 which was administered by my Department in a more or less arbitrary way.  It was provided for the benefit of the poorer counties and these poorer counties got a bigger slice than some of the better-off counties.  In fact some of the better-off counties got none of it.  We propose to continue that special grant for some time, at least until they all reach the maximum.  There has also been an additional grant, over the last few years, of £50,000 for lime subsidies to the county committees.  That is somewhat abnormal.  It will be continued as long as the abnormal circumstances are there in the matter of artificial manures, but if the emergency had passed away and we were back again to the stage where we could get unlimited supplies of artificial manures it is possible that that particular grant of £50,000, which we are now providing for lime, might be reduced.  As long, however, as the emergency lasts the Minister for Finance will not refuse to contribute in the three ways indicated: (1) £1 for every £1 raised by the county councils; (2) to continue to give the £6,000 by way of a special grant for distribution amongst the poorer counties; and (3) to continue to give this rather high amount for lime subsidies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the House will be agreeable to give the Minister a Second Reading of this Bill. In fact, those of us with experience of the work done by the county committees of agriculture welcome this measure.  It is true that in some of our counties we have not even yet reached the maximum, but, nevertheless, I think there is a general recognition of the fact that the money spent by these county committees of agriculture is probably the best spent money passed out by the Exchequer and contributed, in a certain proportion, by the ratepayers.  It seems to me that much in relation to the whole question of our agricultural policy could be raised and discussed within the rules of order on this Bill.  The real purpose of it is to give power to our county committees of agriculture to spend more money.  That money will be spent by them, in their various activities, in propagating Government policy.  Unless these county committees have a policy to propagate through their officials, a policy which they are prepared to stand over themselves, we would not be justified in giving power to the county councils to raise a larger rate to enable them to extend their activities.  The money that is at present being raised by the county councils for the county committees of agriculture is well spent, and has been for many years past.  We feel that a good return has been got for it.  We would hope, therefore, that if larger sums are now to be placed at the disposal of the county committees, that equally good results will flow from the expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me, however, of vital importance, if we are going to get the best value for the money to be provided, that there are one or two things we ought to have from the Government in order that the work of these county committees, and of their officials, may be as effective as possible in present circumstances.  This was borne in on me at a meeting of our county committee of agriculture which I attended yesterday when certain matters came up for consideration.  Our county officials everywhere are at present <Col N="19" /> being urged, and rightly so, to go out and do what they can to get an additional area under wheat.  Now, we are all for that, but some of us feel-I do and I think it is true to say that the officials of the county committees all over the country feel-that Government policy could be greatly helped if the price which the Minister for Agriculture or the Government is offering for wheat was reasonably adequate: to ensure that the policy of the Government, in so far as those officials have to sponsor or propagate it, will have the best possible chance of success. It is difficult for these officials to go to groups of farmers anywhere and urge a policy which the farmers believe does not commend itself to them in pounds, shillings and pence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of entering into a wide discussion on Government policy.  If additional money is to be raised and placed at the disposal of the county committees of agriculture, I know that part of it is going to be spent on a campaign to be undertaken by out county instructors amongst the farmers to propagate a certain policy.  My point of view is that they are not going to be as successful as we would wish them to be because Government policy in this matter is weak.  My view, and I think it is the view generally held throughout the country, is that the price which the Government are offering for wheat does not give the officials a chance of getting the necessary acreage that the country wants under wheat this season.  If that policy is to get a chance, then the Government ought to announce to-morrow a price that will ensure its success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of this question of growing more wheat is being urged by the Government over the radio, and emphasised from pulpits all over the country.  No matter how anxious all of us may be to help, it is quite impossible to argue the hard facts with the farmers because what they do is determined by the pounds, shillings and pence which their labour earns. Farmers anywhere that I have met them are not satisfied with the price which the Government have fixed for the wheat crop of 1942.  They do not think it is sufficient, with the result that if more is not done in that direction the country will not get as much of the crop sown as it ought to get, or as it wants to get.  If the farmers are to get a good chance of doing their job, they ought to be told to-morrow that a better price will be paid.  I believe that all the officials of the county committees are at one on that point.  I think they have said so. <Col N="21" /> Therefore, I think the Government ought to take the point in view of all the people through the country who are involved in this effort in one way or another, both officials and farmers.</P>
    <P>Another point in connection with this was discussed at our meeting of the county committee of agriculture yesterday. This is the problem which confronts every committee for the coming season&mdash;the shortage of artificial fertilisers. Personally, I believe it is unwise, as well as being quite impossible, to urge the growing of wheat on every kind of land.  Some of our farmers who grew wheat this year were left without any crop, although if they had sown oats they had a chance of getting a crop out of it.  I do not say that has been widespread, but such a thing did happen in many a field in my own county.  If a big acreage of wheat is to be grown next year, and if we are to get any sort of a crop, then I suggest something must be done in the matter of obtaining fertilisers.  I see in to-day's newspapers a statement from the Minister of Agriculture in Northern Ireland to the effect that there they will have supplies of sulphate of ammonia to meet all their requirements this season, provided they can take them within the next six weeks.  Anyone attending fairs along the Border is aware of the fact that numbers of dairy cows are going week after week into the Six Counties and to Belfast.  They will be milked there and the milk will be sent across to England.

      <P>I am sure the Cathaoirleach knows as well as I do that it is putting our agricultural instructors into an impossible position to ask them to go amongst the farmers and appeal to them to put an additional area of their land under crops if they are to be met with the retort: &ldquo;What can we do without artificial manures?&rdquo;  I <Col N="22" /> believe that is the big problem we will have to face this year in the matter of increased tillage.  The situation is such as to justify the Minister for Agriculture taking his courage in his hands and going across to England to put it before the people there.  The Minister should not leave it to officials, but should go across himself and put before the people there the situation that confronts the farmers of this country this year.  I would venture a big bet that if the Minister goes across with the goods he has to offer, he will come back with the artificial manures required for the coming season.  I do not want to see our Minister for Agriculture, or any Minister, humiliated. The State is humiliated when a Minister is humiliated.  But I think the Minister ought to go across and ask and, if he asks, he will receive.  That, in itself, would put the farmers, the committees of agriculture and their officials in a position to deliver goods which, in present circumstances, it is impossible for them to deliver.  I think the few matters I have raised are urgent and that they are pertinent to the Bill because the position of county committees of agriculture throughout the country is similar, I am convinced, to that with which we were confronted yesterday.</P>

      <P>Somebody in this House said that I was, obviously, a town tenant.  I am, but I am also a farmer.  I do not say it in a boasting spirit, but I had one of the inspectors of the Department with me on the 6th November and he was somewhat surprised to see that I had three Irish acres of oats in grass corn&mdash;the 1942 crop.  Here is the matter to which I want to draw the Minister's attention. I hear farmers say everywhere that they are not going to grow as much wheat this year as they did last year. That spirit is quite evident and it is a very serious matter.  I questioned a number of farmers about it and they answered: &ldquo;Why grow wheat at 2/- a stone when we are getting&mdash;even at variance with the law&mdash;2/3 and 2/4 for our oats?&rdquo;  I asked was not the price of oats controlled by the Government. They said: &ldquo;Yes, it may be controlled, but prices are regulated by supply and demand and we are getting 2/3 and 2/4 a stone for our oats, whereas we would get only 2/- for our wheat.&rdquo; Whether that is responsible or not, a considerable number of farmers say that they are not going to grow as much wheat this year as they did last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sent wheat to be crushed for flour &mdash;I shall not say where&mdash;some time ago.  My son came back with a report &mdash;he had to wait for a very long time &mdash;that a very considerable portion of the wheat was being crushed by the owners for pig-feeding.  I asked a certain gentleman if that did not involve a serious disservice to the country.  He said: &ldquo;You know the difficulties farmers have in paying rates.  We can get 2/3 for our oats and it is better to get that price and feed <Col N="24" /> the pigs with wheat, for which we can get only 2/-.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Every farmer knows that the growing of wheat has a deleterious effect on the soil, that it is much more severe and needs a poorer subsoil than oats or barley.  Even if I have diverged somewhat, I am delighted that I got an opportunity to say what I have said because the matter is very serious.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Senators who said that the county committees have done very good work and have made good use of the money raised by rate and the money they got by way of grant. I am glad that every Senator agrees that they should get this extra 1d. in the £.  I do not think that it would be very satisfactory to enter upon a discussion of the price of wheat now. The Cathaoirleach would hardly allow us to proceed to a proper conclusion on that subject.  Senator Baxter said that part of this extra 1d., if asked for by a county committee, if agreed to by a county council and if sanctioned by me, might be used by a county instructor to pay for the expenses of a journey on which he might, possibly, advise farmers to grow wheat.  In that way, Senator Baxter sought to bring his remarks into order.  He said that the instructor's task would be rendered much easier if the price of wheat were higher.  We all agree with that, but I am afraid I cannot pursue that question further.  There are aspects of it which could not be discussed on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry to hear that there is any infringement of the present regulation, as mentioned by Senator Madden, regarding the use of wheat for animal feeding.  That is a question we cannot discuss now, but in a few cases, where we had the necessary proof, very severe penalties were inflicted on the people concerned and there are other penalties to come.  If Senator Madden or any other Senator would help us by giving information which would enable us to get after the people who are infringing the regulations, I promise that they will be suitably dealt with. <Col N="25" /> We must, first of all, make sure that we have enough food for the human population.  I think that we shall have sufficient food after that for all the animals in the country.  So far as can be calculated in my Department, with the crops produced this year&mdash;cereals, potatoes, and beet pulp&mdash;there would appear to be sufficient food for both man and beast.  It is possible that the farmers are a bit over-conservative&mdash;I do not blame them for that because they had a bad time last year&mdash;in keeping over feeding stuffs.  They may be keeping a little bit too much so as to be on the safe side.  It is quite possible that later&mdash;in the spring months&mdash;feeding will be more plentiful because more will be available from the farmers who are somewhat overstocked at the moment.</P>

      <P>The Control of Imports (Amendment) Order, of which the Seanad is asked to approve, is a very formal one, and is made merely for the purpose of regularising what has been the administrative practice of the Revenue Commissioners.  Under the Control of Imports Act the Government had made an order in relation to all the quota orders in force at the time allowing the Revenue Commissioners to permit the importation of goods subject to quota orders, when they were imported as samples, as stage properties, for scientific purposes, or for further manufacture for competitions or exhibitions, or in any such circumstances that the Revenue Commissioners had power under certain Finance Acts to admit without payment of duty.  There were two quota orders made subsequent to the passage of the Control of Imports Act, 1937, and the purpose of this order is to give the Revenue Commissioners, in relation to these two quota orders, the same powers that they have in relation to all the other quota orders.  In fact, the Revenue Commissioners have been <Col N="27" /> proceeding on the assumption that they have these powers, and the orders were made to regularise the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This order has been made because of representations which were made to me after the Gárda Síochána Pensions Order was made last June.  It was represented that there was not adequate allowance made for some of those being retired.  I had the question examined and I was satisfied there was something in it.  I went to the Government and I asked for permission to empower the Minister for Justice, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to give added years up to six years.  At the same time it was thought proper to provide for deduction, instead of addition, if in any future case that should be considered appropriate. The effect would be that in the case of men who have already retired they would get pensions up to half-pay instead of what they would be entitled to if they retired through incapacity, namely, on the actual service given. That is the principal change in the Pensions Order.  There was also a change in one of the articles, under which it was necessary for the Commissioner to give a certificate that a person getting a pension gave satisfactory service.  Obviously if a man was retired because he was not considered satisfactory it was not very <Col N="28" /> convenient for the Commissioner to do that.  We have taken power to make it unnecessary for the Commissioner to give that certificate.  That is all that is in it.  So far, eight senior officers were retired.  It is not the intention to give added years in all cases.  There are some cases undoubtedly in which I am satisfied they should be given. I do not think that in any of the eight we have in view the pensions will be diminished.  The pensions they will be entitled to, if retired from incapacity, would amount to about one-third.  I was asked in the other House if further retirements were in contemplation and, as far as I could learn from the Commissioner, they included about two superintendents and at the outside 30 other ranks, sergeants and Guards.  We hope that will be the end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the order.  I think the Minister would be well advised to make as clear as possible what he said in the last sentence, with regard to the conditions in the force out of which this particular order and the order of last June arose, that he is approaching the end.  It would be desirable, from the point of view of the force itself, and also the public, that the Minister should repeat &mdash;because these things have to be repeated&mdash;that whereas there might be a certain number in contemplation now, when that is over we will reach a point of stabilisation and that what one might call sins committed by persons up to the present will be forgiven. It is very unfortunate that the matter has had to be dealt with in this way. As I said when the order was previously made, the situation, all things considered, is that the Guards were asked to do something which verged upon the miraculous, and the fact that they have been able to do it at all is a great credit to a great many of them. I would like to put the Minister one question concerning the regulations applying to the Guards themselves.  I know that Guards who have a certain number of years' service, who are married and have children, have a great objection to having themselves and their families removed to another <Col N="29" /> part of the country.  I do not know the reason for these removals, but I presume it is for police reasons and as a result of the experience arrived at by this force and other forces.  I wonder if there is any regulation or scheme for moving a young Guard from one station to another&mdash;say, in the first seven or eight years of his service.  I think this would have an effect on his efficiency.  I wonder if there is any effort to give him a variety of duty.</P>
      <P>There is one case with which I happen to be familiar.  An effort is made to get Irish speakers for the Gaeltacht.  Naturally, these Irish speakers come from a remote area originally&mdash;by the very nature of the case.  They are brought to the Depôt and trained, and then sent to an Irish-speaking district&mdash;which also, by definition, is a remote area&mdash;and they are left there for seven or eight years. From the point of view of police duties, I do not think it is possible for a young man to become an efficient Guard if, at the beginning of his experience, he is put into a remote station and left there.  I do not profess any special knowledge of this matter, but it would appear to me that, if a man got a year in a county town like Clonmel, Cavan, Dundalk, Drogheda, or Portlaoighise&mdash;apart from the Cities of Limerick, Cork and Waterford&mdash;it would be of very considerable advantage to him.</P>
      <P>In the first years of their service, every Guard should see what real police duties are like in towns of a substantial size.  The idea of sending a man who comes from a remote area out into another remote area, leaving him there for the first formative years, tends towards inefficiency and to, perhaps, the kind of thing to deal with which this order is framed.  I am supporting the order.  Perhaps I should have given notice to the Minister that I intended to raise this particular matter.  I wonder whether there are any regulations or any scheme by which Guards, in the early part of their service, are given an opportunity to see different types of police duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not against the order, but support it.  However, it has been pointed out to me that there <Col N="30" /> is a rather strange anomaly in this. We are giving extended years for pension purposes to men who have to be retired from the force for, shall I say, inefficiency; but, in the case of a man who has to retire for health reasons, though there is a certain pension, so far as I know if he is under the statutory period he does not get any addition to his years of service.  Does it not look rather unfair that the man who, for certain reasons, has to be retired compulsorily, is getting this extended period so as to qualify for an enlarged pension, whereas the man who is retired through no fault of his own, but perhaps for health reasons, is penalised?  It was pointed out to me that there is a certain number of men who, as a result of their activities in the force, have contracted ill-health, but not enough ill-health to be retired. These men carry on under difficulties and in some cases, perhaps, the state of their health may be responsible for some of the back-sliding.  It may happen occasionally that, in view of the health of these men, there may be a medical inspection, and if they are found to be not quite fit for active work they may be retired.  Then, in all fairness, they should get the same consideration as is given to the men whose cases are under consideration now.</P>
      <P>With reference to the point raised by Senator Hayes, I quite agree.  Take the case of a man who is sent to the Gaeltacht.  As a rule, he is sent because he is a thoroughly competent Irish speaker.  Would it not be better &mdash;as the Senator points out&mdash;to send some of the young men who have a fair knowledge of the language?  It would be first-class training for them to be resident in the Gaeltacht and would enable them to improve their knowledge of Irish.  A man who has a competent knowledge of Irish, sent to an English or semi-English speaking district, would probably be of great help to his colleagues there.  That is one aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other aspect has been mentioned on many occasions before.  Is it advisable that these young men should be left for a long period in one neighbourhood?  There is often the <Col N="31" /> danger that a &ldquo;hail-fellow-well-met&rdquo; type of young man may be led into temptation.  If it is taken in time, before it goes too far, and he is changed to a station in charge of a man who is very keen on discipline, it might be the best thing that could happen to him.  I know this suggestion would be very unwelcome to the men themselves, but it may be in the best interests of many of the young men if they could be placed in positions where they would be under careful supervision and relieved from the temptation that is so prevalent in many of the stations.  This matter is somewhat outside the scope of what we are discussing, but we did not get an opportunity to raise it for some time and it may be no harm to have it ventilated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that Senator Goulding has drawn attention so clearly to what appers to be a grave anomaly in the principle of this order. The Seanad is in considerable difficulty in studying this order.  I understand that one copy has been left in the Library&mdash;it has not been circulated&mdash; and Senators have had no other opportunity to study it.  It would require some hours' work to understand as much of the order as we learned in a few minutes from the Minister, who put the central point so clearly for our benefit.  Nor have we had an opportunity to study the discussion in the Dáil, as the report which contains it arrived only to-day&mdash;my copy was on the doorstep as I was coming here this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Senator Goulding's point, I feared that that was the meaning of the order, from the little I could learn of it until the Minister spoke.  He said quite clearly and frankly that it was definitely putting officers whose performance of their duties or whose capacity&mdash;I do not want to say anything harsh&mdash;was not quite equal to the duties they might be called on to perform at their degree of seniority in a better position as regards pensions than men who had served in the ordinary way, with good characters, in the force, and who retired through ill-health. <Col N="32" /> I think that a stronger word than &ldquo;anomaly&rdquo; might be applied to that.</P>
    <P>I do not grudge the addition the Minister proposes to give to this small class of people.  It is no excuse to say it is a small one&mdash;that excuse has been given for other things.  I think, however, it is an injustice to men who, through stress of work throughout the country, have broken down in health and are retired, that they are not treated as well as those whose capacity fails to adjust itself to a position of responsibility&mdash;and that is, I think, the position of officers for whom this order is designed.  The Minister has not made any attempt to justify his proposals in favour of this small group of men as against those whose health has broken down in the ordinary service of the Guards.  I cannot think of anything which would be more likely to cause discontent among the rank and file of the force, I cannot imagine anything which would be more likely to give rise to a sense of injustice, anything more calculated to be a righteous cause of discontent, than for members of the force to think that when they retire in the ordinary course they will be treated worse than men who were retired for inefficiency.</P>
    <P>The Minister is probably aware that there is a good deal of discontent among the Gárda at the present time on account of inadequate attention given to their health while members of the force.  I understand that they have to pay for any special treatment they may receive out of their own pockets. The Government gives some small help towards the Gárda benefit fund, but the proportion is, I understand, small. I think it is entirely wrong that the health of the Gárda should not be safeguarded by a proper system of treatment such as is provided for the members of the Army.  That hardship placed on the Gárda of providing for the care of their own health certainly gives rise to discontent.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware that there have been grave complaints published in the journal of the Gárda in relation to sickness in the force, which must be associated with this lack of <Col N="33" /> attention.  There have been grave complaints of insanitary conditions and the insanitary mode of living that many of the Gárda&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I rose chiefly to support what Senator Goulding has said about the anomaly that exists&mdash;I would call it an injustice&mdash;with relation to the treatment of these men who are going because of inefficiency and the treatment of men whose health has broken down in the course of their duty.  Senator Hayes made a very proper remark when he said that the country owes a great deal to the Gárda for the services they have rendered in past years.  They have performed magnificent services.  That is a comment which is properly made on the whole body of the Gárda and which should not be applied especially to the eight or ten officers with whom this order deals.  The Minister in his opening statement to-day and in his remarks in the Dáil has not given any explanation to justify his proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the provisions of this order.  We are labouring under the disadvantage referred to by the previous speaker, the disadvantage of not having seen the order.  That is unfortunate.  There do appear to be some anomalies.  I understand that the order will be in force for 12 months. There is a feeling among members of the force that under this order men may be retired for reasons other than inefficiency.  Men may be retired through ill-health, and I take it that all retirements in the force will take place under the order during the period of its operation.  I do not think it is right or proper that other retirements taking place, in addition to those mentioned by the Minister, should come under the order.  I think they should be dealt with by ordinary disciplinary methods, as of old.  These men should not come out at this period with the stain of inefficiency pursuing them through life.  No member of the Gárda should be retired through this order on the ground of ill-health, even <Col N="34" /> where that ill-health has made him inefficient.</P>
      <P>The Minister wishes to obtain power to add to the approved years of service in the case of certain officers.  I think the same power ought to be applied generally to the Gárda; there should be no discrimination between these officers and the Gárda generally.  When they joined the force originally, they were all more or less of a uniform type. A man who has given 16 or 17 years' service, who has a family and whose whole interests are wrapped up in the Gárda, may find himself in a terrible position if, under this order, he is retired.  He will have the responsibility of rearing a young family and he will have nothing with which to face the future except a miserable pension of 20/- or 25/- a week&mdash;which, I think, will be the average amount.  I think the Minister is taking a lot on his hands when he is taking power to diminish the years of approved service.  Approved service would appear to be the service that a man gets a certificate for, and I think the Minister is very unwise in taking it on himself to diminish the years of approved service, whether it be in the case of an officer or an ordinary Guard.</P>
      <P>It would ease the minds of the Gárda generally&mdash;and I may say that there is great uneasiness among them&mdash;if the Minister would make it clear that this applies only to people whose inefficiency arose through faults which we need not now go into, and not through ill-health.  He should also make it clear that the old disciplinary methods will apply after this order has ceased to have effect.  It is necessary to make it clear that the two periods will not be mixed up, and that there will be a definite line drawn between men who are forced to go out through ill-health and men who are forced to go out through inefficiency, failure to give useful service to the people.  I think the Minister should make it clear that there will be no difference in the treatment given to the ordinary Gárda and the officers. What will apply to one should apply to all; there should be the same measure of indulgence and the same measure of censure.</P>

      <P>I want to express my sympathy with the point of view stated by Senators Goulding and Rowlette and I want to ask the Minister a question.  I want to know when this order and the previous order, to which this is closely allied, will come to an end.  I think we all have sympathy with the difficulty in which the Minister is placed in dealing with this rather abnormal matter.  There apparently may be an injustice during a certain period to some people who may have to retire because of ill-health; their position may be worse than the position of certain others who were, in effect, compulsorily retired.  I want to know how long that period will be.  If it is an indefinite period, there might be a danger; if it is a short period, a period of short duration, one definitely defined, and if no other Minister will have the power afterwards, the injustice might affect a few people but from the public point of view it would not be so objectionable.</P>

      <P>I think the whole trouble in the Guards was due entirely to the length of time that officers were allowed to remain in particular areas. I think that all Senators will agree that we have as good a police force as there is to be found in Europe and no Senator has any reflections to make on any member of the force.  The Gárda are human, and if they are allowed to remain ten, 12 or 14 years in an area they will naturally make friends there and there is a danger that they will be tempted&mdash;and there is plenty of temptation&mdash;and, unfortunately, some of them fall.  Now, I think that the old system in the Royal Irish Constabulary, where an ordinary constable would only remain in a certain area for a certain number of years, was a good system.  After having served a certain number of years in one area, he was transferred to another area.  As Senator Hayes has pointed out, these men should not be confined to a remote area, because, as a result of being confined to the one area, they make friends and it is possible that they may get into trouble as a result.  Unfortunately, of course, a number of men have been obliged to retire for certain reasons, but that is no justification for <Col N="36" /> saying that the Gárda Síochána, as a whole, is anything but a decent body of men, and I hope that, if certain members of the Gárda Síochána have to retire as a result of ill-health, the Government will give full credit to these men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on a point of personal explanation. I think Senator Goulding misunderstood me.  In the remarks I made, I was not referring to the question of the Irish language at all.  The point I was trying to make was that if young members of the Gárda Síochána at the beginning of their service are left in a remote area for five or six years, it cannot be good for them.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of retirement on medical grounds, I wish to say that I know of a case of a man, who had been formerly interned with me, and who became blind in 1931.  I think he is now depending on a blind pension, and I think the Minister ought to take into consideration such cases as that, particularly in view of the fact that the Gárda Síochána, in the beginning, had to face peculiar difficulties which, I hope, will not occur again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The one question with which Senators seem to be chiefly concerned&mdash;and this was also the case in the Dáil&mdash;is that of members of the Gárda Síochána being retired on grounds of ill-health, but that is a question which is wrapped up in Civil Service Regulations, and I do not think I could deal with that matter. This order was brought in to deal with a particular condition.  In reply to Senator Douglas, I may say that the order is only temporary, and it is expected that it will lapse next June.  I do not see, at the moment, any reason for a renewal of the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of retirement due to incapacity, that is not a matter for me to decide; it is a matter for the Minister for Finance and, with all respect, it is a matter that does not really arise on this question, although it was raised also in the Dáil.  I can quite understand men being retired under such circumstances and feeling that they <Col N="37" /> had a certain case for getting more than men retired under other circumstances. Some of these men thought that they should have been heard and that they should have got more, but the Government did not agree with that.  On paper, at least, these men made a case, and that is why I brought in this order.  I felt that there was force in the case that was made.</P>
    <P>However, I suppose it would be better for me, at the moment, to keep to Senator Hayes's point about Gárdaí being changed.  I know that the Commissioner, in the case of the Taca Síochána, did not allow them to go out of Dublin until they had a certain amount of training.  In fact, I think they are all still here.  The Commissioner realised that these men should be trained.  I am not quite certain, but I think the practice is to give a young Gárda service in a fair-sized town before sending him anywhere else.  I am not quite sure about that, and all I can say now is that I will draw the Commissioner's attention to the matter.  I think the early training of a young Gárda is particularly looked after, and I am fairly certain that, in the case of the Taca Síochána, the man concerned gets a good training before he is sent into a remote area.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Senator MacCabe, about some of these men being changed from place to place, I do not think that that would arise in connection with the question of retirement as a result of ill-health. I understand, however, that our provisions in that regard compare favourably with those of any other police force in the world.  Naturally, I am not quite certain about that, but I am informed that the treatment given to such men on retirement here is at least as good as that of men in similar forces in any other country.</P>
    <P>Senator Cummins dealt with the question of approved service. &ldquo;Approved service&rdquo; here means actual service.  That is what it means in this order.  Then, Senator Cummins wanted to know whether all retirements would be made under this order while it remains in force.  At least, that is what I understood him to say. <Col N="38" /> Of course, that could not happen.  If some Gárda or officer of the Gárda misbehaved himself, he would have to be dealt with by a disciplinary court, and his retirement, under such circumstances, would have to be with the consent of the Minister.  That has happened in a couple of cases recently. But it must be remembered that some people might want to take advantage of this order, and get out of the force in that way, and so we still have the ordinary disciplinary regulations, and we do not intend to depart from them at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>In raising this matter, I assume that all the members of this House know as much about the case as I do.  My knowledge is very largely confined to the reports in the newspapers, and these reports reveal a very alarming situation and throw doubt, at least, on many of our institutions in this State.  I, therefore, take this opportunity to secure some assurance to the public at large that this matter is not going to remain where it is at present.  There are grave misgivings in every walk of life in the community regarding this case.  It has caused great interest generally, particularly amongst the class to which I belong. As I said, there are many of our institutions under a cloud, for instance the Ministry of Justice, the Attorney-General and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.  I think all those Departments are more or less under a cloud.  In the case of the Ministry of Justice, somewhere about the 10th of the present month, with all the majesty of the law, two people were prosecuted in the Criminal Court for fraud, for very extensive frauds.  There were 24 charges formulated against those people, and, according to the judge, in the public interest 23 of them were dropped&mdash;mark you, &ldquo;in the public interest&rdquo;&mdash;and the minor charge was <Col N="39" /> proceeded with, on which those people were convicted.  In Dun Laoghaire, somewhere about the 19th of the present month, two unemployed men were prosecuted for stealing logs, and both of them were sent to jail for two months.  I do not know how any community is to believe that the law is impartial, in view of this and numerous other instances in which the unemployed, the poverty-stricken people, are penalised to the very limit.  I am not going into the case where a man who stole a few shillings' worth of gas was sent to jail for six months, an unemployed man who was in bad health, or to compare that with the treatment meted out in the Ennis case, but I think something has got to be done about it.  It reminds me of a quotation &mdash;I do not know the author&mdash;which fits this situation very well.  It runs something like this: &ldquo;The law doth punish the man or woman who steals the goose from off the common, but lets the greater felon loose who steals the common from off the goose.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the author, but the quotation certainly fits the situation here very well.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is here in relation to this motion on the adjournment, and I want to say in this connection that long before Order 83 came into operation there was a Prices Commission set up, and the greatest possible difficulty was put in the way of fair employers who believed that their workmen ought to have an increase in wages.  They had first to satisfy this Prices Commission that no increase would be put on the commodity which they produced in order to give the increase in wages.  Those were fair employers, people who were anxious to provide good conditions for their employees, and they were hampered by this body.  Now, let us see what occurred in connection with this company. This company, Messrs. Jordan and Company, of Ennis, at one period made 80 per cent. profit in one year. What were the Prices Commission doing there?  Surely they must have <Col N="40" /> had some knowledge of what was going on, but, so far as the public know, no action was taken in connection with this matter.  As I said before, there is a great deal of alarm in the country in regard to this case, and it has been suggested&mdash;and will be believed until it is proved otherwise&mdash;that this is typical of a number of industries of new origin in this country.  It matters not to the people whether they are exploited by an alien or a native if they are to be exploited, but I submit that in this case the thing was overdone; it became an outrage.  In one case, the Revenue Commissioners were defrauded of over £11,000.  That £11,000 would pay the wages of the staff in Ennis for several years.  Note also that those people were making 80 per cent. on their capital in one year.  As I said, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is here, and I am sure he will deal with the matter. I submit that this Prices Commission, or whatever effort is being made to control prices, is a farce so long as what happened in Ennis is allowed to go on.  They are more concerned with preventing the working classes from getting real wages than they are about controlling the profits of exploiting capitalists.  The idea of a Prices Commission is a farce so long as any company can make 80 per cent. on its capital in one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, there are many features of this case which are causing great alarm and concern throughout the length and breadth of the country, not the least of which is that the man who had the public spirit and sincerity to expose all this, the secretary of the company, has been dismissed.  The judge, in giving his decision, recommended that this man should be retained in the company. Mark you, this man is not an alien; he has roots here; he has a family here; he is a man of good reputation, but, because he responded to the appeal of the Government, and would not be a party to this fraud and robbery, those people had the audacity, within a fortnight after their conviction on the minor charge which I have mentioned, to dismiss him from his employment.  The man who was public spirited enough to expose this fraud was thrown out of employment.  So far <Col N="41" /> as those people are concerned, himself and his family can starve, while the man who was convicted can celebrate his victory in one of the big hotels in the city.  He can celebrate his triumph over the Government and the law and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and everybody else.  Are we or is the Government going to stand by and allow a man like the secretary of that company to be thrown out on the streets by a non-native?  It is for this and other reasons that I take this opportunity of asking the Government to explain to the people what their attitude is on this whole matter. Unfortunately, the Minister for Justice is not here.  I should like to get an explanation from his Department as to why the Attorney-General agreed to drop the 23 more serious charges in this indictment and proceed on a minor one, but, as the Minister for Justice is not here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Foran requires the presence of not only one Minister but of two and perhaps of three.  He has the advantage of having a Minister present within the House to reply to him and the further advantage, which few Senators have enjoyed, of having another Minister listening to him in the gallery.  I should like to make a few remarks entirely from the point of view of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and entirely from the point of view of the public interest, as distinct from any question of different types of treatment meted out to different classes of persons.  I have no special knowledge of this matter; I do not know anybody concerned in it.  I do not know the man who has been dismissed.  I have never spoken to anybody about it and all my knowledge of the case is entirely <Col N="42" /> drawn from what I read in the newspapers. I am aware that newspaper reports of cases in the courts are not full reports&mdash;they could not very well be&mdash;and I am also aware that one should not base one's view of an individual merely on the report of evidence in court.  In this particular instance, however, a number of charges were made against individuals.  To some of these charges a plea of guilty was entered, a conviction was recorded on these charges and a penalty was imposed by the judge.  About that there can be no doubt whatever.  One is entitled on that basis of fact to make certain general observations.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to follow Senator Foran by weighing up the verdict or the adequacy or inadequacy of the punishment accorded but merely to take the position of the man who was dismissed, as it appears to the ordinary citizen who has no special knowledge of the matter.  The secretary of a public company has, I think, three duties.  He has a duty to his immediate superior, the managing director of the company&mdash;in this case one of the accused who pleaded guilty to a particular offence.  He has a duty in the second place to the shareholders of the company through the directors and he has also a duty as a citizen to the State.  Now, Sir, naturally the auditors of a public company must get assistance from the secretary of the company in the interests of the shareholders.  Supposing, as in this case, the secretary does make a disclosure, <i>bona fide</i>, which is in whole or in part upheld in court, is it not in the public interest that a man who does take that action should not be penalised, that the ordinary citizen, and the Minister who represents the ordinary citizen, should do whatever is in his power&mdash;I am not clear what is in his power&mdash;to see that such a man is not penalised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order, Sir, to grasp the situation one must consider the relative positions of the State on the one hand, the guilty parties on the other, and then the person who was the State witness. The State got a verdict; it got a fine and the Revenue Commissioners will get their taxes.  Not only will they get their taxes but they may also get a <Col N="43" /> penal multiplication of the taxes.  I forget exactly what the penalty is, but the Revenue Commissioners will certainly get it.  The State, therefore, gets all its taxes, plus a fine, plus a sum of money by way of penalty. Those who admitted that they had broken the law are let off on paying a fine.  They are left in possession of their liberty and in possession of a sound business or a substantial share of a sound business, which runs with certain favours conferred upon it, as a matter of public policy, by the Oireachtas, by this State. That is the position of the guilty parties.  In the third place the secretary, through whom the State has gained&mdash;when I say the State, of course, I mean the whole lot of us&mdash; the secretary who was instrumental in putting the State into the position in which it now is left, has lost his livelihood in circumstances which, it appears to me, will not improve his chance of getting another position.</P>
    <P>What is more important is that every other secretary of a company in that position is now asking himself a certain question.  I think there can be no doubt that every other secretary of a company is saying to himself: &ldquo;If I take any action of this kind, or become involved in any way in any transaction of this nature, will my fate also be that I shall be thrown out on the street?&rdquo; I think from every point of view that that is a very lamentable situation, one which the Minister should do everything possible to remedy.  I realise the difficulty of individuals who have had a very serious falling out working together, but I do think that if there is anything that can be done by the State, anything in the power that the Minister has at the moment, or any power that can be conferred on him to do justice to an individual in that position.  I am sure everybody would agree that justice should be done.</P>
    <P>I do not want to discuss the policy of tariffs, monopolies or special favours to industrialists.  That is not the question at issue here at all, but since the policy has been adopted of giving favours to particular individuals or <Col N="44" /> groups of individuals, we must surely agree that these individuals also have certain obligations imposed on them. The Minister, almost necessarily following from the policy which has been pursued, has been given very considerable power over firms and individuals. I think that any person who is put in a position of reaping profit from privileges granted to him in the public interest must realise that while he has got certain privileges, there is also power to remove these privileges and that that power will, if necessary, be exercised.  I am far from being clear as to what precise action the Minister should take, but I am clear that if any person, enjoying special privileges from the State which give him a profit, breaks the law of the State, another person who keeps the law should certainly not be put in a worse position than the person who has broken the law.  I am at one with Senator Foran in this&mdash;perhaps it is a class question; perhaps I have some of Senator Foran's bias with regard to class&mdash;I do not think any fine or any penalty for income-tax imposed on a prosperous company is comparable to making a salary earner or a wage earner lose his livelihood.  In this case the one man who did no harm, who in fact did the State a service, as far as we can see from the newspapers, does appear to have suffered and the person or persons who reaped a profit and who confessed their guilt are merely punished by a fine.  That seems to me to be an inexcusable state of affairs. Whether by way of pension, gratuity or otherwise, that particular individual, it would appear to me on the evidence so far as I have read it, is entitled to better treatment, not only from the point of view of equity, from the point of doing justice but also&mdash;and I submit to the Minister this is much more important&mdash;from the point of view of industrial development, from the point of view of seeing that secretaries of companies do their duty honestly, not only by their own directors but also by the State, whose custodian and guardian the Minister is and about whose interest we here are specially concerned.</P>
    <P>I should, therefore, like to hear from the Minister whether, under the powers <Col N="45" /> he has, there is anything he could do, or whether he has any suggestion to make of any action he could take with extra powers.  I think I should add that between Senator Foran and myself, we have taken up, I am afraid, most of the half-hour allotted, and I take it that there would be no objection from any side of the House to the Minister's being given ample time to reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information. This is a very serious matter for the Irish people.  The order in force in this country in connection with new industries is that 51 per cent. of the capital must be Irish.  Now, in the formation of these companies there are two forms of shares&mdash;preference and ordinary shares.  Only the ordinary shareholders have a right to attend a meeting of the company and to vote.  The preference shareholders have no vote, either in person or by proxy, so that the control of the company rests entirely in the hands of the ordinary shareholders.  I am speaking subject to correction, but I understand that is the general principle.  What is the position of the capital of this company? Who are the holders of the ordinary shares and who are the holders of the preference shares?  That would give us an idea whether foreign or Irish capital controls the company.</P>
      <P>I am afraid the other directors of the company&mdash;I do not know who they are&mdash;are hardly free from blame in the matter.  No matter who accepts the position of a director of a company, if he does not keep a careful eye on the company's interests, and if any individual or any number of individuals could get away with a thing like this it is a very serious matter.  The secretary acted a manly part and it would be too bad that this country should let such a man down in favour of any foreigner, no matter who he is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to say much about this, except that the seriousness of the matter, from the point of view of the public, is very great, and that I know it is causing considerable concern amongst Irish industrialists, the vast majority of whom, I am satisfied, run their businesses in a manner which is beyond reproach, so far as integrity is concerned. My difficulty is that the public mind has been undoubtedly affected and affected in a way which may be serious, unless in some way or other it can be presented to them in a different manner, while, at the same time, in no way withholding the truth.  I think Senator Foran stated that there were 24 charges, and the difficulty is that I cannot honestly make a comment, good, bad or indifferent, in regard to 23 charges which the State withdrew, because I do not know the facts and, therefore, can only refer to the possible effect of one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I would have said anything but for the fact that I want to agree and disagree with Senator Goulding.  I agree with him as to the responsibility of the directors, particularly for the decision to dismiss the secretary of the company, which normally could not be done without the assent of the directors.  But I also want to say that, while I believe directors ought not to remain directors of companies of which they have no knowledge&mdash;if there are any such&mdash;or to which they cannot give reasonable attention, at the same time the public ought not to imagine that a director who attends directors' meetings regularly, intelligently asks questions relating to the business and to the books can possibly watch every transaction of the company.  It is in the interests <Col N="47" /> of the directors and of those who are trying to carry out their duties as directors conscientiously, that the integrity and responsible position of the secretary and of the officers of the company should be maintained, because without that the position of the directors would be such that I think such service as they can give&mdash;and they can give very considerable service&mdash;will be almost futile.  But do not go away with the idea that the best directors you can find in the country, even half a dozen of them, can possibly, while giving full attention even at directors' meetings, watch the passing of invoices, the checking of goods, and the various items where there could be abuses.</P>
    <P>I have felt I should say that, and also that, to my knowledge, the matter has caused considerable concern amongst industrialists.  But most of those who have spoken to me or to whom I have spoken are in the difficulty that there was a case in the court, and we must assume that the State would not have withdrawn the charges, or that the judge would have agreed to the withdrawal, if they had believed that a <i>prima facie</i> case existed for those charges.  For my part, I think it would be wise for the House to deal with the matter on which there was a plea of guilty and the position with regard to the secretary.  I do not think that anyone appreciates more than I do the difficulty that might arise.  But the company were clearly in a difficult position after the case, and I have sympathy with the directors who, probably, were in no way responsible for any irregularities which took place; I am speaking of the ordinary directors.  But most of us do feel that their action within a fortnight in dismissing the man, contrary to the opinion of the judge, raises an issue which may have very unfortunate effects on the good name of Irish industry and of the State as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

      <P>I have very few words to offer, but I must say that I am exceedingly glad Senator Foran gave us an opportunity to hear something about this very important matter from the Minister for Industry and <Col N="48" /> Commerce.  The discussion has tended to concentrate upon the injustice done to the dismissed secretary, and upon the bad effects that is likely to have upon people in a similar position.  But, for my part, I was almost as much shocked when I read of the re-appointment as managing director of a man who had been convicted of fraud.  It is quite true that a number of charges were not pressed, but he was convicted of fraud; and what an example that is for the people of the country as a whole, for our industry as a whole, and even for Government servants as a whole.  I dare say it follows as a matter of course that, if the managing director convicted of fraud is re-appointed, the secretary, who has been instrumental in revealing that fraud, has to go.  The original and almost the worst fault seems to me to be the re-appointment of a man convicted of fraud.</P>

      <P>I wish at the beginning to make it clear that my presence here, as distinct from the presence of another Minister, was not intended to confine Senator Foran to any particular points of this matter.  To the extent that Senator Foran was confined, it was by his own action in so far as he gave notice of intention to raise here disclosures made in evidence during the trial to which he referred, and nothing else.  In so far as he raised the matter of the withdrawal of other charges against the two men who were on trial, I want to say that there is nothing which the Government would welcome more than an opportunity of making the facts fully known to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that an opportunity will be taken in the Dáil next week to make such a statement.  I am not in a position to go into detail but I think I should say that the withdrawal of the other charges against the two men on trial was not done at the wish of the Attorney-General or counsel representing the State in the case.  I agree with a great deal of what Senator Foran has said and with a great deal of the indignation he has expressed.  I feel also with Senator Hayes that we should <Col N="49" /> make it clear that the public of this country commend the action of the secretary in drawing the attention of the Department of Supplies to certain irregularities in the affairs of the company. I would not agree with Senator Hayes that, by doing so, Mr. McCleery has prejudiced his chances of obtaining other employment of a similar character.  On the contrary, I feel certain that most public companies in this country would like to have in their service a man who had thus established his integrity and public spirit.</P>

      <P>In reply to the point raised by Senator Goulding, the position is that L. Jordan and Company, Limited, Ennis, is an Irish company, established under the law of this country, with the great majority of its ordinary shares held by citizens of this country and the majority of its board of directors citizens of this country.  I agree entirely with Senator Douglas that the other directors of the company cannot be commended on their action after the result of the trial in declining to accept the offered resignation of the managing director or dismissing the secretary.  I do not think these other directors have shown that they appreciated fully the significance which the public attached to the whole incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel strongly about this matter because I know that this one incident, isolated though it may be, may do damage to the policy of industrial development in this country which it may take years to repair.  It is natural that people assume from one incident that irregularities of the same kind are general.  I am sure that most people connected with business in this country know that incidents of the kind revealed in this trial are most unusual and that, so far as the public companies of this country are concerned, <Col N="50" /> there is rarely in the conduct of any of them anything which could possibly lead to similar circumstances arising.</P>
    <P>It is a very rare occasion that anything of this character emerges in the courts and it would be a false conclusion for anyone to arrive at that because of this one incident there were similar irregularities in the conduct of other public companies.  My feeling in this matter is strengthened by the fact that for some time past it has been the experience of the Department of Supplies, in dealing with this company, that they were unwilling to afford to my Department the same degree of co-operation which other manufacturers gave, and in some respects their attitude could be described as one of obstruction.  In the year 1940, as soon as the accounts for the first half of the company's financial year became available, it appeared that they were making profits substantially in excess of those previously earned.  These profits were not 80 per cent.  The profits revealed by the accounts of the company, certified by the auditors, in 1937 were £5,400; in 1938, £6,300; in 1939, £7,900.  These are the net profits.  It was not until the year 1940 that a substantial inflation of the company's profits appeared.  It is true that to a considerable extent that substantial inflation in the company's profits was due to the development in that year of an export trade of considerable dimensions.  That export trade was made possible by heavy stocks of materials purchased during the early months of the war.  It was brought to an end by my order prohibiting these exports early this year when I considered it desirable to conserve that stock of materials for our own purposes.</P>
    <P>The matter of the prices charged by the company at home was, however, taken up with it because it was obvious that, despite the addition of this export trade, the profits which were being earned were substantially greater than appeared justifiable even if allowance was made for the expansion in the company's business at home.  At an early stage in the Department's examination of the company's affairs information became available to the Department <Col N="51" /> which it was considered should be communicated forthwith to the Attorney-General and that information led eventually to the court proceedings referred to here.  During the period that the court proceedings were pending and while the managing director was suspended from his office I considered that the attitude of the company called for drastic action by my Department; but it was a matter of some difficulty, Senators will understand, to devise a course of action which it could not be argued might prejudice the trial.  Now that the trial has ended, that position will be taken up.</P>
    <P>I should explain that the powers of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to investigate the affairs of a company are strictly defined in the Company's Consolidation Acts.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has no power or no right to investigate the affairs of a company, unless he is requested to do so by shareholders of the company holding not less than 10 per cent. of the issued shares.  I have received no request from the shareholders of this company for an inquiry into its affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Industrial Credit Company no nominee on the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  So I understand. The company is, of course, subject now to the terms of the standstill order. Senator Foran made reference to it as it affects workers, but it also limits the distribution of dividends by public companies, and the profits of this company are subject to the excess corporation profits tax recently imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to say anything concerning the allegation that the company has defrauded the Revenue.  That is a matter upon which we might all have an opinion, but it must be clear that there has been no judicial decision yet upon that subject.  I know that the matter is engaging the attention of the Revenue Commissioners, but I cannot say more about it at this stage. The only privilege which the company can be said to have enjoyed from the <Col N="52" /> Government was that of a protective tariff.  As it happened, a decision was taken to suspend the protective tariff enjoyed by that company, together with a number of other protective tariffs, and that decision is now being implemented.  It will be necessary, assuming that the attitude of the company will remain unchanged, to take further measures to regulate the sale of its products.  What these measures may be I am not now in a position to say, because it is clearly a matter of some difficulty to regulate the price and distribution of products of the character produced by this company. I gather that they manufacture and sell some 120 different lines of products, all of which are related to one another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the number is probably much higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The number is probably much higher.  If there has been any delay on the part of the Department of Supplies in taking that action, it was due solely to the fact that these court proceedings were pending, and it was not desirable to create a situation in which it could be said that the trial of the persons charged had been prejudiced by the action of the Government.</P>
      <P>I do not know that it is possible for me to say anything more at this stage in relation to any of the matters mentioned. I understand that a number of specific questions relating to the matter have been tabled for the Dáil next week.  They are addressed to various Ministers and all of them will be replied to.  In the course of these Dáil replies, the matters affecting Departments other than those for which I am responsible will be dealt with, and perhaps it is better that I should leave them to be dealt with by these replies rather than to attempt to deal with them myself, as my knowledge of the attitude and actions of other Departments is not as complete as it is of the Department of which I am in charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the future of the company is concerned, it is a matter of some speculation.  I think we must create a <Col N="53" /> situation in which it will be possible for us to ensure that the affairs of the company will be carried on with due regard for the position it occupies here.  It is true that the company has not got in any sense a legal monopoly, but by reason of the fact that it is the only company producing some of the lines of goods it sells, and that the importation of these goods is not now possible, arising out of the emergency, it has a virtual monopoly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <P>Could the Minister say whether the company has an industrial credit loan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The history of the company, as I understand it, is that it was established as a private company.  It subsequently applied for and received a trade loan guarantee.  Later, it was floated as a public company and the trade loan was repaid in full.  The flotation of the public company was underwritten by the Industrial Credit Company.  I do not want Senator Baxter to misunderstand the position of the Industrial Credit Company.  It is in no way subject to the Government. Its activities are completely independent of the Government and in its ordinary activities in underwriting issues of shares and other matters of that kind, it is not subject to Government direction in any form whatever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that question without some notice.  I looked up the position of the company to remind myself of its position under the Control of Manufactures Act.  I got the information which clearly established that the great majority of its ordinary shares are held by persons who are qualified as Irish citizens under the Control of Manufactures Act, but I did not go to the trouble of finding out who were the individual shareholders.  It is possible that the Industrial Credit Company may hold some of the shares, although it is the general policy of that company to dispose of these shares to the public when the time is favourable.  It may be that <Col N="54" /> the whole of the issue was subscribed by the public, but I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <P>I do not know that there is anything further I want to say.  I was going to conclude by expressing the opinion that, having regard to what has happened in the history of this company, it will be essential for the Government, when any question arises in the future of reimposing duties to protect it, to ensure that the company's affairs will be conducted in a manner which will reflect the responsibilities of its position.</P>
