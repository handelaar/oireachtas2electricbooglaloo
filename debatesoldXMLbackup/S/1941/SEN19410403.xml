      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Emergency Powers (No. 73) Order, 1941, tabled on the 27th March, 1941, be and is hereby annulled.</P>
      <P>I should like, at the outset, to assure the Minister and the House that I am not full of malice in moving this motion.  I have a point of view about the efficacy of the methods which the Minister is adopting to achieve a certain end, and I had no other method open to me but to put the motion down in the form in which it is.  If it were possible to put down a motion to amend the order in a particular way, giving certain powers to local authorities, I should have preferred to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To begin with, this order sets out that local authorities, urban councils, corporations, and county councils will have power to go in and acquire by agreement or compulsorily any bog land.  They may acquire it on behalf of the State.  Many of the difficulties which I foresee in this are of such a character that it would be unwise to permit these powers to be operated by local authorities without full examination of all the implications of the order. It was never my point of view, and I am not going to suggest, that our local authorities generally are not competent. In fact, I have always maintained in this House, and elsewhere, that local authorities do tolerably well the work for which they are elected.  Some do it magnificently, others are not just so successful; but, taking it on the whole, regarding the people elected to discharge certain obligations to the ratepayers and the poor of their county, I think we can say that they do us credit. They are unpaid, and most of the public <Col N="986" /> representatives are very busy men. Members of the county councils are usually individuals who live far from the county centres.  They come to the meeting once a month, but their activities are not finished there.  The problem, as I see it, is of such a magnitude that, in my judgment, it cannot be tackled and solved by merely issuing this Emergency Order and passing the burden and the responsibility over to local authorities to provide fuel for the people of this State for the coming 12 months.</P>
    <P>What is the problem?  An Taoiseach, speaking in Limerick on Saturday last, told us that last year we imported 2,750,000 tons of coal, and last year we cut 3,800,000 tons of turf, and also had 1,700,000 tons of mechanically won turf. He goes on to warn us that this year we must prepare for a situation when we may have to provide all our fuel requirements from our own bogs, and that that means, with one ton of coal equalling two tons of turf, we must this year provide 8,000,000 tons of turf. I have gone into this because I am trying to get at the back of the mind of the Ministry on this question.  The Taoiseach told us that every available man from now on should be employed cutting turf.  He suggested that every idle man in the rural parts of Ireland who is able to use a spade, or able or willing to learn the use of a sleán, should be put to work at once.  The first point that strikes me about it is this: last year we cut 3,800,000 tons of hand won turf, but last year was a very remarkable year.  We would want to have this year just as good&mdash;we pray to God it may be&mdash;because not for a great many years have we been as fortunate in getting so dry a season. If we cut turf or won it last year, it was, in fact, due to the wonderful weather we had, and we had 3,800,000 tons to show for our efforts.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, there are not very many bogs in the country that are not being worked.  I am speaking of bogs that are well drained, with faces ready for cutting, and I am afraid there are very few of them, and that the area of bog ready to cut is very limited indeed.  I suggest that the 3,800,000 tons of turf we got last year came from bogs which had been in <Col N="987" /> use for a long time.  Perhaps we have some other bogs in a usable condition, but they are in remote districts.  So far as I see, we cannot provide 8,000,000 tons of turf off the bogs that were in use last year.  It is a physical impossibility, in my opinion, to get two crops of turf off these bogs this year.  Of course, the Minister may have information of a character that is not available to me, but, so far as I know the country, and I have been over a fair amount of it and know what bogs are like, we cannot provide 8,000,000 tons of turf from existing bogs.  That is because we cannot do what the Taoiseach suggested&mdash;namely, take two crops off the bogs this season.  To begin with, people are fortunate enough on the whole to get one crop of turf off the bog.  The weather has everything to do with it, and the heart of man cannot prevail against a day like yesterday.  Weather has to be taken into account, and I believe it would be very unwise to bank on getting our full requirements from the bogs we have been accustomed to use.</P>
    <P>But there is another consideration. The Taoiseach says that we should put to work every idle man in the rural parts who is able to use a spade or able and willing to use a sleán. Take the situation of the bogs&mdash; some of them are in the centre of fairly thickly populated areas but others are more remote, up in the hills or on the tops of mountains.  So far as I see the situation in the country&mdash;anyhow in the rural parts of Ireland of which the Taoiseach spoke&mdash;I do not see so many people unemployed as would make it possible for us to turn such a number out on the bogs as would rear two crops of turf in one year.  I do not think the men are there; they are not in close proximity to the bogs.  To rear two crops of turf in one year means that you have got to have a number of men ready to go into the bogs now, or as soon as the water disappears, and that will take some time.  As soon as they start work they must continue at the job of cutting, turning, clamping, saving and starting at the next crop immediately that is done.</P>
    <P>The situation in rural Ireland is not <Col N="988" /> such that will enable us to get the numbers of people to do that work throughout the year, and, at the same time, to carry on the ordinary work of attending to all the tillage which we have in hands.  Days like those we have been experiencing have thrown us back for weeks and the net result will be that tillage operations are going to be more difficult than if the weather had not been what it was during the past ten days.  I am convinced that because of physical limitations, the number of people available, the limitation of the area of banks available for cutting and the fact that you have to take the weather into account in the winning of turf, you cannot possibly face up to a possibility of taking two crops of turf off the banks cut on last year.  I do not think that there is the smallest chance of getting 8,000,000 tons of turf through the sort of action which it is Suggested we should take under the ægis of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are being given powers to enter bogs, compulsorily if necessary.  I am not going to suggest that local authorities generally will be so foolish or so stupid as to acquire bogs where they are being worked.  But, mind you, this question of interpretation, of whether or not the bogs are being worked to their full capacity, is a rather difficult one.  There are few counties where the usable bogs are not being worked. They are owned by people who have them attached to their farms, who got them when the purchase of their lands was going through, perhaps bought them outright just as men buy farms outright, but taking the position with regard to bogs generally, they are owned by people who have them drained and who have worked them for a number of years.  It is true that they may have one face from which turf is being cut and turf may not be cut on the other side.  If you proceed to acquire and cut the side that is not in use, you may upset the economy of the holding.  The economy of thousands of our small farms is contingent on the possession of a certain area of bog which regulates whether the holding is economic or not.  In suggesting that we may now acquire bog compulsorily, <Col N="989" /> we may upset the economy of many farms in the rural areas which would not be economic but for the possession of bog.  That might have rather serious consequences.</P>
    <P>You have just decided on action that will give local authorities power to exercise functions which will upset the ordinary economy of holdings.  I suggest that we ought to make ourselves aware of the implications of that.  I am not suggesting that local authorities would use their powers in this fashion, but I do not think it is wise to suggest that they should do so, even in present circumstances.  There is another way.  If there was a suggestion that you were going to utilise bogs this year in the rural areas, or in areas where they are being cut year after year in a different manner from that in which they have been utilised in the past, you may in fact, instead of getting more turf, actually get less turf from the same bank.  You can upset the conditions of the people who have been taking turf off these bogs for their own use and for sale in towns. It may upset the whole working and planning of those bogs.  That is not a good thing to do, but you can do something more.  I have known some of the most bitter quarrels we have had in the country to take place over the possession of bogs and the right to use them. These are considerations present in my mind when I see what local authorities are expected to do and the powers which you are giving them to exercise.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would like to say that I am in favour of local authorities like county councils, in a limited way, taking upon themselves the responsibility of providing from bogs within their domain a quantity of fuel that will be sufficient, say, for their machinery or even for their instituttions. If they can do that, it is all to the good.  In attempting to carry out even a scheme like that there are certain limitations.  You cannot send anybody at all into a bog and be satisfied that he is going to give a good return for his time there.  Quite the contrary.  I am not quite clear how many of our county or assistant engineers are competent to plan and to carry out the kind of work required in <Col N="990" /> bogs.  I am quite satisfied some of them are not competent to do so because while a person may be a very good engineer, there is special engineering skill required in a bog that can only be acquired by spending days and weeks and months in the bogs. In fact, you can make such a mess of a boghole that you are going to have much more water in the hole than turf on the bank.</P>
    <P>This problem of getting sufficient work done and getting it done economically is not going to be solved for the asking.  Nevertheless, I am quite satisfied that in a number of counties anyway you could give power to local authorities to go into bogs which are in accessible places and where they can be acquired in a reasonable manner to be worked for certain limited purposes. But if we are to take the problem as it was represented to us by An Taoiseach, if we are to take it seriously, we have to face up to a situation where we have this year to provide the equivalent of 2,750,000 tons of coal, which is reckoned to be 8,000,000 tons of turf. If we accept the situation that we are not going to get any imported fuel into this country at all, and that we have got to provide it for ourselves, and if the people of Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Galway are going to have fuel to cook the food which we hope they will have next year, I do not think we can meet it by passing on to the county councils the powers which you are passing on under this order and merely leaving things there.</P>
    <P>It is important to consider the magnitude of this problem.  If the Government are really serious about it, they will realise the problem is of unusual magnitude.  We have got either to accent the Government's word on these things, or to be sceptical and doubtful about it, and suggest that although they say such a thing they do not really mean it.  I prefer to take it on the basis which was enunciated by the Taoiseach, that it is a major problem which ought to be tackled in a big, broad way.  What is the magnitude of the problem?  Let us consider it in terms of cash.  Last year 2,750.000 tons of coal were imported at £3 a ton, apparently, according to a question and answer in the Dáil yesterday.  This £3 <Col N="991" /> a ton is under the current price, but at £3 a ton the amount of money involved would be £8,250,000.  The value of the 3,800,000 tons of turf we produced last year, at the present price of coal, would have represented £4,000,000 of coal, which means that if you want 8,000,000 tons of turf this year you have to produce this year an extra £4,000,000 of turf, taking the current price of coal, out of our own resources.</P>
    <P>I want to urge and argue seriously that that is completely beyond the financial ability and outside the responsibilities, from the point of view of finance, which should be put upon county councils.  It is also beyond the competence of their staffs and of county councils themselves as men elected to do a certain work.  If we expect them to do that, we are not going to get it.  I am one of those who believe that we can do things in this country if we go about them in the right way, if we go about them with courage. I have urged on this Minister in another capacity that people may find fault with the Government for going too far in doing the right thing, but that is not half as bad as people finding fault with you for not attempting to do anything, right or wrong.  In my view, the fault that will be found with the Government this time twelve months, if we have a shortage of fuel, is that they did not face up to the problem of providing fuel in the way they should.</P>
    <P>I have tried to argue already&mdash;I may not have made myself clear&mdash;that from the existing bogs which we are working it is a physical impossibility to get the amount of fuel which the Government say they require.  It is physically impossible because of the limited area of bog; because of atmospheric and weather conditions, which are always an incalculable quantity, and because of the limited number of people who are suitable for the work of cutting turf.  I want again to repeat that every man in the country cannot cut the turf.  I am prepared to take Senator Quirke down for a week to any bog he likes in the country and test what we can do, but he knows as well <Col N="992" /> as I do that while some men may he very good with their slean their next door neighbour may not be half so good, or, in fact, he may not be any good at all.  If you are going to get turf produced, just like anything else, you must get efficient people at the work.  I do not know what the people who come from bogs calculate as a good day's work for a man, but in my day, in the lowland bogs, we thought that when a man cut what we called five crates of turf in a day he was a good man.  He was a very good man. He would not smoke an ounce of tobacco or 20 cigarettes in the day and do it.</P>
    <P>I am convinced the Minister ought not to pass this baby on to the local authorities.  I think it is too big for them to carry.  The Minister should not create in the minds of the people of this country the impression that they are going to be all right and that because certain powers have been passed on to local authorities and because parish councils are going to get to work, everything is going to be safe and well, that we are going to have plenty of fuel this winter.  I say now, as I said about tillage some time ago in this House, that we are going to he hungry for turf just as we are going to be hungry in other things because we are not going the right way about it.  I do not think the obligation ought to be put upon local authorities to go to their ratepayers in the counties to raise money for the purpose of paying men to cut turf which is going to be stored up for six or nine months before it can be turned into cash.  I suggest that £4,000,000 extra over and above what the value of our turf was last year is involved in this, and that you are expecting local authorities to find the money to do that.  I think that is not the way to do it.  I think it is beyond their capacity to do it, and it ought not to be expected of them.  I suggest they are not competent to do it and cannot deliver the goods.</P>
    <P>Let us assume that you could get local authorities to go into this matter of providing fuel by direct labour in their respective counties, not only for the use of the people of their own counties, but also for the use of <Col N="993" /> people in densely-populated urban centres, such as the City of Dublin and its vicinity.  Look at the problem of marketing.  Who is going to do the job of marketing the fuel after it has been won?  Here is my point of view: We have been passing many Acts in the Oireachtas to provide a better system of management in connection with local authorities, generally, and we are told repeatedly that the staffs are being overworked and have not the time to look after the details, and that there is not the necessary machinery for a proper supervision of staffs.  It has been pointed out that a lot of the work these staffs are asked to do is beyond their competence, and the Ministry have acquiesced in that view. Now, in my opinion, nothing that local authorities have been asked to do up to the present would be so far removed from a proper conception of what their duties and responsibilities are than this matter of winning and saving turf and also its marketing.</P>
    <P>The staffs of local authorities, such as the surveyors and the assistant surveyors, have their days fairly full in connection with their other duties.  As a matter of fact, if we are to judge by their petrol allowances, as compared with the petrol allowances to other people, these county surveyors and assistant surveyors must be amongst the busiest people in this country. Now, if these engineers, surveyors and assistant surveyors are going to be drawn from their ordinary work in connection with roads and so on, and put on such work as the development of our bogs, I do not know how they stand.  It is possible that quite a number of these engineers would not be familiar with the particular type of work to be done on the bogs, but I am satisfied that the staffs of local authorities will not be able to undertake this task because of its magnitude. The winning of the turf that is required would provide work for thousands and thousands of men, but it is a task that will be beyond the competence of the local authorities unless they are given very material assistance.</P>
    <P>Now, we have become, in this country, much more land-minded than we <Col N="994" /> were in former years.  I am not speaking of the land mines that explode, but, at any rate, we are much more concerned about what we can dig out of our own fields than we were in September, 1939, or even before that.  I think that we are now going to be more turf-minded, if I may use the phrase, and I do not think it is a bad thing that we should become more turf-minded. Some people, I understand, do not like the smell of turf&mdash;although I do not object to the smell of turf&mdash;and I believe that some housewives do not like the ash of turf, but there is an easy way of getting rid of the ash.  Anyhow, I do not think that any people in this country should be above burning turf if no other fuel is available, and I am all in favour of having our people supplied with as much turf as our bogs can produce, and now is the time to set about the task, but I should like the matter to be approached in a proper manner.  We should not go about this in any petty way, but should try to secure sufficient turf for all the people in the country.  Senator Quirke may think that this is one up for him, but actually it is not.  We cannot afford to wait for machines for the winning of the turf, as things are at the moment.  We have the human machines, and I should like to use these human machines for the winning, saving and marketing of the turf.</P>
    <P>What I want to put to the Minister is this: we have got to face up to the situation that the Coal-Cattle Pact may not be just so important in the future as it has been up to the present, and that we shall have to provide more fuel from our own resources than we have been accustomed to produce in the past.  It is possible that, as a result both of what is happening here at home and in other countries, you may have to consider altering the policy that has been pursued in the past here with regard to the exchange of our cattle for coal supplies&mdash;and a very good policy it was.  If, however, such a disease as the foot-and-mouth disease should become endemic here, we may have to depart from the policy of exchanging certain commodities of ours for imported commodities such as coal, and my view is that we must face up <Col N="995" /> to that possibility now.  We have countless thousands of acres of bogs, and we have very many unemployed people in the cities.  Many of these unemployed people came originally from bog areas into the cities in their search for work, and I believe they would be very glad to go back and work on the bogs if the work was to be had there.  I think the Government should set themselves the task of bringing these people back from the cities and putting them to work on the bogs.  In my opinion, the way to do that is for the Government to set themselves the task of going into the bogs.  Some of the larger bogs have been drained in part, but there are others which have not been drained and which could be made available for use in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not think that anything we can do would make it possible for us to supply our entire fuel requirements this year, but we can do something at least, particularly with regard to the supply of turf, and I should like to see our Government setting about the matter in the right way.  It must be remembered, in connection with this matter, that these bogs very often stretch across great areas of the country.  The authority of the parish council ends at the border of the parish, and even in the case of a county council, the authority of that county council will stop at its border; but there are bogs that stretch across many counties, and so I urge that now is the time for the Government to get into these bogs. There is no use in waiting for machines to be brought into the country.  Failing the importation of machines, we have a sufficient number of human machines, as I have said, who would be quite willing to do the work.  There are so many people unemployed that it should be quite possible tor the Government to put them to work on these bogs.  The Minister should not expect the local authorities to do impossible things.  It is necessary to provide fuel for all the people of the country, but let the responsibility for providing that fuel rest on the people who have some authority to organise the work.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins, for instance, the <Col N="996" /> other day, threw out a suggestion&mdash; obviously not very well thought out, but with a certain amount of originality behind it&mdash;to the effect that county directors should be given authority to go in and do such work, and the Senator also urged that there should be some authority or body to deal with the work of marketing.  That is the sort of problem that has to be faced, and I believe that now is the time to face up to it.  The Ministry deplore the fact that there are so many people in the city unemployed.  A number of these unemployed people in the cities are people who came from bog areas in the country&mdash;people who could handle a sleán&mdash;and I think that these people. if they were satisfied that they could get a full day's work at a full day's pay, would be glad to go back and work on the bogs.</P>
    <P>I think that, apart from the fact that you want to do this thing in a really effective way, from the point of view of the provision of fuel for our people, you should look at it also from the point of view of the number of people who could be put into employment.  In that regard, also, you must not look at this matter in a petty way, and the Government should bear in mind what was done in connection with the workers on the Shannon Scheme.  You cannot expect men to travel ten and 20 miles to the bog every day.  If they were to do that, they would be worth nothing when they came to work on the bogs.  You will have to deal with the matter in the same way as your predecessors did in connection with the Shannon Scheme, and that is to bring these men into a camp at the bog site, be prepared to feed them, and so on, while the work lasted.  If you do not arrange for some such scheme as that, the cost of the production of the turf would be twice as much as coal is at the moment, and that is a thing that will have to be avoided.</P>
    <P>In this connection, it would be well worth while to examine the possibilities of putting men who are serving in the Army on this job.  There are many men in the Army who could cut turf. I know of some of them, from my own native parish, who could do it; and <Col N="997" /> there are also some officers in the Army, I am sure, who could do better work, from the engineering point of view, in the laying out of bogs, than some other engineers could do.  You have had the Army doing some rather distasteful work for some weeks past. It does not make any of us happy to see them employed at that work but it has to be faced.</P>
    <P>I think there is a very good case for considering that, in a time of emergency, there is a big problem here to be tackled.  You have got to convince the people and to assure them, because their state of mind at present is that they want assurance.  You want to assure the people that you see that the task is a big one, that it, is going to be tackled with vigour and imagination, that you are not going to stop at small fences and that you are not going to be afraid to take risks.  Then when you get that sort of quiet confidence restored to the minds of the people you will get the backing and support from them you want.  I think that is the atmosphere you want to create in regard to this question.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be misunderstood by anybody in what I say on this motion. Far be it from me to have any purpose whatever other than to make my contribution towards getting the 8,000,000 tons of turf which the Taoiseach said we needed.  I have good reason for thinking that that cannot be done by the methods which the Ministry have been pursuing up to the present.  I have made suggestions as to how the efforts of the people locally can be supplemented by the policy of the Government.  I think there should be a proper turf policy enunciated, and it is up to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to enunciate it.  Then if he fails here and there, we shall know the reasons for his failing.  The bog banks will slip at times, no doubt, no matter how valiant your efforts may be to prevent their slipping.  Those who know much about bogs will know how easy it is for a bank to slip at times, but that should not prevent you from going ahead with the work or from going on to the next farm and opening another bank.  It is better that a bank should slip here and there than that you should cease from going on with the work at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="998" /> I move the annulment of the order in the hope that the Minister will amend it and in doing so enunciate a policy with regard to bogs that would have the support of all of us.  We shall go out and support him if he enunciates such a policy, and if there are failures we shall stand behind him because we feel that risks have to be taken.  I think it would be much better to take these risks than to sit down and believe that we are going to get turf produced by the plan which it, is hoped to operate under the order as it now stands.</P>

      <P>Needless to say, I intend to oppose the motion, and I shall be very much surprised if Senator Baxter will get any reasonable support in this House for it.  I think it must be quite obvious to most people here what the idea behind the motion is. Senator Baxter says he does not want anybody to misrepresent him, or to misunderstand his motives, but the only reason for the motion, so far as I can see, is that the Senator has an incurable itch for publicity.  He does not care what motion he puts forward or what speech he makes; so long as he can get some publicity anything is justified.  We have had a very lengthy speech from Senator Baxter.  Anybody would think when he set out to criticise the present system whereby it is hoped to provide fuel for the people of the country, he would at least have put up some alternative.  The Senator hardly expects us to take him seriously when he suggests that the Army should be employed to do the job.  Surely the Senator-knows that that is not a job for the Army.  I do not believe the Senator was serious in the suggestion, but that was the only suggestion he put up.  Are we to take it that he means something else when he says that the county councils are not the right people to do this job; that the people who should do this job are the people who are in a position to get the necessary finances?  Perhaps he would suggest something even more ridiculous, that his idea would be that Ministers and civil servants should go down the country and cut turf?  It would <Col N="999" /> not be a bit beyond Senator Baxter even to put up that sort of suggestion.</P>
      <P>If he had suggested that, in certain cases, the Construction Corps might be used, there might be some sense in that suggestion, but seriously to suggest that the Army should be diverted to that type of work in a time of crisis is, in my view, altogether unworthy of a member of this House.  If the people of the country were to take Senator Baxter's speech seriously, the only thing they could say is: &ldquo;That is good news, facing an emergency!&rdquo;  From start to finish, his whole speech tried to create the impression that there was no hope whatever of getting fuel for the people of this country, and that the sooner they made up their minds to perish from cold, the better. If anybody took any other meaning from Senator Baxter's speech, I should like to hear it.  I listened to it very carefully, and I could take no other meaning from it.</P>
      <P>According to him, the county councils could not do the job, it was entirely beyond their capacity to undertake this work and carry it out successfully; people could not be applied to this work overnight, the ordinary man could not cut turf.  We had 101 other suggestions of that kind &mdash;all defeatist statements, all calculated to create the impression that the best we can do is to produce a few tons of turf and hope to get in a few tons of coal, and that the majority of the people would have no fire whatever in the coming winter.  To my mind, that is the worst possible type of speech that could be made at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If only enough people keep on making enough speeches of that type&mdash; though they will have to hear somebody else besides Senator Baxter, because they have been listening to speeches of that type from him for long enough&mdash;then we shall have no fuel, because if you keep telling the people long enough that it is an expert's job to cut turf you will get them to believe that after a while.  The people do not, however, at present believe that sort of stuff.  Everybody knows that you can take a man, even out of the city, and <Col N="1000" /> that he can do this work, provided there is somebody there to show him how.</P>

      <P>There are people on the Turf Board who know very nearly as much as Senator Baxter, believe it or not.  There are several people on the Turf Board who know more than Senator Baxter and any information that is to be got about turf inside this country, or outside it, is on the files in the Turf Board.  Despite what Senator Baxter may have said in his speech, or what he may have said when he took the other line a couple of months ago, when he talked of the Clonsast scheme and all the money that was thrown into it, it was a good job that a certain number of roads were made into the bogs, even though Senator Baxter did not agree with it at the time.  The Senator had better make up his mind that the Government is going to supply the people with turf.  Senator Baxter, by way of excuse for his change of attitude&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>No change of attitude at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>No change of attitude! That from the Senator who said that we should dig up our fields when a short time ago he said that the only thing we could dig out of our fields was grass.  He said, also, that it may be necessary to change our economy.  This from the Senator who told us some time ago that our only hope in the world was to rear cattle, that the only salvation we could expect was to exchange coal for cattle and cattle for coal, and so on.  Where would we be now if we all followed that policy?  The Senator then went on to tell us that even if we had efficient people to manage the scheme, even if we had, for instance, Senator Baxter running the whole thing, there are very few bogs drained and ready, which are not in use.  Let us examine that statement.  Surely the Senator knows that that is not a fact. Surely he knows that there are several bogs drained and being worked for <Col N="1001" /> machine-won turf at the present time which can be utilised.  The outside rings of those bogs can be utilised for the production of hand-won turf.</P>
      <P>Surely the Senator realises that anywhere that face banks are being used, and are being used for a number of years, that it is not a question of having a few square feet of bog surrounded by water and a farmer going out in a boat to cut the turf.  That is not the case.  If there are face banks, then, the area immediately surrounding them can, with very little preparation, be made available for winning turf this year.  He said that we got 3,500,000 tons of turf last year, that the Taoiseach made that statement in Limerick, and that in case anybody might think that we could repeat that experiment this year, the Senator said that last year was an extraordinary year, and then he prays to God that this year will be another extraordinary year, and that next year will be yet another extraordinary year.</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that nobody can get figures and say: &ldquo;These are the exact figures, and that is the exact number of tons of hand-won turf last year or the year before.&rdquo;  The fact is that, as near as can be estimated, the amount of turf cut per year over a number of years was 3,500,000 tons. The Senator knows that as well as I do, but he will just use any figures or any argument he can to prove his own case.  I do not think he succeeded.  He says there are not enough unemployed men in the rural areas, meaning that even if we had this perfect machine, and even if we had experts to put in charge of every area, there are not enough unemployed men in the area to do the job.  If the Senator says that there are not enough unemployed men within the immediate vicinity of every bog, I would be inclined to agree with him, but not if he suggests that there are not enough in the provincial towns; and the people in the provincial towns have common sense to know that the best policy they can adopt at the present time is to send their men out to cut more turf.  Thank God a lot of them have taken it up already, and more of them will do it.</P>

      <P>For instance, Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir, Bray, and a hundred other towns, including the City of Galway.  I could keep on naming them for half an hour, and in to-morrow's paper there would be a lot more of them, and I hope, by a fortnight, every town in the country will have refused insistently to take the advice of Senator Baxter and will have taken it into their heads to go out and cut the turf.  That is the situation in the country, and any man who comes up here and tells us that the county councils cannot handle the job is just trying to create a situation which will be disastrous for this country.</P>
      <P>We have been discussing this and other turf measures for the last week or two, and the whole foundation of all the organisation set up for some time past is that we are facing an emergency. If we are to face an emergency, even a lesser emergency than invasion, we must be prepared for a position where every county must stand on its own feet, and every parish, if necessary, stand on its own feet; and I say that if the parish councils fall down on the job in this emergency, it is a case of God save Ireland.  Talking about what cannot be done, if the people will only make up their minds, there is no knowing what is possible. People have got to make up their minds once and for all, that the supplies of coal likely to come into this country in the next twelve months will be insignificant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they would only make up their minds to that, then I believe they will do the rest, and that it would be very hard to stop them.  Senator Baxter says that we cannot take off two crops this year&mdash;that it would be absolutely impossible.  If the Senator knows anything about conditions in the rural areas at all, or the way people go out to cut turf, surely he knows that in practically every area&mdash;the Senator, I am sure, has some farmer with a turf bank in his mind&mdash;the farmer who has a turf bank utilises it for his own use. He goes out and cuts what he wants for himself, and if he can get a few extra fine days he cuts some more to keep for himself, but there is no such thing as  at full capacity.  In <Col N="1003" /> that way more turf banks are available, and turf banks will be made available in every area through the measures now being taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter may come back on me and say that, they could not be made ready now.  The fact of the matter is that any amount of them can be made ready.  There are any amount which cannot be made ready, but these ones can be made ready next year.  The Senator proceeds to worry about private ownership and he says that the county council engineers are not, in his opinion, competent people to go in and interfere in that way with private ownership&mdash;that they are not competent nor trained to handle that kind of job.  At the same time he tells us that he has the greatest possible respect for county council officials.  In other words, he wants to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.  If county surveyors who are qualified engineers or deputy county surveyors, who also have to be qualified engineers, are not fit to handle a turf bank, who is? There may be, possibly, one man, or half a dozen men, who are not qualified engineers but who have an extensive knowledge of the turf business, but it would be quite impossible for these people to travel the country and to deal with situations arising over an area of the entire State.  He says he is not going to find fault with the turf. Well, if I were to go to the trouble of looking up the records I am sure I would find that on a previous occasion, when discussing turf, his suggestions would be found to be less helpful, if you can imagine anything less helpful, than his speech to-day.  He says that every man cannot cut turf.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator would not cut turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I often cut turf, and he will be a very lucky Senator if he does not have to cut it himself this year.  I know some men who would not cut very much of it now.  The Senator tries to create the impression that it is an expert's job.  Surely anybody knows that that is not so, and that if we have to depend on experts we will just bear <Col N="1004" /> out the truth of what Senator Baxter says, that we will not be able to get turf.  We cannot afford to depend on experts, and we must take it for granted that every man can be trained to do that job in a limited space of time.  We will have to make up our minds that every man who is physically fit and competent to do any kind of manual labour, is competent to cut turf, provided that he is willing.  Willingness is what we want.  We want people to be willing to do the job, and if we get the right outlook on it we will get the job done.</P>
      <P>Senator Baxter made a side-attack on the scheme and said we need not wait for the machines.  He learned something since his last speech in the Seanad and apparently knows now what the facts are.  Even if we could get machines, it would take three or four years&mdash; and five years, in some cases&mdash;to drain a bog, and there is no suggestion of waiting for machines.  It is a question of pushing ahead with the job, getting turf cut, and doing that the day before to-morrow.  He goes on to say that the county councils are not the people to do it, that they should not be asked to do this job, that it should be done by the Government. I suggest, with all respect to Senator Baxter, that it is being done by the Government and that any job which the Government has to do is not done by themselves, with picks and shovels. They decide on a certain Department or a certain section of the service to do the job.  In this case they decided that the best people to handle the job were the county councils.  I cannot see how anybody could put up a reasonable argument against that attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, for instance, some other scheme were suggested, what would happen? Senator Baxter did not suggest another one, but if he had we would have been delighted to hear it, as a good many people have been worrying their brains trying to find a better scheme than that which it is proposed to put into operation.  Supposing that there were some other scheme, surely it would mean that perfectly new men, so to speak, would have to be found. An advertisement would be put in the <Col N="1005" /> papers and, say, 25 men would be obtained and sent to the various counties.  I take it that any average man from here ought to be fairly competent. He would be sent into a county that is not his own, at a time of the year when we should be starting to work immediately.  If that man is sent to County Wexford, it will take him a month before he finds his way around, and it will be three months before he finds the places where turf is available and it will be three years before he gets to the stage of knowing the right people to get in touch with in the various areas.  The county surveyors and the county council officials generally are the people in touch with the areas, they know every mile of road, every piece of bog, every ganger, and all who would be of any use in a scheme of this kind.</P>
    <P>This scheme is the result of very serious thought, and if Senator Baxter had any alternative scheme or a better scheme, he should have intervened and come along to the Turf Board or to the Government to explain it, rather than stand aside sneering, as the best hurler who is always on the ditch.  The only reason, in my opinion, we would not get the necessary amount of turf cut this year would be if the people had in their heads the idea that they would obtain coal.  That is the one big obstacle.  I have been in various areas during the last two weeks, and believe that the people have a notion at the back of their heads that something will happen&mdash;that, as there was plenty of coal always, for some reason or another it will not fade away overnight but, through some miracle, the supply will be maintained.  The fact of the matter is that, even if coal did come in &mdash;and I do not believe it will, and those who know more than I do not believe it will&mdash;the Government has guaranteed a market for the turf.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>At what price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>There need be no uneasiness in anybody's mind that turf will be left on hands.  The proper idea for those who are interested in the success of this scheme, and for those who really have the national interest at heart, is to work amongst the parish <Col N="1006" /> councils and make them approach the coal merchants, so that the coal merchants&mdash;most of whom realise the situation&mdash;may place orders for turf now. The only difficulty is that people seem to think coal will be available; they do not seem to realise that face banks have been thrown open in every area, and that a good living can be made if they start work.  Instead of creating a spirit of defeatism, Senators should try to make the parish councils appreciate the position.  They should ask them to organise their own people to cut turf to meet their own requirements and, when that has been done, to meet the requirements of those in non-turf areas bordering on their own.</P>
      <P>There is no necessity at present to discuss the price of turf, as Senator Baxter has suggested.  That can be arranged in its own good time.  At present the work is to cut turf and to save it.  Then the other matters can be dealt with.  Instead of finding fault with the present scheme, we should be on our knees thanking God that we have the bogs here.  Other countries have been left without coal and have no bogs, so we should thank God that we have them and that we have the men to work them.  If we fail to work them and are left without fuel that will be our own fault, and it serves us damn well right.</P>

      <P>It is always difficult to oppose one's immediate colleagues&mdash; political or otherwise&mdash;here, and it is equally difficult in the councils and in business where we meet other citizens. I am sure Senator Quirke did not mean to be personal but, when speaking sometimes about one another here, I think we exhibit too strong a feeling and that, I am sure, is not good for the country or for the causes we all have at heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am always jealous of big bodies, probably because I am a nominee of them not only this year but for the <Col N="1007" /> past 20 or 30 years and I am delighted with the record of service that some, if not all, of our public bodies can show. But, there is no use in going back on our political history; that is not going to get us any turf.  As against any institution that will be set up by this or any other Government, I would stand for the county councils every time.  I do not know whether it was in the time of this Government or the last Government that there was a drainage scheme inaugurated outside the authority of the county councils which succeeded, in my native county, for example, in getting together a band of incompetents.  How they did it, I have never yet been able to understand. Not only were they incompetent in regard to the interests of those they were supposed to serve, but they offered every insult and assault they could in doing it and, finally, went away with some of the swag themselves.</P>
    <P>I know that local bodies are institutions that are more or less human. My council meets every two weeks and, in the meantime, the chairman and the vice-chairman are always available daily on the telephone to offer any assistance they can to the experts of the council when they require it.  They are constantly kept in touch, through the chairman and vice-chairman, with the ideas of the rest of the members. These are times of destiny and the month of April may be a month of destiny for us if the weather continues to be what it has been like for the past couple of weeks.  Hence, I say, get on with your job to the best of your ability.  The Government and the people of Ireland are in a difficult situation just as an army may for a time be in a difficult situation.</P>
    <P>When an army is in difficulties it appeals to the engineers.  The people should now appeal to the engineers, to the men who, perhaps, for ten or 15 years have been serving their interests, and who know the difficulties and delicacies of their bogs and their roads.  I submit that the engineer is the proper authority to have at the head of affairs if you want to get the turf you are seeking.  I have been <Col N="1008" /> told that you want another 4,000,000 tons of turf.  Is that all?  Is that the whole difficulty?  When you consider that every penny of home assistance is administered through local councils, you will agree, surely, that that is a more delicate job but it is done with efficiency, and without some of the flagrant abuses that might mark our bringing in some new Government Department. Another delicate function which is carried on with efficiency by the local council is the administration of medical charities.  That has been done with ease and facility for a long period of years.</P>
    <P>The situation in my county with regard to the umemployed is one of great difficulty.  We have a small county with a dense population.  We have six important ports for the conveyance of coal, Dundalk, Drogheda, Clogherhead, Gyle's Quay, Annagassan and Greenore, and obviously the fact that coal has been coming in for years will create difficulties for us.  We have a big problem on hand in regard to unemployment in Drogheda.  That town has 1,300 unemployed to-day and I am afraid that the figure is going to rise and that the board of health will have to shoulder the heavy responsibility of financing them and keeping them going.  I hope we will be able to tell them: &ldquo;There is a train going at such-and-such a time to such a bog. Get on it and start work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With regard to the rights of bog owners, I do not believe there is a county council in Ireland that will trample on the rights of any individual, unless I mistake the temperament of the different representatives of the various localities with whom I have come in contact.  They are not so hide-bound politically to-day as they were 10, 15 or 20 years ago.  They are beginning to think, in the words of Griffith, for themselves, and to examine everything conscientiously.  They are not afraid to speak their minds. Thank God, that day has again come, and I venture to think that no county council will set a foot on any bog or part of a property, or in any way injure a home or family which has guarded its rights jealously down through the years.  Of course, there is the other side to be looked at.  A public <Col N="1009" /> body must supply the money.  I am often asked if we are mad when we strike high rates, but the position is that we have to do it to keep things going.  If we do not do it, we are faced with the fact that we may have infringements, and sometimes there may be infringements to get fuel too, but I am sure that a competent body of 20 or 30 fellow-citizens elected to do their job will take good care of the rights of the public, and with the assistance of the parish councils will see that nothing is done that would deprive any man either of his rights or his property.</P>
    <P>I was speaking to two surveyors to-day, and I would like to have this matter of the instructions cleared up. I understand that they were issued only to commissioners and to surveyors. That is the usual practice. The representatives of the public on public bodies are never taken into confidence on these matters; they must hear all about them from somebody else.  However, I am mentioning that only in passing and will let it pass.  I am informed that our first job is to provide fuel for our hospitals and for our engines.  I am a little anxious that it may tend to shove up our rates beyond the figure that I would desire, but, of course, we must be prepared for something like that.  With regard to surplus turf, I hope that it will be seen, if we have a surplus, that we will be allowed something in the neighbourhood of the cost of production, so that no added charge will be placed on the rates in case, in a spell of enthusiasm, we may cut more than we are in a position to consume.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter wanted a new body. He is a little sceptical, perhaps&mdash;and rightly, I thought&mdash;that we have not the turf.  He deplored the want and absence of turf.  Fortunately for all of us, he did not suggest that when we set up this new body the sun will begin to shine and the turf to grow where it never grew before.  I am satisfied that no one will do this job better than the county councils, with the help of the parish councils.  Through the parish councils useful suggestions should come in, and I believe the people will strive to serve their country as their fathers did before <Col N="1010" /> them.  No matter how successful the chairman of any company may be, he cannot always have his finger on the pie.  Neither can I, nor a surveyor, stand on the bog all the time, but surely we can get competent gangers. The success of the head of any institution depends on his judgement to select the right officials.  Thanks be to God, we have not to come up to the Appointments Commission to get these officials. Competence can be judged by those who owe the public nothing, and although I have been 30 years associated with public bodies, I must say that I have not lost half-a-dozen clients.</P>
    <P>I think that county councils can do excellent work for Ireland as far as our resources will allow.  On Sunday evening last, I was travelling through a town of 3,000 inhabitants which had taken steps to ensure, through its parish council, that the hospital got its supply of turf.  I was advised before I left home of bogs which may be developed.  When we get over some of the difficulties of another political institution called the Border&mdash;I am sure the Minister knows these mountains&mdash; we may be able to get a railway that will take the turf from the top of the mountain this time, if we are not dreaming, as perhaps the Minister and myself often dreamt in the past.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to think that we ought to give the county councils every possible encouragement.  Let us realise that they are same men, elected the same as any of us may be elected to any institution.  Some of them have been elected down through the years in face of fierce opposition and they are anxious to give 20/- in the pound value to the public.  All surveyors are are anxious&mdash;and I put my county's staff of surveyors against any&mdash;to do their best, and I am satisfied that when the year is over, with such resources as we have and subject to such obstacles as may confront us, the Government will this time have no regret for going down to the people to ask them to do the work for themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that neither Senator Baxter nor Senator Quirke gave me much help in understanding <Col N="1011" /> this order.  I cannot say that I am as enthusiastic as Senator McGee, but I certainly do not adopt the attitude that while we objected very seriously to taking authority from the county councils a month or so ago we now object just as strenuously to the devolution of authority to them.  There was an inclination for devolution of authority. I do not know that it might not be a step in the right direction and county councils in getting this authority may show very clearly that they are capable of doing such serious work when responsibility for it is reposed in them.</P>
      <P>What I wish mainly to do is to put several queries and I hope the Minister will make the position clear to some of us who are county councillors and who are anxious to be able to help in a practical fashion the county councils in doing this work.  It is nearly time that this work was started.  We will not notice time passing until we are in the middle of April.  The cutting of turf is an important matter in this month and next month.  I am anxious to know is the initiation of the scheme to come from the county councils?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody who knows the country knows that the bogs are scattered here and there, scattered widely in some areas and then there are miles of country where there is no bog at all. Are the engineering staffs of the county councils to prepare the scheme?  Are they to carry out the scheme?  Who is to provide the necessary money for the carrying out of the scheme?  Are the county councils in the first instance to pay all the money in connection with the carrying out of the scheme?  Are they to pay the men employed?  Where the county council gives a licence to another local authority to execute turbary rights over a bog, has it also to pay the money in connection with that another local authority?  Take, for instance, an urban council: the county council can give an urban council a licence to go in and excercise turbary rights over a bog.  Would that urban council have any responsibility in regard to the payment of expenses in connection with the cutting of turf for <Col N="1012" /> that urban district?  In my county there are two urban districts and if the county council takes it into their head to supply turf to the inhabitants of Ennis and Kilrush, and gives a licence to exercise turbary rights over the bog, will that local authority have any responsibility for the payment of the people employed or would the county council have to meet all the expenses?</P>
    <P>I am putting that position to the Minister because I am sure several county councillors here know that several county councils are working on an overdraft at the present time, and may be working on an overdraft for some time to come.  It is, therefore, just as well that we should understand whether, with this devolution of authority and devolution or responsibility there is also a devolution of financial responsibility.  These are all matters, I think, of some importance and I would like the Minister to address himself to them when he comes to speak.  To what extent is it intended that county councils should supply turf?  Is it intended that they should supply turf to the entire urban areas who were depending on coal before?  Is it intended that they should bring a stock of turf?  How are they to assess the amount of turf needed in that particular area?  I do not know whether these instructions have been issued.  Senator McGee hinted that it was a pity that people other than the officers of councils were not taken into confidence and told what exactly the schemes were.  My county council is holding a special meeting on the 21st to consider the matter and I do not know what information they have.  I do not know what information to start to work and that is the reason I am asking that we should get some information to-day.</P>
    <P>So much for the production. Now for the distribution.  How is it going to be marketed?  Are the county council staff going to act as a marketing board or are the urban councils' staffs going to act as marketing boards?  How is the price going to be fixed?  Then there is very great trouble in respect to transport.  There <Col N="1013" /> are some areas that are remote, some towns that are not urbanised at all. Of course, I know the county council can delegate to a parish council the power to exercise turbary rights but how is the turf going to be removed from the bogs in these remote areas? Is there any provision made by which transport would be provided to remove the turf from the bogs in these areas? In some counties railways do not afford much facility.  The railways do not serve certain non-urbanised towns.</P>
    <P>These are a few matters on which I would like the Minister to give some information.  These are some of the questions county councillors will ask and these are the matters which will agitate the minds of county councillors when they meet to consider that matter within the next month.  The fact that the finances of the county councils are working on overdraft will make some of them very chary of embarking on these projects at all.  I ask the Minister, therefore, to give us some indication of what is the position and as to how far county councils will have to bear these responsibilities.  When these matters are cleared up, I am sure county councils will be very willing to undertake the work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hogan's contribution to the debate is about the most practical so far.  I think very few of us will agree with the mover of the motion.  The majority of us agree that the local bodies are the best suited to do this work.  It has been pointed out that the local bodies know more about the local districts and about the local people and are more conversant with the conditions in their areas than any person from the central authority could be.  Surely Senator Baxter must know well that in the past few years one of the greatest complaints we heard all over the country, particularly in the rural areas, was in regard to these inspectors who have been going around.  Farmers will tell you they are bothered and annoyed from inspectors from one Department or another calling on them.  Does Senator Baxter want us to send another bevy of turf inspectors all over the country?  Surely <Col N="1014" /> it is about time people in the local areas began to give up this idea of always crying to the Government.  I had to refer to this matter lately in a debate here, and I think it is no harm to stress it again.  We should get out of this habit of looking to the central authority all the time to do things for us.  If Sinn Féin means anything at all, or ever did mean anything to us Irish people, it meant we should be prepared to take responsibility on ourselves and to do many things for ourselves locally instead of always depending on the people in Dublin to do them for us.</P>
      <P>In regard to this work of cutting turf, I do not agree with Senator Baxter that it is skilled work.  It is work that is best done, of course, by people who have been doing it all their lives.  Many years ago there was a very big coal strike in England.  It was so extensive that it threatened the fuel supply of this country and, I well remember, in a small town in the south of Ireland a number of us got together; the majority of us had never cut a sod of turf in our lives; we went out into a neighbouring bog district and, with the help, of course, of the local men, who, may I add, are about the best engineers to look after the arrangement of bogs, we succeeded in cutting enough turf to supply the people of our own town during the crisis and to carry them on through the winter. That was done, I think, in about a fortnight's work.  That gives me a good idea of what could be done if people all over the country could be got to do the same thing, even men who know nothing whatsoever about the cutting of turf.  It is ordinary manual work and any man who is ordinarily efficient could become an expert turf producer in a comparatively short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter spoke of the amount of turf that the Taoiseach said we should produce, but I think we are inclined to forget that a very considerable amount of that turf is being produced annually.  In normal times we produce probably a quarter of the amount of turf that we are looking for now.  In addition to that, quite a number of the coal merchants all over <Col N="1015" /> the country are now making their individual arrangements to produce this turf for themselves.  Quite apart from the work that would be done by the local councils in the matter of turf production, many coal merchants are endeavouring to have contracts made for the supply of thousands of tons of turf, and they are making their own private arrangements.  Then, with regard to coal, I do not agree with those who say that we will get no coal at all.  I think we will get some coal at least, and that should mean that we will require far less to be produced by the local councils than has been suggested by Senator Baxter.</P>
    <P>On the question of finance, like Senator Hogan I am anxious to find out how the local councils or county councils will finance this scheme.  If, say, the county council is to take over certain bogs, is the county council to delegate its powers to the urban council or to the town commissioners, and, if so, is it the town commissioners or the local council or the county council that will have to find the money?  As has been pointed out, many of these councils are carrying on on an overdraft, and they are strictly limited to the amount of rate they can strike.  If they have to provide additional finances for this undertaking they will have to go outside their powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all provided for? Well, that settles that argument.  Now there are certain areas in this country where turf is peculiarly suitable or available, but the difficulty about turf in the urban areas is that the modern range is not suitable for the burning of turf.  In rural areas, turf is an ideal fuel, but the difficulty there is the question of transport.  I know of many of these rural areas which are very remote from the source of supply, and turf could not be procured under a distance of at least 20 miles.  The result is that the cost of transport of turf to these areas is very expensive. <Col N="1016" /> I think that the best body to undertake that work would be the local co-operative societies, and I believe that if the officials of the county councils got into touch with the officials of the local co-operative society, that would be the best way to have the turf conveyed to these areas&mdash;provided that petrol was available for the lorries of the co-operative societies, because if petrol is not available when the turf is good and ready, the question of transport from these remote areas is going to be very serious.  I trust the Minister will deal with some of these points when he is replying.</P>
      <P>On the question of interfering with private turbary rights, may I point out that I do not think there is any serious danger of that at all?  Private turbary, as a rule, is very carefully safeguarded, and the men who own that turbary are going to be very careful to see that their rights are not interfered with. Surely, there is ample turf in this country to enable us to avoid the necessity to interfere with private enterprise. Thanks to the work of the turf societies in the past few years, our bogs are in a much better position to be availed of now than they would have been if these societies had not been in existence.  Roads to the bogs have been constructed, and these turf societies can be re-organised very quickly, and that will make the work of turf production far more easy than it otherwise would have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great difficulty, with some of us at least, is the question of the mountain bogs.  In many parts of the country the bogs are in very remote areas. Some of them are almost inaccessible, but some of the finest turf is to be found at the very tops of the highest hills.  It is difficult to save turf there, because the turf season is much shorter in a high altitude than it is in the lower levels, because the autumn mists interfere with the saving of the turf, and after mid-August it is almost impossible to save the turf.  The great difficulty in these areas is that there are no roads, and it is almost impossible to get the turf down to the nearest road.  It seems to me that it would not take very long to make roads into <Col N="1017" /> these particular areas, and if that were done I think you would get a better type of turf than the kind of turf I see here in Dublin.  The turf that we see here in Dublin is not to be compared with the turf that we get from the mountain bogs.  From the point of view of calorific values apart from the transport point of view, the mountain turf is a closer and better type of turf altogether, and would give far better value than any of the turf of the kind we see here in Dublin.  The difficulty, as I have said, is the transport of that turf so as to make it available in the cities and towns.  I do not know whether it would be possible for the council to arrange for the transport of that turf, because in many counties no other turf is available, but I think it is a matter that should be carefully considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the best thanks of the House ought to go out to Senator Baxter for bringing about this very informative discussion, and I am perfectly sure that every member of the House, as well as the Minister, has learned much from the discussion.  I am not in entire agreement with Senator Baxter in many of the points he made, but I think it was in very bad taste to say that because he raised a discussion on a matter of very vital importance, he did it specifically for the sake of publicity.</P>
      <P>That is not Senator Baxter.  Anybody who has been sitting here for the last few years and who has been listening to the various discussions on the primary and chief industry, agriculture, could not charge Senator Baxter with looking for publicity.  I believe myself, if there was one man in this country, even long before we came into this House, who had the real interests of agriculture and of the country in general at heart it was he.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With some of the points the Senator made I do not agree.  There has hardly ever been a time perhaps in the whole tragic history of this country when the people were so much up against a condition of things, the outcome and the development of which may have serious catastrophic consequences.  This is no <Col N="1018" /> time for ambiguity, still less is it a time for politics.  It is a time for every citizen to throw his whole weight, initiative and effort behind the country and the Government to meet the exigencies of the situation which confronts us to-day.  Look at the colossal difficulties that are presented to us&mdash; lack of food and fuel, and widespread unemployment.  I had a very important appointment down in my county to-day but when we could not reach this motion last night, even at great inconvenience to myself I deemed it to be my duty as a member of this House to remain over for this sitting of the House to-day to see if, in my own crude way, I could contribute even one thought that might be helpful to the Ministry and to the Government.  I felt it was my duty to do it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the only county council in the country up to the moment which has considered this matter is the council of which I am proud to be a member, the Limerick County Council.  We had a meeting on Saturday and we reviewed our responsibilities to the various units under our control, our various commitments to the public bodies, and our paramount duty to the poor and to the ratepayers.  We had to consider an estimate of expenditure for the financial year 1941-42, an estimate of £359,000.  In that there is set outside £80,000 for road work.  I think we were also one of the first public bodies to accommodate the food-producing people of the county by advancing them money on easy terms.  For that purpose we set aside £15,000.  Excercising our powers both as a county council and as a board of health, we secured a very considerable number of acres and gave them out under the allotments system.  We budgeted £20,000 for home help.  I think our council has also set an example by reason of the fact that for the last two years, 75 per cent. of the fuel that is being used by the county surveyor and by the public institutions in our county was obtained from native sources.  We had a letter from the Local Government Department before us on Saturday asking that we might be the medium for arranging for the cutting, saving, marketing and distribution of turf in <Col N="1019" /> our county.  I quite agree that we are really the only body in the county which could successfully handle this whole question and we are ready and willing to render all assistance, but I believe this is the essence of the matter.</P>
    <P>We asked the county surveyor for his opinion on the proposed scheme.  I agree with Senator Hawkins that there is no man in the county who knows more about the physical features of the county than he.  Along the border of the peat lands, it is worthy of note, we have the largest number of unemployed. The farmers living in the vicinity are small farmers whose livelihood at the best of times is precarious. The number of arable acres on their holdings is very small.  We asked the county surveyor, as I have said, how he would co-operate with the council if a scheme were adopted, and the answer he gave to us was: &ldquo;Give me the money and on one bog, on Monday morning, I shall have 300 men at work. Before a fortnight is over, if I have sufficient money, I shall have 1,000 unemployed with sleáns in their hands digging deep into the bog and producing all the essential fuel for this county and regions outside it.&rdquo;  Where are we to get the necessary money?  In our county we are working on an overdraft and if, at any time, notwithstanding the most efficient and economic administration, we are obliged to exceed that overdraft by a couple of thousand pounds, we have a wire down from the Minister for Local Government saying: &ldquo;We note that you have exceeded your overdraft, you must make provision for same.&rdquo;  Where are we to get the money?</P>
    <P>Although I may not have been a pioneer in the matter, to show that at least my mind was running along lines somewhat similar to those which were being considered by the Department, I might mention that when the Estimate of £2,000 000 for Clonsast bog was being considered here a couple of months ago, I suggested that we should set aside a sum, say, of £1,000,000, for the development of local bogs here and there throughout the country&mdash;making boreens into them, <Col N="1020" /> improving existing bogs, removing flood waters, etc.  Anybody who has any practical knowledge will realise that the bottom sods of turf in the bank are really the most economic and have a quality approaching nearest to that of coal.  When I asked that money should be set aside, the Minister said that if I had patience probably something would be forthcoming, and I suppose this was the scheme he had in mind.</P>
    <P>Our county council has been complimented for efficient work, not by one but by a number of Ministers.  Three or four years ago we borrowed £350,000 to build homes for the poor.  We built 1,100 and 500 houses, 1,600 in all, and a scheme is under way at the moment to house the balance of those who live in terrible hovels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a bit, but there is a limit to the capacity of the rural ratepayer to bear any more expenditure in money, and that is why I come in here.  If we have to budget for £360,000 to meet normal commitments, if in pursuance of the production of fuel and food, we have to use the compulsory powers to secure land and advance money, as we have done, then I say you might just go too far, and impose too great a burden on rural ratepayers.  And mind you&mdash;I pointed this out 12 months ago&mdash;we were compelled to offer a threat of dismissal to several of our rate collectors, and there is a limit to the capacity, and also to the patience, of the people. Give us the money and it will be administered with the same care and the same efficiency, and with a sense of patriotic responsibility to our nation, and to the various elements for which we have to find these services.  Give us the money, and in Limerick County Council, where you have 36 members elected from all parts of the county, who know the turbary and every part of it, and we are prepared to co-operate, as is the county surveyor, and do the work immediately, because in five weeks hence it is beating the air to be talking, as An Taoiseach talked, <Col N="1021" /> about producing 8,000,000 tons of turf to meet the necessities of this country for a year hence.</P>
      <P>There is one aspect of the question that I should like the Minister to clarify.  Senator Colbert will bear out what I say.  In the western part of the county, as far as the eye can see, there are thousands of acres of peat land, virgin peat.  Now, here is the point, and it is a very serious one.  You tell the county council to exercise its compulsory powers.  Mind you, we had two compulsory powers, and it was a slow, irritating and expensive piece of legislation before we could ultimately secure the land for the production of food.  Let the Order Paper represent a swathe of peat land, and on the borders you will find a number of local farmers having what are called banks in which penetration might be 100 yards.  We are asked to come in by the powers given to us, and to take over the undeveloped parts of that. Here is the trouble.  The farmers are not the owners of that.  I am told, and I had some experience because of litigation between local farmers from time to time, that many acres are held by Merrion Street, where the Land Commission has retained vested rights and ownership of these swathes.  Many of these small farmers, some of them with four and five, or ten, or perhaps 15 acres, of which one or two, possibly, is arable, eke out an existence from hand to mouth, and the turbary is common to them all.  The result is that the little store calves or cattle that they rear during the summer months exist on turbary common to all.  You will find cattle all over it, irrespective of those who own the turf banks.  If we excercise the compulsory powers in these cases there will be hell for leather.</P>
      <P>These are little points that I would like the Minister to clarify, and I will have them transmitted to my own council, which is ready and willing to co-operate in dealing with a position which is colossal, and of supreme national importance.</P>

    <P>But surely there must be a much more comprehensive scheme, with much more detail, in the mind of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, than appears in this particular order.

Paragraph 12 of the order sets out that the county council shall raise and defray the expenses of the scheme by means of the poor-rate as a county-at-large charge.  They are <Col N="1025" /> to raise it, I presume, largely by borrowing.

      <P>I am glad to hear <Col N="1026" /> that.  Then, there is the question of the transport of turf.  I take it that Galway City, to mention one place, will need an immensity of turf, but the bringing of it into Galway will not be a great problem.  But, who is going to bring it into Dublin?  Suppose we get no coal imported into Dublin this year. There are people who have a certain amount of coal which, with great economy, might do them to the winter, but the great bulk of the population of this city, if they had the money&mdash; and they have not&mdash;could not store enough coal to do them for the winter. That is a problem of transport and storage, about which, I presume, also the Minister could give us some information. For my part, speaking as a citizen of Dublin, and a person with an interest in all ordinary folk in Dublin, I do not mind whether it is the county councils or the Army, or the Turf Board, or what it is that cuts the turf, I am anxious to know if we could get any kind of reasonable assurance that there is a scheme for cutting it, and secondly, that when it has been cut, we will get it into the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that matter there will be a very big problem of storage in Dublin.  Turf occupies more than twice the space of coal.  In artisans' dwellings, in small houses, and in tenements, turf has to be bought in small quantities.  The question of storage seems to me to be a very serious one, and I am raising it for the purpose of seeking information about any plans that have been made to meet it.  I know a town in Munster where, for the last 20 years, no turf has been cut except at a distance of about 25 miles away.  It comes into that town only when the farmers have nothing else to do, and think they will cart a few loads in.  Senator Quirke knows that town.  There are five or six thousand people in it, and at the moment they have practically no coal, and if all their needs are going to be supplied from turf, the problem of transport will also arise.  Getting turf to towns in Munster like that is going to be difficult.  I agree with Senator Mac Fhionnlaich that with the co-operation of everyone the situation may be saved, but, it cannot be saved by an airy waving of the hand, and by <Col N="1027" /> saying: &ldquo;There is plenty of money&mdash; spend it,&rdquo; because that will not solve our problem of cutting, marketing and storage.</P>
    <P>There is the further problem of supplying poor people in Dublin who cannot afford to pay anything at all for it, and who will be in that position in increasing numbers from this on.  That, sir, is principally what I would like to ask about it: whether the financing of this scheme is to be left entirely to the local authorities; what arrangements are made about transport whereby the City of Dublin, for instance, is going to be supplied with the enormous amount of turf it would need if we are in the situation that no coal at all will be available, and what arrangements are going to be made for marketing, I think it would be very useful to this debate if we could hear something from the Minister in extension of what was in the order on these matters, because it is not a controversial subject &mdash;it is a matter entirely of machinery.</P>
    <P>We are all in favour of getting the job done, and those of us who know the City of Dublin feel that the doing of it in Dublin is a matter of great difficulty which cannot be solved as in parts of the country where there are parish councils.  I doubt if parish councils in Dublin would be of any advantage in this direction.  What we would like to hear from the Minister is whether there is any scheme to be put into operation after the turf has been won and saved for its transport, storage and marketing in places far from bogs and with a certain density of population. I do not think anybody minds what he is asked to do in this emergency. People would be prepared to do things they have never done before and to take steps they never thought they would have to take, but they do need some lead, and some intelligent explanation of how the problem is going to be solved.</P>
    <P>There is the difficulty about finance. It has not been disposed of so easily as has been stated here.  It cannot be left to local bodies to carry the indebtedness which may result.  I do not know what county councils or combinations of county councils are going to solve <Col N="1028" /> the problem of supplying turf to the population of Dublin next winter assuming that no coal is available.  On that I would like to hear the Minister. While expressing no view as to whether the order ought to be annulled, while expressing my complete agreement with Senator Baxter that the object is to get the fuel and to see that it is distributed to those who need it and can pay for it, we must recognise also that there will be very many people who cannot pay for it and who will need it, because fuel is an essential of life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw Senator Baxter's motion on the Order Paper I was somewhat horrified at its extravagance but, listening to the arguments and the language he used has to a great extent produced some thought about the difficulties of providing us with fuel.  In regard to this whole question of our fuel supplies and the ability of county councils or urban councils to produce our requirements economically, that is a matter that has yet to be seen.  Senator Baxter seems to have a great deal of doubt about the ability of the council to do this work.  In most parts of the country where there are rather extensive bogs we had a few years ago what are known as turf societies, and they, in their own way, have been producing a large output, but there has not been at all a sufficient demand for it.  I understand there are some of those turf societies that could multiply their output a thousand per cent. if there was a demand for it, but owing to prejudices among householders and industrialists as to the suitability of the fuel for their purposes when supplies of coal were available they were not at all disposed to take supplies of turf.  Much use could be made of these societies if contact was set up with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt at all that those who know most about them are the officials of the county councils, and I have not the slightest doubt whatever that they will make the fullest possible use of them.  In addition to that, the county councils are a nerve centre of all activities in the county and will work largely through the parish councils or, at least, seek their co-operation. <Col N="1029" /> There is not a parish in which there is not some form of local committee for the purposes of this scheme which is now visualised.  But, whether there might be a certain amount of cause for the suspicion in Senator Baxter's mind as to the ability of county councils to do this work, we will not know until the time has come.  We only know there is an organisation there at the moment; it is the obvious method in which to get a bulk output in a hurry. Whether the councils are capable of doing the work and getting that work properly supervised, and getting turf produced cheaply and economically&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Nor could we hold anyone else responsible for it.  All that responsibility rests upon the person who supervises the work.  That is the kernel of the matter.  It is not a question of the organisation, but of the spirit in which the work is done for the good of the nation.  If you have all the emergency powers and authority in the world, if the man who is put as foreman on the work is not able to get the most out of his men you cannot get the work done, and there is no use in going back and telling the organisation they have made a mess of things.  If any one section of the organisation fails to do its duty the whole organisation must fall to the ground.  That is what we are up against in trying to build up an organisation.  It is no use talking about money.  If you get the output from the supervisors and the workers, if you get conscientious work done, a full day per head, to the best of their ability, it would pay, obviously.  Money is only a secondary consideration in the circumstances.  But are we going to have what we see very often in cases of relief work where it is a case of putting in the time?  Who is responsible? It is the people on whom the responsibility is put&mdash;the foreman or the workers themselves.</P>

      <P>It should be inculcated in the minds of the workers that they are working for themselves, for the people and that it is up to them to give the produce to them at the cheapest possible price and that the surplus would be given to the poor man who has no money to pay for it.  That is the kernel of the whole situation.  It is no use, if there is a mess made of the position, saying that the county council is at fault.  The matter depends on the atmosphere in which the thing is built up.  There is no one as capable of developing that spirit than the daily papers of the country.</P>
      <P>Every day in the week the papers are abusing the Government for some scheme or pointing out that everyone is getting discontented owing to shortage of supplies.  The one thing in life that is of most use to us to-day is the development of a right mind, to encourage everyone to do his duty in the best way he can, to take the jolts and setbacks calmly, as a stumbling block it is his duty to get over.  If we are going to be short of fuel next winter, let us not be short because of want of propaganda in developing the minds of the people and teaching them what their responsibility really is.</P>
      <P>I would like to see a campaign launched by the daily papers or the local papers in this country, in which the editors would all meet voluntarily and say to themselves, &ldquo;What can we do to play our part to get everybody combined in a national scheme of communal output?&rdquo;  They could write up articles of every kind to tell them what to do, to tell them that it is work for the nation and that every extra sod of turf cut is important, and that every man will get the surplus he cuts.  It is in that spirit you will get results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the county councils are capable of doing this work or not.  If they are not, perhaps another solution would be to put the responsibility on, say, the county commissioners who have been appointed in case of emergency.  These people have a good deal of experience of the areas in which they have been elected.  They know the farmers; they know the tillage <Col N="1031" /> lands, and there are regional commissioners co-ordinating them.  That might be an alternative but, whether it is or not, the fact remains that there should be somebody in every county with final or complete authority.  It does not matter what he is.  Let him be a county councillor or a commissioner. But he should have sufficient authority to say, &ldquo;That is final.  We can go in there and go to work, and put so many people working on it.&rdquo; His word must be final and he must be able to use his discretion.  Each man's area would be in competition with the other areas in regard to how much turf each commissioner can produce.  There should be a bonus at the end of the season if the output per man is greater than the output in the next county. He should be paid for getting that result.  Why not?  If he shows enough energy and organising ability, why should he not get a result from it?  I would give him a commission for producing turf at an economic price, and that would be better than for people to be going round the country saying that if you cut a man's salary in half you are doing good national work, because that is positively stupid.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any real difficulty about ways and means of getting into our bogs.  At any rate, in the West of Ireland during the last few years, a tremendous amount of work has been done in connection with bog roads, and so far as I know there is no difficulty, in the West of Ireland at any rate, from that point of view, thanks be to goodness.  With regard to the matter of the development of virgin bogs, I think that some instruction might be given to the people who will be entering on bogs to have due regard to the fact that it is not desirable to use compulsory powers in the case of a bog that has been worked out, or almost worked out, while within 10 or 20 miles distance you might have a virgin bog.  I have not the slightest doubt that while we are all arguing here about the best way to get results, the Minister, with his usual care, has made a complete study of this matter, and I have no doubt that there are probably many points, about which all of us have spoken, with which the <Col N="1032" /> Minister and his advisers are very intimate.</P>
    <P>In any case, we have had a very useful debate here on this question; many helpful suggestions have been put by Senators from all parts of the country, and I have no doubt that the Minister appreciates what has been said, and will find that some of the suggestions that were made will be very helpful. In conclusion, I should like to repeat how important it is for our daily and local and provincial newspapers throughout the country, during the next few weeks, to try to develop the minds of the people along the line of cutting and saving all the turf that can be saved, and to impress on our people that every sod of turf they cut is cut for the nation, and that every extra sod they can cut is for the poor man.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Senator Baxter's motion has brought out some very useful suggestions and helpful ideas on this question of the production of turf.  The debate has been very useful if only from the point of view of getting points, such as those raised by Senators Hogan and Hayes, as well as by other Senators, put forward here, because these are some of the points that are troubling the people in the country, and points on which they should like to have more information. We are in a peculiar position here in this country at the moment.  Our coal supplies have been cut off, but we have other fuel available, and with a little organisation it should be fairly easy to find ways and means of bringing that fuel into the homes of our people. There are certain difficulties, but, with sufficient determination, we should be able to get over these difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I believe that the real difficulty is not in the matter of the cutting of the turf.  That can be got over by organising our unemployed and putting them to work on the bogs.  As Senator Hayes pointed out, the greatest difficulty, in my opinion, is the matter of transport, and that is one of the points that the Minister and those in charge of this scheme should bear in mind.  No matter how many bogs you may have, the question of transport is the real difficulty.  In County Galway, for instance, we have <Col N="1033" /> very many acres of bogs, and the supply necessary for Galway City alone would be about 100,000 tons of turf. That turf has to be taken, mostly, from the Connemara area.  We expect to take some of it by boat, but most of the bogs adjacent to the sea have been cut away in recent years, and the supply of turf will be very limited.</P>
    <P>Some speakers in this debate have said that a town or city worker would be no use on a bog because he knows nothing whatever about the cutting of turf.  For quite a number of years now, however, we have heard a lot here in this House, as well as from public platforms throughout the country, about the drift of workers from the country to the towns.  Therefore, there must be quite a number of country people in the towns, and I believe it would be very easy to take these people back again to the country to work on the cutting of turf.  Accordingly, I do not think there is much in all this talk about the city worker not being able to cut turf.</P>
    <P>Certain powers are to be given to county councils in connection with this matter, and a few weeks ago, here in the House, I suggested that the Government should set up a commissioner and give him power to do this work.  I suppose that has been done more or less through this order, but whether the power is given to the county council or to a commissioner&mdash; and we might debate which would have been the better course to follow &mdash;at any rate the power is now given and it is our duty to give our full support to what is being done.  Some people resent the giving of compulsory powers, but I do not believe it will be necessary for any county council to utilise these powers.  I can give an instance of a bog which is quite adjacent to Galway City.  The bog is only about four miles away from the city, and the owners of that turbary&mdash;20 of them&mdash; have already come along and offered the use of 20 turf banks free of charge. That has been done though a body known as the Fuel Committee.  Now, anybody who knows the country knows how a countryman values his turbary rights, particularly when the turbary is close to a city such as Galway; yet <Col N="1034" /> these men have shown their public spirit by offering that turbary free of charge, and if you are able to take a second or a third crop of turf from the bank you are free to do so.  I think it would be a very good thing to try to stimulate that spirit in all our bog owners, and I really do not think it will be necessary for any of our county councils to use compulsory powers.  I think the people will give the bogs free of charge, or at least at a very reasonable price.</P>
    <P>Some speakers have referred to the almost impossible task that will be imposed on the county councils as a result of this.  One would imagine, to hear these people, that the county councils will have to produce 8,000,000 tons of turf, whereas it is no such thing.  We must remember that without the assistance of the county councils we produced, last year, almost 4,000,000 tons of turf.  Now, the county councils are asked to produce sufficient turf for the carrying on of their machinery, such as stone crushers, and so on, and for the supply of their public institutions, such as hospitals, and so on.  For the Galway County Council machinery alone, something like 6,000 tons of turf are required, and they have been using turf for a number of years, and I should say that every county council in the country would need about 6,000 tons of turf for the use of their machinery and the upkeep of their institutions. There is nothing in the order, however, demanding that they should supply sufficient turf for everybody in the country.  There are the ordinary coal merchants who will be making their own arrangements, and the amount that the county councils will be asked to produce under this scheme will be limited.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister&mdash;and I am sure there is power under the Act&mdash; that when the county councils have produced sufficient turf for their machinery and for the upkeep of their public institutions, their workers should still be kept on to cut turf, and that such turf should be handed over to some charitable organisation, such as the Vincent de Paul Society, or some other such organisation, merely for the cost of production.  In Galway City there were <Col N="1035" /> some 500 families in receipt of free fuel last year, and it is probable that that will be increased this coming winter, and I think that if these unemployed people were put to work at the cutting of turf, and if that turf were handed over to institutions such as the St. Vincent de Paul Society, at cost price, or even free, for distribution among the needy people next winter, it would be work well done.</P>
    <P>Now, it is the duty of the coal merchants and such people, who make their living through the importation of coal, to procure a sufficient supply of turf for their ordinary customers.  I understand that the Minister has already sent a circular to each coal merchant asking to be informed if the merchant is prepared to go in for the sale of turf, and what arrangements he has made to have such turf produced. If, in any town or city, these people, for one reason or another, are not prepared to go in for the production of turf, I think some buying-and-selling organisation should be set up for the handling of the turf under the county council scheme, and to produce the turf, and arrange for its distribution among the general public later on.</P>
    <P>In that connection, the question of storage is a very big question.  In most of the new houses that are being built, as well as in the old houses, you cannot store turf so handily as you could store coal, and therefore these merchants, or the buying-and-selling organisation in the district, will have to have greater storage space than would be necessary in the case of coal. Much of it can be stored in the bog but, if we are going to make an attempt to get a second cutting of turf, we must have an organisation which will ensure that immediately the farmer has his first supply of turf cut, we will be in a position to take that supply off his hands, give him cash for it and make arrangements for storing it, otherwise you will not get a second crop of turf from these people.  In many of our bogs, even those from which turf has been usually cut every year, some money will require to be spent on drainage.  I do not ask that big drainage schemes should be undertaken, <Col N="1036" /> but where the expenditure of say, £150, would make all the difference in the world in the proper utilisation of a number of banks, I think the county council should have power to spend that money and to recoup itself, if necessary, from minor relief schemes or from whatever other source funds may be made available.  Banks should not be left undeveloped, simply because of the necessity for expending £50 or £60 on drainage, and that is the case at present in a number of areas throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Another question that has to be considered is this.  If we are going to take workers from a town out to the country to work on a turf bank, even if it is only four or five miles from a town or city, we must cater for these people in a manner somewhat different from that to which the ordinary country residents are accustomed.  For that reason I would say that power should be conferred on the county councils to erect shelters, or even that a request should be made to the county councils to erect shelters on the bogs for these people who have to cycle out five or six miles to work in the open spaces on the bogs.  On last Sunday, Senator Buckley and I visited with some other people a bog some four or five miles from Galway, to which at present 28 young men cycle out every morning.  It is a nice thing to see these young people prepared to go out to work in the bog, but if in wet weather, such as we have had for the last few days, they have to cycle out and find that there is no shelter available when they get there, it will knock the heart out of them.  They are not going to continue to do that unless some shelter is made available where they can stand in wet weather and have their meals.</P>
    <P>Seeing that they are prepared to make their contribution, they are worthy of some little consideration from those who are running these schemes.  I believe it would take not more than £10 to put up a shelter in these bogs.  It may be argued that that would be too costly, but I say that if you are not prepared to spend £5 or £6 to provide for the comfort of workers on a scheme where the total expenditure <Col N="1037" /> will be £500 or £600, it shows a certain lack of consideration for these workers.  You will certainly get a better return on the bog if the workers are satisfied, and they will appreciate everything that is done to assist them that way.  That £5 or £6, or perhaps, £10, would be money well spent.</P>
    <P>I think that Senator Baxter mentioned that county council engineers were too busy at present.  As far as the engineers in County Galway are concerned, I fail to see what they would be doing at all at present because all the relief schemes have been closed down since the 31st March.  While I am on that matter I should like, with the permission of the Leas-Chathaoirleach, to make a few remarks which may not be strictly in order.  An order was issued that all relief works should be closed down on the 31st March. Some of these schemes were left in a ridiculous state.  Just because it was the 31st March, work ceased although the schemes were far from complete. In some districts there is a red lamp left hanging up, a danger signal to the ordinary users of these roads, and the work is going to be left in that condition until the next relief scheme starts.</P>

I do not wish to add anything more except to say, that we should all do the best we can to ensure the maximum production of turf.  We shall be spending the money amongst our own people and, even if we cannot export it, as Senator Hayes said, and that we have to send our cattle out in order to get coal, it does not matter because we have to get the fuel this time.  Our duty, therefore, is to convince the people who are engaged in fuel production and in the production of food, that they are doing just as great a national service as those who have joined the Army to defend the country.</P>

      <P>I was saying that my previous impression of the Senator's attitude in regard to turf was somewhat rudely shattered when I listened to him to-day, because it seemed to me that he now thought that the one salvation for this country lay in our being able to secure a production of turf on an unparalleled scale this year. I was also a little astonished that the Senator should seem to be under the impression that for the first time the Government had given some consideration to the development of the peat resources of the country.  I know that if you read one or two of the newspapers, one or two of the journals which are in weekly circulation here, you would think that for the past eight or nine years, not to speak of the past 15 or 16 months, the Government had <Col N="1039" /> been doing nothing in regard to these associated problems of food and fuel for our people.  But, while it is quite easy to understand how people, who are not familiar with the procedure of this House and with the programme which the Government has been putting through the Oireachtas over the period I have referred to, might be under that impression, I must confess that I cannot understand how Senator Baxter could be under it for one moment.</P>
      <P>This problem of the fuel supply of this country is not one of only recent concern to the Government.  Over a period of years a policy of development has been pursued in relation to our bogs, the fruits of which I think the country is going to reap during the coming winter.  Senators who are familiar with the various parts of the country have told us this evening the extent of the preliminary works, necessary for the development of the bogs, which have been undertaken.  They have told of roads being laid, bogs drained, and how, in addition to that, there has been the nucleus of an organisation built up, an organisation which has a great deal of experience, and which now has a great deal of knowledge of all the problems that have to be dealt with in producing turf, whether by machinery or by hand, in the summer.  And the Senator has, or ought to have&mdash;I am sure he has&mdash;full knowledge of all the steps that have been taken in that regard.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I say that I have listened with astonishment when I heard his speech here this afternoon. I am quite prepared to accept the Senator's declaration that he meant only to be helpful, but I do not think that in the present circumstances it is going to be beneficial to this country to allow the people to believe, for one moment, that this problem has been neglected over the past eight or nine years, and particularly, has been neglected over the past 15 months.</P>

In fact, it was so highly skilled that he doubted whether the staffs of the county councils, their engineers, and other specialists&mdash;even of the county councils situated in the bog areas&mdash;would be able to tackle this job, whether they knew enough about it to save the turf, whether in fact there could be certainly produced in this country a sufficient army of labour with the necessary skill to enable us to acquire the 4,000,000 tons of turf.  And how did the Senator end?</P>

      <P>I have the Senator's own words.  He was doubtful as to the capacity of engineers; some of them he was certain could not do it. He was satisfied, however, that one could give some county councils power to acquire bogs and to work them for limited purposes, and the reason for this was because the skill and experience at their disposal were equally limited.  And how did the Senator end; upon what note?  That the Government, who he said incidentally, ought to be able to win this turf, that the Government, who had the money and the power of raising the money, and who ought to be able to produce the turf, should immediately proceed to recruit from the towns, from the cities and the towns, a sufficient number of unemployed men, many of whom perhaps might never have seen the country, and may have never been on a bog in their lives, and send them out widespread over the land to do a job which the Senator himself stated could not be done by the skilled staff of the county councils and by men born on the bogs and reared around them.</P>

      <P>If I may interrupt the Minister, I said the men who had gone in from the country, and Senator Hawkins repeated the same statement. <Col N="1041" /> I said the men in the towns who had gone in from the country, and had the skill because they were born in the bogs.</P>

      <P>Let us see how practical that is.  Here we have in the City of Dublin a large number of people who came in from the country and who unfortunately are unemployed.  At least a large number of them are unemployed, perhaps 30,000 of them. And is the Government of this State going to call every one of these men before it, and examine them individually, and cross-examine them as to whether they were born in the country or knew anything about turf, and then have them medically examined to see if they were physically fit to go down the country and start cutting turf which, Senator Baxter knows as well as I do, must be produced before the end of next autumn?  Now, surely, if a suggestion of that sort is made&mdash;I am not going to say it was made to mislead the public&mdash;one thing it will do will be to create the impression in the public mind that this is a sort of job that can be tackled by a huge disciplined organisation operating like an army.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of them may.  But the Senator wants the whole Army, and does the Senator appreciate, as I was saying, the extensive training which the bulk of the Army is undergoing, of the strain that is imposed on the personnel, or of the number of vital points that have to be garrisoned all over the country? Does he appreciate that the personnel which we have at our disposal is barely sufficient to do all the things that have to be done by the Army, of the state of constant alertness which has to be maintained in the Army?  If a few men have been allocated to bury a few cattle here and there, what sort of indication is that that the enormous number of people that would have to be dispersed all over the country in order to win the quantity of turf we require would be available from the Army?  The Senator must be aware of the strength of the Army.  I am not going to mention it specifically here. As far as I am aware of the problem, even if we were able to utilise the services of every man in the Army, that would not be sufficient to do the sort of job that has to be done now.  Yet the Senator, notwithstanding all his professions that he is only anxious to help, wanted to create in the public mind the idea that the Government could either use the unemployed in the cities or the men in the Army to produce turf, and that if the Government had only the sense to do that there would be no fuel problem to face in the coming year.  I am afraid that was why he dragged in both the Army and the unemployed men from the cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator was not without some appreciation of the problem involved, because he told us that we would have <Col N="1043" /> to take these men and put them on the bogs and house them in tents.  If you are going to do that efficiently, the Senator said, you must bring men on to the bogs and house them there in camps.  Has the Senator ever examined the problems that are involved in the setting up of one of these camps on bogs, providing commissariat, housing, heating and sanitation?  Does he realise the amount of work that would have to be undertaken in the establishment of even one small camp to house 50 or 100 men?  If he had given any consideration to this problem he would have realised the enormous difficulty there would be in taking men from the City of Dublin and sending them on to a bog.  We had experience of that last year.  This thing was tried out last year in order that we might see what difficulties were involved in it, and the one thing we did find was that, in relation to the cutting of turf notwithstanding what was said by some Senators, that it was not easy work for city-bred men&mdash;I am not talking now of men brought up in small country towns who have occasionally worked on bogs or at farm work, and who have not quite lost contact with the countryside&mdash;when it comes to putting a cityborn person on a bog it is quite a different matter, if you want to get effective output.  Accordingly, as to proposals in relation to utilising the unemployed in this way we had a preliminary trial last year and the results were very disappointing from the point of view of the number of men who were prepared to go and work on bogs, and also at the beginning and for a number of months, the output we were getting from these men.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the problem which the Senator has put before us.  Perhaps in a more concrete and practical way than the Senator did outline it, let us assume that we produce 3,800,000 tons of turf every year.  We may in fact produce a good deal more, or we may produce something less, because turf is not weighed when cut.  When a farmer is cutting turf for his own house he does not trouble to weigh it, as he knows roughly from looking at it what volume of turf will meet his needs for the year.  Accordingly, when we talk <Col N="1044" /> of this problem in terms of tons we may unconsciously be misleading ourselves, because we do not know the exact quantity of turf cut or produced. We do know reasonably well the quantity of coal imported, and it may be taken that in round figures it amounts to 2,500,000 tons a year.</P>
    <P>It may not be quite as much as that. We know the relation between coal and turf in terms of heating value, and that 5,000,000 tons of good quality turf would be equivalent to 2,500,000 tons of coal.  To revert to the 4,000,000 tons of turf produced here every year, we can assume that it is produced by turf producers numbering from 200,000 to 250,000 persons every year.  It is produced in widely scattered areas by individuals working on their own, without the sort of provision you would have to provide if you were going to regiment men and bring them out in battalions.  It is a handicraft of the first order, and is not capable, except after a great deal of preparation, of being produced according to mass-production methods.</P>
    <P>What is the method we have adopted after a great deal of consideration to get the equivalent of the 2,500,000 tons of coal which we require each year? We have seen that there are anything from 200,000 to 250,000 turf producers already in existence.  We know that around them there are other people who have some familiarity with this work and who, if a sufficient inducement is given to them, can be recruited to supplement and intensify the efforts of the existing turf producers.  We have asked them to double their normal output of turf this year, and we have told them, if they do that, that they are going to be certain of a market for their surplus.  In addition to that, in order to ensure that any labour readily available for the production of turf, in these areas, in the sense that it is suitable labour, would be employed, and employed by the organisation which is best fitted to supervise labour employed for wages on work of this kind&mdash;that is, by the existing staffs of the county councils and urban authorities, we have made the order which the Senator wants to annul.  We have said to the county councils and to the <Col N="1045" /> urban authorities that the responsibility is on them of producing enough fuel to meet, first of all, their own needs, and then the needs of the people in their district.  I should, perhaps, qualify that a little by saying that the responsibility is on the county councils and on the local authorities of producing, first, sufficient fuel for their own needs, and then of making turf banks available for those in their neighbourhood who wish to produce on their own account, of making available the opportunities for producing that turf if these are not already available to them, and we have gone further and said that, to the extent of the deficiency that there may be in this machinery, the urban authorities and the subsidiary bodies of the county councils will have to try to make it good.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind this problem, I do not think that a better way of getting this increased production of turf could be secured.  The Senator has spoken as if it were an impossible task that we were setting the local authorities, the town commissioners, the urban councils, the parish councils and the people themselves in these areas, the people who are going to be the consumers of the fuel.  He has talked here as if that were an impossible task, but it is no more impossible than the task set to the farmers of this country in regard to increased tillage.  The increased area which the farmers are asked to put under tillage this year is 60 per cent. of the amount they were asked to put under it last year.  I am not going to say that that has been a light burden.</P>
    <P>They have had to tackle it under some difficulties, difficulties in regard to equipment, difficulties in regard to manures, difficulties in regard to seeds, and difficulties, perhaps, in relation to credit.  With one possible exception, and I am not admitting it as an exception, there are none of these difficulties in relation to the production of turf.  You do not have to get manure, you do not need seeds, you do not have to get anything except the most rudimentary equipment, and, so far as that equipment is concerned, I am advised that there is not the slightest difficulty about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>But this additional work has been set to the same people. The numbers are the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The additional work may have been set to the same people, but I have heard it argued by associates of the Senator elsewhere, that notwithstanding all the increased tillage which is required this year, there is still not enough work to employ all the people in rural Ireland who could be usefully employed on the soil. Therefore, so far as tillage operations do not provide sufficient opportunities for employment, here are additional opportunities for employment in cutting and providing this turf.</P>
      <P>Though I am not going to minimise the job too much, I lived a long time in the city but I have also spent very many summers in the country in a county where turf is the common household fuel, and where it has to be saved by the farmers, and I have sufficient recollection of the number of free days available for saving it in the summer.  I am perfectly certain, therefore, that it is not an impossible job to ask every turf producer in this country to double his output of turf this year and to supplement that by the activities of the local authorities and the county councils. Provided the people are not disheartened, provided we do not get this problem painted in the gloomy terms of Senator Baxter's speech, provided we do not destroy their morale by calling on the Government to do this, that and the other thing, we shall not have the slightest difficulty about getting the increased production of turf that is necessary in the coming season.</P>
      <P>The next thing we are asked about is the question of finance.  It was assumed, apparently, that no provision had been made in the order to enable the county councils to carry it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not assumed at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It seemed to be assumed in some of the questions in the debate.  It was raised by innuendo. It is quite clear that somebody has to undertake the initial expense, and the county councils, which have borrowing powers, as well as everything else, are empowered to raise and defray any expenses <Col N="1047" /> incurred by them in the execution of this order by means of the poor rate as a county at large charge.  I do not think the initial expenses in this matter are going to be very high.  I do not think the total expenses will be very high either, but the one thing that seems to be overlooked in this matter is that this turf is being cut for sale, and not for free distribution.</P>
      <P>The county councils or the urban authorities may acquire land by compulsion or by agreement, as they are respectively empowered to do under this order, and when, say, the county council makes arrangements to grant to other persons, including urban authorities and subsidiary bodies, licences to exercise the right of turbary over the bogland, they may make that grant subject to the payment to the council of such sums and such conditions as they shall think fit to attach to such licences, so that, obviously, if the council is going to acquire turbary and is going to grant the right of turbary to other bodies, they can make terms of payment and can enforce them, and the same applies equally to boglands which may be taken up by agreement by an urban authority.  It is further provided in this connection that an urban authority may sell or dispose of any turf produced in the exercise of that right of turbary.  If it sells, it will have the opportunity of selling in a ready market at its own door.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The county council will have all the power that any ordinary citizen has in enforcing his rights, and I think that if the council is sufficiently firm in the matter, the difficulty which the Senator anticipates will not arise.  Actually, I do not think it will arise, in any event, because I feel that the people of the country do appreciate what is involved.  I was saying that since the county council or the urban authority have the right to sell, and will have a ready market at their doors, this problem of finance will not arise in the acute manner in which it is being presented to the Seanad here this afternoon.</P>
      <P>That is quite obvious, particularly in view of the rather exceptional terms of Article 12 (4).  I think it is very unusual to find in any order of this sort a provision to the effect that &ldquo;moneys borrowed by an urban authority under this Article shall not be reckoned for the purpose of any limitations imposed by any Act on borrowing by such authority.&rdquo;  I think the Seanad can rest assured that any great difficulty in regard to the financing of the turf cutting campaign by local authorities is not going to arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be said that I have suggested that all this is dependent upon the ability of the producing authorities, whoever they may be, to dispose of the turf, and I may be asked what guarantee I can give them that in fact it will be disposed of.  The first assurance I can give the House and the local authorities in that regard is this, that, notwithstanding what Senator Goulding has said, I think it would be very unwise for any person who can make arrangements to provide himself with an alternative fuel to assume that coal will be available for him in the coming winter.  The conditions under which coal is now being shipped are extremely difficult and we may quite reasonably assume that, in the turf producing areas and in the districts adjacent to those areas, it will be very unlikely that any household coal will be allowed to be sold during the coming winter and those who are engaged in the coal trade or those who have to use coal for any industrial purpose, or for any purpose, would be well advised now&mdash;<Col N="1049" /> and I am giving this as a specific warning&mdash;to enter into arrangements immediately for the fuel which they will require during the coming winter and, in fact, before the end of the coming winter.  I want that statement to be taken seriously.  I want everybody to appreciate the significance of it because when that statement sinks home, I think we shall find that every person of foresight, every person of any prevision, every person whose livelihood depends upon an assured supply of fuel, whether it be for sale or for use in his own industrial undertakings, will now set out to make the necessary arrangements either through his parish council, with individual turf producers or with the urban authorities, for a supply of fuel sufficient to meet his needs during the latter part of this year and during the coming winter.  And, on that assumption, I think that this question of finance, so far as the producing authorities are concerned, is not likely to arise.</P>
    <P>Two other questions have been raised here, one in relation to transport and the other in relation to marketing and distribution.  I am not going to open up on that because arrangements and plans are at the moment being devised but I can say that, so far as transport is concerned, there is no reason at this stage to anticipate that the difficulties will be insuperable.  Difficulties there will be, but we hope we can make arrangements which will at any rate overcome them.  In any event, at this stage, transport is not the important thing.  At this stage the important thing is to get down and get the turf cut.  It does not matter what transport we may have if we have not got the turf to transport and, if we have got the turf cut and saved, the problem of transporting it, notwithstanding everything that has been said, is going to be a comparatively simple one. After all, turf is a fuel that can be used to provide its own transport in certain circumstances and has in fact been used to provide transport for other merchandise over the railroads of this country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of distribution and marketing, that will be <Col N="1050" /> done so far as possible through the existing fuel marketing and distributing agencies.  After all, there is an organisation of private individuals and private interest which has been built up in this country to provide for the widespread distribution of coal.  There is no reason to believe that the people who have been making a living out of the coal trade will not be equally prepared to try to make a living out of the turf trade, particularly when they will not be able to make a living out of the non-available coal.  So far as the question of marketing and transport is concerned, the general structure is here already to the extent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Ceist amháin ort.  Just one question.  In the <Col N="1051" /> past there was a certain section of people engaged in the turf business. They brought turf into Dublin with ponies and horses and carts from the Bog of Allen, from around Prosperous and around County Kildare.  Surely the people who have been engaged in the coal business would not cut these people completely out of the market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, any person who has been handling turf before and handling it as a commercial proposition for sale in Dublin will now have enhanced opportunities to develop that business.  I was saying that we have already in existence a substantial organisation which can be changed over and which, in fact, is at the moment changing over from coal to turf, because they are out looking for turf everywhere it can be got.  To the extent that that organisation fails to meet the situation we have the Turf Development Board which is prepared to supplement it and which, I think, with its own resources will be able to deal adequately with any difficulties when they arise.  I am told, however, that if we are prepared to deal with the transport situation, and if we are prepared to deal with the marketing situation, we have forgotten the matter of storage, but, I do not really appreciate what the difficulty there is. Surely, those who want to know what the position is in relation to storage do not anticipate that the Government is going to go out and increase the fuel storage capacity of every household fourfold?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator says that it is not a question of household storage, but of storage in quantity. After all, however, there are coal-yards, and if the position of these is somewhat circumscribed in regard to floor-area I gather that there is ample space for expansion upwards.  But if the coal-yards, no matter what may be done in that direction, are not able to accommodate the equivalent amount of turf fuel as they formerly stored in the matter of coal, <Col N="1052" /> still the difficulties are not insuperable. After all, it should be more easy to keep a fairly continuous flow of turf into Dublin over the land routes than has been possible in the case of a supply of coal over the sea routes.</P>

But, of course, the Senator should remember that we have stored other perishable products in the open before this, with satisfactory covering and protection from the weather.  After all, there are such things as tarpaulin, or you can even get weather-boarding.</P>

      <P>Yes, you can even thatch it, but, at any rate, what I mean is that not one of these bug-bears, which almost constitute a phobia in Senator Baxter's mind, will stand examination or analysis, and so, for goodness' sake, let us stop trying to discount the effort which is now being made by talking about the difficulties of transport, the difficulties of storage, and the difficulties of distribution.  The real problem that is before us, the fundamental problem at the moment, is to get the turf cut and saved.</P>

      <P>I think the House ought to thank Senator Baxter for having initiated this discussion, especially because it has brought out that very enlightening speech from the Minister. After all, the country will want to know what provision is being made for their fuel supplies in the coming autumn and winter.  We have been told that it is almost certain that no coal will come in, and therefore we will have to depend upon our own resources. The question, accordingly, is to get going about producing for ourselves the fuel we need.  Yesterday, <Col N="1053" /> the Minister put through this House a Bill for the development of an anthracite coal mine, and to-day he has shown us how we in this country&mdash;an adult and a resourceful people&mdash;faced with the problem of supplying our own fuel, can rise to the height of that task and produce the fuel we require.  Why, we would not be worthy to exist if we were not fit to tackle this problem.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, we have a Government which, since it came into office about eight years ago, made plain the way. Every successive year, in spite of the great difficulties and criticism that the Government had to face, it taught us how to use our own resources.  I am not one of the people who seem to like the term &ldquo;self-sufficiency&rdquo;&mdash;I think it is an odious term&mdash;but I do like the term &ldquo;self-reliance,&rdquo; and I think that in this matter of our fuel supplies, even if the need were not so imperative as it is, we ought to have self-reliance, and feel that if we are thrown back upon our own resources we can face up to the situation and produce what will at least keep us alive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question of fuel is of particular interest to women, and, therefore, although I cannot contribute any useful knowledge to this debate, I think that any woman sitting in this House should not be silent on the matter. Last year, when the crisis came upon us, Galway, under the inspiration of Senator Fred Hawkins, set about tackling this problem.  Senator Hawkins got together a committee to deal with this matter, and I think that this House will be glad to know that one of its own members did such a grand day's work for Ireland.  He got the city and municipal authorities interested, and also the bishop; and his lordship, the bishop, spoke to all his priests and asked them to impress on their people the necessity for producing all the turf that could be produced. Galway, with the aid of the Mayor's Fund, was able to assure a market for whatever turf would be produced.  The Mayor's Fund was started in order to provide for the poor people who could not buy fuel, and the problem of storage was solved with the assistance of the little committee that was started by Senator Hawkins, and as a result <Col N="1054" /> many a hearth-fire was kept lighting in Galway throughout the winter. Therefore, I think, Senator Hawkins deserves thanks from all of us.  After all, we are an adult people, and we have been toughened by a long fight, and I think it should be easy for us to face up to this position, and I must say that I think there should go forth from this House a message of hope and confidence that we will be able to face our difficulties and carry on to a successful issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>For some years I have had some experience in meeting a demand for turf banks which the commissioners of my town happened to have in their possession.  We did find a difficulty, for some years, in getting anybody willing to go out in the country and cut the turf.  However, the ice was broken eventually, and people who had never cut turf before &mdash;both young people and elderly people &mdash;went in for the cutting of turf, and the demand for turf banks grew.  I must say that anybody who embarked on that scheme four or five years ago repeated it year after year since, but it took this year, when the crisis arose, to bring an overwhelming number of applications, and if we had 200 turf banks at the present moment we would have 200 applicants for these banks willing and eager to work them.  I must say that I was more than amazed at the spirit of despondency that seemed to fill Senator Baxter, because I believe there is no occasion in the world for it.  I believe that, under certain conditions and if the necessity arose, you would have not only twice the quantity of turf produced, but six times the quantity, and it would be produced even by people who never produced turf before.  We have heard it said that it required skilled labour to cut turf, but any manual worker will learn how to cut turf in half a day, and possibly he will become an expert at it if he is an ordinarily intelligent man.  There will be some who will excel in that work and become artists in the art of turf cutting, but the average workingman can master it quite easily.  There is no mystery about it; all that is required is plenty of energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in regard to the county councils, <Col N="1055" /> I think it has been rather a disadvantage to us that we had no knowledge of the recent circular that was issued to the county councils.  I think there was a special one with regard to this question of turf, but we were labouring under a disadvantage to-day, in discussing this matter, when we were not in possession of that circular. I did happen to get some knowledge of it through the local officials to-day, and I think that the county councils are not being asked to do a great deal.  I think that the officials of the county councils may go, and should go, much farther than merely supplying themselves and their public institutions with turf.  I think that is a very small task, and one that they could easily improve upon.  I hold that they should go further and cooperate with, and help and encourage, those who are cutting turf on every patch of bog.  Now, the Land Commission did a certain amount of drainage and road-making on bogs, but that was not continued and, in some cases, the roads have fallen into a state of disrepair. I suggest that the Land Commission, or preferably the county council officials, would be doing very useful work if they went in for improving these roads.  In most cases the roads are already in existence and an improvement could very easily be made by those who have the machinery at hand, and the people with the machinery at hand are the officials of the county councils.</P>
    <P>I must say that, in making the selection of the local officials, to do this work, the Government were extremely wise.  After all, if you send a new engineer into a district, it will be months before he finds his sea-legs&mdash;or perhaps I should say, his turf-legs&mdash; and he will be wandering around for a long time before he can get the proper men for the job, whereas the man who has been in the district for some years will know exactly where to get his workmen, his gangers, and so on, and also how to get efficiency.</P>
    <P>The councils could go much further than supplying their own wants by helping in the matter of roads and, possibly, in the matter of drainage <Col N="1056" /> and machinery.  If that help is forthcoming I have no doubt that all will be well.  There is not the slightest need for despondency.  I think that eventually this crisis may well prove a blessing in disguise.  I am perfectly certain there are people in the towns now going out to bogs in the country who will go on cutting turf on those bogs in future years, and in that way a new sort of economy in the matter of fuel would be developed in this country.</P>

      <P>Bhí mé ag eisteacht le Bhean Uí Choincheannainn agus ba mhaith liom cúpla focail a rádh i dtaobh an méid a dubhairt sí.  I should like to say a few words arising out of the remarks made by Senator Mrs. Concannon.  Last year at the Technical Education Congress in Galway, we had an opportunity of seeing the activities carried on in the bogs in West Connemara.  We went along from Galway to Clifden and Kylemore and back through Oughterard.  We went practically through the whole turbary area of West Connemara and we noticed that the turf had been ricked all along the main road.  We were informed that the means of transit from there into Galway was by motor lorries.  It seems that the motor lorry will not be available for transporting turf during the next season and that an alternative means of transport will have to be utilised.  I do not know whether the district is too far from Galway to make it possible to utilise horse transport, but it would be my ambition to use such means of transport if possible.  Some people do not realise the importance of horse traffic in this country.  Perhaps some Senators may think that it is because I have some interest in that direction that I am labouring the point but that is not my motive.  I am speaking from a national standpoint.  The horse is bred and fed by the farmer and the oats and hay on which he is fed are grown by the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was mentioned in this House on a former occasion that much of the unemployment which prevails in the country was due to the fact that so much petrol was used.  We also heard recently in this House that possibly the petrol shortage was a blessing <Col N="1057" /> in disguise.  The point occurs to me now: what means of transport is available from West Connemara to Galway or to the nearest market for this turf?  If horses can be employed, that, in my opinion, would be the ideal solution.  But if the journey is too long one would be inclined to think that some other means would have to be availed of.  There are a number of inlets in West Connemara which could be reached by curraghs or boats. Perhaps the turf could be transported by these boats from West Galway to Galway or the nearest railway station.</P>
    <P>It furthermore occurs to me that in this city for the past 40 years I have seen people from West Connemara going for the harvesting season to England and Scotland.  We all remember the sad occurrence at Kirkintilloch and other similar tragedies.  We have seen these people going to England and Scotland in the endeavour to earn a few shillings to tide them over the year.  Would it not be a great thing if these people could now be provided with more remunerative employment in their own homes in the production of turf?  I think that with that object in view an effort should be made to have this turf brought to market by the best possible means. These are some ideas that occurred to me on listening to Senator Mrs. Concannon.</P>

      <P>On the whole I have not very much complaint to make about Senators' contributions to this debate. There were one or two exceptions. Despite anything Senator Quirke in his rather bad-mannered style&mdash;it is the style we are accustomed to from him in this House&mdash;may think about my motives in putting down this motion or despite anything the Minister may think, I had just one object, quite an obvious one.  In putting forward the motion I mentioned certain doubts and difficulties.  Senator Quirke got up and abused me, but he answered none of these points.</P>

      <P>That is the standard of intelligence the Senator displays, but I cannot help that.  I just make this comment.  He opened his speech by <Col N="1058" /> saying that I had an incurable itch for publicity.  I just answer that by saying that that may be his line, and that he gets his name into the papers, with all manners and styles of photographs, much more frequently than I do.  I have no desire for that.</P>

      <P>I do not think it gets one anywhere in the end.  That is not the way to treat a really serious problem like this.  I put forward this motion seriously for the consideration of the Seanad.  I had hoped that I would get some light and enlightenment. I will say that a number of Senators made some very interesting contributions.  I would particularly commend the contributions we had from some Senators from the West. Neither of them is here now.  It was refreshing to hear Senator Hawkins and Senator McEllin and others.  They put their case much better than the Leader of the Government Party in this House, or even than the Minister did.  The comment I have to make about the Minister was that, instead of treating what he, apparently, and the Head of the Government, regard as a very big question, next to the production of food, instead of facing up to it with all its implications for the country in a serious way, he improvises his speech as he goes along.  Clearly he has not any plan, and because he has not any plan he passes it off on to the people.  If there were a plan I would be anxious to hear it revealed fully in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister does his best to put a construction on statements I made in this House in the past, a construction that in justice and fair play, and having regard to his responsibility as a Minister, he ought not to put on any statement.  I made certain comments on a previous Bill.  The comments were made when I knew nothing about this order coming into operation.  How could I know anything?  The comment I made was that there were certain dangers in going in on turf banks belonging to small uneconomic farmers, the farmers with uneconomic holdings down the country&mdash;going in there and encouraging them in a type of production that was going to cut off <Col N="1059" /> part of their holding in a very short time, leaving them much poorer than they were before.  If the Minister wanted to be fair to me and to the House, he would recognise that that was the gist of what I was saying. What there was in that that was contradicted by anything I said to-day I do not know, and I do not understand. I only say that there are all sorts of problems raised by this order. There are difficulties that can be dealt with, difficulties that I raised, and difficulties which still remain unanswered.</P>
    <P>I am not any more confident now than I was before, because the Minister only put up Aunt Sallies as he went along and then knocked them down.  That is what is responsible for things like putting us on an ounce of tea next Saturday.  Will we be on an ounce of turf after a bit?  I am as conscious as anybody else that every citizen has responsibilities, that he may have to make great sacrifices and get very little accommodation for doing so.  I have always been conscious of that, and the Minister knows that I have been conscious of it; and I know what this problem of cutting and marketing turf is.  I see the size of the problem in transportation and marketing, and I see the risks of people in a city like Dublin if they are not provided with fuel.  When I discuss the possibilities of the Army the Minister, in trying to answer me, surely was much more contradictory than ever I could be.  The Minister talked about the enormous number of men who would be required to win the turf.  The Minister clearly has in his mind that there must be a great addition to the numbers of unemployed this year, and that they must be put into the work this year.  It all has to be pressed into a short space of time, and if it is not done in that time it is not going to be done at all.  A lot of money has been spent on schemes of high labour content and in getting turf from the bogs.  That is all inherent in this proposition: and in the circumstances I was anxious to have the Minister put all his cards on the table and let him begin his scheme and finish his scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1060" /> It was quite clear when he told us about storage in Dublin that not alone is there a problem in regard to the physical limitations of storage, but that when you bring in turf from the country you cannot build it up in stacks in a coal yard.  I often went to a turf stack after a wet night, and although it was thatched and well looked after I could see what the turf on the face of the stack was like.  The Minister does not know, but if he did go into one of the coal-yards to-day where turf has been lying for the last four or five days, he would pick over a great quantity before he would get what would start the kettle in the morning.  On the other hand, having got your turf into the city in a large quantity, you have a most inflammable material stacked up in heaps.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>You see that is the Minister's line, and it is that irresponsibility which appears when he cannot face up to the realities of the situation, but is simply frivolous.  He says then that people do not know what they are talking about, and that they are contradicting themselves.  We are prepared to make propositions and suggestions; we are prepared to face difficulties, but what I see in this House with some of the Ministers, and with Senator Quirke, too, is that as soon as you seek an answer to a proposition, and exercise your intelligence to find the results of a certain Act, you are labelled a defeatist and all sorts of things, you are throwing a spanner into the works, and countless other unfair statements are made which, in fact, are not true, and which defeat the arguments and the very schemes which are fathered by the people who make these arguments.  I did not argue at any stage that the county councils were not competent to do this within the limitations&mdash;nor engineers generally.  Nothing of the kind.  I am not going to allow that to go on record as representing my attitude.  I did not say it, and it would not be true if I said it, but there are <Col N="1061" /> engineers in every country who would pretend to be confident about it.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is serious in all he says, that we are not going to get the coal, he had better face up to the fact and not try to improvise arguments as he goes along, or talk about how you could not put 50 men into a bog containing 10,000 acres for a week in a camp without having to make all sorts of provisions, commissariat, sanitation, etc., and that you could not bring in enough food to do them for a week. That sort of argument gets you nowhere. We all know it is not a fact. Whatever difficulties there are in a situation like that can be met.  We like to get a fair answer to a fair question.</P>

I know you have got to spend money in bogs, and I know that you are going to spend it now, but my main quarrel is that this responsibility should not be passed on from the Government to the local authorities, the county councils, and the ratepayers.  If the job is worth doing at all, and it is a big job, it should be taken on by the Government.  If it is a failure it should be the Government's failure.  If it is to be financed it ought to be financed by the Government.</P>

I wonder what is the problem of the British Army in Africa, with Irishmen as generals at the head of it, providing them with food and all the rest of it over such terrible country?  If we cannot do that kind of thing here, we can do nothing, and if schemes are to be turned down by arguments like that we will get nowhere. However, when there is no scheme there have to be excuses.  We have heard a fair share of excuses but they will not fill hungry people's stomachs in these days.  We may not have as much fuel as will keep hungry people warm, and fuel is as important to most of those people as food.  I am just as concerned as anybody in this House or outside it and I wish to make my contribution.  I do not like to be abused, nor do I like to abuse other people or to hear people being abused here for anything said in this House.  I try to make a fair and reasonable case, raising various questions that have yet remained unanswered.  Maybe they will be answered at another time, but I know that, Micawber-like, the Minister and his colleagues are hoping their problems will be solved by something else turning up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That with a view to securing an economic price for fat cattle the Seanad is of opinion that export licences for beef carcases should be granted without delay in all cases where suitable abattoir and other facilities are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I first put this motion down I was not quite sure if I had stumbled <Col N="1063" /> on a mare's nest or not, but, in view of the information which has reached me since yesterday, I am rather inclined to think that, perhaps, the kind of nest on which I have stumbled is a hornet's nest.  I am not quite sure whether a mare is a kind of bird that dirties its own nest but, if so, this situation created by the absence of adequate facilities for the export of beef carcases has something in it of the quality both of a mare's nest and of a hornet's nest&mdash;it is not without sting and it is not without stink, if I may be pardoned the use of the word.  I would like that the House should assist the Minister in every possible way in drawing the sting from this economic situation and removing the stench which has arisen in connection with it. We wish to help the Minister in this useful decontaminating process.</P>
    <P>Although I use a rather strong metaphor, I am not suggesting that there is any moral stench, but only a kind of economic stench arising from the fact that, owing to a peculiar situation, certain persons occupy a monopoly position and have been able to exploit that monopoly position in such a way as to pay the farmers&mdash;the producers of the fat cattle&mdash;a good deal less than a fair price for those cattle, while, at the same time, they have charged the full price, if not more, to the Dublin butchers who ultimately use those fat cattle.  The stench, then, is not a question of any kind of dishonesty but a question of an economic situation which we would like the Minister to clear up.  The best way to clear up that economic situation, which results primarily from the glut of fat cattle in the home market, is to increase in every possible way the facilities for the export of beef carcases to the British market.  In that way, most conveniently to all concerned, the surplus cattle available for slaughter can be disposed of, and people&mdash;no matter who they are&mdash;buying cattle for the Dublin market will have to compete with the export price in the payment they make for those cattle, and that price will be such that the farmer will look forward to receiving it and it will give him no just cause for complaint.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> Consequently the emphasis is on the desirability of extending abatoir facilities wherever possible, so as to take care of the surplus of fat cattle now ready for slaughter and which the home market is unable to absorb.  Let me remind the House briefly of the facts which constitute the background of this economic situation.  As we all know, owing to the foot-and-mouth disease, we can no longer export live stock on the hoof.  Owing to a very satisfactory arrangement made by the Minister with our neighbours, about three months ago&mdash;an arrangement contemplating a higher price for our finished fat cattle, when sold fat in the British market, than any we had yet received in recent years&mdash;it was possible for the Minister to recommend that our farmers should stall-feed a considerable number of our fat cattle this winter.  I join with the Minister in welcoming the fact that, for the first time in our recent economic history, stall-feeding appeared to be an economic and profitable proposition.</P>
    <P>Our farmers, especially in the Minister's own county, Wexford, and in Louth, and, doubtless, in other counties, took the Minister's advice and stall-fed considerably more cattle this winter than was enough to supply the needs of the home market.  Then the outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease came, and our neighbours made it impossible for us, for obvious reasons, to sell any of those fat cattle, or, indeed, any fat cattle on the hoof in their country and, consequently, the only way in which we could dispose of our surplus fat cattle was by selling them in the form of beef carcases.  We heard, much to our satisfaction, that the Minister made an arrangement with our neighbours by which they would take any reasonable quantity of beef carcases at prices corresponding to the live-weight prices which had formerly been arranged.  We thought that in that way the situation with regard to the surplus beef cattle would be taken care of, but for some reason, unknown to me, there seems to have been some delay in some parts of the country in arranging for the establishment of, or allowing the local people to establish <Col N="1065" /> abattoirs in which they might kill cattle for export as beef carcases to our neighbours.  Apparently, it is necessary to receive the permission of the State in order that one should export beef carcases.  I do not know why, unless, perhaps, there is some sanitary reason which makes it desirable in the public interest that beef carcases should not be produced except on premises which reach a certain standard of fitness.</P>
    <P>Anyhow, licences are required and my complaint is that in at least one instance known to me, there has been considerable delay in the provision of that licence, and, in consequence, the farmers all round that district found themselves at the mercy of the &ldquo;big five&rdquo;, the members of the Emergency Purchasing Commission, who came down to buy beef in a glutted market for the Dublin consumers' market. According to my information, these buyers played off one farmer against another and they offered prices on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, with a distinct understanding that if the farmer did not choose to accept those quite inadequate prices, he would be put in the black books of that organisation and might be sorry for himself afterwards. The result of that has been that while farmers are fuming about what they consider a serious grievance they are quite reluctant to give the facts of the case to people like me who might ventilate those cases with greater confidence if I had been able to appeal to definite concrete cases. Owing to the absence of these facilities for exporting beef carcases, the big five were buying cattle, at the rate of about 1,000 a week, for about £5 a head cheaper than the price that the farmer had reasonably looked forward to getting, and which he would have got if he had been free to export the cattle in the form of beef carcases. Yet, the same &ldquo;big five&rdquo; were selling those cattle at completely normal, if not super-normal, prices, to the Dublin butchers, so that there appears to have been in recent weeks a matter of about £5.000 a week of abnormal profits which have disappeared into thin air, so far as the farmers producing fat stock are concerned, or so far as the <Col N="1066" /> butchers buying the cattle from the &ldquo;big five&rdquo; are concerned.</P>
    <P>One of the things that I, and the public, would like to know about is, what has been happening to this £5,000 a week abnormal profits which have been passing through the hands of the &ldquo;big five&rdquo;.  The general impression throughout the country is not, perhaps, a very charitable one with regard to the interpretation of what became of that money.  At all events, people do not believe that it was subscribed to the Red Cross Fund or contributed to the Comforts Fund for the National Army or the Local Security Force, so I would like to know where that money went, and whether sufficient steps have been taken to prevent that form of undesirable profiteering at the expense of the farmer and the consumers from taking place again.  Of course the most efficient check would be to take care of the supply of surplus beef by way of the export of dead beef carcases which is recommended in this motion.</P>
    <P>The farmers who stall-fed fat cattle for the last three months had reason to look forward to a price analogous to the price arranged for our export fat cattle during the coming six months, and here they find themselves disappointed of that price by as much as £5 a head.  That is only one of other examples of the way in which farmers have been penalised for their virtues, and while I do not say that it is the fault of the Government, I do say it is a pity when that situation arises in which any business man, farmer or otherwise, should suffer more for practising sound business enterprise and civic virtue than if he played for safety and followed a different course.  In the events which have happened, farmers would be better off if they did not take the Minister's advice, had not stall-fed large numbers of cattle, but fed only enough fat cattle to satisfy the requirements of the home market and sold all the rest as forward stores three months ago.  In that case, this problem of a glut would not have arisen, and the loss of £5 a beast would not have been incurred but, of course, neither the Minister nor farmers anticipated the <Col N="1067" /> outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease which has caused all the trouble, and now the problem that faces us is partly related to that unfortunate situation.</P>
    <P>The solution of it, as I have attempted to point out, is that, wherever possible, adequate facilities should be provided for the export of surplus beef carcases.  If that is done, then I think we will have no further reason to complain of the prices paid to farmers when competition has been restored between the &ldquo;big five&rdquo; and the British importer.  The farmers tell me that, owing to their difficulty in getting rid of all their cattle now ready for slaughter, the cattle are eating up food which would really be needed for other purposes, and perhaps for human consumption, in the course of the next few months.  But they have to keep their cattle, in cases where they cannot sell them, longer than is profitable for them and they have to keep them alive in some shape or form.  Consequently, it is in the interests of the country at any rate that these cattle should be disposed of by way of export in so far as they are not needed for consumption by our own people.</P>
    <P>There is also the point that if suitable abattoir facilities were set up in Drogheda and elsewhere there seems no reason why the Dublin butchers should not buy their beef wholesale from these local abattoirs in competition with the British importer, and, in that case, it would no longer be necessary for the Emergency Purchasing Committee or any similar body to go around on foot visiting the farms of the sellers of fat cattle.  I may say that these people in Louth and Meath do not at all appreciate visits of Dublin buyers coming from infected areas and infected yards in Dublin, bringing the possibility of foot-and-mouth disease to their own farmsteads which hitherto have been fairly free from that disease. If you adopt the method of buying the carcases wholesale from suitable abattoirs in Drogheda and elsewhere, there seems no reason why Dublin buyers, with the possibility of infected footwear, should pay any visit whatever <Col N="1068" /> to any farmstead in Louth and Meath.</P>
    <P>The simplest solution of the whole problem is that the Minister will, everywhere where suitable facilities exist, allow abattoirs to function as producers of beef carcases for export or for consumption in the home market.  Certainly a competitive price will then have to be paid which will be based on the price already fixed for export purposes.  If the Minister can assure me that something on these lines is being done or is the policy of the Government, I personally will be only too happy to withdraw the motion.  I think, in the meanwhile, it is an excellent thing that we should ventilate all the grievances that have been expressed, even though some of them may be without foundation, because it is better that things should be brought into open debate in a House of this kind rather than remain underground and germinate serious discontent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  It is never a very encouraging task to second Senator Johnston in anything.  I think, no matter how much time one may devote to the subject, he will have hung his hat on every possible peg on which it could be hung.  Nevertheless, I think the motion appeals so much to common sense that it needs very little discussion.  We are asking the Minister to assist in carrying out a very excellent arrangement that was made, possibly at the Minister's own prompting, certainly by his own officials.  It is only fair to state that at all times and in all places it is possible to approach the Minister and his officials and one will always come away encouraged.  But whether due to circumstances of fate or otherwise, there is always some jolt and these jolts seriously affect the credit that farmers build up for themselves in their banks. The situation is very difficult for farmers when they assure the banks, as many of our farmers do, that bills and overdrafts will be reduced say, in January, in February or in March, when there is the fear that their stock may go to loss or waste.  On Monday last a friend of mine who had, I think, 25 first-class cattle, would not be <Col N="1069" /> allowed to let them out.  He will have to leave them there until June or July. These cattle were well worth £30 to £35 a beast.  Some man in the West of Ireland, who would have other cattle to replace these, if they had got away, is deprived of the benefit of that deal and that sale, with consequent loss to everybody concerned.  Some of these people told me last week that they are at the mercy of what almost amounted to gangsters.  I have seen stock leaving a farm at something in the neighbourhood of £2 a cwt.  I do not know what they fetched when they came to Dublin.  I was able to trace them no further than the county.  While I am sure nobody wants to say anything to any man who is earning his livelihood, still, the concern of this House and the concern of the Minister must be for the producers down the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every town and village there were slaughterhouses producing meat under fairly good circumstances in times of peace and, to my mind, the moment any difficulty develops in the livestock trade these slaughterhouses should be placed at the disposal of producers and vendors.  If the slaughterhouse in the humblest village is good enough for the slaughter of cattle and sheep for the benefit of Irish consumers in times of peace surely they ought to be good enough when an emergency such as this arises.  I am perfectly certain that what is good enough for ourselves at home should be good enough for our export trade.  That may be a small point but it is the little points in life that count most.  That is a little point that would have very great effect in encouraging competition and bringing about an excellent arrangement which was devised by Mr. Twomey and Mr. Adams.  It is very much to be deplored that six weeks have elapsed, the six most critical weeks in the year.  On every farm there is a limited supply of food and fodder.  There is a reasonably good market assured if we could get to it. The slaughterhouses may have some small defects but they have been good enough always for the home market. They have been licensed for the home market and should be licensed for the export market now.  Our cattle producers <Col N="1070" /> or our cattle salesmen have human qualities to a very marked degree.  Their policy is each man for himself and the more he can get for himself the better.  But that is not for the good of the country.  I suggest that if the Minister can see his way to have those slaughterhouses in the various towns and villages placed at the disposal of the salesmasters or the vendors of livestock they could take them over at once and I would be very satisfied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the motion because I believe that if it were possible for the Minister to license all the slaughterhouses it would be the means of creating a market for our stock and would create some competition in the sale of our stock, thereby helping to ensure for the producers a remunerative and economic price.  I understand that there is a number of slaughterhouses in Dublin and throughout the country that would be suitable for the purpose of slaughtering our fat cattle and sheep, and I would ask the Minister to consider favourably the suggestions made by Senator Professor Johnston and Senator McGee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, it is most distasteful to me to have to comment adversely on any section of cattle traders.  After all, I am here as their representative, and it is not very pleasant to have to comment on their action, but I must say that the present emergency committee, that was set up by the Minister, does not command the confidence of any section or any organisation in the trade.  They are out for themselves, and I think the Minister has instructed them to the effect that they are to forget that they are members of any organisation&mdash;in other words, to remember that they are there solely as his nominees to carry out the business.  I do not blame the Minister for setting up this committee in this period of emergency.  It was the Minister's job to secure a meat supply for the citizens of Dublin, and we all could say that anything he did to get over that emergency was quite right, but when it has been pointed out <Col N="1071" /> to the Minister that the action of this committee has been a complete racket and nothing but profiteering, I think it is up to the Minister to reconsider the situation and scrap that committee.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the committee.  Personally, they are all decent men, and they are only doing what nine out of ten men in the cattle trade would do if they got the opportunity, and that is feathering their own nests.  As I say, I do not blame them for doing that, but I do blame the Minister for giving these people, or any people, the opportunity to profiteer.  That is the position at the present time.  They have got <i>carte blanche</i> from the Minister to go into a restricted market, where they are the only buyers, and give whatever price they like to the producers and the unfortunate farmers, and they can then sell in a market where they have a definite fixed price of 10½d. a lb.  In other words, buy as cheaply as you can, but there is your price for the commodity when you sell.  The policy, in the first instance, was that whatever profit you made you could hold for yourself.  I do not think Senator Johnston was exaggerating when he mentioned £5 10s. 0d. per head.  I think that in a good many cases the profits were even more than that&mdash;that is, the gross profit per beast.  As I said, however, I do not blame these people for their action, and a lot of us are quite jealous because we have not got the opportunity of profiteering.  That is the fact.  I do blame the Minister, however, for giving the chance to anybody to profiteer at the expense of the producers.</P>

      <P>I am not asking the Minister to scrap this profiteering and racketeering committee, merely to set up another committee that might be worse.  I am quite satisfied that a scheme could be produced that would work to the satisfaction of the Minister and of all concerned, and I hope, with the assistance of my colleagues in the producers' association, to be able to put forward a scheme which would be satisfactory to the Minister, and then, and not till then, will I ask the Minister to change the present committee. As I have said, it is not very pleasing to me to come here as the representative of the cattle trade and have to denounce any section of my colleagues. Senator Johnston made a very good suggestion, of which I thoroughly approve, to the effect that if the Minister would consent to the licensing of these abattoirs throughout the country, the Dublin butchers, or any butchers, should have the option of purchasing the meat at these abattoirs at current prices, without any fixed rate.  I am sure that these butchers would be very pleased to sell at the prices they would get after exporting, less expenses.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister and his experts are in a very difficult position, and I do not want to labour the point or denounce the Minister's action or policy in any way.  I am speaking solely in the interests of the farmers and producers, and I say that even the best price that has been given is no compensation for these farmers and producers who have spent their time trying to make ends meet and are now being offered a price for their produce which is neither remunerative nor economic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the unfortunate outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease which so upset the country, fat cattle slaughtered in the abattoir were making 56/- per cwt. in some cases in the Dublin market. I have not heard of any bigger price than 52/- being offered by the present emengency committee.  As I have said these cattle were making 56/- and the Minister can get confirmation of that statement if he wants to from the Dublin cattle salesmen.  The present <Col N="1073" /> prices are not economic and the Minister should see that, in the interests of producers and in the interests of stall feeders, who have kept their cattle until this time of the year, that a proper price is paid.  Goodness knows they are entitled to some consideration and it is the Minister's job to see that they get it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDoyle" hpid="Dr. Doyle Dr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words about the price of cattle and sheep as one who lives in the middle of a foot-and-mouth disease area.  I believe there are at present about two buyers, one for cattle and one for sheep, in that area and the people have to accept the prices offered by these buyers.  The price for cattle purchased for the Roscrea factory is, I am informed, £4 or £5 per head less than the ordinary market price.  The fact is that the people from the factory go out and pay about £5 per head less than the ordinary market price for a beast.</P>
      <P>There are also sheep in this area. I believe the Minister has appointed somebody to go round the country to purchase these sheep but this man also buys sheep at £1 per head less than the market price.  That is really taking advantage of the farmers in the area simply because of the fact that they are held up by this unfortunate outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.  There is no free market at all.  That is a very serious matter from our point of view and it is one of the matters which the Minister should have seen to. These buyers can go round the country and say to a farmer, &ldquo;I will give you so much.  You must take it because if you do not, the animals will remain on your hands&rdquo;.  I think that is the real problem in this matter although I do not know whether it is really relevant to the motion or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to speak at any great length on this important subject.  We have listened to a very ordinary innocuous speech from Senator Johnston.  Whether there is a nigger in the wood-pile or not, I do not know but I think the implication which runs through a good deal of the remarks which we have just heard, <Col N="1074" /> namely, that the Minister and his Department are in some way to blame, is hardly fair.  I think the implication should rather be that with the information at his disposal, the expert knowledge he has behind him and the excellent Department which he is administering, the Minister is certainly doing his best and that any difficulties which have arisen, and which humanly could have been foreseen, have been foreseen by him&mdash;in other words, that Senators are merely pushing an open door in this matter.  I have not spoken to the Minister on this subject, and I do not know his views, but I imagine that he would be very sympathetic to the question of providing greater facilities for the slaughtering of cattle.  It is purely a question of the exigencies of the situation, of venues and of inspectorships and a horde of other things which have to be taken into consideration by the Minister and with which his critics are not thoroughly conversant.  From what I know of the Minister personally, I think he would be very sympathetic towards this motion.  I do not think anybody could quarrel with it in essence but when we come to carrying it out as thoroughly as it might be carried out, the question arises of venues, inspectorships and of expenses. All these have to be considered seriatim. The Government is best in a position to consider these matters.</P>
      <P>Senator Counihan spoke at length, and I really was amused at his adroitness in exculpating both culprits at the one time.  From the point of view of straddling a difficult situation, I thought his performance was much better than that of Senator McGee.  It reminded me of an old quatrain of Jacobite times with which no doubt Senator Professor Hayes would be familiar:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;God bless the King, the nation's brave defender,</P>
      <P>God bless&mdash;there is no harm in blessing&mdash;the Pretender,</P>
      <P>But who Pretender is and who is King,</P>
      <P>God bless us all, that's quite another thing.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After hearing Senator Counihan, I <Col N="1075" /> could not discern who were the culprits. At one time he exculpated the Minister from blame; at another time he belaboured his colleagues in the cattle industry, while in a further reference to them he beslavered them with a good deal of adulation.  However, that is neither here nor there.</P>
    <P>Having got in my &ldquo;skelp&rdquo; at Senator Counihan, I think he need not worry unduly about the motion.  I take it that the Minister will consider the representations made to him in a most sympathetic manner.  I would appeal to the Minister when he is giving these extra facilities, which I have no doubt will be forthcoming, to consider the claims of a portion of the country which is perhaps the best in Ireland both for stock raising and stall feeding. I refer to the district around Enniscorthy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very large district with which the Minister is fairly familiar and it is well served in the matter of abattoirs.  The Minister will find that there are ample facilities for the slaughter of cattle, and farmers in that locality have for some time past been urging on me the desirability of utilising these facilities locally.  As I say, it is the best cattle-rearing district in Ireland.  There is a lot of stall-feeding being carried on but the prices offered recently for fat cattle are certainly not such as would tempt the farmers in that locality to part with their beasts.  I would ask the Minister if possible to investigate the possibility of developing a dead meat trade in Enniscorthy in order to serve the needs of that large district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnston indulged in some metaphors about stench, etc.  I thought he was going to undertake the Herculean task of cleaning out what to him would be the Augean stable of the Government but perhaps that was too big a job for him.  I would ask the Minister again to look into the question of providing local slaughtering <Col N="1076" /> facilities for the places I have mentioned. Senator Counihan spoke about the uneconomic price paid for stall cattle.  Only about ten minutes previously Senator Johnston adverted to the fact that the price had become economic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The fundamental point in dealing with this problem is that everything we do is done with the object of preventing the spread of foot-and-mouth disease. There is as everybody knows a number of veterinary surgeons attached to the Department of Agriculture. I believe, myself, they are very good men, and I think most Senators will agree with me in that. At any rate, they are the best we can get in this country.  If we take five or six senior men there who are directing operations as far as this outbreak is concerned, who confer together every day and, as it were, advise me on any decisions I might like to take from the economic point of view and who give veterinary opinion on it&mdash;if they said to me that from the disease point of view such a decision in bad or such a decision is good, well, I am inclined naturally to take very serious note of any advice they may give in that way. People in the country who talk about <Col N="1077" /> this foot-and-mouth disease position, and people who write to me making suggestions, some of them in the direction of tightening up the restrictions and some of them in the direction of relaxation, appear to think that they would be able to direct this thing better than the veterinary surgeons. It will be admitted that these five or six men are better equipped to advise on the disease position than any other five or six men that we could get in the country.  They have been asked for their advice on various aspects of the disease from an economic point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I say that when I decide on an economic proposition I would ask for their advice.  I might decide that such-and-such is a good idea from the point of view of the farmer, and then I would ask: &ldquo;Do you see any risk?&rdquo; and if they said there was a risk, then of course I would have to reconsider it from that point of view. I do not say that I have strictly adhered to their decisions.  I will give you one instance.  There is the ban on certain meetings.  The veterinary men have stoutly maintained all the time that they could see no risk whatever by running horse races and dog races and football matches.  I said that, even so, people have such a terror themselves of these meetings that perhaps it is better, on the whole, not to allow them to go on.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not taken the advice of the veterinary people on matters of that kind where there was no risk, but I have not ever taken a risk where they advised me that a thing was dangerous.  There are aspects of schemes that were suggested here that are, I am afraid, likely to be found dangerous when they are examined.  The whole object is to try to avoid contact or to minimise the contact as far as possible between farm <Col N="1078" /> and farm and we must, therefore, try to prevent dealers from going from one farm to another.  We cannot prevent it altogether, but we must beat it down to the very minimum, and that is what is at the root of a good many restrictions that are made, and is at the root, in particular, of the scheme that was inaugurated for the purchase of meat for the City of Dublin.  Now, whatever system might be proposed, I quite admit that a competitive system would be better.  It would give more satisfaction, and if there is a competitive system the very essence of competition is that the farmer must have a choice of three or four buyers.  That means that if a farmer has cattle to sell at least two buyers would go to his place, and there is more risk of infection that way than by sending one buyer only, within the Dublin area, for the time being.  That is the reason why this particular scheme was adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, to go back to the beginning, I quite admit that no Senator here is laying any particular blame on me. Senator Counihan says that perhaps I should have got out of the position, quicker than I did, of that committee doing all the buying.  To go back to the beginning, I think it was in the middle of the week&mdash;I cannot give the date now; it was on a Thursday; we had to stop the Dublin market and all the cattle coming into Dublin.  We saw that we had to have cattle killed for the Dublin consumption on the following Monday, otherwise there would be a shortage of meat.  We were considering that during the previous day, and practically all day we worked to see what scheme could be adopted. There was the obvious sort of thing suggested that we might allow the farmers to have their cattle conveyed to the Dublin salesmen and have them disposed of to the butchers the next day, but on a limited scale.  We feared that if we did this, no matter what order we would make you would have certain farmers who would follow their cattle to the Dublin market to see how they got on, and that there would be a great risk of their bringing the disease back to the farms, and we thought that after the first week you would have dealers going from farm to <Col N="1079" /> farm and saying to the farmers: &ldquo;Well, now, you do not know anything about the Dublin market business, and we will take the responsibility of buying your cattle and we will see them through the salesman and on to the butcher.&rdquo;  In that system there was the old danger of contact taking place.</P>
    <P>I remember that particular scheme being considered very carefully.  We considered other schemes, too, and eventually we said that we must have a scheme where there is one buyer only, and where that buyer is under the strictest possible control&mdash;as strict as we can make it anyhow.  We thought then that if only one buyer went to the farmers' premises and took the cattle, we would fix the price as well as we could do it, and we would send an officer of the Department with that buyer to see that he was disinfected before he went in and when he came out again, and in that way to try as far as possible to prevent a spread of the disease.  Out of that suggestion of dealing with the farmers' end of it, came the idea of organising a committee to take charge.  There was another reason for the committee.  I might possibly have taken over the buying of cattle, as Minister, if it could be done as quickly as it needed to be done, but Senators will realise that it would be extremely difficult for any Minister to have several thousands of pounds put at his disposal inside a few hours, and to have all the machinery, accounting and so on, set up, which would be necessary to carry on a scheme of that kind in the course of a few hours, because we saw it was a matter of hours on that particular Thursday.</P>
    <P>We, therefore, thought that it would be better to get a committee of men connected with the trade, who would come together and do their own financing, and organise the whole of the buying, the transport of these animals to the city, the dealing with them in the abattoir, and the handling of them to the butchers.  We laid down prices for cattle and sheep, and a list of prices to be charged to the victuallers. They were subject to revision after the shortest possible <Col N="1080" /> time for experience.  I quite admit that the officers in my Department are not experts in the analysis of costings to the butchers, or what should be paid to the farmers, and so on, and besides that, there were expenses that would be incurred in this scheme that would be unknown before the scheme commenced. For instance, we asked the committee to send their buyers in a special car from Dublin, and to take our officer with him.  Our officer would bring disinfectant, and he would disinfect the buyer going in, issue the licences, and disinfect the buyer going away.  We asked also to arrange transport for the cattle, and lorries were got to take the cattle direct to the abattoir or to the station, and if the cattle were brought to a station by train, the lorries would take them on in the station and bring them to the abattoir.  That was one expense that was an unknown factor, if you like, because we did not know what would be the extra expense of getting lorries at the present time when petrol is so scarce, and also getting them at short notice in places where they were wanted as the buyer went around.</P>
    <P>The organisation of the abattoir was an unknown quantity.  It is possible to get the abattoir charges during the ordinary working of the eight or seven-hour day, or whatever it is, but we recognised that, for a short time anyway, it would be a 24-hour day, and that there would be serious congestion, and that there would have to be extra assistance to keep the place clear of the meat as it was killed.  We had to do the best we could about the price to be paid for the cattle, and the price to be charged to the victuallers.  The next thing was how were we to choose a committee.  It was suggested that we might choose the chairman of the national executive of the Irish livestock trade, the chairman of the Dublin victuallers, and three men who were largely in this business of dressed beef in the Dublin abattoir, and these were the five chosen.  It has never been suggested by anybody, and it is not, therefore, necessary to refute the accusation, that anybody either in my Department or myself had any personal interest in those men.  At least <Col N="1081" /> one of those men I had never seen, and the others I had only met by way of seeing them on deputations, and the same applies to the members of the Department.  These five men were chosen, and they were asked to do this job, and do it quickly.  They met the officers of the Department to discuss the scheme with me during that same Thursday evening, and on the following morning they were making arrangements to buy the cattle, and they had a supply of meat for Dublin on the following Monday, and there was no interruption in the meat supply in the city.</P>
    <P>There may have been an interruption in certain shops but, generally speaking, there was no interruption in the supply of meat in the city.  These men acted promptly and worked very well and efficiently.</P>
    <P>I felt from the beginning, I must say, that there would be a certain amount of criticism of the individuals who would join this committee, but I did not think that it would be so quick or so very severe.  The two men who were chosen from the two organisations were, I might say, practically rejected with ignominy by their own members, for having helped on this committee. It is extraordinary that a man who has for 14 years, say, enjoyed the confidence of his colleagues as their chairman should have turned out to be such a reprobate, if you like, in the course of a few days, and be thrown out without very many to stand up for him.  At any rate, that was the position, and they carried on.  As somebody said to me after that incident, if you were to choose five archangels from the cattle trade, the remainder of the cattle trade would be dissatisfied; and, he said, &ldquo;You will not find five archangels in the cattle trade&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should say that these two, and the officers of my Department also, thought at that time that this would be a very temporary arrangement.  We were all very anxious&mdash;and I am very anxious still, indeed&mdash;to get as soon as possible as close as we could to the ordinary flow of trade, with as much competition as possible.  I thought that it was <Col N="1082" /> only a matter, perhaps, of a week or two and that the important thing was to get it going.  I thought it would not last very long and that it would all blow over.  When we found, however, that it would not be a matter of a couple of weeks and looked like a matter of a couple of months, if not longer, we thought it was better&mdash;in face of all the criticism&mdash;to make some change.  I wish again to make that clear.  I was not dissatisfied in any way with the working of that committee.</P>
    <P>I think the figures are very much exaggerated, though I may be wrong. Personally, I must say that I have heard from at least eight or ten people who sold cattle to that committee that they were perfectly satisfied with the price and, in their own opinion, if they got their 53/- per hundredweight they thought it a good price at their own farms.  After all, it may have been 56/- a hundredweight for choice cattle previously, and going down from that; but, in that case, the farmer had to send his cattle by rail or lorry to Dublin and had to pay the usual auctioneer's fees and so on at the Dublin cattle market, and had to pay whatever expenses of that kind there may be.  I cannot remember the details now, though I have paid them myself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but it would amount to something and, in making the comparison, it should be kept in mind. Against that, as I have mentioned already, the present committee must pay heavier expenses.  Again, I do not know what the difference is.  These special lorries had to be disinfected before and after each run from the farm to the station and from the station to the abattoir, or from the farm to the abattoir, and they have to pay increased charges.</P>

I know it was exaggerated in putting it at £4 or £5 per beast but, whether it was or not, there was no reason, if this necessity were to continue, to operate in this way over a long period. There was no reason why we should continue on that basis and, therefore, I decided to meet the committee and tell them that I would have to make some change.  The committee then agreed to work on a commission basis. Seeing that they have agreed to work on that commission basis from the beginning of this week, I hope to be able to make public that basis early next week, but the details have not been fixed yet.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  I am giving a history up to the present <Col N="1084" /> and will come to the points afterwards. Then Senators will see what took place right through.  I say that we changed to the commission basis. Whether we may increase that commission or lower it, at the most I suppose it would only make a difference of about 6d. or 1/- per head of cattle. I do not say that it should not be lowered if possible, but it will not make any difference to the owner of a beast, although it would, by lessening it, make a difference to the people concerned. I am not sure to what that will amount, but I do not think it would amount to as much as £50 or £60 per man per week.  That commission is subject to revision after the experience of a week or two, when we have seen how the new arrangement works.</P>
      <P>If there is criticism of its being too high&mdash;and I agree with Senator Counihan and others who say we should not have profiteering&mdash;the only criticism is that five men are getting too much out of it.  It is a very small thing when it is distributed all over the cattle and sheep purchased but it may be a considerable amount to the five men concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, 1 per cent. on £25 is something like a quarter of a pound per head.  They are buying no cattle at less than £25 per head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought from the way Senators were talking that they were buying for much less than that.  But, as I said, that will again be subject to revision when we find out what is the amount.  We can decide whether they are getting too much or too little and whether we should reduce it by, say, 1/- or 1/6 per head.  The charge that they are paying too little to the farmers, and charging the victuallers too much cannot be made any longer. After all, it is no benefit at all to the committee now to pay too little to the farmer and it is no benefit to them to charge too much.  In fact, it would <Col N="1085" /> benefit the committee to pay too much to the farmer because the commission will then be higher.  I do not know whether they will do that or not.  If they do pay too much, I shall probably have to get others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have changed the basis of purchasing and the farmers will not have any grounds for complaint such as they have had.  The basis of their complaint was that the committee were profiteering at their expense, as well as at the expense of the victuallers.  There will be no more about profiteering, either at the victuallers' or the farmers' expense and the only criticism we may hear in future is that the committee are making too much out of it for themselves. Senator Counihan said that nine out of ten would do the same&mdash;incidentally, I would like to get that tenth man.  I suppose they would all like to be paid for their time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave an outline of the history at the outset and I am now coming to the points raised.  I do not want to go back on these accusations that the price paid to the farmers was too low or that the price charged to the victuallers was too high.  I think there is an auditor working on the accounts of the operations of the committee up to last Saturday night.  When he has finished his work, we will find out then, as a matter of interest only, what the profits were.</P>

      <P>It was Senators themselves who were disarming.  It is impossible to make a firm speech after the very kind speeches made by the Senators.  If the profits were very large, it is possible that if Senator Johnston approached the committee they would make a contribution to the Red Cross.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>A good idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The next point concerns the licensing of abattoirs.  Senator Johnston referred to complaints of delay in permitting local abattoirs to start operations.  That particular business was covered by the Fresh Meat Act which was passed about 1930, as Senator Hayes will probably remember. Under the Fresh Meat Act the premises, first of all, must be registered, and in order to be registered, they must fulfil certain conditions with regard to structure and so on.  These provisions are laid down very fully in the Act, and, so far, we are carrying out the provisions of that Act for the registration of these premises.  I think we should continue to do that.  I do not think we should take the risk of allowing meat that might be tainted or unfit for human consumption into the British market at the present time.  It is quite true that the British are very anxious to get meat at present, and I think they will pass meat at the other side now that they would not pass in peace times.  But we took years in this country to get any sort of a good name in Great Britain on account of the eggs we sent them in the last war and we do not want to play the same game now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of applications have come in within the last few weeks and these premises are being examined as quickly as we can get over them. The veterinary surgeon who does practically all of this work himself has been out on the job looking at premises here and there during the last few weeks.  I do not know whether he will pass some of them or not, but when he comes back he will hand in his report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the bacon factories come under this Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily, but some factories are also registered as beef and mutton exporting premises. One of those is the Wexford bacon factory.  It is registered for all three. Waterford is, of course, also registered for all three, and so is the Farmers' Union abattoir in Cork.  Some of the other factories are not so registered. When this veterinary surgeon comes back and hands in his report, if he says a premises is all right, registration is immediately granted.  If he states it is not all right, he generally indicates what is necessary to bring it up to registration standard.  The proprietor is then told what he has to do to secure registration, and he has to get an idea of what it would cost him. If he wishes to go ahead and alter his premises to bring them within the standard required, he can do so, and he will get registration.  It is a matter of economics.  I would not like to advise a proprietor to undergo great expense to bring his premises within the prescribed standards because I think that when the foot-and-mouth disease is over, there will not be much in the fresh meat trade.  Before the disease started the return from it was practically equal with that from the export of cattle alive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand the Minister to state that if this veterinary surgeon recommends that certain requirements be carried out in respect of premises already licensed for <Col N="1088" /> and capable of slaughtering 1,000 sheep, and if the alterations are carried out so as to make the premises suitable for cattle, the proprietor will get a licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There is one limitation I want to mention afterwards.  I have been asked to-day by a certain proprietor of a registered premises whether I thought he would be justified from the economic point of view in spending a certain amount of money to bring his premises up to the required standard.  I found it very hard to advise him.  I said that when this foot-and-mouth disease is over it will pay just as well to export live cattle as to export dressed meat and if there is a very small change in the price of offals, then he would be better off with live cattle.  I told him that I would not like to take the responsibility of advising him to do it.  But, I said, &ldquo;It is a matter entirely for yourself.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the other hand, of course, a very small increase in the price of offals would give a bigger price in the dressed meat trade than in the price of live cattle.  It is also necessary to get an exporter's licence.  Senators might not be quite clear on these two points because sometimes there is confusion between them.  The premises have to be registered as fit for the slaughter of cattle for export and then a person must get an exporter's licence to export from that premises.  In fact, more than one person can get it.  For instance, several persons had exporters' licences from the Dublin abattoir before this outbreak occurred. They have them still, of course, but they are not using them now to any extent.  There is a very small amount of beef going out but not to any great extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Under what law is it necessary to get that licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the same Act&mdash;the Fresh Meat Act.  There is one particular case I may mention, perhaps &mdash;Drogheda.  The registration was granted more than a week ago.  I think it was last Saturday week, as far as I remember, and the exporter's <Col N="1089" /> licence was given to the committee that owned those premises.  The committee themselves have not yet allocated days to certain people who want facilities for slaughter.  That is the cause of the delay.  The delay is not due to the Department.  It is due to the fact that the committee find it difficult to allocate the days amongst the various applicants.  Those are the points that have to be considered.  As a rule we do not refuse an exporter's licence to anybody.  If an exporter has a registered premises to work in and if he says he wants to export beef or mutton or pork, as the case may be, we grant the exporter's licence unless he is one of those people listed in all the Acts, either that he was guilty of a contravention of the Act before, or that he is a bankrupt, or something like that.  Unless there is any such reason for refusing, he gets the licence.  There is one limitation, however.  We mean to grant registration to as many premises as we can cover by our veterinary staff and that is one limiting factor.</P>
      <P>I should say this: I do not mean now the veterinary staff available at the moment, because none is available at the moment on account of the foot-and-mouth outbreak but I mean in normal times, what we can cover when our veterinary staff come back to that sort of work again.  In the meantime, we could get it done by some local veterinary officer perhaps, on some sort of time basis, until we are able to cover it by our own staff.  In other words, we could not possibly have a premises registered in every village and town in the country because it would be impossible to have proper veterinary supervision.  Therefore, there must be some limit to the number.  From that point of view also, we are more inclined to register a large premises than a small one because the large premises can be very much more economically looked after from the veterinary point of view than a small one.  That is a thing we have to keep in mind.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1090" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that.  There was one other point in regard to these premises which was raised by Senator McGee.  Senator McGee very wisely and fairly said that if a premises was good enough for the slaughter of cattle for home consumption it ought to be good enough for the slaughter of cattle for export.  It appears, I must say, to be a very fair statement.  However, there is this to be said about it.  There is at least the consideration of the size of the place.  For instance, take a butcher who is killing on his own premises; he may have a little slaughterhouse in his own yard; he may run it very well and efficiently and keep it very clean and is able to slaughter, say, three or four cattle a week and maybe 18 or 20 sheep a week. But he never could hang in that particular slaughterhouse maybe more than one beast and maybe more than four sheep.  That would be absolutely useless for export.  It may be very efficient and very well run for the home trade but it would be no use whatever for export.  There must be more capacity for hanging.  There must be room for packing, whether he packs in crates or in boxes as the case may be and there must be the facilities that are necessary for doing a bigger trade, as it were, than the butcher would be doing in his own small slaughterhouse. But, subject to that, if it is a big slaughterhouse, used for the slaughter of cattle for home consumption, and if it is well done then, generally speaking, with some small alterations, it could be converted into suitable premises for the export trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point I want to deal with is the point raised by Senator Johnston.  He does not see why the Dublin butchers should not be permitted to take their meat from an abattoir like Drogheda or Waterford or Wexford or these places that are doing fairly good business now. There again the consideration is to stop too much contact as between dealers and farmers.  That suggestion was one of those put up to us back in the beginning when we set up the committee to deal with the position.  We did consider whether we should not get all dressed beef into the city from Waterford, <Col N="1091" /> Roscrea and these other places and not allow cattle in at all.  As Senators are, perhaps, aware, we dealt with pork in that way.  We got all dressed pork in and did not allow pigs in at all for a period and we thought it might be possible to deal with cattle in the same way.  Coming down again to examine what would happen if we adopted that system, suppose we said to the Dublin butchers, &ldquo;Any of you that wish can go down to Drogheda and select your meat there,&rdquo; what I am very much afraid of is that the butcher would go down; he would think perhaps he was getting better value and maybe he would be right in thinking that.</P>
    <P>If the seller had two or three good sides of beef he would say, &ldquo;I will take these back with me and maybe a dozen carcases of mutton.&rdquo;  Then, being very pleased with himself, he might meet a dealer, and the dealer might say, &ldquo;Well, you are pleased with what you got.  I will make sure you will get cattle and sheep here every other week, if you come down.&rdquo;  In that way the dealer would build up a connection.  Perhaps another dealer might come on the scene and in the end a number of dealers would go out amongst the farmers collecting cattle and sheep for the Dublin butchers. That is the sort of thing we are afraid might grow up.  Again we come back to the original idea we had, which is to try to prevent, if at all possible, more than one buyer going to any farmer who has cattle for sale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to that point, the Minister does not contend that every dealer can go out and buy cattle and take them into Drogheda or any abattoir or slaughterhouse and have them slaughtered?  Must he not get a licence before he can have them slaughtered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>For export, yes, he must have an exporter's licence.  What Senator Counihan is suggesting, perhaps, is that there would be only a limited number allowed to bring cattle into Drogheda abattoir.  If that was <Col N="1092" /> the case, suppose the limited number was five, why not call them the &ldquo;big five&rdquo; in Drogheda, the same as the &ldquo;big five&rdquo; in Dublin?  I do not see the difference.  Unless it is unlimited, competition is no use.  It is only a matter of degree anyway.  All these things may be an improvement on the present position.  I am quite prepared to admit that, but that is the reason anyway why we thought it better to stop dressed beef coming into the city at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept the point that if the export facilities were adequate the internal price would regulate itself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that more fully.  I got away from it.  With regard to the export business, however, I should have said that there are a number of firms in the export business.</P>
      <P>The principal four now are Roscrea and the three co-operatives which I have mentioned, Waterford, Wexford and Cork.  There are a few other smaller ones, as well as Drogheda and the Dublin abattoir and there are some sheep going also.  I have some figures here&mdash;unfortunately, I cannot give the figures for all the firms&mdash;but for these four, taking them together&mdash; that is, Roscrea and the three co-operatives I have mentioned&mdash;they exported 4,000 beef carcases in the month of March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very good for this time of year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is very good for this time of year.  Now, there are certain areas where there is a fair amount of competition, but there are also other areas where there is no competition. I am referring now to the point made by Senator Doyle.  First of all, let us take the Dublin area. That area would include the county of Dublin and a bit of the County Meath, close to the city, and there is no competition allowed there.  Nobody can buy fat cattle or sheep in that area except the committee.  Outside that area, however, in County Kildare, the <Col N="1093" /> rest of Meath, and other counties, the buyer from Roscrea or Wexford or Waterford can compete against the Dublin buyer, and, to that extent at least, there is a certain amount of competition. Again, take this matter of the 15 mile redius for the borough, to which Senator Doyle refers.  There is only one area, and that is Roscrea, and the whole County of Dublin comes under the 15 miles radius, but within that radius there is only one buyer allowed, and that buyer in the case of Dublin, is always accompanied by an officer of the Department.  In the case of Birr he is accompanied by a veterinary surgeon within the five miles radius.  Admittedly, there is no competition in such a case, because we do not want more than one buyer going to the man who has cattle or sheep for sale.  It is alleged that the buyers from Roscrea have taken advantage of the situation, and perhaps that is true, but I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDoyle" hpid="Dr. Doyle Dr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly, they have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that may be so, but I have had letters in that connection from two farmers, one in County Wexford and the other in Carrick-on-Suir&mdash;perhaps Senator Quirke would know that district better than I do&mdash; and in these two cases I wrote back to the farmers concerned and suggested that they should write to Waterford. As a result, Waterford sent a buyer to them and the farmers wrote and thanked me, not only for the amount of competition, but for the price they got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, there is real competition down there, or at least greater facilities for competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I should say that Waterford is working on commission almost altogether.  They pay so much for the meat according to quality, and in that way they are paid for their cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Are not Waterford and Wexford doing an export business in the dead-meat trade?</P>

    <Col N="1094" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but there is a real difficulty there just as in the case of the Dublin area.  We cannot afford, at the present time, to allow more than one buyer to go around there.  However, I shall take a note of what Senator Doyle referred to with a view to seeing what we can do to enforce the paying of a fair price in that area for cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDoyle" hpid="Dr. Doyle Dr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>And for sheep also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We are trying, in the Dublin area, to see if we cannot give the alternative to a seller of cattle or sheep of a live-weight price&mdash;particularly in the case of cattle&mdash;but so far it has not proved to be practicable. The farmer is inclined to be suspicious of a dead-weight price, because he does not know what may happen in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>He will accept the live-weight price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but he is not inclined to accept the dead-weight price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be possible to arrange for a live-weight price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, we are trying to arrange for an alternative. Now, it has been suggested to me that there is a passage into the Dublin market from the abattoir.  I am told, on the one hand, that the passage is there and that it is only a question of knocking down portion of a wall, but from another source I am told that that is not possible.  However, I am having that matter investigated and I am getting a report upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if the passage were not there, would you not have to cross the street, and would it not be an easy matter to disinfect the street&mdash;lay down disinfected straw&mdash;and in that way you would avoid any danger of infection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I do not want to take refuge under the wings of the veterinary staff of my Department, but they do lay very great stress on the danger of driving cattle across a street or roadway.  If you are driving cattle across a particular street or roadway <Col N="1095" /> it might be possible to give that particular spot a good disinfecting every evening, and that is a matter that is being examined.  I should like very much to be able to give the farmer the option of the live-weight price, because that would probably do away with a great deal of the criticism of the present scheme, and naturally I want to avoid as much criticism as I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection, I should like to point out to the Minister that there is a lot of criticism about gypsies travelling around the country with their horses and other animals.  I should like to know whether any action has been taken in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, there is just one more question that I should like to deal with before I come to gypsies.  Senator Kehoe started by accusing, or complimenting, if you like, Senator Johnston on pushing an open door.  Well, he started pushing an open door himself in great style in asking me to do something for the County Wexford, but I am afraid it is not so easy to do all that the Senator wants us to do. I agree that the Enniscorthy district is probably one of the best in the country&mdash;the Senator, probably would say, in the world&mdash;for producing cattle, but it must be remembered that there are other places nearby besides Wexford, and if the people are not satisfied with Wexford they can go to Waterford.  I know of the case of one farmer who sent his cattle to Waterford instead of to Wexford and he was well satisfied.  Accordingly, they are not so badly off in Enniscorthy in that respect.  It is true that there would be more cattle in that area at this period of the year than in other areas, because they go in for late stall feeding, but seeing that Wexford is already there and that they have access to Waterford, I do not see what can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, with regard to this question of the gypsies, various sources of infection have been suggested, and we get several of these suggestions every day in the Department.  These are all examined by the veterinary staff, if they have not been examined already.  One <Col N="1096" /> of the suggestions was that gypsies and tinkers should not be allowed within five miles of an infected farm, and I do not see what more you can do in the matter.  After all, you must leave these people and their animals on the road.  You cannot put them anywhere else.  If you were to put them on a farm, the farmer would probably object.  So far as I know, however, they have not spread the disease. Before I conclude, I should say that I have tried to get an analysis of the cases so far, with a view to ascertaining what was the cause of the spread of the disease.  I have not got a complete analysis.  A complete, scientific analysis would entail a lot of work and would mean that we would have to take members of our staff away from the important work they are doing at the moment, and it is only the veterinary surgeons who could make a proper analysis.</P>
    <P>However, we have got a summary, or a short account, if you like, of every case, and it is evident, from that, that in the great majority of cases the disease was spread by human contact, and that in all these cases it was spread by human contact from farm to farm.  So far as we can find out, the disease was not spread at race meetings, or greyhound tracks, and so on, but from farm to farm.  The disease was spread in various ways.  For instance, what occurred here in Dublin at the beginning was that a case of foot-and-mouth disease broke out in a certain yard.  There were three or four men working in the yard&mdash;drovers and minor dealers&mdash;and they all came in to have a look at the affected animal. They all became very expert, as they thought, and when there was a report of another outbreak of the disease in another yard, these alleged experts went over to have a look, and thus spread the disease further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there not a vet. on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the vet. was on his way.  Our powers were limited during these first two or three days in Dublin. In the beginning, for instance, we had not power to compel a man to stay in <Col N="1097" /> or to compel him to go out.  These fellows were very keen on their Constitutional rights and they would not stay in or go out when told to do so. A great deal of harm was done in that way before we got the Emergency Orders which gave the police certain powers.  I am only giving this as an instance of how the disease was spread. Another instance was where a man was employed by a certain employer. He might or might not have been there on the day the thing occurred, but he just went off and hired himself with another farmer.  This was responsible for a big outbreak. He hired himself with another farmer.  That farmer asked him had he any contacts.  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I came from County Cavan.&rdquo;  Why he said he came from County Cavan I do not know, but he was hired and after he was there for some days the whole herd went.  As time went on, things were tightened up very much because people began to realise that it was necessary to take stringent measures. As far as the Department was concerned they were just as strict in the beginning as they are now, but they found it absolutely impossible to get people to co-operate.  They are cooperating much better now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any evidence that farmers were cloaking it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>And are you paying them compensation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not been paid yet.  There is a good deal of talk about the regulations not being strict.  I should like Senators to realise what happens in these cases.  A farmer suspects that one of his cattle has foot-and-mouth disease.  He goes to the local barrack, the Gardaí in the barrack telephone to the Department and, as quickly as possible, there is a veterinary surgeon there.  If it is a place within 30 or 40 miles of Dublin, the veterinary surgeon is there within two hours.  At the same time as the telephone message is sent to the Department one of the Gardaí is sent out to the farmer's place and he tells all the people there that they must <Col N="1098" /> stay where they are, while he does not allow anybody to go in there.  If the veterinary surgeon on arrival verifies the case as one of foot-and-mouth disease, the men on the farm are kept there until the veterinary surgeon sends back for his disinfecting outfit. These men are then thoroughly disinfected before they are allowed out. After a thorough disinfection and fumigation of their clothes, they get the option of staying in on the farm or of going out and staying out.  These measures are now being carried out very much better than in the first instance because people are more willing to co-operate than in the beginning. The slaughter of the cattle is then proceeded with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Dublin here, we were able to dispose of the cattle very much more quickly than in the country because it was only the few affected cattle that were buried.  As a rule, all the rest were immediately shifted for manufacture into meat meal.  Cattle that were not in contact with the affected beasts, that were out in a different house or in a different field, were slaughtered for the manufacture of canned meat, not in the ordinary abattoir because we want to keep the abattoir if at all possible free from the disease, but in a smaller abattoir in the city.  In that way, we have succeeded in clearing some of the Dublin areas in the course of a few hours.  In the country, of course, it is a slower job.  We have been accused of being too slow, of delaying for five or eight days in dealing with affected cattle.  I think that is hardly fair.  In some cases we may have delayed as much as five days, but there were peculiar circumstances and we could not act as expeditiously in these cases in the country as in normal cases.  We have got the assistance of the military in many cases and as many as 100 soldiers have been out digging pits. The digging of these pits, of course, is an enormous job.  They have to be seven feet wide and as much as nine feet deep.  Then you allow about a yard for each beast.  Sometimes the pits are as much as 100 yards long. They take a lot of digging, but the <Col N="1099" /> beasts are disposed of as quickly as possible.  In the country the work may not be carried out as quickly, but it could not be done more efficiently or more quickly than it is.  The big cause of the trouble was concealment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The cause of the infection in Prussia Street which started the trouble in Dublin, the cause of the infection in Birr which started the trouble in that area, and the cause of the infection in Naas which started the trouble there, was concealment.  If the disease had not been concealed, these three sources would have been dealt with much more rapidly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We never discovered that. There are about three cases that we cannot account for.  Various theories have been put forward.  One was that plover were migrating at that time and it is possible that they could have carried infection.  It is quite possible that plover carried it from Donegal to Ballacolla.</P>
