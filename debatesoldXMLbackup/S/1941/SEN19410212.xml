    <Title>Army Pensions Bill, 1940 (Certified Money Bill)&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the present Bill is mainly to extend the date of application for pensions and allowances under the Army Pensions Acts, 1923-1937.  These Acts award compensation for injuries and disease attributable to or aggravated by service, or compensation to dependents in respect of deceased members of the various Forces as defined by the Acts.  The extension of the date has been necessitated by the fact that there are about 515 persons whose applications could not be dealt with because they had not applied within the statutory time limits, and as many of these cases seem to constitute a genuine hardship, it has been decided to extend that limit so as to be able to deal with the cases on their merits. The present Bill extends the date of application to 12 months after the passing of the Act, so that it will be possible under it to deal not only with the late applications already mentioned, but also with any fresh applications made within the new statutory period.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as first introduced, only extended the date for applications under the 1932 and the 1937 Acts, but as a result of certain representations it was amended in Committee to cover also applications under the 1927 Act. It therefore puts ex-members of the National Army on the same footing as ex-members of the I.R.A. as regards the time limit of application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another amendment introduced on <Col N="386" /> the Committee Stage in the Dáil to meet the views of members of the Oireachtas gives applicants for dependents' allowances under Part VII of the 1937 Act two years from the passing of this Bill in which they could appeal against an adverse decision by the Army Pensions Board.  The right of appeal within two years from the passing of the 1937 Act was already conceded in that Act, but in a number of cases the two years had elapsed before the report was made by the board, so that in effect the right of appeal was frustrated.  This defect has now been rectified by giving applicants the right to appeal within two years from the passing of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>The necessity of extending the date of application by means of this Bill has also been utilised to solve certain difficulties which have arisen in administering the Acts.  Some applicants, for instance, have failed to attend for examination when called by the board and as the Acts stand at present there is no power to compel attendance or, failing attendance, to determine the claim.  Power is now taken in this Bill to determine any such application, if the person fails to attend after a second notice given after an interval of three months.</P>
    <P>Power is also taken to reduce the allowance given under the Army Pensions Acts where the person affected receives simultaneously a pension under the Widows and Orphans Pensions Acts.  Finally it is made clear that, for a widow to qualify for a gratuity under Section 19 (3) of the 1937 Act, her husband must have been actually in receipt of a pension under the 1932 Act at the date of his death.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill does not make any new class of person eligible for a pension.  As the Minister has said, it merely remedies certain defects in previous Acts with regard to dates for the making of applications and the hearing of evidence.  It must be said, I think, that the Minister for Defence, when the Bill was before the other House, met very fairly amendments which were put up to him.  The Bill as <Col N="387" /> it emerged from the Dáil does, I think, cover all the cases with which the members of the other House were conversant. Therefore, there is nothing in it about which there can be very much opposition.  I understand the Minister wants all stages of this Bill, which is a Money Bill, to-day.  Perhaps I might ask whether any consideration has been given by him to a case that was mentioned in the Dáil in which a member of the Opposition front bench and the Minister for Agriculture were said to be interested.  I think the Minister said that he might deal with it in the Seanad.  I have no personal knowledge of the case myself.  It was mentioned that something in relation to it might arise in the Seanad.  In all the circumstances, I think the Bill ought to be passed through all stages to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not in for the opening of the Minister's statement, but, taking the original Act, it seems to me that if one has to decide whether disability is due to service or not, the decision has to be almost an arbitrary one.  A time limit was fixed for the Act.  It was obvious that, as time went by, it would be almost impossible to say whether or not the disability that a man admittedly suffered from was specifically due to service given to the State in warlike activities.  In arriving at a decision it seems to me that some consideration must be given to the question as to whether or not the disability was due to such origins. It is now a good number of years since the potential beneficiaries received their disabilities.  Suppose, say, that in 1920-1921 12 men went out and had to lie in ambush in wet weather.  If one of them, some years later, develops phthisis, how is one to say that it is exclusively due to his experiences on that night.  It must really have been due to a certain weakness in the man himself since the other 11 men, who had the same experience, did not show any ill-effects from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that this Bill ought to pass because I am certain that a great number of people have not received the justice that was meant to be given to <Col N="388" /> them in the original Act.  At the same time we must remember that we are now in the year 1941, and that this measure will cover cases going back to 1920-1921.  In my opinion, any doctor who would affirm that a given disability, other than say a bullet would which is covered by the Wounds Pensions Act, was due to a given experience 20 or more years ago, is obviously not speaking in a purely scientific way.  He has, of course, to bring a certain amount of commonsense to bear on the case.  You cannot have any definite code of rules for dealing with these cases.  I would like to know from the Minister whether there is any rule of thumb method for deciding that such disability is due to warlike activity.  I admit that if anyone were to ask me to lay down rules I would find it very hard to do so.  I would, I imagine, have to trust largely to commonsense and to the integrity of the applicant making the statement and of the doctor who examined him. I should like to think that the Minister has given some consideration to that matter.</P>
    <P>A period of 20 years leaves its mark on all of us.  We develop all sorts of troubles that were not foreseeable 20 years ago, and we complain now of pains and aches.  I know I suffer from them myself.  If anybody were to say to me that these were due to what one went through at that time, I would say it was all humbug.  I do not know what my pains and aches were due to originally, no more than anybody else does.  Your neighbour may say they are due to the sins of your youth. Physical illness is, of course, quite distinct from being riddled by machine-gun bullets or from falling off a lorry and getting your spine broken, so that really nobody can say that a given percentage of disability is due to a specific thing that happened 20 years ago.  I could not say it, nor do I know anybody who could, so that in the end, I think, you must rely on the medical examination and on the integrity and probity of the applicants.  At the same time, when one has reached the age that a good many of us here have reached, I suggest that our child-like faith in human probity has suffered <Col N="389" /> quite a good number of shocks, possibly as a result of painful experience.  For these reasons, I think the Minister ought to be able to tell us that some sort of precautions will be taken to see that we do not all come along and blame the fight for freedom for disabilities that we suffer from&mdash;and try to cash in on that&mdash;when, in fact, they are really due to quite extraneous, and perhaps hereditary, causes.</P>

      <P>May I take advantage of the discussion on this Bill to bring to the notice of the Minister the cases of a good many women who served in the Cumann na mBan and who have made claims for military service pensions?  Their applications do not seem to have made much progress. A difficulty in their case is to prove that they gave military service.  They usually did not take part in major engagements, but I think some means should be found to help them to prove their claims.  A number of them have been able to establish their claims.  The number able to do that is very small. I understand that a great many claims are pending.  One difficulty is the getting of evidence from the brigade leaders who do not seem to bother about the women.  For that reason, I would like to say a word on their behalf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 12 deals with people who refuse or fail to make application. I have nothing to say with regard to those who refuse to make application, but, as regards the others, their failure to make application may be due to this, that when they got notice to attend to submit evidence in support of their claims they were not physically fit to do so.  I should like to see provision made in such cases, whereby, if an applicant, notified to attend, produces a doctor's certificate showing that he is unable to attend, his case could be deferred until such time as he was fit to attend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 13, a widow may receive a pension, provided her husband was in receipt of a pension before his death.  We know that it takes a very long time to deal with these applications, and it is quite possible that <Col N="390" /> a man who had made application for a pension might die before his claim was decided, and his wife, in that event, would not be entitled to a pension, even though, if his case had been investigated, it would have been found that he was, in justice, entitled to it. In such cases, provided the application had been made, provision should be made whereby, if there was sufficient evidence to prove that he suffered from a disease or disability and that such was the cause of his death, his widow and children would be provided for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather a pity, to my mind, that the Government should burden themselves with this further Bill before the cases already under consideration have been dealt with. There are cases of men who were called before the board 12, 18 months and two years ago and who are still in darkness as to whether their cases have been dealt with negatively or affirmatively. I suggest that the cases already before them should be completely disposed of before new cases are taken up, because there is not a public representative in the country but knows of various cases of hardship in respect of which the chief complaint is as to why they are not told the decision one way or another.  I know cases of real hardship which should have been favourably considered and which have not been considered.  My main point is that claims already sent in and which are properly certified should be dealt with and completed, before taking up the consideration of an altogether new set of cases.</P>

      <P>The truth of the matter is that while this is necessary, having received the approbation of those responsible and the question of <Col N="391" /> codifying and clarifying the position being very important, I feel that the existing arrangements should be speeded up, and I am at one with the last Senator in saying that a little more speed should be shown.  We have the regrettable spectacle of cases of the 1916 veterans not yet being decided.  It is not a question of some of these men dying because some of them have died, but a little more speed should be shown and a little more grease put on the machine.  I know that it is an extremely complicated process and that the difficulties have been long and almost interminable, but, nevertheless, I think I am right in saying that the board has been sitting for six years and the cases of the 1916 veterans in particular, because, after all, they were the nucleus of the whole movement, should have been decided long ago on the principle of first things first.  We are coming near the end of the pension period when old Father Time will decide one way or another, but it is perhaps not yet too late to ask that the allotment of pensions to those of the 1916 men who yet survive should be decided as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Taking the Bill generally, I am not very clear, I am sorry to say, as to exactly what Acts are covered by it, but I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the amendment of the Disability Pensions Act which allowed applications in respect of aggravation of disease to be made under the disability pensions scheme.  So far as I understand, the only time-space allowed, when it was passed, was a period of six months, and the cases of many of those who had previously applied under the 1932 Act had not been brought to a conclusion when that six months' period elapsed.  Later, when they tried to apply under that scheme, they were told that their applications were too late.  I wonder if the Minister would consider an amendment to this Bill, or even further legislation, to allow an extension of the time for application  whose cases were not decided within the period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator Hayes, I discussed the matter immediately after the debate in the Dáil with Deputy Fionán Lynch. I explained the position in respect of the particular case he had in mind and in which he mentioned the Minister for Agriculture was also interested. The position actually is that, if the individual in question can produce additional evidence which was not available at the time of the previous hearing, his case can be reopened.  I think that all I can say in respect of the points raised by Senator Fitzgerald is that we all recognise the frailty of human ingenuity in regard to dealing with the particular type of case he had in mind, but we have done everything possible to meet it.  For instance, the bringing in of the aggravation clause in 1937 was an effort to deal with it. There were numerous cases in which men could not prove that disability was due to service, but, as a result of the 1937 amendment, they were enabled to prove that disability had at least been aggravated by service and, in that way, they came within the Act.  I think that that was as far as we were able to go at that time, with the exception of a man whose disease, designated as a certain percentage, was diminishing, and who, by reason of that diminution found himself again outside the Act.  Another amendment was brought in in 1937 which made it possible for that individual to opt for a flat rate pension.  In the case of an individual whose disability was diminishing from 80 per cent. down to as low as perhaps 50 per cent., he was entitled to opt for a flat rate pension.  If he did not do that, his pension ceased when his disability went below 80 per cent.  He could, of course, come up for examination at a later period, but, as against that, there was the possibility that, by reason of treatment he had got in hospital, he might be recovering and would possibly make a complete recovery. Therefore, that individual was given the right to opt for a flat rate pension, or take the chance that his disability would become worse, that he would go again to the 80 per cent. and be entitled to the higher pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the remarks of <Col N="393" /> Senator Hawkins and Senator Kehoe, I am afraid that they are mixing up service pensions with disability pensions.</P>
    <P>I think that every case has been dealt with under the 1932 Disability Pensions Act and only a few are left under the amending Act of 1937.  Accordingly, I have come to the conclusion that what Senator Hawkins and Senator Kehoe were referring to were service pensions under the 1934 Act.  As regards Section 13, I have no control. That is a section which runs through most Acts into which finance enters. In answer to Senator Kennedy, the aggravatory clause of this Bill extends the right to come in by 12 months.</P>
    <P>As mentioned at the beginning of this debate, this is a non-controversial Bill.  Most of the Senators who spoke believed it should go through and, beyond saying that I would be very grateful if the House would consider the question of giving me all stages to-day, so that the measure may be got into operation, I have nothing to add.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That in the opinion of Seanad Eireann, and in the absence of guaranteed minimum prices, there <Col N="394" /> should be a declaration of Government policy to the effect that surplus produce on the lands of farmers who have complied with the Compulsory Tillage Order, 1941, will be purchased at a price which will not involve the farmer in financial loss by reason of his having complied with the terms of the order.</P>
    <P>The members of this House and the people of the country are at one in their desire to get the maximum production from the land during 1941.  I have already put down more than one motion in the hope that we would get the means to effect and bring about this increased production which we all desire.  These motions were not accepted by the House or by the Government but I make no apology whatever for coming back to the question. The danger that will confront the country if the land is not made to do something which it has not done for a great many years is being borne in upon us more clearly now than it was previously.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a mild protest against a number of the admonitions, exhortations and kindly advice being tendered to our farmers by quite a number of respectable and responsible people up and down the country, with a view to getting them to work harder and to produce more.  These people take no account of the consideration that the farmer should get a just price for his labour.  The one outstanding exception amongst these exhortations was that of the Lord Bishop of Killaloe.  Apart from the advocacy of his Lordship, I have not seen where one of the people who are urging a policy of greater production pointed out that, as a corollary, the farmer should be justly paid for the produce which he will make available to the people by harder work and longer hours.  Just treatment should be our first consideration. I suggest that the people who are pressing our farmers to be more patriotic than ever before and to work harder than they have done in the past should balance that advice by saying that the farmer should secure a just return for the labour he gives and for the produce he places at the people's disposal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> We are urged to increase production in the name of patriotism but farmers in the past have not been slow in demonstrating their patriotism.  Quite a number of us in the past put everything we had into the melting pot&mdash;farms, homes and the interest of our families. Quite a number of farmers would be prepared to do the same again but a great many realise that, while noble deeds are done and great sacrifices made in the name of patriotism, the reward from the people is frequently not commensurate with the sacrifices made. A great many of our farmers, hard pressed as they have been over a number of years, have been asking themselves: &ldquo;What are we capable of doing and what is expected of us in the name of patriotism?&rdquo;  I realise&mdash;and I am sure the House and the country generally realise&mdash;that we are being thrown back on our own resources now to an extent we have not experienced in the past.  In my judgment&mdash;I think I have said this previously&mdash;all the resources which can be made available to the farmers of this State to enable them to save and to keep hunger away from all homes, should be made available.  That has not been done and it is not being done.  To-day we are asking, I think, for, approximately, 2,700,000 acres of tillage.  Last year we expected an additional 1,000,000 acres.  We did not get anything like it.  We got close on 2,000,000 acres last year.  We are wanting an additional 700,000 acres now. May I point out that for 700,000 acres of tillage the Government are giving a guaranteed price, that is, those 700,000 acres would represent the maximum requirements of wheat and sugar beet, but for 2,000,000 acres there is no guarantee whatever and no indication as to what compensation the farmer is to get for the crops he is expected to harvest from those 2,000,000 acres.</P>
    <P>A few days ago I was discussing this question with a man whom I regard, and whom I think the Minister would regard, as being an authority on agriculture in this country.  I put him the question: &ldquo;What would you do if you were given the task of providing from our land enough food to supply all the needs of our people and our animal <Col N="396" /> population?&rdquo;  His answer to me was: &ldquo;Millions would not stop me.&rdquo;  In my view that is the way to do it.  Millions ought to be made available if it is necessary.  If you have not the food, money cannot buy it.  These millions can be made available if the Government will face up to the situation with courage and imagination.</P>
    <P>What is the argument against giving the guarantee for which I ask?  One point which will be made, of course, is that there will be such a demand for food that it is absolutely certain nothing will be left on the farmer's hands and, accordingly, he does not want any guarantee for what he would produce.  If that be the answer, I say the Government are incurring no risk whatever in telling the farmers of the country: &ldquo;Go on with your job; if there is anything left on your hands we will see you will not incur any loss by reason of your increased production.&rdquo; I say here, too, that it is a very risky policy for the Government to permit our food supplies to be so short that they are quite certain that everything we produce will be absorbed by ourselves here.  I think they ought to make certain of having a margin over.  It is not enough to have food in your home for to-day; there ought to be a little for to-morrow.</P>
    <P>If the Government are satisfied that our total production is going to be used up, and at a price which will pay the farmers for growing it, the Ministry and the Government are taking no risk whatever.  If the Government give this guarantee and tell the farmers that they are going to stand in if they get into difficulties, immediately there would be brought about a condition of stability in agriculture which has been lacking and which even to-day is lacking.  A most extraordinary position exists at the moment, a situation tending towards inflation.  There has been and there is now a considerable amount of speculation with regard to agricultural commodities. There was such a position in regard to oats early in the year, and that probably applies to other crops now, even to wheat.  That is not good. I believe it is fundamentally unsound <Col N="397" /> for the nation and bad for agriculture to have that sort of speculation and instability.  It is much better that the farmer should have a reasonable return for his labour than to be running into a period of high prices when the speculator is putting a value upon what he produces out of all proportion to its real worth.  In the end somebody must pay.  The poor who cannot obtain the goods suffer, and in the end it is all passed back to the farmer.</P>
    <P>On the other hand there is, I suppose, the possible dread on the part of the Government that if there were considerable quantities of crops on the farmer's hands which the farmer could neither profitably feed to stock nor to humans and if the responsibility was on the Government to take these over and do something with them, the Government would be involved in considerable financial obligations and possibly in loss.  If the Government is not prepared to face a situation of that kind I think it is manifestly unjust that the farmers, a minority of the community, who are giving a service to the community as a whole in time of trial and difficulty, should have to carry the burden and bear that loss. I think it is unjust; I think it is a condition of things which you should not ask our farmers to face.  If the farmers anticipated such a state of affairs they would be justified in refusing to enter into increased production of food either for the people of the country or for the animals.  I would hope for a wider outlook on the part of the Government and on the part of the community as a whole.  I would hope that our farmers would be told: &ldquo;Go ahead; work hard and work long hours; employ labour; do everything you can with your fields; sow all the crops you can; make certain of one thing, that you will produce enough food for our people and for your own livestock, and we will see that you will not incur any loss by the pursuance of such a policy.&rdquo;  If that were said by the Government the attitude of our farmers towards this whole problem of increased tillage&mdash;especially of many farmers who have not had experience of a tillage policy for a great many <Col N="398" /> years&mdash;would be very different from what it is.</P>
    <P>Even the tillage farmers know how unstable the scheme of agriculture has been where for a number of years they have been dependent on the growing of grain crops.  The policy which was pursued here for a number of years undoubtedly altered the trend of our agricultural policy and influenced to a considerable extent the animal and poultry population of this country. There could have been another way and a better way.</P>
    <P>In the first place, none of us is able to look into the future.  We do not know what may happen within 12 months.  Some people are calculating that the war is going to continue for a year or two or three.  If a blockade is waged against us for as long as that the farmer must get a price, and he will get a price, but who knows what other changes may take place in the international situation which may alter completely the outlook?  I think we must guard against that and at the same time we must see what we have accomplished in the last 12 months and make comparisons with our achievements as against the achievements of farmers and Governments elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In 1939 I moved a motion in this House asking for a guaranteed minimum price for all tillage crops arising out of the application of the Compulsory Tillage Order.  That was rejected by the Government.  I believe they were unwise.  I am now convinced that they were very unwise.  To-day in this country we are short of a great many commodities that we could have grown in our own fields and which the farmers would have grown if they had been given those guarantees which were within the competence of the Government to give.  Possibly before next harvest comes we will be short of animal food and food for humans. Our farmers would have produced it from our own fields if they had been given those guarantees.  I challenge anyone who says to me: &ldquo;The farmers will not do it.&rdquo;  In my experience&mdash;if I am to be contradicated let me be contradicted by someone who knows better&mdash;the farmer does what pays. <Col N="399" /> The farmer has just as much sense about pounds, shillings and pence as anyone else, and will engage in that type of agricultural production which will pay him best.  He has done it in the past.  He would have done it in 1940 had the Minister faced up to that motion and given those guarantees. I know, of course, that some people are saying this is not the time for the farmers to hold the community up to ransom.  There are farmers here and there, or people who are playing at farming, saying that kind of thing.  I must say that I have discussed this whole problem with a great many people who are entirely engaged in the occupation of farming, and I never yet heard a farmer say that he did not want a guaranteed price for the commodities he produced, nor did I ever hear any one of them say he would not take it if he got it.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what others have done. In the first place, the British Minister for Agriculture has issued a declaration of Government policy indicating that during the war and for one year after they are going to give a guaranteed minimum price for all crops.  You will have noticed in the papers to-day that the New Zealand Government are undertaking to guarantee the price of meat exported from that country.  Look at what they did in the North in 1940.  We here asked for an additional 1,000,000 acres under the plough. The Minister, in his speech in the Dáil &mdash;a speech which, I may say, despite criticism from certain other people, I would commend&mdash;indicated that we had succeeded in getting approximately an additional 300,000 acres tilled in the Twenty-Six Counties last year.  Mind you, we asked for an additional 1,000,000 acres, at least Ministers talked about 1,000,000 acres&mdash;I think the Minister present here talked about it&mdash;but we got only 300,000 acres.  In the Six Counties they asked for an additional 200,000 acres under the plough and they actually got 260,000 acres.  They got 260,000 acres in the Six Counties, and we could get only 300,000 acres in the Twenty-Six <Col N="400" /> counties.  What is wrong with us?  Are our farmers more lazy and less go-ahead than the farmers up there?  I do not think so.  We are just as tough, and we can work just as hard.  From the point of view of patriotism they have just as much reason to answer to the patriotic call at the moment as we have, at least if you are to judge them from the protestations which they frequently make.  But there was this very great difference, and this very great incentive to the policy which they were asked to pursue when compared with what we were being asked to do.</P>
    <P>In the Six Counties there was a subsidy of £2 per acre for every additional acre of land of seven year old lea put under the plough.  They guaranteed a minimum price for potatoes.  They guaranteed a minimum price for oats.  They guaranteed a minimum price for milk.  The price which they gave for potatoes is working out at approximately £5 per ton on a farm at the present time.  The price for oats is working out at about 12/- or 13/- on the farm.  They did this with their farmers; not alone did they give them a guaranteed price for their potatoes, the equivalent of £5 at the present time, but they subsidised the purchase of those same potatoes by the farmers.  After receiving £5 per ton for their potatoes the farmers were able to purchase back their own potatoes to feed to their own stock at 55/- per ton, and at the moment they are selling their pork at about 104/- or 105/-, fed on potatoes which are costing them £2 15s. 0d. per ton, after getting the balance between that and £5.  We to-day are getting approximately the same price for our pork, 105/-, but we are not getting this sort of assistance.  They have been similarly guaranteed with regard to their oats, their poultry, their eggs and their milk.  This is very interesting for the dairying counties.  During the winter months they have been given 1/2, 1/3 or 1/4 per gallon for their milk at their creameries. They got 1½d. less if they preferred to take the separated milk back home.  In addition, at the moment their eggs are commanding <Col N="401" /> anything from 6/- to 8/- per 100 more than ours are value for here.</P>
    <P>Will somebody tell me that those encouragements have not been responsible, entirely responsible, for the immense increase in tillage in the Six Counties?  In my judgment they have been so responsible.  In my opinion they are essential.  I suggest that their costs of production are certainly not higher in the Six Counties than ours are here.  I am not going into that, because I am not making an argument for one place as against another.  I am pointing out what the people in the Six Counties regarded as essential in order to get their farmers to pursue the kind of policy they wanted them to pursue in the emergency through which we are all passing.  We got 300,000 additional acres of tillage in 1940.  I would put it to the Minister present: What would our position be to-day had we got another 300,000 acres?  If we now had crops&mdash;potatoes and oats, if nothing else&mdash;from an additional 300,000 acres of tillage, we would be in a far better position to feed our people and our live stock.  We would have got those additional acres had the Government given us the guaranteed minimum prices asked for in 1939, and it would not have cost the Exchequer one penny.  I think the time has come for all of us to appreciate that this job of feeding ourselves is a very big one, but it is vital to our very existence, and no money can maintain order and stability if we have neglected to provide food for the population.  It will not save either the Government or the leaders of public opinion or thought in this country if, from the land of this country in 1941, we are not able to obtain as much food as is necessary for our home requirements. The way to ensure that that will be made available is to tell the farmers that no matter what produce they have over after the country's requirements are met, they are not going to incur any loss.</P>
    <P>There are all sorts of problems facing our farmers, and we have been stressing many of them in this House.  We know that a great many farms are <Col N="402" /> under-stocked and under-capitalised. We know that many of the farmers are poorly equipped to meet the problems that are now arising.  We know there are others prepared to rent land for the purpose of cultivating it if they had any assurance that they would not lose by doing so.  I do not want to see a policy of speculation engaged in with regard to our soil.  We ought to have some definite aim.  Under existing conditions, after taking stock of the problems which confront us, we ought to make our minds up that we have here an opportunity to do something for ourselves which we have not been doing in the past.  I feel that in this matter the Minister is not very far away from the point of view that I hold.  For a number of years we have been engaged in the practice of importing considerable quantities of raw materials for the purpose of feeding animals which are either sold off the land or are killed here and sold.  We cannot engage in that practice much longer.</P>
    <P>If the farmers are given a chance, if they are given encouragement and assured of stability, I believe they are prepared to do their share.  I believe a definite declaration of policy, along the lines I suggest in this motion, will be tantamount to a credit note for every farmer.  The farmer would then be able to say to a banker, a shopkeeper, or anybody else: &ldquo;I have ten acres here and the Government have stated that whatever I produce off that land will be taken from me at a price that will not involve me in any loss financially. I want so much from you for tilling and seeding that land.&rdquo;  I believe that a man in that position would immediately be able to get all the assistance he required and would be able to go ahead with the good work.  I would like to see the farmers encouraged in that fashion.  It would be far better than to have them renting their land to others because they have not sufficient capital to work it themselves.</P>
    <P>If we have sufficient confidence in ourselves to face the situation boldly, we can re-shape our agricultural policy <Col N="403" /> along lines that will be much more beneficial to the country.  We must remember that this effort to increase food production cannot easily be achieved.  In many parts of the country this winter the people have lived through a period when it was quite impossible to prepare the land for tillage.  I am sure the Minister realises the difficulties that had to be faced by the men with a pair of horses and a plough.  There were days when it was absolutely impossible to do outside work.  It is in such circumstances that the difficulties confronting the farmers become apparent.  If we did the things that are obvious and that are within our competence, we could, I believe, shape a new agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>Speaking on Senator Johnston's motion recently, I regretted that the Minister for Agriculture had decided to suspend the sittings of the Agricultural Commission.  The strange thing is that in other countries which are not as largely agricultural as this they are considering agricultural policies and it is peculiar that the Minister should regard this as the proper time to suspend all advanced thought on that question here.  Even to-day the Ulster farmers have a committee sitting to consider their future agricultural policy.  I believe we ought to be shaping our agricultural policy.  We ought to give some consideration to the problems that will confront us next harvest.  Perhaps the Minister will tell me that his fear is we will not get half enough produce from the land.  There are many of us who fear that we will not get half enough.  I want to give our people sufficient encouragement to induce them to give us the whole loaf, so to speak.</P>
    <P>It is very necessary to consider the position that may confront us next harvest, particularly in districts where the grain crop is heavy.  We ought to be planning the erection of buildings in which to store the grain.  One of the main difficulties of the grain-growing farmer is that he is unable to store his grain.  He has to cash it at a time when very few people want it and <Col N="404" /> nobody will take the risk except a speculator.  There are people who purchased oats at 9d. and 10d. a stone after last harvest, and to-day they can get 2/- for it.  The farmer who grows the oats is losing and the farmer who has to buy it for seed is losing.  The individuals who come in between take all the profits.  That is the problem that confronted us in the past, and it will confront us again unless during the months between this and the next harvest farmers are enabled, by some system of credit, to make provision for the proper storing of their crops.  I suggest that farmers should be placed in a position to erect buildings in order to hold grain crops until such time as the market is able to absorb them.</P>
    <P>No matter what we do about tillage, the dairying industry should not be overlooked and there must be no reduction in its output.  It is very essential that we keep our dairy stocks at their maximum from the point of view of numbers.  It is necessary to do that while at the same time doing our utmost with regard to tillage.  We should see to it that we will not in any way deplete our herds.  When this madness passes from the world there will be a new situation in which a country like ours can serve usefully if we now keep our stock virile and up to the largest numbers possible. Instead of making spasmodic efforts here and there without any clearly defined views, we should concentrate on a definite agricultural policy.  I suggest our method should be to get our farmers into production at a rate which they have not attempted for a great many years by giving them adequate guarantees.  They will not make any great effort unless they are given encouragement, and so far the Government has not made any satisfactory move in that direction.  It is not anything like adequate to guarantee the produce of 700,000 acres and give no security in respect to the additional 2,000,000 acres of tillage which are so urgently required.</P>
    <P>I urge that if we can get this increased tillage, in the cultivation particularly of potatoes, oats and barley, a great quantity of the imports for <Col N="405" /> which in the past we have had to pay with exports, need not come here in future.  I think we can teach our farmers that from their own land they can supply their needs to a degree which they had not hitherto attempted, but the difficulties are many.  We are to-day living under conditions which are quite abnormal. In the past, the attitude of most people in this country was to purchase food at the lowest possible figure at which they could get it.  People in our towns and cities, just like people in towns and cities in England, felt that they were doing their duty to the farmer by buying their food in the cheapest possible market.  They did not mind whether it came from the ends of the earth or from the neighbour's field.  What was all-important to them was the fact that it should be cheap.  I think we shall have to alter that attitude of mind in future. I think that a great many people in this country should have done with the idea of cheap food.  We got cheap food in the past, but how did we get it?</P>
    <P>The Minister has probably read or heard of a book called <i>The Rape of the Earth.</i>  That book describes how cheap food was produced from the land.  America has already lost one-third of her soil by these methods and continues to lose it at an increasing rate.  The rate of erosion in Africa and Australia is also steadily mounting. Cheap food was produced in South America, in Australia and other countries by exploiting the land, by ploughing and tilling it without any regard to the need for fertilisers, cutting off forests and working the soil until it became so light that it could be blown away, as it has been blown away off millions of acres, leaving nothing but deserts behind.  We in this country have been trying to conserve our soils, trying to keep them fertile, and whilst we have been unable to use the mechanised implements that are available to the farmers of these other lands, the cost of production here has been much higher than in these other countries.  All this time we had to try to compete against the <Col N="406" /> methods of production which I have described.  Even at the moment you can buy grain in South America at £2 per ton, while in the shops here it costs about £15 per ton.  I wonder if to-morrow or at the end of the year a blitzkrieg were started by either of the belligerents what would happen to the fruits of this year's harvest?</P>
    <P>We have had to compete against the methods of production in other countries, which I have described, because the people in the towns and cities wanted cheap food.  My view is that cheap food, the product of the cheap labour of farmers and their labourers, should no longer be expected in this country.  Our aim should be to pay the farmer decent wages for his own labour, so that he in turn may be able to pay a decent wage to those whom he employs.  If there are people in the towns and cities who are not able to buy dear food, then I say it is our job to face up to that situation, to see what we can do to increase their wages and incomes so as to enable the farmer to get a decent price for the food he produces, a price which will give him a reasonably decent standard of living.  I say that this demand for cheap food, if we are going to have any decent standard of living for the people of this country, is something that might as well be forgotten.  I do not think it is a wise or sound national policy.  It has been disastrous for the farmers, and for rural life generally, and has been responsible for a big reduction in the rural population.  If these things are to be averted, if we are to rehabilitate the country, we must make up our minds that we are going to pay a decent price for the food that we get from the land.</P>
    <P>I am urging that the Ministry should give our farmers at least the same encouragement that farmers receive elsewhere. Our farmers want just as much encouragement as their fellows living across the Border or in New Zealand.  They are just as human, just as normal.  There is not very much difference between the Minister, although he comes from the Six Counties, and the man from Cork.  The farmer in Armagh is very like the farmer <Col N="407" /> in my own county, and neither of them is unlike the farmer in West Cork. The farmer in West Cork likes to be paid a fair price for his oats and potatoes just like the farmer in the Six Counties.  For years past, there has been neither security nor stability in Irish agriculture, and that lack of stability and security has had an enervating effect on our whole life here. That is one of the first problems with which we must grapple.  I urge that a declaration of policy from the Ministry will do much to encourage greater production. The difficulties of production at the moment are of a magnitude that is sometimes, one feels, not fully realised.</P>
    <P>There was inserted in the newspapers the other day an advertisement appealing for the production of more potatoes, if farmers could not grow more wheat.  It seems never to have occurred to those responsible for the advertisement that an acre of potatoes cannot be produced&mdash;this has been my experience&mdash;at a cost of less than £20 or £25 cash.  I suggest that the Minister might make some calculations on that score or get some practical farmer to make them.  You are giving a guaranteed price for wheat, but there is no mention of a guaranteed price for potatoes.  Let us assume that it costs £25, or even £20, to produce an acre of potatoes.  You may get eight tons, ten tons or 12 tons from that acre or you may get only seven.  Assuming the yield to be seven tons, and say that the farmer gets as high as £4 per ton, he receives only £28 for the produce of his acre.  Just look then at the return which the farmer gets for his labour.</P>
    <P>You want an additional area under potatoes but how is that going to be secured?  There are many, almost insuperable obstacles.  I do not know whether the Minister will recommend the growing of potatoes on lea land without any manure.  The Minister knows, as well as I do, that the same quantities of farmyard manure that we had last year are not available for the growing of potatoes this year.  On <Col N="408" /> the whole, farmyard manure is used up in the growing of root crops of one kind or another and artificial manures are not going to be available in anything like the quantities that are required.  These are some of the difficulties that confront us.  If the farmer is not able to secure these huge returns from his tillage that are hoped for next harvest, will the Minister be in a position to say then that the Government had done everything it could do or that there was nothing which it should have done, that it had not done?  I put this point to the Minister.  Had the Government, in 1939, given a guaranteed minimum price for all crops, would there not have been a very considerably increased area put under tillage in 1940?  Every additional acre of lea land put under tillage last year would be stubble to-day and that would be much more suitable for the production of potatoes, even with a small dressing of manure, than lea land is to-day. You had there potentialities and possibilities which could be easily tapped which are not now available.  The whole trouble about this policy of farming is that you cannot plough your score and sow all the seed and reap, thresh and eat, all in a day. You have to look 12 or 18 months ahead and even that is not very long for farming.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that this is the biggest task, next to the defence of our rights as a nation&mdash;and, indeed, in that this problem of producing additional food also is involved, as the problem of our defence involves our capacity to produce additional food, and is secondary to it.  Hungry people, or even people half-fed, will not be half as enthusiastic about defending their rights as a nation, as they would be if they are well fed.  Those who went through it know that there was no time when the people of this country were as virile or as vigorous as they were in the days of 1917 to 1919.  Then there were plenty of stores, the people were comfortably off, and they were not afraid to take the risk. They risked their homes, their land, their money and their lives.  Plenty of food is essential for defence, and <Col N="409" /> we should spare nothing to get it.  A gentleman said to me that he would be prepared to spend millions of money.  To put the thing in a nutshell, I urge that no millions can compensate for the situation which will confront us if we have not enough.  The possibility is that we may not have enough if we do not give guarantees of some kind or another.  If we give the guarantees, the possibility is that they may never be called upon, that the people themselves will be in such a situation that they would be able to pay a price that will compensate the farmer for his labour.  It is all complicated, intricate and involved, but our whole future and our national life depend upon the capacity, the imagination and the courage of the Government to face this situation.</P>
    <P>I believe that a bold statement of policy will ensure that our people will face this problem of tillage and increased food production in a way that they have never faced it before.  Having faced it, and having solved it, we will have an entirely new outlook about the future, and will reach a stage, in these days of difficulty and emergency, when, by our own efforts and the confidence we have in ourselves and in one another, we will never be so dependent on the lands and toil of people in other countries for food for ourselves in the days to come.</P>

      <P>It is very hard, after the field that has been covered by Senator Baxter, to find anything new to say to this very grave problem of agriculture and the condition of farmers. I will be told, I suppose, if I attempt to offer a severe critique of the policy of the Government, that I am attacking the Government; or, perchance, I may be told that the Limerick farmers are lazy.  However, if I know the philosophy of Government, it is that their primary duty is to maintain law and order, and to give a maximum of prosperity to all the people with the minimum of taxation.  This condition of agriculture is not quite a recent development.  This is a stupendous <Col N="410" /> national question, and every time that I had occasion to speak on it here&mdash; appreciating, of course, my limitations, and without the academic training of some of our professors&mdash;I had to focus, in my own way, the attention of the Government and of responsible thinking men on the position of agriculture over a number of years.  It is in a desperate condition.</P>
      <P>We had a very serious report three or four years ago and I do not know if anything has been done about it by the Government.  There were three reports&mdash;one on banking, one on currency and credits, and a report by the Registrar-General.  I have here in my hand a most important broadcast on Tuesday, December 31st last, by the Minister for Agriculture.  He opened by saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At the present moment, when men are debating the most effective measures for the defence of their country, it is important to remember that one of the very urgent questions is that of food supply.  I want to stress the gravity of the situation in regard to our food supplies.  The position is gradually becoming more serious and it is quite possible, if not probable, that within a very short period supplies of imported food may be cut off entirely.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the opening of the Minister for Agriculture and upon that Senator Baxter has dilated, I consider, very effectively and practically for the last half-an-hour.  We have had a very bad winter.  The planting of wheat has been very considerably restricted&mdash; there is no doubt of that&mdash;and the early part of the spring up to to-day has not been helpful for man and horse in a field to continue the setting or planting of spring wheat.  There has been an intensive drive from top to bottom and there has been&mdash;and there is&mdash;a response in the hearts of the farmers of Ireland to rise as perhaps never before to meet the exigencies at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter has pointed out that there is a guaranteed price for wheat. There is none for oats, for potatoes, or for farming generally.  My council, as <Col N="411" /> I told the House a fortnight ago, realising its duties and its responsibilities to the people and the Government, hammered out a scheme to accommodate the farmers, many of whom need help; and we have decided to give them, on the production of their rates receipts, a maximum of £20, and down as low as £5 for those in the agricultural labourers' plots. They are almost late for winter wheat: to the end of February is the latest time, and, judging by the condition of the weather at the moment, very little can be done; and since last Saturday they have been asking if there will be any guaranteed price for the other cereals they will be compelled to set. Take 5,000 cottiers in my county. They have been pouring in with their application forms.  They are delighted to be accommodated with £3 or £5. If they set an acre of potatoes or half an acre of oats they want to know if they will get guaranteed prices for oats or potatoes, or might what happened a few years ago happen again, when we had considerable quantities in the barns with no market?  They then expected something in the region of 1/3 a stone and had to market their oats three or four years ago at anything from 9d. to 10d.  It was not sufficient to pay the cost of production.</P>
    <P>In another part of his broadcast, the Minister tells us:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If ample supplies of artificial manures were available, I would have no fears for returns on the poorer soils.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, artificial manures may be available in a limited way, but what about the price?  The price asked in my city and in other large towns last Saturday for artificial manures was £8 a ton.  How can a farmer meet these heavy charges?  As I pointed out before, everything that he has to buy is about 100 per cent. above the prices of the previous war&mdash;the 1916 war&mdash; and everything that he has to sell is at a very low minimum.</P>
    <P>Take the report of the Registrar-General. As far as I know, the Government <Col N="412" /> have done nothing about it.  In that report, a very serious state of things was indicated&mdash;what amounted to the gradual and ultimate disappearance of the agricultural people of this country, of the farmers.  There is no doubt about that.  No one can question the authority of his figures.  He tells us that over 300 rural schools were closed and that there were 36,000 less boys on the register of these schools in the county areas&mdash;and all that within a period of ten years.  In yesterday's Press, we saw it reported that there are about 38,000 less agricultural workers now employed on the land than were employed on the land ten years ago, and about a month or so ago I gave some statistics here showing that there had been a serious diminution in the number of cows, in my own particular county&mdash;a diminution of something in the region of 40,000 dairy cows.  I pointed out the reasons why, and I defy any man listening to me to challenge the fact that, if he goes into any barn of cows&mdash;let us say, a barn of 18 or 20 cows&mdash;five, six or seven of these cows will be found to be what are commonly called &ldquo;duds&rdquo;, or strippers suffering from various diseases.  There are plenty of practical farmers listening to me now, and I am sure they will bear that statement out.</P>
    <P>That is the position at the moment. I have been connected with public bodies for a great many years&mdash;16 years in the district council of my own part of the country and nine years in the county council&mdash;and all my life I have been connected with agriculture and, through my business as an auctioneer, I think I am as well acquainted with the business of farmers as anyone could be.  Now, from my experience, I can say that the farmer at the moment is not in the position or has not the money to renew these five, six or seven &ldquo;duds&rdquo;, and he is ashamed to drive them out and send them to Roscrea.  He is ashamed because of that pride that is inherent in the Irish farmer&mdash;because his neighbour might say: &ldquo;Oh, Paddy Brown has only 15 or 16 cows left, he has sent five or six cows to Roscrea, and he must be in a bad way and is nearly <Col N="413" /> finished.&rdquo;  I do not want to blame our past history for that particular feeling or pride, nor do I want to blame the slaughtering of a few thousand calves as a result of an undigested kind of economics some years ago, but that is the position that exists, and, no matter what may be the cause, the position is terrible, and something must be done to meet it.</P>
    <P>We submitted a scheme last year in our council, and I beg leave to submit it here.  It may not be exactly <i>à propos</i> of the present discussion, but I believe that it is analogous to it. We put forward the scheme for the consideration of the farmers and it was passed unanimously, and I believe that if the Minister or the Government could see their way to implement legislation to put that scheme into effect it would be helpful both to the Government and in the giving of employment to the workers.  It is a scheme to provide State-aided labour for farming work.  It comes under three categories: Under the existing regulations governing minor employment schemes the wages are 4/6 per day of eight hours, and the number of days per week given to workmen employed on a rotational basis on these schemes varies according to the unemployment assistance.  The present regulations are as follows: (1) A weekly scale of unemployment assistance of 13/6, which covers five days per week; (2) a weekly scale of unemployment assistance of not less than 10/- and not more than 13/-, which covers four days per week; (3) a weekly scale of unemployment assistance of 9/6 or under, which covers three days per week.  Now, from this it will be seen that the cost to the State of providing employment for the three classes already indicated is as follows: (1) five days at 4/6, £1 2s. 6d.; (2) four days at 4/6, 18/-; (3) three days at 4/6, 13/6. That is what it costs, and that money is spent on work that is not reproductive work.  Now, here is the scheme to which my council gave very serious consideration and for which it finally voted.  The present recognised minimum agricultural wage is 30/- a week. Assuming the employment to be fulltime farm work, the scheme is that, taking 30/- per week as the present <Col N="414" /> agricultural wage, the wages to be paid to these workers, in the three categories, would be as follows: (1) 22/6 to be paid by the State and 7/6 by the farmer&mdash;thus guaranteeing the 30/- minimum; (2) 18/- to be paid by the State and 12/- paid by the farmer&mdash; again guaranteeing the 30/- minimum; and (3) 13/6 to be paid by the State and 16/6 by the farmer, also amounting to the minimum of 30/-.</P>
    <P>Now, look at the effect of that.  It would at once release a very considerable number of the unemployed and put them to reproductive work on the farms, and of course it would certainly reduce the numbers of young men who have been in the unquestionably demoralising situation of hanging around at the street corners of our towns or at the crossroads for indefinite periods.  If the 30/- was to be made up by the Government paying 22/6, 18/-, or 13/6, as the case might be, according to the three categories, all that kind of thing would be obviated.  I want it to be clearly understood, however, that that scheme had nothing to do with those who are employed regularly on the land, and that the people whom I have in mind would be used exclusively for improvement works on the farm.  The scheme was simply one that would bring about a change in the outlook of these young men who are wandering about, many of whom, as a result of present conditions, are merely harassing the whole State and are no good to anybody.  I have been discussing this matter with many farmers, and I believe that if the Minister could rise up here now and tell us, and if it could be proclaimed from the housetops and appear in the Press to-morrow, that he would give a guaranteed price to the farmers of the country for the 2,000,000 acres for which no guaranteed price is in the offing, the response would be a most extraordinary evidence of the spirit and the desire of the agricultural people of this country&mdash;that spirit of patriotism which, through the whole history of this country, has characterised their actions in times of need.</P>
    <P>The agricultural people of this country do not know where they are at <Col N="415" /> the moment.  Senator Baxter told you that in the North of Ireland they have £2 an acre for ploughing, but they have no such thing in these parts of the country.  He told you that they have 1/2 a gallon for new milk in the North of Ireland, whereas, in the South, it varies from 4d. to 5d. a gallon, which is not even sufficient to meet the cost of production. Only a few days ago I saw a man pay 7/6 for a shovel that, ordinarily, would cost about 10d.  That is a terrible condition for agriculture to be in. It means a disappearing race and means that the whole system of agricultural economics is upside down. There is a guaranteed price for wheat, but it must be remembered that this is the middle of February and it must also be remembered that, as a result of the geological nature of the land in some parts of this country, the fields are very difficult to clean.  The soil is muddy and cement-like and becomes so congested that it is practically a moral and physical impossibility to prepare it and cultivate it for the production of such an essential food as wheat.  I remember giving evidence before a commission in 1928 and I pointed out that, although I had many acres of wheat, if one were to go about four miles, due south-west, one would find that the cultivation of the soil for wheat there would be the last word in tyranny and slavery because of the muddy and cemented nature of the soil. As somebody pointed out on the last occasion on which we were discussing a similar matter, the soil becomes so cemented as a result of the vagaries of our atmosphere.</P>
    <P>Even under strong pressure, the county council did not get in all the first moiety of the rates last year. Some of it they will get yet, but it shows the hardship there is in extracting money from the farmers because of the depressing conditions under which agriculture is labouring at present.  We had a budget two years, amounting to £12,000, for the payment of home help.  Last Friday we had a budget of £20,000 under that heading, and that does not allow the making of reasonable allowances for starving <Col N="416" /> women and children.  Appreciating its responsibility to the nation and to the Government the local council budgeted £15,000 for down-and-out farmers in order to give them money to buy seeds and produce crops. Farmers are asking: Will there be guaranteed prices?  Will there be a guaranteed price for oats?  They point out that some of the oats they grew a few years ago developed mildew when it could not be sold.  If the Minister got up and said that he would guarantee prices, and that the crop would not be left on the farmers' hands, after all their toil and labour, the response would be something that would surprise even the most sanguine Government followers, as well as those on other benches.  I appeal to him to do that.  It would be a great day's work.  He would be proclaimed a grand Minister, because he would be giving a sense of security to farmers, some of whom are now getting only 4d. a gallon for their milk.</P>
    <P>Look at the position concerning butter.  We were told at a dairy conference in Mallow a few months ago that that question would be reconsidered from another basis.  While there has been competition from New Zealand and other places for 50 years the Irish farmers were able to meet it, but to-day that competition is a serious menace to our foreign markets. While that is the position with milk and butter that farmers have to sell they find that the prices they have to pay are beyond their capacity.  If I had my bag, which is at present at the hotel, I could show the Minister and the House a bundle of documents that farmers got from the Land Commission. I do not like to be painting the picture so badly, but I want to have the position faced up to, and I appeal to the Minister to rise to the occasion and to let the farmers of the country know that their services, their toil, their energy and patriotism will not go unrewarded, and that they will get guaranteed prices for their crops.  Let them know that the Government will not fail them because their responsibility is colossal.  The facing up to that responsibility will be to the advantage to the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into the general question of agricultural policy or the general question of the economic policy we should pursue in our present emergency, but to advocate a policy which seems to me to be implicit in this motion, which has been so admirably and so comprehensively argued by Senator Baxter and others.  As I see it, the immediate object of this motion, if adopted, would be that our farmers would have confidence to go ahead, and to use every effort to produce all the food they could of the kind that we know will be needed for our own people and for animals on our farms during the next 12 months.  The reason why it is necessary to give the farmers that confidence is that some of them have been badly let down in the course of the last 18 months.  When the war began the immediate effect was that the price of all cereal products, including oats, went up to a very considerable level.  I think oats were selling at well over 20/- and perhaps 30/- a barrel in the autumn of 1939. Farmers in planning their tillage campaign for 1940 had these attractive prices in mind and went ahead with a considerable degree of confidence but, as I explained on a former occasion, the effect of the high prices of cereals on the producers of animal products, particularly of eggs and such like, was to make it unprofitable last winter to maintain so many poultry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a large-scale massacre of poultry, and what would be an important outlet for oats produced in 1939-40 disappeared by reason of the adjustment made in poultry producers' costs, which were too high in view of the prices they were getting for eggs. The result of that was that when the new crop came on the market in the <Col N="418" /> autumn of 1940, there were not enough poultry and other animals available to eat it, and stall feeding of cattle was known to be unprofitable. In reality, there was a surplus of oats in the home market, and the effect of that on the price of oats was that it fell in the autumn of 1940 to 12/-, 13/- or 14/- a barrel, or to nearly half the price it had been eight or nine months previously.  Many farmers, in poor circumstances, laid themselves out to grow large quantities of oats and other cereals in the year 1939-40, hoping thereby to establish their financial position by the prices which they confidently anticipated that they would get for oats in the autumn of 1940.  Owing to the events that happened oats, that they had counted on selling at 15/- or 20/- a barrel, they had practically to give away at from 12/- to 14/- a barrel and so they were badly &ldquo;stuck&rdquo;.  The Minister for Agriculture was very emphatic that farmers who held the oats, and did not sell for a miserable 12/- a barrel, would have reason to be glad that they did not sell, in view of the way national and international circumstances were developing.</P>
    <P>That advice I know was perfectly sound, but thousands of farmers were not in a position to take that advice either because they had no accommodation for the oats they produced, or they were in grave need of the money they would get by selling.  They were practically forced to sell for 12/- a barrel oats that they and many other people knew quite well would be worth 15/- to 20/- a barrel in a few months. I know that most of the oat crop produced by farmers is produced for consumption on their farms but a certain proportion of oats is, in normal times, produced as a commercial proposition, to be sold as a cash crop.  In view of the impossibility of the rest of our agriculture being able to buy cereal products like Indian meal and so on in the shops, it is of the most terrific importance that oats growers should be induced and persuaded to grow not only as much oats as they need for their own consumption, but sufficient oats to take the place of the oats which other farmers, poultry keepers, and so <Col N="419" /> on, will need to buy from them, seeing that they have no other sources now available from which they might buy cereal products.  In fact, unless our native agriculture can produce sufficient cereal products for animal feeding to replace the Indian meal which we can no longer buy, there will be a large scale destruction of the specialised poultry farms which are amongst the principal users of cereal products, and that will be a serious injury to our national agriculture.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Government last autumn to give a guarantee to farmers that they would be able to dispose of their oats at a reasonable price&mdash;and I think a reasonable price for oats last autumn would have been something well above the 12/- per barrel level at which much of it was sold&mdash;meant that in the case of as much as 5,000,000 cwts. of oats a price at least 4/- per cwt. less was accepted by the producers of oats than they should have got, and the loss of 4/- per cwt. on 5,000,000 cwts. of oats is equivalent to £1,000,000 taken out of the pockets of a very deserving and a very important section of our agricultural community.  In fact, it amounted, from their point of view, to a swindle.  They were swindled out of £1,000,000 or more of the income they should have received for the valuable service of producing oats in the season 1939-40.  These people were bitten last season and they do not want to be bitten again.  If we want to remove the feeling of lack of confidence from them, it is absolutely essential that we should fix some price for other cash crops besides wheat, including oats, and, if you like, potatoes, so that they will have the feeling that they may go ahead with confidence and that anything they have to sell will be saleable at a price which will compensate them for the trouble and expense of producing it.</P>
    <P>The immediate object of this motion is to restore confidence among a section of our farmers who have reason to feel uncertain and who have been let down in recent years.  But there is another and a very general aspect of the policy involved in this motion. <Col N="420" /> At the present time we are up against a national situation in which our industrial activity is faced with the possibility of very considerable restriction on account of the impossibility of obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials from abroad.  Now, a country can survive if one aspect of its economy has been forcibly contracted or restricted provided other aspects of its economy are enabled to expand.  We, ourselves, have shown examples of that in quite recent years. For example, in 1932, owing to circumstances into which I do not propose to enter at the moment, agriculture was severely restricted by external conditions.  At that time, I thought that something in the nature of an economic collapse was inevitable.  But I learned in the events which happened that it was avoided because the Government pursued a policy of rapid and vigorous industrial expansion, throwing the resources of our national credit into that expansion.  Although I considered that the circumstances under which that expansion was necessary were foolish, nevertheless I considered then, and I consider now, that the expansion of industry itself was wise and that only that rapid and vigorous expansion in another direction enabled this country to survive the very serious injury inflicted on it by the events of 1932 and the following years.  Our economy survived then because we were able to expand industry while agriculture was being restricted and contracted.  Nowadays, industry is being restricted and we must expand agriculture to balance that situation.  Otherwise the collapse which we managed to avoid in the circumstances of the economic war may be inflicted on us by the circumstances of the present international war.</P>
    <P>I should like this motion to be considered as a contribution to a very desirable co-ordination of economic policies.  The Minister who has honoured us with his presence at this debate is, of course, the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures and, I suppose, as his principal activity is in connection with the censorship, the blue pencil might be <Col N="421" /> regarded as the symbol of his high office.  In another capacity he is reported to have stated that if all the &ldquo;blue-pencil&rdquo; ships that sailed the seas were sunk, we here would be able to establish a higher standard of life for our people than if we continued to import supplies from abroad, and that was that.  Another Minister also stated that the import of necessary supplies was so essential to our economic life that we should think seriously of acquiring a merchant navy for ourselves, and I do not know whether he added a navy to defend that merchant navy.  At any rate, you had there a clear example of the Minister for Supplies advocating one economic policy and the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures advocating another economic policy which was its exact antithesis, so that there must be need for the appointment of another Minister who will co-ordinate the economic policies advocated by the Minister for Supplies and the economic policies advocated by the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.  Incidentally, a certain journalist who drew attention to that obviously serious discrepancy in economic policies had that reference blue-pencilled out of his article, doubtless by the Minister's Department, which seems to me to have been a very questionable use of his powers.</P>

      <P>With all due respect to the opinion of the Senator, I think there is need for co-ordination of economic policies and, in that co-ordination, agriculture should play a prominent part, and a policy of the kind advocated by Senator Baxter in this motion would, in my view, be an important step towards a desirable co-ordination of our economic policies in general.  We have to face the fact, as the Taoiseach stated the other day, that we are blockaded by two belligerents, although it might have been more accurate if he had said that one belligerent is taking effective steps to blockade both us and our neighbours, and the other belligerent is blockading us in the sense that he does not allow as much supplies to reach our shores as we would like to get.  But, at the same time, you must recognise that we can get nothing at all except by the goodwill of that other belligerent. That merely is a matter of detail.  But I think the Taoiseach might have added that there is a third nation, neutral like ourselves, which is also in a sense blockading us, and that third nation is the United States of America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often wondered why the neutrality of the United States of America should be regarded as so virtuous from the point of view of British propaganda, whereas our neutrality is regarded as anything but virtuous. That is by the way.  It does seem to me to be the case that one of the principal reasons why we cannot import necessary supplies for our agriculture, and other purposes, is the fact that the American neutrality law will not allow American ships to come within the war zone: that it will not allow ships to deliver cargoes in our western ports at Galway and Limerick.  It would be desirable, from the point of view of our agricultural readjustment, that we should be able to import supplies of agricultural manures in American ships and land them on our west coast ports.  The matter, I think, is so serious and important in connection with these and other economic problems of ours, that we should make serious representations to the people <Col N="423" /> of that great country, and to our friends over there, to use their exertions so that our west coast ports, at any rate, may be open to the reception of American ships bringing necessary supplies to us.  With those necessary supplies, especially of artificial manures, we could face the problem of expanding our tillage effort with greater confidence.  Without them, we have to face it any way.  We have to do our best to get all the food we can out of the soil, even if in doing so we cause some damage to the fertility of that soil.  But, at the same time, we ought to try to make the best of all our circumstances, domestic and international, and if anything can be achieved by representations to the country that I have suggested, then I advocate that something of the kind should be attempted.</P>

Senator Baxter usually does, but I think that on this occasion he has deceived Senator Johnston to some extent.  The farmers in this country are in a pretty healthy state at the moment.  They are not rich, and they will never be millionaires. They can get along and get something for their money.  At least, they can get boots and clothes and cement.  If Senator Johnston's policy had been in operation during the last ten or 12 years they could get nothing, because we would have no industrial products to give them in return for what they produce themselves.  In regard to every single industry that was started here during that period, Senator Johnston, and people like him, said that it was going to be an utter catastrophe for the economy of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>What we, as a Government, have been trying to do during the last ten or 12 years is to build up both agriculture and industry, so that the farmers and the industrial community will be able to exchange their products between them, and thus be able to maintain a fairly decent standard of life.  We tried to warn the people against the precise situation that has arisen at the moment, wherein they would find themselves without boots and clothes, if they did not produce boots and clothes themselves, and without bread if they did not produce their own wheat.  We pointed out to them that the false price economy, which Senator Johnston and those who think with him are so fond of expounding from time to time, is really false economics and not true economics.  What we want is a balanced industry, producing from our own soil&mdash;where we can control their production&mdash;all the things that we want, both of industrial products and agricultural products, so as to give our people a fair standard of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnston referred to something I said in the Dáil to the effect that if ships ceased to come here we could still increase the standard of life.  I said that we could do that in a few years' time if we used our brains.  But if our attitude were the attitude of Senator Johnston, then, instead of increasing the standard of life here, we would soon be starving. We could do nothing unless we could import what we required from outside. If the Senator's policy had been in operation, we would have gone on buying bacon from China because we could have got it at a cheaper price there, and so to-day we would be producing no bacon.  If his policy with regard to wheat had been adopted, then we would have continued buying wheat from the Argentine or some other country, and now we would have no wheat of our own.  Neither would we have any boots or clothes, because under his policy we would have gone on buying them from Czecho-Slovakia where we could have got them a few pence cheaper.  In fact, we would have nothing to-day if his policy had been <Col N="426" /> pursued.  But if we set ourselves to it we can produce a fairly decent standard of life here.  While the total closing down of imports here would have, in its immediate reaction, economic chaos, which would be followed by social chaos if not grappled with, the ultimate effect would be that the people would set themselves to produce all that they could out of their own resources.  Thanks be to goodness, the farmers are doing that in spite of Senator Johnston.  They are setting themselves to the task of producing all that they can from their own land in order to feed the people of this country.  Our industrialists are setting themselves to the task of trying to get substitutes for the raw materials which they formerly imported.</P>
    <P>There is no difference between what I said and what the Minister for Supplies said.  With regard to the reference to my speech about ships not sailing the seas and not bringing here the things that we could not easily manufacture, I was contesting there the point of view put forward in the Dáil by Deputy Hickey who said that in such a situation we would be helpless. The Deputy's attitude was much the same as that of Senator Johnston.  I said that we would not be helpless, and that if we put our brains to it we would get through all right.  I hold to that. Now, to come back to the motion.</P>

      <P>But for the fact that I do not want to be going back too much on the past, I would give the Senator more compliments of the same kind. Senator Baxter's proposal is really a worse solution of our difficulties than a guaranteed price for our products.  If he reads his motion again, he will see that what he wants us to do is to give a blank cheque to all the farmers to scrape the soil, sow something and, no matter whether they tend it or not, we will see that they suffer no loss and that everything the farmer produces, whether he does it efficiently or not, and whether he takes any care of it, will be purchased at a price which will not involve him in any financial loss. <Col N="427" /> A guaranteed price per cwt. for oats, bacon, butter or potatoes would be much preferable to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator in his motion says that, in the absence of guaranteed minimum prices per cwt. or per unit of a product, he wants this other thing, which I say is very much worse.  That, however, is only by way of criticism of the detail of the motion.  I think that a better guarantee than the guarantee which the Senator proposes in the motion, or guaranteed fixed minimum prices for products, is the general guarantee that could be given to the farmers that we here, of all Parties, mean to see to it that, for the future, we are not going to be dependent on imported cereals, or anything else, so far as we can ensure that position.  The Senator held up as something to be followed a declaration by the British Minister of Agriculture that, during the war and for one year after, farmers would get guaranteed minimum prices.  The Minister for Agriculture and the other members of this Government have said that if our policy were to go through, not alone for the duration of the war and one year after, but for ever, so far as we could do it, the farmers would get such a price as would enable them to produce what the people require at a fairly decent price.</P>

      <P>There are some people who, if we started to discuss in an open assembly here what would be a fair price for wheat, would make a demand for 50/- knowing, as I know, and as Senator Baxter knows, that 40/-, in all our circumstances, is a very decent price.  The Senator threw out the millions very generously to-day, but I do not think he would throw them out quite so freely if the Minister for Finance were taxing us all in order to get those millions.  He slung around the millions for agricultural products, but I say that if you take the present price level of agricultural products, or even the price level of agricultural products back in the autumn of 1940, they were all right, and that the farmers could get along&mdash;they are not going to be millionaires but they could get a decent standard of life&mdash;on the prices they got for their agricultural products last autumn.  That is not to say that I at all approve of farmers getting 14/- or 15/- a barrel for their oats&mdash;and 12/6 as some of them got&mdash;from the merchant and that oats later being sold at 25/- a barrel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Senator take a note of his question and deal with it afterwards.  Where are we to go in regard to that?  Is the Government to guarantee everything and do everything for the farmers, including even the things the farmers should do for themselves?  The proper policy for the <Col N="429" /> farmers&mdash;those of them who can do so &mdash;is to hold over their oats crop, instead of flooding the market with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The rats will not eat it if the farmers know a little more than the Senator knows about it.  There are a good number of farmers in this country who are pulling Senators' legs about rats eating the wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose rats do not eat wheat in the Minister's country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>They would if they could get at it, but I would not let them get at it.  The proper policy, first of all, for the individual farmer, is to hold and store, either in threshed or unthreshed form&mdash;whichever suits his particular circumstances.  It is not going to cost him much to store it in the stack and the rats will not get at it, as Senator Baxter knows.  A couple of pence will stop that. Secondly, the farmers should co-operate to store and relieve the pressure on the individual.  Take the situation in Campile, County Wexford.  There should be an organisation like the organisation there in every parish in the country, and when the farmers of County Louth, of my constituency, come grumbling to me because they sold grain several years in the autumn and harvest time which went up in price later on, I say that the only way to deal with that position is to co-operate to store, as they are doing in Campile.  If we are going to make any progress in agriculture, or in any other type of activity, we must have that local co-operation.  We cannot throw it all back on the Government. The Government cannot deal with 3,000,000 units, but they can deal with the representatives of a few hundred properly organised agricultural cooperatives who would undertake to use their own initiative and brains in their own localities to do what is required for the betterment of their own neighbours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.  Our people have energy and initiative when they are stirred up, and I think that what has happened since last autumn should stir them up.  The fact that farmers sold oats at 12/6 and that it is now 25/- or more, and sold barley for 20/- which is now 30/- should stir them up to do what they can on their own farms, to store next year's grain crop for a few months and, secondly, to co-operate in organising storage and credit facilities for farmers in their neighbourhood who cannot store. Senator Johnston made a statement as to the price for oats in the autumn of 1939, and if all his information is as accurate as that statement, I do not think much of it.</P>

The fact is that the price of oats in autumn 1939 was around 11/6 or 12/6.  The Senator went on to talk for five or ten minutes, basing his case on the drop in the price of oats from 28/- or 30/- per barrel to half that price in the following year.</P>

I should like to pick the best of everything which happens in the world and apply it here, if it could be done, but let us not be unfair about what has been done here for the farmers.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator said that, in the North, the farmers had a guaranteed price for the whole of their oat <Col N="432" /> crop.  I am informed that they have a guaranteed price for only one-sixth of the oat crop.  They had an advantage in the price of milk and in the guaranteed price and the subsidy for potatoes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>And £2 an acre for ploughing.  They had also an advantage in respect of poultry products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As against that, I could take Senator Baxter to some farmers in the Six Counties who would tell him that it is not much use to get a guaranteed price for bacon when the pig population has to be cut down by two-thirds.  The position regarding hens is similar to that of the pigs.  The farmers there cannot get feeding stuffs although they have the guaranteed prices.  The Minister for Agriculture has, I think, gone as far as is necessary or desirable to meet what the Senator has in mind&mdash;that is, that the farmer should have a fair indication that there would be stability in regard to this year's prices.  The Minister, speaking publicly on a couple of occasions recently, outlined his policy and said that, even if the emergency were to pass next autumn, arrangements would be made to restrict the importation of feeding stuffs until such time as the home grain stocks, for sale as cash crops, would be exhausted.  Farmers understand what the Minister means by that.</P>
      <P>Over the past number of years a general indication of Government policy was forthcoming.  We had the admixture scheme.  On a couple of occasions, when the admixture scheme seemed about to fail, the Government stepped in and pinned oat prices to a certain minimum limit.  The admixture scheme was designed to absorb in the grain brought in for feeding stuffs the home-grown grain for sale and to do that at a fair price.  In my opinion, the indication given by the Minister for Agriculture that he will not allow foreign grain to be imported beyond the extent necessary to make up our deficiency in feedings stuffs is a sufficient guarantee for our farmers that if they sow they will be able to harvest at a reasonable price.</P>

      <P>The Government's past policy in that regard is the best guarantee the farmers can have for the future.  What happened in regard to milk, butter, eggs, poultry, and bacon in recent years?  For the last eight or nine years, these products were held above the world market price.</P>

      <P>That is all right for public consumption, but the fact is that they were held well above the world market price.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>From the course of the debate, it would seem as if the motion were purposely vague.  The motion refers to &ldquo;surplus produce&rdquo;. What would Senator Baxter regard as &ldquo;surplus produce on the lands of farmers&rdquo;?  It would be simple enough to calculate the amount of oats and barley held, but is it the Senator's intention to widen the scope of the motion so as to include the stock fed with the barley and oats and other products of the land?  You would want a competent auctioneer, like Senator Madden, to compute the financial loss entailed if these products were to be retained on the farm, or to calculate the compensation due to a farmer for loss involved by having to comply with the terms of the order.  I do not say that Senator Baxter so intended it, but the motion seems to me to be one which would facilitate the scamp farmer&mdash;by that I mean the farmer who would scamp the Tillage Orders. That scamping did take place during the last war, when there was compulsory <Col N="434" /> tillage, and its effects are still to be seen through the country, where land was tilled simply to comply with the order, and in some cases was not seeded at all.  The motion, as framed by Senator Baxter, seems to be safeguarding these people, so that if they put in a mock crop of lea oats, and it was a failure, they could seek compensation under the terms of the motion.</P>
      <P>Such a thing, if it were allowed to be done, would be disastrous for the country.  I think I can say with the Minister that the tillage farmer, the dual-purpose tillage and dairyman, that I am used to is not in a bad state and is quite competent to increase his tillage and to use any surplus produce or surplus cereals for the purpose of producing food for the people.  I cannot see that there would be any surplus remaining to which the terms of this resolution would apply. The two staple products of the soil that we require for feeding the human subject are already guaranteed.  The price of sugar beet is guaranteed; the price for wheat is guaranteed; but these were guaranteed despite the hostility of all the people in opposition to the present Government.  People have said that they would be found dead before they would co-operate with the wheat policy.  I must congratulate Senator Baxter to-day on his complete turn over to the Fianna Fáil policy. He has spoken to-day so much of what we people have spoken from year to year about producing our own requirements to feed our own people and to buy as little as we can from outside. Senator Baxter has spoken all that in favour of this resolution here to-day, but his supporter, Senator Johnston, took quite the opposite view.  I repeated the question I asked him: Did he not recommend to the Minister here the policy of closing down the beet factories and flour mills and buying all from outside?  He did, in my hearing and the hearing of Senators here.  To-day would he stand for that and face the people of this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not recommend the closing down of all the beet factories.  I said 50 per cent. of them might well be shut down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="435" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator said practically all the beet factories and the majority of the flour mills should be closed down and we should concentrate on a few big flour mills.  If that is the economic policy the Senator adopted then, and if a different thing is suggested to-day, I think more coordination is required between Senator Johnston and Senator Baxter than between the Minister and the people on this side of the House at any rate. The question was raised of growing oats as a cash crop.  In the portion of the country I come from it is not grown as a cash crop.  It is grown to feed the animals of the farm, and they are the produce for which you would require to have the guaranteed price, if possible.  I cannot see how that could possibly be brought in under this resolution.  Possibly we would have surplus produce on hands all right, but it would not be surplus produce in the form of oats; it would be surplus produce in the form of animals fed on the oats, for instance, pigs and poultry.  In that case we would require actuaries going around the country and more officials to calculate who was going to have the terms of this resolution applied in his favour and to compute where the financial loss was.  The great danger I see in it is that such a thing would allow for &ldquo;scamp&rdquo; tillage without the production of a decent crop.  A farmer could claim that his crop entailed him in financial loss.  That would be a disastrous thing if it were allowed to materialise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to some of the remarks of Senator Madden.  He again mentioned the fact that I said Limerick farmers were lazy.  People did object to that statement of mine. If I said half the things the Senator said about Limerick farmers I think I would be ashamed, but I know in Limerick as well as elsewhere there are good industrious farmers and there are lazy farmers.  If some of them object to my saying they were lazy, I am sorry.  I think they have greater reason to object to statements of Senator Madden and other Senators&mdash; to Senator Counihan when he described the farmers of the country as <Col N="436" /> mendicants.  I come from farming stock and I object to farmers being called mendicants.  We are a proud race.  Senator Baxter referred to it&mdash; or some Senators&mdash;saying that farmers do not like to advertise their difficulties to one another.  But to get up here publicly and describe them as mendicants is something to which we all ought to object.  That is all I wish to say on this resolution.  It seems simple, as I say, at first, but I see its implications are more far-reaching than I anticipated at the start.</P>

      <P>May I at this stage interrupt on a point of explanation and a question of fact?  I only want to put before the House the facts with regard to the price of oats in regard to which the Minister disputed the accuracy of my memory.  I have looked up the figures in the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> since then and I would like them to go on the official record. In September, 1939, old oats were 7/10 a cwt. and new oats 8/10; in January, 1940, oats were 12/1 per cwt.; in February, 13/3; in March, 13/6; in April, 12/9; in May, 12/3; in June, 11/3; in July, 10/4; in August, old oats, 10/- and new oats 8/1; in September, old oats 10/4 and new oats 8/5.  These are the facts.  You can interpret them yourselves.</P>

We heard from both sides of the House here&mdash;because there are two sides to this House&mdash;statements in relation to agriculture of a most contradictory character.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather amazing to me, not being a farmer, to find skilled farmers ranged up on both sides of the House with absolutely opposite views as to the economy of farming. I think it is a pity that a spirit of co-operation has not been cultivated among the farming community, has not <Col N="437" /> been encouraged by the Government among that community so that those grave differences of opinion would not arise in regard to agricultural problems. Attempts have been made before this Government ever came into power to have such organisation brought about, to foster a spirit of co-operation among the farming community. They have failed.  They have failed for want of the co-operative spirit on the part of our people.  I believe until that co-operative, communal spirit, if you like, is introduced into the country and influences all who are connected with agriculture, both the farmer and the farm worker, we will have no success with our agriculture in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two points in reference to the resolution, the main principles of which I should like to support. There is the difficulty of finding out exactly what surplus material might be on the hands of the farmers. It would be hard to distinguish what might be a genuine surplus of corn from what might be only a faked surplus. I do believe that a use could be found for that corn on practically every farm.  If the crop is not grown in exorbitant or excessive quantities, a use could be found for it by walking the corn off the land in the form of animal flesh, or even, as they do in Senator Baxter's country, carting it off in the shape of carcases.  There has been talk about where the demand is to come from.  The demand exists amongst two-thirds of our people in this country. One has only to study the statistics of the malnutrition of our people to see where the demand exists for the food that is grown in our country.  Even in England to-day according to recent records one-third of those who presented themselves for the service of the country could not be accepted owing to malnutrition.  The same condition exists in the land of the free and the home of the brave&mdash;America.  Food is being carted away, dumped into the rivers, burned and destroyed, while people remain unfed.  There are about 110,000 people on our unemployment register to-day, and you can multiply that at least by four, I should say, to get at the number of people who are <Col N="438" /> suffering from malnutrition, because there is scarcely one of those on the unemployment list or scarcely one of those on the dole or on home assistance who is not suffering, or whose families are not suffering from malnutrition.  It is idle to talk of a surplus of corn, or a surplus of barley, while you have our people crying out for that surplus, but cannot reach it because they have not the wherewithal.</P>
    <P>To my mind the whole system is definitely wrong, and until the system is changed you will never have comfort, you will never have peace.  You will be ever hovering on the brink of revolution in this country until that system is changed.  The farmers have their difficulties, but their trouble, too, arises from the same cause.  The trouble does not come from laziness or lack of knowledge on the part of the farmer.  It comes from the fact that although a demand for the food he produces exists in the bodies of our people here at home, those people cannot buy it and it is left on the farmers' hands.  I would support the resolution if I thought it were practicable, if I thought it would be any help to the farmers, but at the present moment I believe it is neither practicable nor helpful to the farmers.  But I would say to the Government, although we are living in a period which some people might say is not suitable for the framing of plans for the future, that even now at the eleventh hour they should set up some machinery to investigate the cause of the depression in the agricultural community, of this flight from the land, and of this disinclination on the part of the workers to remain on the land.  Some machinery should be set up, and that instantly, to lay plans for the future, to lay plans for the coming year.  I do not believe that much could materialise from any plans that could be made at present, but that should not prevent the Government from setting up some court of investigation into the position of agriculture.  I would appeal especially to the farmers to group themselves together in the counties throughout Ireland where the economic conditions of the farmers are similar, to get the most capable instruction from experts <Col N="439" /> in the business, from professors, if you like&mdash;even calling in Senator Johnston to give them a hand&mdash;and to set up some kind of machinery to plan a sound agricultural economy.  Until that is done I am afraid there is not much hope for agriculture in this country.</P>

      <P>It is not so many years ago since this country was flooded with foreign agricultural produce. The Irish farmer himself purchased American bacon and, I believe, in some cases even Chinese bacon. Very often he bought oats from the Argentine, flour from southern Europe, and sugar from Czecho-Slovakia.  At the same time we were boasting that we were the finest agricultural country in the world; that we had the finest land and that we had the finest people. When we set out to make a change we were called rainbow-chasers, idealists and everything else.  Now the position is that those of us who are living in the towns have for some years past been paying a price far above the world price for the butter we are eating. We have been paying a price over <Col N="440" /> the world price for the sugar we use, and we are doing this because we have subsidised our farmers.  We have given our farmers a price, as the Minister stated a moment ago, over and above the world price for certain of their products.  I know Senator Baxter's answer to all this.  He will tell me that even that price does not give the farmer the cost of production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>We had an argument about the price of oats a short time ago, and the Minister told us that the farmers were foolish to sell their oats at 10/- or 12/6 a barrel; that they should have held that oats.  I will say this for some of the people who sold that crop: they had to sell it; they could not afford to keep it.  Many of the farmers with whom oats are a cash crop could not afford to hold that crop. They had to dispose of it in order to pay their debts in the towns, and many of them had not the buildings in which to store it.  The Minister pointed out that the obvious remedy for that was co-operation in farming.  We have had co-operation in farming for quite a number of years in this country, but what sort of co-operation have we had? We have had co-operation to drive the town traders out of existence.  Instead of co-operating, as the Minister pointed out that they should have done, entirely in their own industry, they went into competition against the people in the towns.  If that goes on, the end of it will be that the towns will cease to exist altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Genuine co-operation would be something along the lines laid down by the Minister: co-operation in the storage of surplus products, holding them off the market until there would be an economic price for them; co-operation entirely in relation to their own industry, and not the type of co-operation which may tend to destroy the opportunities of their fellow-countrymen in the towns.  If farmers were to co-operate along those lines and provide storage for surplus products, instead of constantly crying to the State <Col N="441" /> to save them and to keep paying them an artificial price for the foodstuffs of the Irish people, it would be much more desirable.  People in the towns are paying an artificial price for many foodstuffs, and at the same time the means of livelihood are being taken away from many of those people.  I agree with Senator Cummins that the thing is nonsensical.  Some form of co-operation between the people in the towns and the country should be arranged, so that a chance of living would be guaranteed to both sides.</P>
    <P>I am as keen as anyone to give the farmer a chance to live and to meet his costs of production, but at the moment it is too one-sided.  If there is to be fair play, it should be applied to all. There should be fair play for the traders in the towns and the unemployed in both town and country.  Until we get co-operation of that type, then it will not be fair co-operation; it will not be good in the national interest or in the interest of the farmer.  This habit of constantly calling for State aid and assistance is undignified, to say the least of it.  The farmers are an independent, upright body, and I am sure many of them resent this constant calling out for State assistance, this constant cry &ldquo;For God's sake come and save us, or we cannot survive&rdquo;. How do farmers who have to produce oats and other crops in other countries survive, the farmers, say, in Germany or Czecho-Slovakia?  How do they live?</P>
    <P>I do not want to drive the Irish farmer back to the standard of living of 100 years ago, but I must protest against the constant reiteration that the farmer is the only oppressed man in this country.  There are others hard pressed and they have not grumbled much at subsidising the farmer and paying more for butter and sugar than they might pay if they were to purchase it from abroad.  These people are not getting the consideration they deserve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, what was almost the most interesting part of this very interesting debate was the theory that underlay it.  It is a pleasant change to find the Government treated as a sort of fairy godmother <Col N="442" /> instead of being an ogre, interfering in everything and steadily evolving in the process into totalitarianism.  We are now presented with a Government that is going to be a fairy godmother, but only, I am afraid, to one class. We are all farmers, or the second generation of farmers; there is farming blood in most of our veins, and what is good for the farmer, we know, is good for the whole country.  But the Government cannot afford to subsidise all the products of the farmers at the expense of other sections of the community.  To my mind the theory of good Government is that those who compose the nation should be brothers and sisters and the Government should be a sort of council of elders elected by the people to look after everybody's interests and if they are too kind to one portion it may be at the expense of the others.</P>
      <P>The question of cheap food comes into it.  If you pay a big price to the farmers the townspeople will have to pay big prices for the farmers' produce and in that way the farmers will have to be subsidised at the expense of the people.  It is bad enough for the unemployed to have the price of food as high as it is, but if it is going to go up steadily, I do not know what the position will be; it will be simply appalling. The price of potatoes and bacon is high and it is very hard on poor people in the towns.  I am in close contact with people in Galway, and I know that the burden is almost unbearable. We must bear in mind, when we ask the Government to do anything, that they have to take into consideration the interests of the people as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two points that arose during the discussion on which I would like to make some comment.  The Minister pointed to Campile as an example of what co-operation should aim at in this country.  I am glad he talked about co-operation, and that Senator Goulding emphasised the lines on which co-operation should be developed.  It might be well if we got an assurance from the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures that the storage of grain will be so safeguarded that if there are any bombing attacks&mdash;Campile brings that <Col N="443" /> to our minds&mdash;our food supplies will be well protected.  That is one of the things we have to guard against.  There is no use in producing the things if a few bombs will destroy them.  If there are stores built for the storage of grain it would be prudent to see that they are built in such a way that they will afford the maximum protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I could not support this motion in its present form; I do not think there has been enough consideration given to its drafting.  It would be a most dangerous thing to start on an indiscriminate and reckless policy of guaranteeing prices.  Such a policy must necessarily lead to a vicious circle of rising wages all round, and that can only end in a dangerous measure of inflation.  In such circumstances the working classes as well as others would unquestionably suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one aspect of the problem that I am surprised Senator Baxter overlooked, and that is the question of technical efficiency in our farming methods.  I am sure the Senator will agree that our technique is extremely backward.  If one examines, as far as one is able, the agricultural methods in a country like Denmark, it will be realised that the production per acre there is enormously greater than ours. Not only is the technique of the individual farmer much better, but the methods of marketing are better and the whole question of co-operation is much more efficient.  I have always felt that if we developed our technique it would be far better for the ordinary agricultural worker and for the farming industry generally than if we started off on an indiscriminate and ill-considered policy of merely raising prices and making things on the surface appear easier.  I am afraid the danger of an indiscriminate guarantee of prices is that it would postpone still further that time of technical improvement which in our system of agriculture is long overdue.  I do not want to be censorious about farmers, but I think that we all agree that their <Col N="444" /> methods could be much improved.  One has got to look only at the figures in regard to milk production and the large number of uneconomic cows in the country.  That alone tells a very unsatisfactory tale.</P>
    <P>There is only one further observation I should like to make, that I do not see how guaranteed prices can be fairly arrived at.  The one danger of a guaranteed price is that the price is generally fixed at a level to suit the most inefficient unit in the industry. In the last war, when it was necessary to fix the price of bread, you had a price fixed to enable the least efficient producer to keep his head above water, and that price gave unduly high profits to the more efficient units in the industry. The moral is to avoid fixing prices, and if you must have control of prices to operate it slowly and with great care.  I do feel that the Government should in all these years have enforced a costings system which would have enabled them to arrive at the true costs of agricultural production. At one time the Government had machinery which would have enabled them to operate such a system, but they abandoned it in a spirit of what, I considered, very false economy.  If the fundamental figures in regard to production are not available, it is almost impossible to arrive at a fair price of any commodity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODwyer" hpid="Mr. O'Dwyer Mr. O'Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Baxter in moving this motion stressed a very important point when he said that there was altogether too much speculation in regard to agricultural products in this country.  I think that speculation which leads to fluctuation in the price of agricultural produce is a great evil. Farmers naturally look for a guaranteed price for all their crops, having in mind the circumstances which they had to face at the end of last year.  It should be remembered that a guaranteed price does not necessarily mean an exorbitant price.  It is really a price that is mutually fair to the farmer and to the consumer.  But if the price of the farmers' raw material is not controlled, it may well happen that a price which is fair to the farmer may be regarded as unfair to the consumer.  For <Col N="445" /> example&mdash;the price of oats last harvest was about 9d. or 10d. per stone.  In many counties, farmers had no means of storing their oats, and they had no option but to dispose of the crop at any price they could get once it was threshed.  In other counties where land was poor, the farmers had to grow oats instead of wheat in order to comply with the tillage requirements, and they threw their oats on the market immediately after the harvest.  The result was that the oats was sold at 9d. or 10d. per stone last October and November. To-day, the worst class of oats on the market cannot be bought at less than 2/- or 2/3 per stone.  That shows that there has been great speculation. Such speculation has affected not only the farmer who needs oats for seed and feeding purposes, but the townsman and the consumer generally, because the price of bacon and poultry products has had to be increased to meet the increase in the price of oats which is largely used as feeding for pigs and poultry.  The great evil of speculation, therefore, affects the consumer equally with the farmer, and it is an evil that should be tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, wheat was sold last harvest at the guaranteed price of 1/9 per stone.  That was a fair price because the year had been a good one.  What has happened since?  The farmer who sold his wheat at 1/9 a stone, and who now needs wheat for seed purposes, is asked to pay 3/5 or 3/6 for seed wheat. Even for home-grown, cleaned wheat he has to pay about 3/- per stone.  In fact there is no price fixed at all.  He has to pay anything he is asked.  The effect of that is that the guaranteed price of 1/9, which was fair last harvest, now turns out to be inadequate having regard to the price which is at present demanded from farmers who have to purchase wheat.  Another aspect of the matter is that a farmer cannot purchase anything in the line of feeding stuffs less than 2/- per stone at present.  If the farmers had held their wheat last harvest there would be the danger to-day that that wheat, which is so necessary for human consumption, would have to be fed to pigs and cattle owing to the present price of feeding stuffs.  It would be <Col N="446" /> as cheap for the farmer to feed his wheat to his stock as to try to purchase other feeding stuffs.  That is the great danger of speculation.  It is responsible for much of the scarcity which is being experienced with regard to other foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>The question is what should be done to counteract speculation?  For one thing I feel that prices should be controlled. It is not so much a question of guaranteeing prices as the question of the stabilisation of prices all round. The price of butter has been controlled for some years.  The price paid to the farmers was regarded as inadequate but at any rate the farmer knew what he was getting.  The price of butter to the merchant and to the retailer was also controlled and the price to the consumer remained practically steady for many years.  In the height of the season, just as to-day when a great scarcity has arisen, the price of butter remained unchanged.  The situation has been different in regard to other products mentioned here.  In order to bring about stabilisation of prices, it is necessary that the Government should control imports of everything in the line of grain and seeds and that there should be a general levelling up of prices so that a reasonable proportion would be maintained between the price of grain and the price of feeding stuffs. To do that, all supplies should pass through one channel and everything should be regulated.  I am not a very enthusiastic supporter of Government interference but, at a time of crisis such as the present, when the country is faced with the prospect of great scarcity in certain commodities, half measures are more dangerous than anything else.  If there is to be any control it should be a rigid system of control as there are always people who are ready to take advantage of scarcity to increase their own profits.  I say that what has been done with regard to the butter industry to eliminate unreasonable profits, should be applied to the whole of agricultural production as far as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken about co-operation. Co-operation would solve many of the farmers' difficulties and, for one thing, it would eliminate profiteering. It would improve the technique <Col N="447" /> of farming in the country, a matter which has been commented upon by Senator Sir John Keane, and it would bring about many other advantages. At the present moment, however, there is no opportunity to apply co-operative methods to the disposal of farm produce, as it would take a year or two years to get such a system working.  There is only one authority in the State at present that can control prices or bring about a stabilisation of prices, and that is the Government.  There is no use in preaching to the people, telling them that they should do this or that.  They have to be compelled and the Government alone can compel them.  You may have one section of the people who are patriotic enough to make sacrifices in the general interest in a time of crisis, but there are other sections who are narrow-minded and selfish and who will be slow to do their duty.  The Government alone has the power to regulate matters fairly.  I am in agreement that there should be guaranteed prices, as far as possible, for all the crops that may be produced, but I say reasonable prices.  The seeds and the raw materials also should be controlled, so that the farmer will know when he is producing what his return will be.  I wish to stress the point that there should be complete control over all imports and practically all sales and dealings in and relating to produce, so as to keep a level price to the consumer.</P>

      <P>I intend to vote for this motion.  Somebody talked about its being vague and indefinite, but to me it is abundantly clear and absolutely timely.  We are talking here all the time as if things were normal.  People are advocating the development of co-operation as the salvation of the farmer.  We knew that many years ago, but it is too late now to think of how co-operation may save the country.

      <P>A shortage in every possible item that is required for human use is occurring every day.  Before the position became really acute, there were over 120,000 unemployed on the live register.  These people could not buy very much.  These have been augmented every week by several hundreds. It does not need very great imagination or training in a university to have a knowledge of what economics along these lines mean.  We have a great number of people unemployed&mdash; they are accumulating every day. Industries are being run part-time or half-time, or closed entirely, and people are being thrown out of employment. The farmer&mdash;at the moment, at any rate&mdash;is in possession of the land; he is the man who can produce the lifeblood of the country, the food, and we have got to realise that, and treat him accordingly.  The motion simply asks that the farmer shall suffer no financial loss because he responds, to the best of his ability, to the call for more food.  Surely, that is a reasonable claim.  If a man is prepared to go out and do more than he has ever done before in the way of production, surely it is the duty of the community to see that he does not suffer any financial loss?  That is what is embodied in the motion, although the Minister could not see it; neither could Senator O'Donovan, who generally misses the point.  He compared it to what happened in the last war.</P>

We know that did not produce food.  In this case, the motion here only deals with it when it is produced and saleable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>And is surplus.  The Government are asked to take it over. Would not any sane or sensible Government encourage that attitude? Just throw your minds into the future, to the next harvest.  What will the position be in this country?  There is growing unemployment, the stagnation of industry, and the slowing up of the money markets generally.  That is what we have to think about now, and make provision for.  Surely, any sane Government would agree with the principle embodied in the motion on the Order Paper here.  When it comes to taking over, they should take over the whole lot, the whole output of the farmers of Ireland, and see that it is properly distributed, not relying on the economics of the financiers, as represented by Senator Professor Johnston and Senator Sir John Keane. The money values of to-day are entirely different from the money values at which the farmer will be repaid. Make no mistake about that.</P>
      <P>I do not pretend to be a prophet, but it must be obvious to anyone who gives any consideration to the matter that, by the time the next harvest comes around, the Government will be very happy to know that there is any surplus in the country and to take it over and deal with the unemployed people.  These are the reasons why I am in favour of the motion.  It is abundantly clear to me.  Any way we can find to encourage the farmers to produce food&mdash;whether we guarantee them or not&mdash;to ensure there is enough to save the people of this island, is part of our job.  What is claimed in the motion is only reasonable, to guarantee the farmer that he will be at no financial loss for any surplus he may produce in response to the call of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMacCabe" hpid="Mr. MacCabe Mr. MacCabe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on a previous occasion, on a similar motion, I do not agree that a guaranteed price should be given to the farmer to produce food.  Firstly, the number of farmers in this country who will benefit is very small&mdash;something under 40 per cent.  The remainder are those of small acreage, from 30 acres back, and surely they cannot claim to have a <Col N="450" /> surplus amount of food at the end of the year.  Instead of giving this guaranteed price, I had in mind three ways by which the farmer could be assisted. The first is to increase the price of what he produces on the farm.  If that price were increased, it would give encouragement to him to produce food and he would be repaid.  For instance, I understand&mdash;and I hope I may be wrong&mdash;that eggs are selling at the moment at 1/6 a dozen, and that there is a likelihood of their going lower in a week or two.  That will mean the end of the poultry industry here.  If eggs are sold at less than 1/6 a dozen, no farmer's wife can possibly raise them at that price.  Here again you have the benefit of the consumption of food&mdash;for instance, corn. Corn and potatoes represent the only food fed to poultry; no foreign food is used.  They are using those and getting good results, but paying from 2/- to 2/6 per stone for corn and anything around 1/- per stone for potatoes, there can be nobody who would think he could afford to sell eggs at 1/- or 1/6 a dozen.  I consider that such an increase in price would be a benefit, as it would increase the number of poultry and would absorb a lot of the grain produced.</P>
      <P>So far as butter is concerned, I admit that the Government did a good deal, for the last two or three years, to help the dairying industry.  Nevertheless, at the present cost of everything to the farmer, I think the price as it stands at present is not a price that will pay him, if he is to continue dairying in the future.</P>
      <P>I would say to the Minister that I think it should be the business of the Government to encourage dairying by increasing the price of butter for the coming season, and if the failure last winter to increase the price did not mean an increase in the price as between the retailer and the consumer, I have no hesitation in saying that the price to the farmer was certainly not sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Besides that, we have the question of pork.  Pork, as Senators know, is generally fed on potatoes and raised by small farmers.  As a rule, they are nearly all small farmers who raise <Col N="451" /> pork in this country.  Now, I have heard from men who have been engaged in that business for a number of years that they fear that the pork industry in this country is dead&mdash; absolutely killed for the present.  Week after week you have the case of young sows being sold from these farms because the farmers have no feeding stuffs for them.  Where there were three or four sows at one time on a farm, you now have one, because there is no feeding for these animals.  That was a great industry in this country, and practically a key industry to the small farmers of this country, and the great trouble is that there is no hope of reviving that industry unless something can be done by the Government. Of course, I admit that the Government cannot ask people in foreign countries to send over feeding stuffs to this country, as things are at present, but unfortunately the price paid for pork at the moment would not encourage our farmers to substitute other feeding stuffs for the imported commodities.  These are my three ways for dealing with what I believe would be the means of compensating the farmer, instead of giving him a fixed price for whatever he intended to produce this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are all agreed that it is a very advisable thing that the farmers should get all the help that it is possible to give them.  I also think that any impartial observer, looking back over Government policy in this country since 1931, when prices for every item of agricultural produce slumped, will have to admit that if there was one duty above all in which the Government did not fail it was in that of helping the farmer.  People may argue that the farmer did not get the benefit of all the help that was made available to him.  A good deal can be said for and against that, but there is one thing with which Senator Baxter and other people will have to agree if they examine the matter dispassionately, and that is that in the matter of asking the Government to do all they possibly can for agriculture, they are merely pushing an open door. For myself, I got a good deal of satisfaction <Col N="452" /> out of some of the statements that were made here to-day, because they showed that if we have unity already in one direction we are getting unity in another direction, and that a very desirable direction, too.</P>
      <P>Many of us have been preaching for a long time that the solution of the farmer's difficulties lies, a good deal, in his depending on his own land and efforts for the essentials of his industry, and that it is unwise for him to be depending on imports.  In effect, it has been suggested&mdash;I do not think I am misinterpreting Senator Baxter&mdash;that the wise thing for the farmer to do is to go on producing all the essentials for his industry&mdash;to go on producing, in effect, all the raw materials for his industry.  Having got agreement to that extent, I think we have progressed a good deal.</P>
      <P>Senator Baxter referred to the Agricultural Commission and to the inadvisability of suspending its activities, and he also referred to the need there is to-day for planning in agriculture. When the Agricultural Commission was suspended I think I would have agreed with the Senator that it would have been better to carry on and that we could have done useful work.  Looking back, however, over the last two or three months, I must say that I now agree it was a wise decision to suspend the commission. Owing to the uncertainty with which we are faced in every aspect of economic and social life, I fail to see to what extent the Agricultural Commission could properly make up its mind and recommend any worth-while, long-term plan.  Now, with regard to this question of guaranteed prices for certain agricultural products, I think there is a danger.  Like everybody else, I should like to see the farmer, the industrialist, and everybody who is engaged in production, being guaranteed as high a price as possible.  I am, though, afraid that the guarantee of prices for the particular products that were mentioned here this evening would not, ultimately, benefit the farmer.  If I thought for a moment that they would, I should certainly go all out in support of Senator Baxter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main things referred to <Col N="453" /> here this evening was the disposal of oats.  The great bulk of the oat crop produced in this country is produced, not for sale, but as a raw material for another branch of the agricultural industry. There is a certain amount of exchange between farmers and farmers, and between districts and districts, in regard to oats.  I am afraid, however, that to guarantee the farmer a price for the surplus oats, without very careful reference to costs of production, would mean that his farmer neighbour would suffer, because if you guaranteed the price to one farmer, automatically the price is raised, and the neighbour, who may be short of oats, must pay the high price.  If we agree that some farmers are entitled, in a selfish way, to get all they possibly can out of any situation, I believe that the guaranteeing of prices would, to say the least of it, leave agriculturists as a whole in no better position than they are at present.</P>

      <P>There is a good deal in what Senator Sir John Keane said, that when you give a guaranteed price you must fix the price so that the least efficient producer gets his cost of production.  We know that producers get, as a rule, the same price for similar commodities, irrespective of their individual costs of production.  The same will apply here, and so you set up a vicious circle; the people inside the margin reap undue profits.  That cannot be prevented unless you introduce some very rigorous system which I doubt our people would accept.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I have no hesitation in saying that products like beet and sugar, which are consumed <Col N="454" /> almost directly by the community, and which are so essential, should be aided by the guaranteeing of prices.  The products must be made available to all, and especially to the poor, and because of the poor they should be subsidised.  But oats, barley and other products find their way to market in a considerably altered form, the great bulk of them at any rate.  If one were to suggest that the price of the finished product, beef or eggs, for instance, might be controlled or guaranteed, then the question is one that might be more easily dealt with.</P>
      <P>I am going to read an extract from a speech that was made in the other House by a very severe critic of the Government.  If I made the same speech I would be accused of being pro-Government or perhaps of being a short-sighted economist.  The speech appears in the Dáil debates, November 7, column 532, and the following is the extract:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is a means not only of producing an immensely profitable export for our community, but also of contributing to the solution of the problem to which I will come shortly, that is, the problem of disposing of the oat crop.  No one in this country realised how much oats the hens consumed until we killed the hens.  It was then, and only then, that the farmers of this country discovered to what an extent their wives had been raiding the oat bin, and they discovered to their cost that their wives were the best economists, and that those daily raids on the oat bins paid a golden harvest in the sale of eggs for the benefit of the family as a whole.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of wisdom in that statement.  The Minister for Agriculture must have been pleased to hear it.  I think the solution of the difficulty in question is in the feeding of the oat crop to farm stock.</P>
      <P>Further on, the same Deputy referred to the difficulty of disposing of oats and, in giving another quotation from his speech, I make it rather in the form of a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Now we come to oats and barley, and that is a matter that is inextricably interwoven with the question <Col N="455" /> of the complsory tillage order. Let us realise the magnitude of this problem.  I remember being jeered at in this House last June when I told the Minister that he was going to have a very critical situation in regard to the oat crop if he did not take steps to dispose of the surplus of last year's production.  He said that was all nonsense; there would not be any trouble at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I give that quotation because it bears on the question of storage which has been mentioned.  I wonder if there was any difficulty in connection with the storage or the disposal of the oat crop. It has been pointed out some time ago in this House, that when it came to the ears of the Minister that some people were experiencing difficulty in disposing of the oat crop efforts were made to take it off the farmers' hands. I believe millers inserted advertisements asking for supplies of oats. There was no question in the advertisements about price, so that nobody could say that the price was too low.  Yet, I understand, no oats were offered.  I am not saying that there were not individual cases of hardship, cases where men were unable to dispose of oats at a reasonable price, or that there were not storage difficulties, but it seems these were the exceptions rather than the rule.</P>
    <P>I have another doubt with regard to the fixing of prices for crops like oats and barley, and it is this: that being crops that have been produced here consistently, they are, to an extent, easier to grow and to handle than wheat, so that there is a danger that they might oust to some extent, wheat, which would be very inadvisable at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>How are they easier to deal with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how they are easier to deal with, but I do know that people like the Senator have been telling us how difficult it is to grow wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I believe there is that danger.  I think that a farmer having a certain amount of stock, and having experience of crops like oats and barley for feeding purposes, and <Col N="456" /> also for cash purposes, will be able to estimate pretty accurately what he will require for their maintenance and for market, and that there is not much fear of there being any great surplus of these crops.  But if you guarantee a price for them, I believe there is a danger that it would interfere with the campaign to get the fullest supplies that we possibly can of what is absolutely essential&mdash;wheat.  For these reasons among others which I will not discuss now, I feel I cannot support the motion.  I was glad to hear certain other points mentioned during the debate.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that it is too late now to have co-operation as a means of helping out farmers in the present situation.  I do not believe that.  If the war, with all its misery and privations, brings home to our people the advisibility of co-operation, the price may not be too dear.  I am a firm believer in co-operation; I was glad to hear so many speakers refer to it.  I do not agree with Senator Foran that something might not be done about it immediately or in the near future; by next harvest, for instance, but without going into that now, I want to say how glad I am that there was so much goodwill shown towards the co-operative idea this evening.</P>
    <P>I suggest to practical men like Senator O'Callaghan, Deputy Beegan and others in the Beet and Grain Growers' Association, that that is a question they should take up.  Many countries on the Continent furnish evidence of the efforts that have been made to bring about co-operation between grain growers and millers.  I do not say that any one scheme in operation there would suit us.  But there have been a dozen or more schemes in operation on the Continent which would serve as a basis and a guide for our farmers and millers in the development of a co-operative system for dealing with this grain problem.  The only other thing I should like to say is that Senator Baxter should feel pleased that he got the assurance he got from the Minister to-day.</P>

      <P>There is no quibble in it.  There is no use in my arguing with Senator Baxter or any other Senator as to what the cost of production is or what a fair price now would be.  Senator Baxter might have brought his costs along and put them before us, or he might have gathered a series of accounts and put them before us so as to give us an indication of what he considers a fair price, everything considered.  It is hardly fair to ask me to say what I consider a fair price.  All I can say is that I believe the Government will do, as they have done, the best that is possible for the farmers.  If it were not for all they have done, in view of developments abroad and of the condition of the markets for many years past agriculture would be in a very sorry plight to-day.</P>

As I said, Senator Baxter, if he is in earnest and sincere about this, should be glad of the assurance that was given here to-day by the Minister to the farmers, that they will not suffer should it happen that there is a surplus of production.  In other words, the message of the Minister here was: &ldquo;Full steam ahead in regard to the production of every item of agricultural produce, and, as far as the Government is concerned, the farmers need not fear the results.&rdquo;</P>

Since I came in here I have heard five or six speakers, and, to be quite candid, while I am an agriculturist and can see the agricultural <Col N="458" /> point of view rather clearly, since I came in here I have got into a bit of a fog.  I noticed it coming up and growing pretty dense at Finglas.  I heard Senator MacCabe speaking about unemployment. I heard the last speaker, who is a cultured man, and whose shoes I would be very sorry to tread on&mdash;in fact, his shoes are too clean.  All those speakers who said that a guarantee should not be given to the farmers, and that they would vote against it, were backed by the arch-economist and nationalist, Senator Sir John Keane.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Baxter is in the bog with me; you are in the fog.  From statistics published within the last few days, it can be seen that in the last ten years unemployment has been greatest on farms from ten to 30 acres. Honestly, in this year of grace, I thought that we would hear of something being done better than we heard about from some Government supporters to-night.  I read a lecture this week by the Rev. Dr. Lucey, a distinguished agricultural economist, who said that something drastic would have to be done for agriculture, as it was down and out.  This year we are going to celebrate the 25th anniversary of 1916.  I appeal to the Government to look back over these 25 years and see what measure of increased happiness has come to the homes of the agricultural community.  Dr. Lucey referred to the change of Ministers nine or ten years ago.  As regards agriculture, the result was the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The foundation is hopelessly wrong. The wage fixed by the Agricultural Wages Board is something like 33/- or 35/-, certainly less than £2 per week, for the men who are to shoulder the spades and the shovels and work the ploughs to produce food for the entire community.  That is the minimum wage, but even that minimum cannot be paid, and unemployment is increasing. The whole community is depending on men who are receiving a wage of less than £2 a week.  The men who are supposed to pay that wage are not able to pay it.  The men cleaning the streets and lighting the lights in our <Col N="459" /> cities and towns receive 50/- and 55/- a week.</P>

I sold 500 barrels of oats at 14/- per barrel.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator said that oats was a saleable proposition last autumn.  As I have said, I sold oats at 14/- per barrel.  When I saw it going to 16/- per barrel I began to get windy and thought of buying some of it back. To-day oats is worth from 26/- to 27/- per barrel.  What about the man who could not afford to buy it back?  What about the man who had to sell his oats at any price he could get for it in order to pay his bills and meet his outgoings? One unfortunate case that I know of happened within half-a-mile of the Border.  A man there had land from me at £7 per acre.  His wheat missed and he put in oats.  He was a poor man.  He threshed it and wrote to me to say that he would pay me in a fortnight or so.  How did he get over his difficulty?  He threshed the oats on a Saturday night at 6 o'clock, and at half-past seven he had it in the Six Counties and got 19/6 per barrel for it. As a result, he was able to pay his bill. But what of the man who could not get his oats across the Border?  Where does he come in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this year of grace, food is a necessity. We, in Louth, till our land, and have always done so, even though we got the cold shoulder from Mr. T.W. Russell when he was vice-president of the Department, and from Mr. Hugh Barrie, his successor, as well as from <Col N="461" /> the late Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Hogan, and the present Minister for Agriculture.  Obviously you cannot keep tilling that land unless you put manure into it.  This year we are threatened with a scarcity of manures and are being driven altogether out of wheat.  Would Senators like to know the reason?  Last year my 70 odd acres of wheat yielded me something less than £20 an acre.  This year, without manure, we must look forward to a yield of something like seven or eight barrels of wheat to the acre.  We hope for that.  That is not good agriculture, and hence, I suppose, we will be driven into oats and barley.  In the Argentine to-day they are prepared to sell maize at £2 a ton.  Should the war end between now and this time next year, is it too much to expect that that stuff will be dumped here, and that selfish interests here will buy it, leaving on our hands the produce of the labour of those to whom we are now paying 30/- and 35/- a week?  What built the James's Gate Brewery and all that it stands for but the agricultural slaves over the last 50 years?</P>
    <P>Are the Government satisfied with the statistics of the last three days, and of the Administration that we have had in this country during the past 25 years&mdash;the Administration not of one Party but of two?  I wonder if they are satisfied that they have done their utmost to encourage those in our agricultural homes throughout the country.  With all the arable land that we have at our disposal, what is the necessity for a compulsory tillage order?  Why do not the Government promote a state of affairs that would encourage our farmers and give them heart to till and produce more?  When I started farming 40 years ago I was, I suppose, an enthusiast of the great benefits that would accrue to agriculture from an Irish Administration.  We were cold-shouldered by Mr. Hugh Barry, from Derry, as we had been by his predecessor, Mr. T.W. Russell, from Tyrone, and by their successors, the late Mr. Hogan and the present Minister for Agriculture.  I want to say that I received nothing but courtesy from the late Minister for Agriculture and the present Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="462" /> It is true to say that we tillers of the soil are being daily prejudiced against Irish industrialists.  The other day I got three dozen Irish-made shares for my ploughs.  All that I can say is that there appears to be more chalk than steel in Wexford.  If the Government want to get down to solid earth, I suggest they should bring the 30/- and 35/- a week that is being paid to workers on the land more into line with the salaries and allowances that are being paid to the members of the Government and of the Oireachtas. You have men here working in the cities getting £100 and £150 a year. Though the majority in Ireland may be organised it has to be remembered that we have another section that is not organised.  The organised majority ought not to close their eyes to the fact that they are going along a wrong and an unhappy road.</P>
    <P>All that Senator Baxter's motion asks for is that in these times of necessity a satisfactory price be paid for agricultural produce.  To leave the fixing of that price to chance means that you will quench the ardour of the farmers. There seems to be some curse over tillage in Ireland.  I do not know what is the cause of it, but somebody told me on Sunday night that when St. Patrick took the shamrock from Tara Hill, he meant that the shamrock should be continued for all time.  I see Senator Quirke smiling, but there appears to be some cloud over tillage. Fancy a professor, a member of this House, getting up and telling us that last autumn there was a satisfactory sale for oats.  That statement was only a little more astounding than the one we had from Senator Sir John Keane.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not use these words at all.  What I said was that last autumn, when the millers asked for oats, they did not state the price.  Nobody could thus say the price was unsatisfactory, but the fact is that no oats was offered to the millers.  I think that is very different from the statement the Senator has attributed to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>Then to whom was it offered, or where did it go to? Was it not on everybody's hands? Oats was unsaleable.  What is the use in the leading House of the Oireachtas being told such a thing as that?  I sold my own at 14/- a barrel.  Do we read anything that is published at all?  What is the cause of our unemployment? What was the necessity for another commission we had, the Drainage Commission, except that more drains are being stopped every day because the farmers have not got 1/- to clean them?  More land is going derelict, and, according to the statistics, the greatest unemployment has taken place in the last 10 years on the 10 to 30 acre farms.  Many farms have been divided and hundreds of homes erected on them, and still there are fewer people on the land.  Nobody but a fool would put money into land to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then you have the representative of the banks, Senator Sir John Keane, supporting the theory that you should not give a guarantee.  The same gentleman last week said&mdash;and it was a terrible statement&mdash;that if the Government were in earnest, there was plenty of money available.  What is the use of these loans to farmers, and what is the use of anything so long as it is a losing proposition?  What is the use of advancing money so that more money can be put into it and what is the use of saying that the Government has done this since 1931 or 1932, when the economist in whom charity is strongest, like Dr. Lucey, will tell you it was a change of Ministers and nothing else?  I am perfectly certain that all the Ministers are in earnest, and I am equally certain that the late Government were in earnest.  They are doing their best, according to their lights, but, for some reason or other, the farmers who are lucky enough to remain solvent never catch the Government's ear.  Let Government supporters and others bury it deep in their minds that, in a Christian land, so long as 30/-, 35/- or £2 a week is <Col N="464" /> paid into the homes of the labourers, the whole thing is wrong.  What is going to happen now?  As chairman of a county council, I will get, within the next few months, a Government grant of £5,000 to relieve unemployment, provided we put up £10,000.  Where is that £10,000 to come from?  The rates in my county, in 1914, when oats were the same price as in the autumn of 1940, were 4/6 in the £; on Monday I was responsible for striking a rate of 11/7 in the £.</P>

      <P>There is the comparison of 4/6 and 11/7 in the £, and there is the comparison that there are as many people employed on the land to-day as there were in 1914.  There is also the comparison that, during the last war, there was a Government compulsory tillage order and that to-day there is something the same.  Why the compulsion? An emergency exists and encouragement must be given if the food is to be provided.  Manures cannot be freely imported, and again there is another want.  Within the last two months the Government wisely sent Mr. Twomey and somebody else to London, and they devised an arrangement which represents the biggest benefit this Government has conferred since it came into office, in that it encourages the production of manure at home.  Would to God the same attention had been paid to the matter a year ago, when preparations could have been made by all of us, and when the little factories in every townland could have been engaged in the manufacture of manure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four, three, two years ago, the popular thing to do with a rick of wheaten straw was to throw paraffin oil on it and burn it.  As a result of this arrangement made by Mr. Twomey, that wheaten straw is about to be manufactured into manure, but it will be late for this season's crop.  It cannot possibly be utilised for the production of barley or oats.  For years I have been appealing to Ministers to do something for barley, but they always turned a deaf ear, and what is applicable <Col N="465" /> to barley is not applicable to oats.  Barley is a luxury food, and there is no reason why it does not fetch an attractive price.  We had several breweries in my county in 1914; we have one or two now.  There is a line the Government could have examined without inflicting the slightest hardship on anybody.  We could have grown our barley and made several breweries, instead of one, because we had several&mdash;Guinness's, McArdle's, Moore's, Cairnes, and others.</P>
    <P>A definite guarantee for production is absolutely turned down, and Most Rev. Dr. Fogarty, in a letter, says that the queen industry is left staggering.  I am not in the least prejudiced against any one of these men.  I do not know Dr. Lucey, but when I see theorists coming out like this, I begin to have a little hope.  What are these loans being offered for?  For the production of something which represents a loss, and the men in charge of the money tell us that it is wrong to give a guarantee of the cost of production, because that is really what you are asked to give, and, I take it, what Senator Baxter seeks. There is a grave necessity, as Senator Foran says, and a crisis at hand, and there is a necessity to grow and produce, but it must be obvious that something must be done in the way of giving a guarantee that it will not all represent a loss.  Farming is becoming a sort of trick-of-the-loop business. You go in here for payment, and out there with a loss, and then you cut your loss and get out as quickly as you can.</P>
    <P>These are the facts which prompt me to lend what little support I can to the motion, and I am very sorry that it is not being accepted.  It would give a very great impetus in my county where tillage schemes have been taken up, but the prices everywhere in relation to these are wrong.  The Minister for Agriculture gave an instance of somebody paying £12 an acre for land, and making money.  Undoubtedly, that can be done, but I paid £13 10s. Od. an acre for four years, making £54 an acre at the end of it.  I left that field and went across four miles of country to let some land in County Meath, and I was offered 50/- for it.  When I <Col N="466" /> asked: &ldquo;Why 50/-?&rdquo;  I was told: &ldquo;Because the heart's fat is torn out of it with tillage for the last six years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those of us who have been in wheat for eight or ten years, or who have been tilling for over forty years back, cannot look on it as the great saviour we should like to feel it is.  I support the motion although it is only a palliative. These commissions are all very well in their way, but solid facts speak. Unemployment on the land is increasing and the necessity for a compulsory order would be unthinkable under an Irish Government, if that Government had its feet on solid earth.  As regards Senator Keane's remark, that it is wrong to give a guarantée, that is a terrible statement to come from a Senator representing the interests which he represents.  It shows to any thinking man what the position is as it confronts us.  I am going on with tillage and taking anything that is offering&mdash;anything in which I can see any money.  I do not want to give offence to Senator O'Donovan or anybody else&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I beg your pardon.  I am sorry to tell you that it cannot possibly pay in the broad sense.  I have tried to show you that by referring to virgin soil, worth £13 10s. an acre, to give four crops of wheat for four years running.  If you go along the main Dublin road, you will see land at 50/- an acre.  The fact that I am in it is the very reason I am here trying, by a trick-of-the-loop business, to earn a livelihood, and doing my utmost to pay a wage of 35/- a week or less than £2, at any rate.  Is anything less than that a living wage?  If there is anything wrong in my statement, it can be tested by the statistics published this week showing that there are fewer people employed on the land now than there were ten years ago.  If there is anything else on which I can assist Senator O'Donovan, I shall be only too pleased to do so.</P>

      <P>Unlike Senator McGee, who is also a member of the farming community and, I think, a representative of that Panel, I am sorry I cannot support the motion.  I intend to oppose it, not because I have not the greatest possible sympathy for the farmers but because I believe, like Senator Cummins, that it is impracticable. I was very interested to hear the speech of Senator McGee and I envy him his good nature.  It is quite obvious that his heart bled not only for the farmers of his own part of the country but for all the farmers.  He is like the man who tried to spread his seed over too much ground and failed to get a satisfactory crop. Senator McGee's sympathies were far too widespread to be taken seriously. Senator McGee is so good natured and good hearted that I can well imagine him, when he goes home, passing sleepless hours thinking of the poor unfortunate farmers who have to work against the bad weather and under other unsatisfactory conditions.  I can also imagine him worrying about the unfortunate manure merchants who had not any manure to sell this year from which they could get reasonable profits.  I can also understand Senator McGee losing his heart over the unfortunate traders who had insufficient supplies of imported seed-wheat to sell this year.  But, like Senator O'Donovan, I feel fully compensated in the knowledge that Senator Baxter has, at last, been converted to the policy of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>It was only to-day, after many years, that we got the real mind of Senator Baxter.  I was uncharitable enough on many occasions to say that I doubted his sincerity in some of the speeches he made attacking the policy of Fianna Fáil.  It is a relief to find him now coming along and telling us that he is 100 per cent. for that policy. Perhaps he will ask why, if I am so pleased with his statements to-day, I do not support his motion.  In reply, I say that Senator Baxter, like many other converts to various causes, is inclined to swing a little bit too far in the direction opposite that in which he <Col N="468" /> was previously going.  I say that his suggestion is impracticable for the simple reason that, if guaranteed prices were to be assured for the various crops he has in mind&mdash;oats, barley, potatoes and so forth&mdash;hundreds of other crops would have to be included. Immediately, there would be a cry from the people producing-onions, tomatoes, carrots, turnips, mangolds and other things for guaranteed prices.  There would also be a cry from the industrialists for a guaranteed price for any surplus they might have on hand.</P>

      <P>Will the Senator read the motion?  It does not ask for guaranteed prices.  It merely asks that surplus produce be purchased at a price which will not involve the farmer in financial loss.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the motion several times.  While I would not have drafted the motion in similar terms, I thought I interpreted Senator Baxter's meaning and I still think that I did that.  If the phrase, &ldquo;purchased at a price which will not involve the farmer in financial loss,&rdquo; does not mean a guaranteed price, I do not know what it means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>If the produce is surplus, it will be taken over at a price which will not involve the farmer in loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>That would mean that thousands of inspectors would have to be appointed to decide what price would not involve the farmer in financial loss.  As Senator O Buachalla has pointed out, it is difficult to ascertain what the cost of production is and that would have to be done in order to find what price would save the farmer from financial loss.  One farmer or industrialist may produce an article at a cost of £1 while another farmer or industrialist, working under similar conditions, but not so efficient, may be involved in a cost of £2 in producing a similar article.  The investigation into the cost of production of the various crops would be going on when the war had ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised that some of the Labour Senators did not ask Senator Baxter to substitute for the phrase he <Col N="469" /> has in his motion the words &ldquo;which will not involve the mass of the people in costs for the necessaries of life beyond their capacity to pay.&rdquo;  My principal objection to the motion is that it is impracticable and could not be put into operation within a reasonable time.  I believe that the idea behind the motion is all right but that, as a result of the motion, we shall get rather bad results.  Every motion of this type brought up here during the past couple of months or, for that matter, during the past couple of years, has had the effect of retarding the machine and slowing down the work. They have put the idea into the minds of farmers that, after all, something more should be done for them and that if they only wait a little longer and it is realised that they are not delivering the goods, the Government may come to the rescue and give them some of the concessions which are being sought by Senator Baxter and others.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that Senator Baxter has any ulterior motive whatever.  Far from it.  I believe he would go as far as anybody else to get the farmers to produce, and that he realises as well as anybody else the necessity there is for increased production not alone in wheat, oats or potatoes, but in 101 other things, if we are to survive and to come out of this war as an independent nation.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator Baxter who said that spasmodic efforts had been made by the Government to get production in wheat and other things.  I think Senator Baxter will agree that the action of the Government was anything but spasmodic, and that the only reason why the results were not 100 per cent. better than they have been was because we had a division in this House here which was not founded on realities at all, but on political background. If in the past four years we had got the co-operation we are getting to-day from the various political Parties, we could snap our fingers at the world and say that, as far as food was concerned, we would be independent.</P>
    <P>Senator McGee looked forward to the day when this war would be over, and when maize would be available <Col N="470" /> in South America or somewhere else, and he suggested that we had no guarantee that that maize would not be dumped here on the Irish markets, and that as a result the Irish farmer would be practically put out of business. If anybody wants any more guarantee of Government policy than the statement we had here to-day from the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, I would like to know what it is.  He made a statement here to-day that it was the policy of the Government, not alone for this year and next year, but for all time, to ensure that the farmers of this country would be protected in such a way that a market would be available at all times for the produce of their lands.  I am sufficiently optimistic to believe that, no matter what change of Government we may have here in the future, no policy will come into force here which will reverse the wheel of progress which has been moving, if perhaps rather slowly, at least consistently, over a number of years.  I believe that this House could serve one very useful purpose during this period of crisis, by acting as an instrument of propaganda, if you like, in favour of production of every conceivable kind.</P>
    <P>I believe that a message should go out from this House to the people of this country, particularly to the farmers, that regardless of what statistics may be produced, regardless of what arguments may be put up as to the comparative values of the home-produced article and the imported article, the policy of this country should be a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, that one ton of food produced in this country is worth 100 tons of food produced in any other country, because we cannot import at the present time.  There can be no two sides to a question of this kind, and I refuse to believe there are two sides. I believe unless we can go on that basis, regardless of political differences or anything else, we are going to find ourselves in the lurch.</P>
    <P>Very little has been said about the other crops.  Most of the discussion centred around wheat.  I believe wheat must come first and foremost.  Wheat <Col N="471" /> must be our No. 1 ideal in this great drive for production, but I believe that after the production of wheat there are other crops which will count very considerably in the life of this country in the very near future.  One of these will be oats.  If an oil-well were discovered in this country there would be no question of approaching the Government to see that the owner of the oil-well would get a specified or guaranteed price for his product.  I believe that the oat fields of this country will be the oil-wells of the nation in the very near future, that we will be thrown back on horses for transport and that the cost of travelling in the near future will be calculated on so many miles to the barrel of oats rather than so many miles to the gallon of petrol.  I believe we should look forward to that and see that we get the greatest possible production in oats, barley and anything that will feed man or beast in this country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of giving guaranteed prices for certain crops and not giving guaranteed prices for other crops, there may or may not be some sense in that argument.  In connection with beet, a guaranteed price is given which, in the opinion of the people directly concerned with the crop, is a satisfactory price.  In the estimation of other people the price is perhaps a little bit high, but even if it is high, it is a great thing we are in the position to say we have at least enough sugar, no matter what happens.</P>
    <P>Because the price is high and because an attempt has been made to distribute the benefits of that crop amongst the greatest possible number of farmers, the acreage has been controlled.  To my mind, it would not be a desirable thing to have a surplus of beet.</P>
    <P>We may have surpluses of other things and no great harm would be done, but in other countries where big acreages went under cultivation for certain crops they found they had to come along and control the acreage. Here no such situation has arisen so far in any case and it would be perhaps a blessing in disguise if we found ourselves in the position next year that we had a surplus of several of <Col N="472" /> these commodities that have come up for discussion here to-day.  In other countries there are hills of surplus and valleys of insufficiency.  Here, unfortunately, we have only valleys of insufficiency and we look forward with hope that in regard to some at least of these necessities of life we may have hills of surplus in the days ahead.</P>
    <P>Senator McGee complained about the two Governments I am quite prepared to accept that he is non-political, if you like.  Any member of this House must be non-political but in any case the end is the same.  I do not want to drag politics into the thing at all but I say if we had not the production we have at the present time the end of many of us would not be the same.  We would probably not be here.  We would find ourselves in the position to-day that we would be asked&mdash;probably politely&mdash;but asked nevertheless, if we would be prepared to exchange a few thousand men for a few thousand barrels of wheat.  Thank God we are not in that position and with the co-operation of all Parties I believe we will be in a very strong position.  With God's help and given reasonably good weather in the spring, we ought to be in the position to stand on our feet.  If we are in that position then, we can afterwards discuss what further steps can be taken to make the lot of the farmer more satisfactory than it is to-day.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I cannot support Senator Baxter's motion but I feel sure that, having the guarantee he has had from the Minister and having heard the statements made supporting him about 49.9 per cent. but not going the 50 per cent., he will withdraw his motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Quirke, I have a certain amount of sympathy with the motion but at the same time I do not believe that it would be practicable. As a matter of fact I am afraid Senator Baxter is going too far in asking the Government for a guaranteed price for all produce.  I am satisfied that supply and demand will regulate the price and I do hope the farmer will get a reasonable price for his produce. I think it fair that I should say I found great discontent amongst <Col N="473" /> the farming community I have come in contact with in connection with the price of oats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that it is a disgrace that certain farmers in the county where I reside, who complied with the regulations, and, not being prepared for growing wheat at the time, did grow oats, were forced to sell that oats for 12/2 or 12/4 a barrel.  To-day, less than three months after, if I go in for a barrel of that oats I am charged 30/-.  I think that is disgraceful.  It is not fair that any sheltered section of the community should be allowed to profiteer so much on the farming community.  I am sorry that the Minister is not here.  I do hope that some action will be taken in the future to see that such a thing will never again be allowed to take place in this country.  After all, the farmer has to pay his annuities; he has to pay increased rates; he is trying to pay a certain wage&mdash;of course, we would like to see him paying more&mdash; he has the worry of being dependent on the weather and everything else, and it is a disgrace that oats which he has sold for 12/2 or 12/4 a barrel should, within a few months, be sold for 30/- a barrel by some other person, who makes sure to have an umbrella over him and that a shower of rain will never fall on him.  The Prices Commission&mdash;if there is such a thing in this country&mdash;should be ashamed of themselves. I am very sincere about this, and I hope that serious notice will be taken of the fact that such a thing was allowed to occur in this country.  I feel that, next to wheat, oats is the most important food than can be produced. I do not believe the people would die of hunger if there was sufficient oats.  While the millers bought that oats at that scandalous price, the working classes and the poor of this country did not get the benefit of it. There was no such reduction in the price of the oatmeal sold to the poor. It was 4/6 or 4/8 a stone.  The difference there is too great.  There was no increase given in wages, and I do not see where the difference could have come in.  As I said, I hope that will never be allowed to take place in this country again.  I have great sympathy with Senator Baxter's motion, and I <Col N="474" /> am satisfied that he has brought it forward in good faith.  After all, even if the Minister did give the assurance which the motion seeks, I am satisfied that he would be committing himself to nothing; that the old law of supply and demand will regulate the price, and that the farmer will get a price for what he produces on the land.  That is all I have to say, except to repeat that if there is such a thing as a Prices Commission in this country I am sorry to say they are not doing their duty, and I hope the few words I have said will reach them.</P>

      <P>If the farmers of this country read this debate they will get nothing but cold comfort from most of the speeches.  In the circumstances that lie ahead, when some of the difficulties which will inevitably arise have to be faced, if the kind of mentality that we had from Senator O'Donovan, Senator Mrs. Concannon, Senator Goulding, and I might also add, with regret, Senator Buckley, is to be applied to the farmers' problems as I see them, then the farmers of this country are in for a raw deal.  If possible, I want to see 3,000,000 acres under tillage in this country this year. I would like to have more tillage than the minimum necessary for our requirements&mdash;I think anybody with imagination and a desire for stability and order, as well as the desire expressed by Senator Cummins in his speech that none of our population should suffer from malnutrition, would like that, too &mdash;and that is what every member of this House should ask for and should lend his co-operation to achieve. Having put down this motion, I am treated by some in a rather patronising kind of way.  I am a simple sort of character from the country.  I mean well, but I just do not quite understand what I am trying to get at, and, in any case, even if I got it, it would not be any good and possibly could not be interpreted and so on.  Yes; I am possibly a simple man from the country.  I had enough faith in this House and in the common sense of the members of this House to believe that they did realise that there were grave dangers ahead of this nation, that we <Col N="475" /> might internally be very considerably upset, that thousands and thousands of our men on the farms of this country might have to leave the farms and go into the defence of the country as they went before, that the job of carrying on the agricultural industry and garnering its harvest might have to be left, as it was left in other countries, to the women, and that the difficulties confronting us are of such a nature and magnitude and character as to take men of imagination, of vision and courage to grapple with them.  I confess quite frankly that I saw none of that here to-day, either on the part of most of those who have spoken or, indeed, even on the part of the Minister himself.</P>
      <P>I go back to what I said at the beginning, and repeat that even millions of money would be a cheap price to pay for ensuring that we have ample supplies of food for the people of this country and the animals of this country.  Yes, it would be cheap at millions of pounds, and, if you have not enough food, millions of pounds will not save you from the consequences. We had all this on the part of some, special pleading verging on hypocrisy, and from others, open hostility. I would join issue, first of all, with the Minister himself, when he suggested that this motion of mine was a blank cheque to the farmer to scrape the soil, and whether he did it efficiently or not he would be paid.  I ask for nothing of the kind.  In the first place, I say that that is a libel on the farmers of this country.  I challenge any farmer in the House to contradict me when I say that not one farmer in 10,000 in this country will go out and scrape the surface of his soil.  He thinks too much about it.  The soil is bred in his bone and in his blood.  He tends it and he cares it.  After his home and his family and his stock, next comes his soil, because he knows that the health of his family and himself, and the health of his stock, depend on the vigour and vitality of his soil.  That is why he wants to care it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who studies the whole problem of nutrition or malnutrition must realise that there can be no healthy <Col N="476" /> life in Ireland, in town or country, unless you have healthy soil.  The history of this country has proved that our farmers have cared for their soil to the best of their ability.  I say &ldquo;to the best of their ability&rdquo; because there were certain limitations.  I do not want to be unfair to the Minister in his absence.  It may be that he said that without fully adverting to its implications. But it was repeated by Senator O'Donovan, and indeed it is not the first time that Senator O'Donovan was ready to slight the farmers of this country.  They were lazy at another time.  It is always a puzzle to me that those people who fly from the land get so quickly a perverted point of view about those others who had the courage and pluck to stay on in the slavery and hardship of it.  It is not fair to them, and it is a misrepresentation of the idea behind my motion to suggest that, if what I ask were conceded, it would be a provocation and an incitement to thriftless, careless farmers to scrape the surface of their land.</P>

      <P>In the interests, perhaps, of Senator Baxter himself, may I remind him that the Minister did not attack the farmers?  He did not contemplate the farmers scraping the soil for a momentary profit.  He pointed out the possibility of men going into agriculture, going on to the land, for the purpose of snatching those unholy profits.  I think Senator Baxter is hardly fair to the Minister.</P>

What the Minister said was: &ldquo;A blank cheque to scrape the soil, and whether he does it efficiently or not he will be paid.&rdquo;  I refute the suggestion contained in that.

      <P>My argument was that if this guarantee were given it would prevent speculation; it would give encouragement to the farmer, to the man who owns the land; it would be a credit note to him and would enable him to devote his energies to the ploughing and tilling of his soil; it would be a guarantee to a bank because he would have a crop which he could sell at a price above the cost of production.  That is what I was aiming at.  I do not want to encourage the speculator.  We have too many parasites in this community in proportion to our total population and, unless something drastic is done to curtail their activities, to reduce the number of parasites living on agriculture, we cannot keep farming on an economic basis.  The crowd at the top will become too heavy and they will weigh the farmers down.  As it is, they are too comfortable and too well fed.  That is what is happening.</P>
      <P>In the motion I have been asking merely that where there is surplus produce on the hands of farmers, the Government will take it off them at a price that will not involve them in any financial loss by reason of their having complied with the compulsory tillage order.  What annoys me is the type of statement made by Senator Mrs. Concannon, who talked about our coming now to the Government.  We are not coming to the Government.  As Senator Foran said, the truth is that the Government are coming to us.  They are coming to us with a big stick, threatening that if we do not do certain things they will take the land from us.  I should like to have the Minister here, because then I would ask him what provision he is going to make for the farmer who cannot comply with the compulsory tillage order.  If he takes that farmer's land, what provision will he make for his sustenance?  Supposing he is a cattle man or a man who could ordinarily get a certain amount of credit from the bank, if his land is taken from him what is going to happen to him?  Unfortunately, the Minister was not here, and I had not an opportunity of getting a reply to that question.</P>

We in the country will not be the first to be hungry.  I do not want to see anybody hungry.  I would not like to see the people in the towns or cities, many of whom have not perhaps the price of to-morrow's meal, going hungry.  I know that the people with the cash can get considerable quantities of goods of the type which the poor will not be able to get two or three months hence.  There ought to be some realisation that in an ordered society reasonable provision ought to be made for protecting the lives of all the people, and food is essential to all life.  Every available means ought to be utilised to ensure that all will have a reasonable supply of food.  In the absence of adequate guarantees, I fear we may not have enough food.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator explained that his motion was misunderstood; that it is not a demand for guaranteed prices, but a request that if there be over-production, produce <Col N="479" /> unsold, the Government will take it over at a price remunerative to the producer.  That is his motion and he has forgotten his own motion in his reply.</P>

      <P>Senator Magennis is not now in the university.  The metaphysician sometimes fits in rather badly in discussions on farming.  Senator Magennis and I crossed swords in the other House a great many years ago when he objected to our being a pastoral people.  I will always remember the phrase he used then.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking for a guarantee from the Government that surplus produce will not be left to rot in the fields, that we will not be left with pigs fed on our produce that we cannot export at a reasonable price; that we will not be left with eggs and poultry that will not realise a figure equivalent to the cost of production. In the absence of such a guarantee, you may not have enough food.  If the Government had to spend £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 in order to get the other position, I would rather have that than the chance of under-production.  I cannot make the position any clearer.</P>
      <P>I cannot confess to be satisfied with the declaration of Government policy. If this matter was discussed at a Government Party meeting to-day, there may have been some statement from the Minister which was more enlightening than anything he said here.  Senator O Buachalla attempted to interpret Government policy and he was followed by Senator Quirke.  All that I could gather from what they said was that the Government will see that no imports will reach this country until whatever products the farmers have on hands are used up.  That is not saying to the farmers &ldquo;Go on and produce; we will see that you will not lose by production.&rdquo;  There is a very great difference.  That is the fundamental question at issue here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I say now, and what I said <Col N="480" /> earlier in the debate, was that people elsewhere who wanted to get production from the land, did not stop at giving even unreasonable guarantees. I would not suggest for a moment that the almost Gilbertian system which the Government of Northern Ireland applied to its potato policy should be applied here but I think, in justice to our farmers, who are expected to comply with the demands of the Government in order that they will be sure of food for the people in the towns and cities, that they might try to beg, borrow&mdash;I shall not say steal because there is not much to steal&mdash;but at least the Government have got to do things that have not been done in this country hitherto if they are going to get as much land under the plough as is requisite.</P>
    <P>Farmers are expected to go to extremes, and the attitude of the Government&mdash;let me be contradicted if I do not correctly interpret it&mdash;is that they will not tell us that they are going to take the goods from us at prices that will ensure that we shall not be involved in any financial loss.  All they say is that they will not allow any goods into the country while we have goods on our land which can be sent to the market.  Every practical farmer &mdash;and with all respect to Senator Buckley, who said that I am as much a farmer as he, I am a practical farmer&mdash; knows that what is happening in the outside world with regard to shipments to other parts of the world is going to influence prices here.</P>
    <P>Many farmers in my county and in some of the western counties who will not grow wheat to any considerable extent&mdash;some of us grow it to the limits of our capacity&mdash;can grow oats and potatoes which will be used to feed live stock.  I do not know whether Senator Buckley likes a rasher for his breakfast, but I wonder, if he had to do without a rasher all the time, or without sugar all the time, which he would prefer?  He, of course, may be a rather ascetic member of this Assembly, but there are quite a number in this House, and the other House, who, I am convinced, would do without sugar every day in the week if they could get rashers.  The Senator <Col N="481" /> regards sugar as an essential food, but many of us, too, have become accustomed to the breakfast rasher.  It has become part of our existence, part of our everyday life, so much so that in the normal course of events people who have got money are never without it.  They expect that that condition of affairs will last for ever, but do not be too sure about the number of rashers you can get for your breakfast between now and August or September next.  If I am any prophet, you will not be able to get as many as you would like.  That is because of the lack of foresight, vision and courage in our agricultural policy 18 months ago.  Had the motion which I put before the House then been adopted, we would have ample food now for man and beast.  We could deal with all comers and it would not have cost the Exchequer a farthing.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with some of the points made by other Senators, because I confess quite frankly in most cases their remarks appear to me to be special pleading.  They consisted of a petty sort of effort to get out of supporting the motion and, at the same time, not to appear to be against it. Surely to goodness, conditions in this country are altogether too grave at this time of the day to permit of this pettifogging nonsense or are we just to go on playing Party politics in the national crisis that is there for every man who has the eyes to see?  Senator Cummins said that he could not support the motion because he thought there was going to be difficulty about finding out what was the real genuine surplus and what was not surplus.  All I can say about the surplus is this.  I know that in the Twenty-Six Counties pits of potatoes have lain in the fields since the present Government came into office and the price of the potatoes would not pay for the labour of removing them.  It was because of that, I take it, that the alcohol factories were set up.  They were surplus.  Mind you, it was not even an economic proposition to feed them to pigs or they would have been fed to pigs.  They were really surplus.</P>
    <P>If the farmers are to be confronted with a situation like that again, would <Col N="482" /> it not break every one of them?  Is the nation ready in these days to demand such a sacrifice from our farmers as to commit them to a policy like that?  I say if the nation demands sacrifies, they should not be made at the expense of the individual farmer. I think that is mere justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">

      <P>I have no desire to be offensive to Senator Magennis.  It is no reflection to refer to the way he earns his living any more than it would be a reflection on me to say that I am a farmer.  I am quite proud of the fact that I am a farmer.  It was not as a taunt that I said that the Professor was a very distinguished&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether that would be out of place either.  The Senator asks are we not getting a guaranteed market.  I put this to him. I said in the House to-day in the presence of the Minister&mdash;and the Minister should have joined issue with me if he were not prepared to accept my figures&mdash;that it costs any farmer in this country, in my opinion, a minimum of £25 to produce an acre of potatoes. The average yield for this country is seven or eight tons to the acre.  3/-per cwt. is £3 per ton.  How many times and how frequently are people in Dublin and in our country towns, able <Col N="483" /> to buy potatoes at that price?  This crop of potatoes is in my opinion absolutely essential, in fact more essential than wheat, for the existence of the nation.  The best of men and women ate potatoes three times a day and were none the worse.  The potato crop is just as essential for the life of our people as wheat.  If I had my choice to-morrow I would go in for potatoes every time.  I am pointing out that at £3 a ton, eight tons of potatoes will bring in only £24, and it costs £25 to produce these potatoes.  Would I not be much better off standing at the corner, if I had not too much pride to stand there, than producing potatoes which cost me £25 to sell them at £24? That is the sort of problem with which we are faced.</P>
      <P>You have got to get down to the hard facts of life on the land to realise what is inherent in this whole situation. There may be people in this House who still say that I am putting forward this motion merely for the pleasure of doing so.  It is not a bit of pleasure to me.  I am just as fearful of the future as anybody but I would not run away from a fight if it came. I did not do it before, nor anyone belonging to me, and we paid the price.  I will not do it now, either.  I am anxious to see that order and life on the highest possible plane be achieved by the efforts of our people, by confidence in one another and by co-operation, but I do not see much sign of co-operation.  I have heard more hard words for farmers than soft ones or kindly ones.  I do not see much encouragement for the farmers from the people who ought to give that encouragement&mdash;people like Senator Mrs. Concannon, Senator O'Donovan, and others.  That is the problem with which we are faced.  We expect our farmers to do everything and not to do it ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with what Senators said.  I am very much surprised at Senator Goulding, who, in effect, said that co-operation would provide an admirable solution&mdash;that if they had co-operation to store surplus products it would be all right, but the policy at present was to drive town traders out of existence.  Certainly that is not the kind of argument with which one can meet the present situation.</P>
      <P>I have been hopeful that this House would appreciate the fact that there is a genuine desire on the part of responsible people who know the difficulty&mdash; on our part&mdash;to ensure that no crisis which is avoidable, as far as we ourselves are concerned, will have to be met.  But we want leadership of another and clearer kind than we got in this House this evening.  While I know it may be an admirable thing to turn down my motion because it was I who moved it, that will have no influence whatever on me.  The truth remains unquenchable, the whole bold facts will stand out as hard as granite that none can strike down and none can avoid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, there are people like Senator Sir John Keane telling us that guarantees would mean inflation, that there would be a rise in prices, deploring the fact that there was such a neglect of technical efficiency and astonished that I had said nothing about that.  No one in this country&mdash; in this House, anyway&mdash;has talked more about an improved technique for agriculture than I, and no one is more keenly alive to the necessity for it. However, it would be quite a good thing to get a man out with a láidh to-day, for those who know what it is like, to till his plot, rather than wait for the mechanisation that Denmark has been able to apply.  We must improvise, we must utilise every means at our disposal&mdash;tractors of various kinds, where fuel can be had.  Any one with experience knows the difficulties <Col N="485" /> there.  Horses are hard to obtain; if you go to the fairs now you see the difficulty of the farmers in this respect.  The horses necessary for tillage are hard to get because petrol has been stopped from the people in the towns and the cities and they have to get horses.</P>
    <P>The complications in the tillage problem because of other problems are truly appalling.  There is not that feeling of security, so far as the man himself is concerned, that is as encouraging for him as is necessary, under the conditions.  When Senator Sir John Keane talked about the guarantees that would mean inflation and a rise in price, I do not think he studied the motion at all.  My understanding of this inflationary development, which comes in every country, is that it occurs when commodities become scarce and money plentiful, and I am afraid this inflationary policy will be gathering momentum here through the scarcity of commodities and through money being available to pay for more commodities than are there.  I am convinced that, if my motion were accepted, there would be so much production that there would be sufficient. I do not think there would be very much surplus, as to till 2,700,000 acres this year, when we had 2,000,000 last year, would be beyond our physical capacity, even if we got everybody working and if we ploughed with our tractors with lights on them at night. So I do not believe we shall reach what we require, but I believe that, if we give this earnest of our good faith to the farmer, we will get quite a lot and, by getting it, we would get commodities which would keep the price level low.  Instead of people in labour circles and elsewhere fearing that this motion of mine will create a position which would make it difficult for the poor to buy food, I believe they should realise that it is the one method by which there are reasonable possibilities that all will get an adequate amount of food.  I cannot help it if the Oireachtas fails to face that position.</P>
    <P>Senator MacCabe did not agree with giving a guaranteed price.  He opened by saying that it would benefit only 40 per cent.  I do not know quite what he meant.  The farmers of this country <Col N="486" /> manage to live only by selling something off the land&mdash;by exchanging a pig, cow, calf, or poultry, or wheat, beet or barley for clothes and boots. Therefore any security that can be given regarding price would be a security for all.  I do not want it for one, but for all.</P>
    <P>His way would be to give a higher price for the things produced on the land.  He went on to indicate the different prices of eggs here and in the Six Counties, and definitely stated that the price of butter is too low; and he declared boldly and frankly that the pork industry is dead.  He talked of people having three or four sows before and now only one.  That comes from the Government side.  If I said that I surely would be interrupted.</P>
    <P>Senator O Buachalla also spoke. Frankly, I expected more to-day from Senator O Buachalla. He has a technical training, he can study figures and he has opportunities which I and people like me have not.  I am quite certain that, even as a matter of interest and as a matter of information, he probably has studied figures with regard to our production and consumption of various foods which we get from our own soil here; probably he has related that to imports and probably he has gone on to see how much could be got form a given area of land in the way of more carbohydrates and proteins.  With a training like that, instead of adopting a rather safe line, I think he should have lost nothing by giving a bold lead.  It is a time when nobody will find fault with the men who are brave and bold.  He says we have only to ask from the Government and that we are pushing an open door.  I wish I could accept that but, frankly, I cannot, from my experience in this House, nor can I see that there is any more imagination being displayed in relation to agricultural affairs by the Government now than there has been for a number of years past.  In this House various propositions have been put up, but one has been put repeatedly in various forms.  It has been supported&mdash;perhaps not as vigorously as it might have been&mdash;from the Government side of the House as well <Col N="487" /> as from this side of the House.  That proposition is that agriculture in Ireland never was capitalised as it should have been, and that because it was under-capitalised the production was much lower than it should be.  I say to-day that that is one of the great faults, one of the great weaknesses, in our agriculture.</P>
    <P>Figures were given here on the last occasion showing the position in New Zealand or Denmark as against Ireland, and showing the remarkable and astounding results that the Danish and New Zealand farmers have got from their soils as against the results we have got from our soil.  While we have borrowed from the banks £12,000,000 or £13,000,000, we have assets of, approximately, some £300,000,000, as well as other resources, in the way of credits, of altogether about £20,000,000, but the farmers in Denmark have put capital into their land to the extent of £250,000,000, while in New Zealand the farmers have put capital into their land to the extent of £130,000,000. When Sir John Keane and other people like him tell us about our lack of technical efficiency and about how people like myself would meet with more success if we were to concentrate on developing our agricultural technique, I say that we can develop a better agricultural technique when we get the means to do so, when we get the money that is necessary to put into agriculture and to give us the farm buildings, farm equipment, plough-shares and all the other things that are necessary for the use of men who want to improve agricultural technique.</P>
    <P>I and others have repeatedly spoken on this matter.  I remember a classic argument being used to me by the then Minister for Finance, who is now the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in regard to this question of credit.  I think it was on a Budget debate.  The Minister warned me of the dangers at that time of giving credits to farmers to enable them to buy stock only a short while after a deflationary period, in view of what it might cost to pay the loans.  It would not have cost half the amount at that time as it is now costing, and if we had got those <Col N="488" /> facilities then, the shortage of phosphates, potash and so on, that many are feeling now so acutely would not be felt to the same extent at all because, as Senator McGee has pointed out, we would have had our own little factories, so to speak, on our own farms and we would have had our own stocks of these commodities; but we did not get the facilities that we required at that time.  That is my answer to Senator Sir John Keane.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Senator will permit me to say that I am not going to rely so much on my imagination in matters affecting this country as the Senator would seem to suggest.  I did study the problem, and in the course of my speech I raised some objections to which, if he thinks it necessary, the Senator might reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Senator O Buachalla made one point, and that was, that in this matter of agriculture, so far as the Government was concerned, we were only pushing an open door.  That was a very important point, and I think I answered it to the effect that I have tried to push the door but never could see anything inside of it.  Now, some Senators have been saying that the farmer, by depending on his own farm, is doing the right thing, and I presume that that is the point to which Senator O Buachalla wants me to reply.  I do not want to be drawn into any Party attitude in this matter, but some other Senators said&mdash;or at least I think this was the inference to be drawn from their remarks&mdash;that we are going to have a fully-fledged Fianna Fáil policy and that that is what I am standing for now.  The fact is that the policy <Col N="489" /> that has been forced upon us to-day has not been forced upon us by the present Government or the Fianna Fáil Party, but by outside circumstances. The truth is that, in spite of all their efforts&mdash;and Senator O Buachalla can contradict me if he thinks I am wrong&mdash;until last year the area under tillage in this country had been definitely declining.  Despite all the efforts of the Fianna Fáil Government, the area under tillage, until last year, had been definitely declining.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is difficult enough to answer Senator O'Donovan at any time, but I shall answer him by saying that if he had been helping me when the first beet factory was erected in this country he would have been doing a better job for this country than the one he was on at that time; and it was that first factory that led to the second, third and fourth beet factories.  That was all the result of the work that was done in these years, and I say that if any credit is to be passed on to anybody, it should be given to those to whom it is due.</P>

      <P>As a matter of information, perhaps I might be permitted to point out to Senator Baxter that the area under cultivation in 1931 was 12¼ per cent., whereas the area under cultivation in 1940 was 16 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if the Senator wishes to claim that as a great achievement on his part, or on the part of his Party, he can do so, but that was an increase of only one per cent., and I think that is very little to boast about. Look at the figures which have just been published from the latest Census returns, and which were dissected by the Press, with regard to employment in agriculture.  I do not know that anybody in this House, or anybody else, for a good many years at any rate, <Col N="490" /> ever heard me advocating any policy for the farmer except that of depending to the utmost limit on our own soil and its productivity.</P>
      <P>I have been pleading all the time for greater energy and for a greater dependence upon our own soil and its products.  That has been my view, and I have repeatedly stated it here.  It is not a policy that I borrowed from Fianna Fáil.  It is the policy to which I was brought up, and we, and those who went before us, always did our best to get the most that could be got out of our own farms and get as little as possible from outside sources.</P>
      <P>Now, I come to Senator Quirke.  He was more reasonable towards me than he usually is, and he used my name frequently.  I think that his remarks might be summed up when he said that he was surprised that the Labour Party had not moved an amendment to the motion, something to this effect: to insert, after the word &ldquo;not&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;involve the masses of the people in paying a price which they will be unable to pay&rdquo;.  Now, I think that that epitomises the whole outlook towards this motion of mine, and it is with that that I quarrel.  I want to be clearly understood in this.  I have made no demand from the Government for a price for the farmer which I would regard as either tending towards inflation or an unreasonable price or anything that would leave the farmer open to a charge of profiteering.  I want nothing of the kind, and I think that nothing would be more disastrous for farming or for any other industry than to pursue a policy that might put them in the position of appearing to be a lot of profiteers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, however, that when you have opportunities for speculation, such as there are at the moment, there is every opportunity for profiteering.  I want to get rid of the profiteer, but it is quite clear that what is operating in the minds of certain Senators is that if you made a statement of such a policy as that, the farmers would be in the position of demanding unreasonable and exorbitant prices.  I do not stand, nor do I think anybody would stand, for unreasonable or exorbitant prices <Col N="491" /> for farmers, but I do stand for a just price.  There is, in the teaching of the Catholic Church, such a thing as a just price, and I think it is about time that Catholic men and Christian men should understand that even the farmer in this country is entitled to a just price.</P>
    <P>If it is put up to me by Senator Quirke that my motion should be amended in such a form, that it will not involve for the masses of the people a price which they will be unable to pay, I answer in this way, that I believe a chance ought to be given to every mortal to go to work and earn as much as would give him a reasonably decent standard of living.  If he got that chance he would be able to pay a just price for food.  I do not stand, and I will not stand for a situation, where the farmer must be a beast of burden, to slave and produce the best of food for other citizens, and to take a price for his produce, that he has been compelled to take time and again, which is under the cost of production. He has been doing that and has been tightening his belt and tightening the belt on his farm in the past.  Can anyone say, even supporters of the Government, no matter how enthusiastic they may be, that they could be proud of our farms or of our farm buildings?</P>
    <P>What improvements have been made in farm buildings during the last ten years?  None whatever.  I give credit where credit is due and agree that it is true that there has been a fairly considerable number of farm houses reconstructed, and new houses erected, but for farm buildings generally there can be no claim for general improvement. That is something that none of <Col N="492" /> us can be proud of.  It is due to the fact that we have been compelled year after year to put produce upon markets that were choked, or that were unready to receive it, while our finances were in such a condition that we had to cash our crops for whatever we got.  I do not think that is fair.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that no stability, no higher standard of life, no reasonable standard of culture can be developed in a land where the basis of life is agriculture if the price of agricultural produce is like that.  In my opinion if a courageous and bold statement of policy had been made to-day, and if the Government were prepared to face up to their obligations, that would have given heart to the country and would have given stability to the people who do not now enjoy it.  I do not want any concessions.  There is an aspect of the question that I am sure will appeal to Senator Mrs. Concannon. It is one in which she is interested. If a stability were given to agriculture, which it has not enjoyed for a long time, there would be a future for our young people on the land.  That is not the case at present, nor for many years past.  It is because of that they have gone off the land.  By such a statement a foundation could have been laid for more marriages, more children, a rising population in rural Ireland and an improvement in the present position. Clearly we are afraid to face it or are not ready to do so, and that being so, I think we ought to get out and make room for people who are prepared to tackle it.</P>
