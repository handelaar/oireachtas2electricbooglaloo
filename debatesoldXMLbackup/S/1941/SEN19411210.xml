      <P>Under the Constitution a citizen who has reached the age of 21 years who complies with the electoral law and who is not otherwise disqualified has the right to vote at an election for members of Dáil Eireann.  Under Section 25 of the Parliamentary Elections (Ireland) Act of 1823, the section which it is proposed to repeal by Section 3 of this Bill, a person who has not attained the age of 21 years is declared not to be entitled to vote at a Parliamentary election.  While this is the position under the Parliamentary Elections Act, and while Section 4 of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act of 1923 declares that nothing in that Act confers any right to vote on any person who is otherwise not so entitled, the presiding officer at a Dáil election is not permitted to query the age of <Col N="58" /> a person whose name appears on the register even though he has no doubt that the person in question is under the age of 21 years, and consequently is not qualified to vote.  This Bill is designed to clear up that anomalous position, and, accordingly, Section 2 of the measure authorises the presiding officer to put to a person tendering a vote the question: &ldquo;Have you attained the age of 21 years?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Unless the answer is affirmative, the person concerned will not receive a ballot paper.  It is not, of course, proposed to abolish the existing provision whereby persons under the age of 21 years are not entitled to vote.  It will be noted, however, that the provision in question is enshrined in a statute over 100 years old.  It is felt that it would be generally convenient if the need to refer so far back for a statement of the law on this very important matter were obviated and, accordingly, Section 1 of the present measure imposes the provision afresh, while Section 3 repeals the corresponding section in the earlier statute.</P>

      <P>I do not think anyone could possibly object to this Bill, and I certainly am not going to do so.  It very indirectly affects us, but I am sure no member of the Dáil would care to <Col N="59" /> think that he was voted for by a child or two, which I believe did occur on one occasion.  I am sure we would be glad to relieve him of such a possibility in future.  This is a simple measure and does not attempt to deal with other anomalies, but in the course of my experience I have noticed that there is not the same concern that people will be able to vote as soon as they are 21.  Quite a number of persons who are not 21 at the time the forms are being filled in for the register will be 21 before the register comes into effect.</P>
      <P>I know that there is a certain amount of grievance in those cases.  I have never personally been able to see why, if the age is one which would show that the individual would be 21 on and after the date for which the register is being prepared, the name could not be accepted for the purpose of formulating the register.  When this Bill is law, any possible danger in allowing the name to appear on the register should be obviated.  It is a small point, but I thought I would mention it.</P>

      <P>Before we pass the Final Stage, there are one or two matters to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention.  Anyone engaged in election work will welcome this new provision because it will do away with a lot of trouble as regards the age limit.  Another point concerns a person whose name has appeared on the register of voters in previous years, and who discovers on the day of the election that for some unknown reason the name is no longer on the list. According to the regulations, it is essential, I understand, that before a name is struck off the register, the person concerned should be so informed by registered post, but this practice is not generally adopted throughout the country.  I ask the Minister, at this stage, to make provision to see that the county registrar, or the people responsible for compiling the register, would be more careful, particularly in relation to people whose names have been on the register for previous <Col N="60" /> years.  It is very awkward when people over the age of 21 who voted on previous occasions, go to the polling station, feeling confident that their names are on the register, and find they have no vote.  This has often occurred on the morning of an election.  I know there is more or less a lack of interest in elections generally, but the county registrar concerned should notify people by registered post, as the regulation requires.  At some later stage, we should seriously consider the question of having compulsory voting, because I am of opinion that any person who refuses to record a vote should not be eligible for a public appointment, or for any remuneration from the public purse if he or she fail to perform a national duty.</P>

      <P>With reference to the point raised by Senator Hawkins, it does not seem to occur to the people nowadays to ascertain in advance whether they are entitled to vote. Years ago, when the contest was between the old Unionist Party, as it was called then, and the Nationalist element, each section had to look after their own interests, so far as revision work was concerned, to ensure that they could exercise their votes.  The register has to be in the hands of the public on the 1st June of each year.  Very often in recent years, in the City of Dublin up to the suspension of elections, our city elections were held towards the end of June. That did not give a great deal of time to those engaged on political work for the preparation of their election campaigns.  It was a matter of only about three weeks from the time the register was supposed to come into operation.  I offer a suggestion to the Minister, although it may not be worthy of his attention &mdash;that it might be possible for the Minister or his advisers to start the making of the register a little earlier each year.  The revision inspectors take up their work in Dublin in the months of November and December, and the lists have to be in the hands of the printers by the 30th December, and to be published by the end of January.  The lists are long, and it means that the work is fairly heavy <Col N="61" /> on those who have to compile the register.  I wish the Minister or his advisers would consider the preparation of the register somewhat earlier, so as to give the local authority an opportunity of dealing with the matter without haste.  In this city, it requires some special consideration because of the many changes of residence that are taking place.  As the House is aware, a great number of the old residents have been shifted to the suburbs, where new housing schemes are springing up on all sides.  Should a local government election take place before the coming into operation of a new register, it will be a very awkward situation for those entrusted with the preparation of the election campaign or the revision of the electors' lists unless my suggestion is adopted.</P>

      <P>A number of the points raised are very interesting, and to some extent cognate to the purpose of the Bill, although not strictly within the terms of it.  With regard to the point made by Senator Douglas, I think he has been very fully answered by Senator Healy.  After all, this date, November 15th, has to be fixed with reference to the time which is normally required for the compilation of the register and the definitive settlement of it, and, according to what Senator Healy says, the existing period from November 15th to June 1st is scarcely sufficient for the purpose so that the argument might be that experience would seem to indicate that the qualifying date should not be the 15th November, but possibly a date earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the point raised by Senator Hawkins, of course one would first of all have to be assured, and have definite proof that the people who complain that their names have been struck off the register improperly did not receive the prescribed statutory notice.  I find it rather difficult to believe that a public officer performing his duties under pain of penalty for failure to perform them, would not meticulously comply with the statute and I could not assume, therefore, that people are struck off the register without due notice.  On the other hand, it may happen, and is much more likely to have happened, that the <Col N="62" /> people did receive due notice, but failed to take any action upon it. If people think so little of the vote that they will not trouble to see that their names are on the register, I do not think there is anything that other members of the community interested in public affairs should do on their behalf.  That also applies to the suggestion of compulsory voting.  I think that if there are public questions, and if people have not sufficient interest in them to make up their minds one way or the other, then the other members of the community might disregard their views and proceed, using their normal rational faculties to decide the questions according to their own opinions.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confer on sanitary authorities the right to take the water they require for the purpose of supplying their district with water.  The powers conferred by this Bill are alternative to and not in substitution for the powers conferred by the Public Health Acts.  Under their existing powers, sanitary authorities may purchase either within or without their district any lands covered with water, or any water or right to take or convey water.  But it is also provided in Section 286 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, that nothing in that Act shall be construed to authorise any sanitary authority to affect injuriously any river or stream or the feeders thereof, or the supply, quality or fall of water without the consent of riparian owners. Thus the right of a riparian owner to the natural flow of water, free from the interference of man other than the acts of other riparians exercising their own rights over the water, remains, and <Col N="63" /> it is settled law that a riparian owner is entitled to resist an encroachment on the channel of his running stream without proving either actual or probable damage.</P>
      <P>If the taking of water by a sanitary authority causes damage, compensation must be paid.  At the same time, when a sanitary authority has completed a water supply scheme, it must be secure in its right to take the water required.  Where the supply is obtained from flowing water, a sanitary authority could only be completely protected against injunction by obtaining the consent or acquiring the rights of every riparian owner throughout the entire course of the stream from the intake to the sea, irrespective of damage.  That would be a complicated proceeding in many cases.  The alternative in the Bill is simpler.</P>
      <P>The Bill defines the expression &ldquo;damage&rdquo; as the reduction caused by taking a supply of water in the value of any estate, interest or right in or in respect of land, or the damage caused to any trade, business or profession by the taking of a supply of water.  Whenever a sanitary authority desire to exercise their powers under this Bill to take a supply of water, they must make a proposal. In that proposal they must state the sources of water, that is to say, the lake, river, stream, well or spring from which, and the place at which they propose to take their supply.  They must also state whether they propose to take all or only part of the water and, if only a part, the maximum rate. They must also state the minimum summer level or flow of the water, and give particulars of any embankment, or dredging, deepening or other similar works which would affect the source of supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate at which water will be taken may not be the same at all periods of the year.  Where the summer flow is very restricted, it would be necessary to store water in a reservoir and no water may be taken at all.  Different rates may be stated for different parts of the year, but the maximum quantity to be taken during <Col N="64" /> a continuous period not exceeding one year must be stated.</P>
    <P>The particulars thus to be included in the statement of the proposal will enable a riparian owner to estimate the effect of taking water under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Having so made a proposal the sanitary authority must then take all reasonable steps to ascertain the persons to whom damage may be caused, enter their names in a book of reference, and give to every such person notice of the proposal.  The notice will contain a statement of the proposal, and will inform the person concerned that he may object to the proposal. Public notice of the proposal will also be given in the Press stating that any person aggrieved by the proposal may object; and the proposal and the book of reference will be deposited for inspection. A period of not less than one month is allowed for objections. A proposal will be deemed to be an agreed proposal unless an objection is duly made to it and is not withdrawn.</P>
    <P>If an objection is duly made, the sanitary authority may apply to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health for a provisional order declaring that the proposal may come into force, and on such application the Minister may make a provisional order in accordance with the application, or he may alter the proposal by inserting conditions as regards the taking of water, or the ancillary work, or reduce the maximum rate, or he may refuse the application.  The existing provisions of the Public Health Acts with regard to provisional orders and local inquiries will apply.</P>
    <P>If a provisional order is made, a person who duly objected to the proposal may present a petition to the Circuit Court praying that the provisional order shall not become law without further inquiry and the court may confirm the order with or without amendment, or may disallow the order. Where a petition is not presented the Minister may confirm the order without further inquiry.  A petition must be presented within five weeks.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that the effect of <Col N="65" /> an agreed proposal or the confirmation of a provisional order is not to bring the proposal into force nor to authorise the sanitary authority to take water in accordance with the proposal. The local authority, by virtue of an agreed proposal or a provisional order duly confirmed, can declare that the proposal will come into force on a stated day.</P>
    <P>This interval is provided so that the sanitary authority can carry out the constructional work involved in the scheme in the knowledge that no question as to water rights can arise. When the constructional work is complete they will give further notice that the scheme will come into force, not earlier than one week after the date of the notice and that persons, whose names are not included in the book of reference who claim that damage has been or will be caused may claim compensation within two years.  Notice of the coming into force of the scheme will be given to persons whose names are in the book of reference, and they will have one year within which to claim compensation.</P>
    <P>Any question of compensation for damage which cannot be settled by agreement may be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, and the Acquisition of Land (Reference Committee) Act, 1925.  These Acts constitute a reference Committee consisting of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Chairman of the Surveyors' Institution (Irish Branch).  That committee appoints qualified persons to form a panel of arbitrators, and from that panel an arbitrator is selected in accordance with the rules of the reference committee.  The decision of the arbitrator upon any question of fact is final and binding on the parties, but on a point of law a case may be stated for the opinion of the High Court. This code for arbitration is also applied to compensation under the Regional and Town Planning Act, 1934, the Public Assistance Act, 1939, and the Unemployment (Relief Works) Act, 1940.  Interest at 4 per cent. will be payable on the compensation awarded as from the date on which the taking <Col N="66" /> of a supply begins, unless an offer of compensation, equal to or greater than the amount awarded by the arbitrator, had been made by the sanitary authority and not accepted.</P>
    <P>This summarises the provisions of the Bill with regard to taking water. Other provisions of the Bill to which attention might be drawn are contained in Sections 17, 19 and 20.  As a preliminary to making a proposal, a sanitary authority must ascertain whether an adequate supply of water is available, and having carried out a scheme they must maintain the works. To enable them to do so, Section 17 authorises them to enter on land, for that purpose between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.  If urgent repairs are required to be carried out in order to prevent loss of water or serious injury to persons or property, they may enter at any time.</P>
    <P>Section 19 affords to sanitary authorities a measure of protection against injunction with respect to existing schemes.  As I explained earlier, it would be difficult for a sanitary authority in every case to acquire all the rights and obtain all the consents that would be necessary in order to be fully protected against all possible actions by riparian owners to restrain them from taking water.  If any damage has been done, the person concerned can claim damages, but he cannot stop the sanitary authority from continuing to supply their district.</P>
    <P>Provision with respect to navigation authorities is made in Section 20. Navigation rights have been conferred by statute, and those rights are preserved in this Bill so that a sanitary authority cannot exercise the powers under the Bill so as to make navigation impossible or unduly difficult.  If a question arises between a sanitary authority and a navigation authority as to the effect of a proposal, Section 20 directs the navigation authority to state their reasons why they think the proposal will affect navigation.  The sanitary authority must consider the objection and negotiate with the navigation authority for the withdrawal of the interference notice.  In these conditions it is reasonable to <Col N="67" /> expect that differences can be adjusted without reference to the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the House agrees, generally, with the terms of this Bill which, I presume, has been rendered necessary by the experience of the Ministry.  With regard to the principle of the Bill, there is no question, but there are one or two points on the sections&mdash;they are not fundamental points&mdash;to which I should like to make reference.  Under Section 15 (2) (b) the Parliamentary Secretary is taking power in regard to compensation.  It seems to me that there is something contradictory there.  We find the name of a person entered on the prescribed list&mdash;by, I presume, the engineer originally engaged on the scheme&mdash;as one liable to suffer damage.  When we come on to this sub-section, we find that the inclusion of the name of an applicant in the relevant book of reference shall not preclude the sanitary authority from contending that compensation is not, in the circumstances, payable at all.  That is an important point.  If, in the first instance, the sanitary authority, in the person of an engineer, after taking all reasonable steps, enters an individual's name on the list as one to whom damage may be caused, nothing will get it out of that man's head that damage has been caused.  Notwithstanding that, the sanitary authority may come on and argue that the first view was not correct.  That seems to be a contradictory line on which to proceed.  Perhaps I am not quite clear about it.  If so, I should like to be enlightened.  From the point of view of the riparian owner, it would be better not to enter the owner's name on the list, in the first instance, unless there is conviction that damage will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the same section, the arbitrator determines that compensation is payable and also that it may be paid at different times.  If compensation is to be payable over a period of years, where will the owner find himself if he wants to dispose of his holding?  That is a consideration which would enter into the mind of any owner.  If damage has been done and compensation is payable, <Col N="68" /> it ought to be paid to the owner during whose tenure the damage has been done.  Under Section 16, it is being laid down by law that, from the time compensation is determined until it is paid, interest will be paid at the rate of 4 per cent.  I think it is unwise to put that in an Act of the Oireachtas. It is not in conformity with the current viewpoint regarding rates of interest. The Government itself is not paying as high as 4 per cent., and it is a thing which we ought not to encourage.  I question the wisdom of inserting that in a statute.  The obligation will, apparently, remain to pay that rate of interest <i>ad infinitum.</i></P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary pointed out that under Section 17 it will not be permissible to go on to a farm between 6 p.m. and 9 a.m. the following day. I fail to understand why you put that limitation on your activities.  If it is essential to take water from any place along a particular route or road, and you decide to do it, I do not understand why you should say that you will not be at liberty to continue between 6 p.m. and 9 a.m.  The farmer does not stop work at 6 p.m. on a summer day. That should not be inserted in an Act. Regulations could be made under which the contractors in charge would be bound not to do certain things for certain reasons, but these limitations should not be put in an Act.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general question of providing water supplies, it is a very commendable work.  So far as it has been carried out, we must all approve of it.  It is essential to civilised life. While a great deal has been done in my own county, I think there is room for complaint.  There is a town in the county near the constituency of the Parliamentary Secretary where the residents have been endeavouring for a considerable time to get the board of health to do for them what they have been doing for the residents of other towns.  I refer to the town of Kingscourt. So far, they have not succeeded. They have appealed recently to the Ministry, and the last I heard, at the board of health, was a complaint that the fault was with the Minister that this town had not been able to get the facilities accorded to a number of other <Col N="69" /> towns.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to look into that matter, because, when amenities like these are being provided for towns, they should be distributed in a reasonably equitable manner.  Whether it is a question of prejudice, or whether there are difficulties which have not been revealed, these people have been denied facilities accorded to people elsewhere.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would now, or on the Committee Stage, give me some information on the matter.</P>
    <P>There is another matter on which I should like to get enlightenment. Whatever policy may have been pursued in other counties, in my county all the new water supply schemes which have been carried through or are in progress are being paid for by the ratepayers of the county generally. That was not an unwise decision.  It was a rather sensible thing to do, because if it had been decided that only those who would benefit would pay, or that only these and the people in the immediate vicinity, who get no benefit, would be obliged to share the burden, it would have been quite impossible to have gone on with a number of the schemes.  While farming ratepayers bear their share of the cost of providing water supplies for the residents of small towns, when a group of farmers themselves decide that they want similar accommodation, they have, according to my information, to pay for the installation of a pump or other equipment. That is after paying for the facilities for the townsmen.  That ought to be looked into immediately.  In my opinion it is not an equitable arrangement.</P>
    <P>If the law is such that it permits the sanitary authority, the board of health or the county council to supply water to a number of small towns all over the county, and to spread the burden of the repayment of the capital cost involved over all the ratepayers, there seems no justification for the system which ordains that if a number of rural ratepayers want such amenities as these, they must pay for them themselves, and the burden will not be <Col N="70" /> equally distributed all over the ratepayers. Water, as we know, is essential to life, but is especially essential to life on the land.  Anybody who has had to go through some of the trials we have experienced for the last few years to provide water for stock will appreciate the terrible waste of time that has been caused by scarcity of water which could be supplied through effort and organisation in our rural districts.  I think we should not only aim at providing water for the small towns, but that we should provide similar facilities for people in rural districts. If the law is that rural ratepayers have to bear their share of the cost where the people in the towns receive benefits, whereas on the other hand when they want any of these facilities themselves they have to bear the whole burden of the cost, I think it is a matter that should be reconsidered. That is a point on which I should like some elucidation from the Parliamentary Secretary.  Generally, I think there is not much to quarrel with in the principle of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>No Bill whatever dealing with any matter of public interest could possibly cover all the cases that might arise.  I have one peculiar case in mind.  A certain town has a water supply that does not cost the people of the town anything.  A benevolent person in the neighbourhood who operated a scheme for his own purposes found there was sufficient water to supply the people of the town also.  Except during a very dry summer, this supply is ample, but occasionally when very dry weather comes along there are complaints from people residing in portions of the town that happen to be on a somewhat higher level than the rest of it that the water supply is not sufficient.  The local public health authorities have been considering this matter, but the difficulty is that the really available sources of supply have been tapped by the private individual to whom I have referred.  If the local authority move now to provide an alternative water supply it can only be taken, I think, from the particular neighbourhood <Col N="71" /> where the existing water supply has its source.  A difficulty will then arise. If the local authority endeavours to tap the source of the existing private supply, it will deprive this individual of water entirely, and while the waterworks are in course of preparation, probably may cause his supply to cease altogether.</P>
      <P>As I said a moment ago, it is impossible to cover all these cases in any Bill, but in this particular case if the private individual in question were to decide that he needed all the water for his own use, and if he were to say to the people of the town: &ldquo;Well I am sorry, but I can no longer supply you with the water you have been using,&rdquo; the people of the town would find themselves in a very awkward position.  On the other hand, if the board of health decide to have an alternative water supply provided, it would entail an enormous expense on the district.  The present water supply costs nothing, except to maintain the pipe system through the town, and the people would seriously object to an alternative supply being provided that would entail a water rate in future.  The people living on the lower levels are satisfied because they say they have enough water, and they are in the majority. The people living on the higher levels, however, say: &ldquo;It is all very well for you, but we have no water during certain seasons, and we want an alternative supply.&rdquo;  These people are calling on the local sanitary authority to give them a supply.  What I want to get at is: Can the sanitary authority approach this individual who has been supplying water to the people, and say: &ldquo;You are not giving us enough water for this town; therefore, we intend to provide an alternative supply from this source?&rdquo;  This person may then say: &ldquo;Very well, I shall cut it off and you can supply your own water.&rdquo; Can he do that?  Has he power absolutely to cut off the present supply pending the provision of a supply by the sanitary authority, or, on the other hand, can the local sanitary authority compel this person to maintain the supply?</P>

    <P>In such cases as these, the people <Col N="72" /> would much prefer if some arrangement could be made by which the existing supply would be maintained in some way and supplemented, because they fear that if an alternative supply has to be provided, it will be a very expensive scheme, and will entail very very heavy costs on the people of the district.  This is a rather peculiar case. Probably there is not another like it all over the country, but it presents a problem to the people of this particular district, and I should like to hear the Minister's views on it.</P>

      <P>I am obliged to travel over some of the ground already covered by Senator Baxter.  In Section 16 it is provided that where a sanitary authority makes an offer of any amount as compensation to any person under the Bill, and the amount which the arbitrator determines to be payable as such compensation does not exceed the amount so offered, no interest shall be payable on compensation in respect of any period after the date of the offer. To my mind that is not just, because if a person is offered compensation for damage done to his property in the provision of a water supply, such person naturally feels that the amount of compensation is not sufficient.  If the matter then goes to arbitration, and the arbitrator is of opinion that the amount offered by the local authority is sufficient, the fact that he knows that such a person will not receive interest on the money will probably influence him to make some little increase on the offer in order to ensure that the applicant will receive interest on the outstanding amount.  I think it an injustice that no interest should be payable in that case and that is one clause that I feel should be eliminated from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the hours of entering on land, in Section 17, it is provided that any officer or agent of a sanitary authority who is duly authorised may enter on any land at all reasonable times to ascertain whether an adequate supply of water can conveniently be taken from a particular source or to repair or maintain any pipes, etc.  Sub-section (3) states that, save for the purpose <Col N="73" /> of carrying out urgent repairs, no person shall enter on any land between the hour of 6 p.m. and the hour of 9 a.m. on the following day.  I am rather puzzled to know how that would affect a county like County Galway. Let us assume that the county engineer has to enter on certain lands for the purpose of taking certain levels or carrying out any of the works mentioned in the section.  He may have to travel to some remote district in Connemara and may not be able to complete all his work on the day he arrives.  If this sub-section is carried, it may well mean that he will have to leave these lands at 6 p.m. and come back again the next day, or perhaps a month later, to carry out the small amount of work which remained to be done at 6 p.m. on the first day&mdash;if it is accepted that they are not to enter on the lands for the carrying on of general works, but only for the taking of levels.  I think that the officer of a local authority should be entitled to enter the lands at all reasonable times. Section 19 of the Bill says: &ldquo;Where a sanitary authority is, immediately before the passing of this Act, taking water from a source of water... no court shall grant or issue any injunction or order... to restrain the sanitary authority from continuing to take water from such source of water at the place, by the method or in the quantity at, by, and in which they are so taking water immediately before the passing of this Act&rdquo;.  Would that mean that although the sanitary authority was taking water from a particular source, we will say by the method of a two-inch pipe-line, and the engineer recommended them to increase to a three-inch pipe-line, that that could not be done?  That, of course, would not be altogether by the same method.  It would be more or less a technical point, as the quantity of water taken off could be greater in that case.  My point is, could not the court grant an injunction against the local authority carrying out such alteration or changing such methods or quantities?  There is another point.  We will deal with Section 22.  It says: &ldquo;Any expenses incurred by a sanitary authority under this Act for the purpose of increasing, <Col N="74" /> extending or providing a supply of water under the Public Health Acts, shall be raised and defrayed as part of the expenses incurred by such sanitary authority.&rdquo;  In Galway, particularly in the urban areas, I know many cases where residents more or less in suburban areas made application to have water extended to their streets and the local authority levied a charge and demanded that such persons should pay a contribution of from £5 to £10 before water would be conveyed to their places.  To my mind, it is not fair. Many of these people are large ratepayers. As a matter of fact I think Senator Baxter mentioned unfair charges where ratepayers were ready to contribute a share to set up and maintain their water supply.  It is not fair to ask such people, when extending a water supply, to make a contribution of from £5 to £10.  I think it is unjustifiable.  Will local authorities in future have power to levy such expenses, seeing that the section says that any expenses shall be raised and defrayed as part of the expenses incurred by the sanitary authority under the Acts?</P>

      <P>I am not sure whether it is relevant to the Bill, but most of these water supplies are initiated in order to provide water for small towns.  On the way from the source of supply to the towns there are very often a considerable number of villages not far from the pipe-line.  Does the Minister intend, when proposals are made, that persons who would have reasonable access to the pipe-line should have a chance of having the water brought to their houses as well as to the local towns? I raised a similar question, possibly the Parliamentary Secretary will remember, in the case of the Fire Engines Bill.  Large numbers of people have no chance of getting fire assistance but they are paying the fire rate. In the same way I feel it is the absolute minimum possible to put a pump on the side of the road near say, 20 houses, and I should like to have it made clear whether this Bill will give a chance of making provision to have that type of farmer who is outside the <Col N="75" /> town but reasonably near the pipe-line supplied.</P>

      <P>The point raised by Senator Foran is of very great interest in Galway, and I am very glad that Senator Foran raised it.  It would be well for the Minister to look into it, and if possible to amend the Bill, providing that public authorities will take such steps as will ensure that a water supply would not be a danger to public health.  I was interested in what Senator Baxter said about the supply of water to the farm house.  That is of great interest to women, especially women on the farms, and I hope that something will be done on the lines suggested by Senator The McGillycuddy. While this is not quite pertinent to the Bill, but it is in some way cognate, it might be possible that people should be enabled to put in winchargers.  It would help them to have a supply of water in the houses and also to have electric light.  It is done extensively in rural areas in America, and there is no reason why a young up-coming nation like Eire should not try and ease woman's burden to that extent.</P>

      <P>The debate we have had has been more in the nature of a Committee Stage than a Second Reading debate, and some of the <Col N="76" /> points raised would probably require examination between this and the Committee Stage before they can be fully disposed of.  Now, dealing with Senator Baxter's point first, in Section 4 of the Bill, it is stated that: &ldquo;Whenever the sanitary authority have made a proposal they should do the following things&rdquo;.  A number of things that the sanitary authority is under obligation to do is there set out, and among those things they shall take all reasonable steps to ascertain the persons (if any) to whom damage may be caused.  The names of persons to whom damage may be caused in the opinion of the sanitary authority would be recorded in the book of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter makes a point then, on Section 15 2 (b):&mdash;&ldquo;the fact (if it exists) that the name of the applicant is included in the relevant book of reference shall not preclude the sanitary authority from contending that compensation is, in the circumstances, not payable at all.&rdquo;  We have moved on from Section 4. In Section 15 we have reached the stage where arbitration is about to take place, where damage is being claimed and the case is being referred for settlement to the arbitration tribunal.  Under the section, the sanitary authority is given what appears to me to be the reasonable right to contend that the person is not injuriously affected at all by the taking of water, notwithstanding the fact that the name has been put in the book of reference as a person who may be adversely affected.  The sanitary authority in compiling the names of the persons who may be adversely affected will presumably be generous in their interpretation of the extent, if at all, to which persons may be injuriously affected in order to afford such persons an opportunity, at any rate, of claiming compensation, but I do not think they should be deprived of their right to argue in the arbitration court that in fact, while they have put them in the book of reference, they are not injuriously affected.  I think that is reasonable.  They give them an opportunity of coming forward by putting the name in the book of reference. If you like, it is <i>prima facie</i> evidence <Col N="77" /> that they are in fact adversely affected but, at the same time, they ought to be permitted to defend themselves before the arbitrator as best they can.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that the individual acting under the sanitary authority's instructions who will compile the first list will presumably be the engineer to the sanitary authority? Would it not also be the same engineer who would be expected to go then and argue before the arbitrator that no damage was done?  That is the situation which is not quite clear to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite, but in the meantime, as Senator Baxter will appreciate, from the time the book of reference was compiled, the scheme may, in fact, have been modified by agreement, and while they might have been adversely affected by the original scheme and their names recorded in the book of reference, at the time it would come before the arbitrator they might not in fact be affected at all. However, I will look into the matter further, but I do not think there is very much in it.</P>
      <P>On Section 15 (c) Senator Baxter referred to the arbitrator's power to decide the time or times at which compensation shall be paid.  I do not think that there is anything sinister in that paragraph.  It is really intended to enable the arbitrator to fix by agreement&mdash;after all, his findings will be more or less agreed findings&mdash;a possible system of payment by instalments. Undoubtedly it is conceivable that that might give the arbitrator power to drag out compensation over a long period, but I should think that where the amount of compensation is within reasonable limits and within the resources of the sanitary authority to discharge it within a short time, it would not be stretched out over a long period, but it is conceivable that compensation in certain circumstances might be very high and the sanitary authority might require a reasonable period within which to reach a final discharge of their liabilities.</P>
      <P>Several Senators referred to Section 17 (3):&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Save for the purpose of carrying <Col N="78" /> out urgent repairs, no person shall enter on any land under this section between the hours of 6 p.m. on any day and the hour of 9 a.m. on the following day.</P>
    <P>Ordinary inspections&mdash;in fact any activity of the inspectors of the sanitary authority or of the central authority, other than urgent repairs&mdash; are not matters of urgency and, while I am quite open to conviction on the matter, I do feel that the owner of the land is entitled to some privacy, and that if inspectors are given the statutory right to enter between 9 a.m. in the morning and 6 p.m. in the afternoon, I very seriously doubt if they should be given a statutory right, for ordinary inspectorial purposes, to enter at a later hour.  Senator Hawkins raised the point that a man may be travelling in the wilds of Connemara and may not get his work finished at 6 o'clock and if he does not continue after 6 o'clock in the evening he may have to go back that long journey the next morning.  Such a thing is undoubtedly possible but that presupposes that the owner of the land would come along at 6 o'clock and say: &ldquo;Your statutory right to remain on my land ceases at 6 o'clock.  You had better get off.&rdquo;  I do not think that would happen in actual fact.  I think that it will be very rarely that a riparian owner or owner of lands affected will object to the inspector being there at any time of day or night that suits him, but, at any rate, I still think that, when we are giving the inspector a statutory right, for ordinary unurgent purposes, to enter the land between 9 o'clock in the morning and 6 o'clock in the afternoon, we are going far enough.  However, if there is any strong feeling on the point we can consider the position again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Senator Baxter, I think, was the first to raise the point, but it was also raised, I think, by Senator The McGillycuddy, as to the possibility of providing water supplies for villages and groups of rural dwellings. So far as this particular measure is concerned, it is an enabling measure conferring powers on sanitary authorities to provide water supplies without any regard to geographical distribution.  It does not specify either a rural area or a town or village.  Presumably, there will be many other questions to be considered by a sanitary authority before they proceed with a scheme for a rural area, but within the framework of the Bill, it is possible to provide a water supply for any group of citizens, either within or without an urban area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Goulding raised a point about the protection of existing water <Col N="80" /> supplies.  Existing water supplies are protected under Section 19.  Whether that affords suitable protection of the nature Senator Goulding has in mind is a question I could not determine without having an opportunity of examining it, but, at any rate, if and when this Bill becomes law, existing water supplies will then be protected against injunction in so far as no change is made as to the quantity, the method, and the place from which the water is being taken.  I think that disposes of a point raised on the same section by Senator Hawkins as to whether if a sanitary authority found a 2-inch pipe was not giving sufficient water they would have full protection under Section 19 against action by persons affected if they put in a 3-inch pipe.  They would not.  They are protected in so far as the method, the quantity and the place at the time this Act becomes law, but if they want to take more water, or use a different method, or tap it at a different place, they must proceed by a new proposal. They can, under the Bill, make a new proposal or make the necessary modifications in their proposal, but they cannot solve it in the rough and ready way which Senator Hawkins apparently has in mind.  Senator Hawkins raised a point about Section 16 (b).  His complaint, I think, was that the arbitrator can offer a bigger amount than might have been offered at first, and that interest will not be payable if the amount was less than the amount offered before he went to arbitration.  I do not think there can be any great objection to that.  The provision is intended to discourage refusal of a reasonable offer.  I think we have disposed also of Section 17 (2) and of the new proposal in Section 19.</P>
    <P>The only point I have not dealt with is one which has been raised by Senator Foran.  It is an important one, and I will have to look into that matter between this and the Committee Stage.  I am not so sure that this is an appropriate place to deal with it or how far sanitary authorities are already armed with statutory provisions that enable them to prevent pollution of a source of water, but this Bill, at any rate, deals only with proposals <Col N="81" /> to secure a supply of water, and I doubt if we could appropriately deal in it with the point which Senator Foran raises.  At any rate, if sanitary authorities have not statutory powers to enable them to protect the source of their water, we will all be in agreement that they should be armed with such powers, and if it cannot be got into this Bill, then at the first available opportunity, the matter would have to be dealt with.</P>

As a rule, it is a matter of negotiation between the local authority and the Minister&mdash;that is my impression.

      <P>That Seanad Eireann is of opinion that Emergency Powers (No. 98) Order, 1941 (Compensation) Scheme, 1941, dated 17th September, 1941, should be revoked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this motion, not because I object to the compensation for personal injury but because it is the only course in order to have the matter discussed.  It will be in the recollection of members of the House that the question of damage to property by bombs or other kind of war action, whether accidental or otherwise, was dealt with in a Bill and was discussed here in what turned out to be a very fruitful and, on the whole, a satisfactory manner.  No doubt for good reasons, the Minister chose to provide for compensation for personal injury, not by way of an Act of Parliament but by way of a Statutory Rule and Order under the Emergency Powers Act passed at the beginning of this war.  The difficulty of procedure by order is that the Minister is never called upon to explain the order in detail and we are in a different position from the one we occupy in dealing <Col N="83" /> with a Bill, as a member of the House has to initiate the discussion and give his own rendering&mdash;which may not be correct&mdash;of the meaning of various parts of the order.  I want to deal with the order with regard to its principles; I want also to deal with certain specific points in the order; and I want to argue that the order needs very drastic amendment, and that in some particulars it could be amended without any extra outlay to the State.</P>
    <P>The order deals with civilian casualties only and expressly excludes members of the Defence Forces, Gárda, the Local Defence Force and the Local Security Force or A.R.P. Services. While I am on that point, I might ask the Minister to tell us when it will be possible to know what precise provision is being made for members of the Local Defence Force and Local Security Force who are injured while on duty.  I have not been able to find any order at home dealing with these matters.  I believe I am right in saying that the general principle on which this order is based is that compensation is to be paid only for injury and dependency: no compensation is granted under these provisions for what one might call sentimental loss. Perhaps we cannot disagree with that. The general principle of the order is that it recognises the necessity for compensation by the State for dependants of persons fatally injured and makes provision for persons either injured totally or to a degree.</P>
    <P>Another very important principle that goes with that is contained at the end of the Order in Rule 36, which states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where compensation might be granted under this scheme, the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, either make or refuse to make such grants.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It should be understood, therefore, that any person who is injured by bombs dropped deliberately or by accident in this country or by any form of war action in this country has no legal right whatever to compensation under <Col N="84" /> this order.  The grants contemplated, although they are set out in detail, are entirely <i>ex gratia.</i>  The Minister reserves to himself&mdash;why he does it I cannot quite understand&mdash;the right to refuse to compensate.  It seems extraordinary that, under the Damage to Property Act, it is provided specifically that a person whose property is injured can go to the courts, while a widow whose husband has been killed by a bomb dropped from an aeroplane has no right to go to the courts at all. She makes application to the Minister and, under Rule 36, which I have read, the Minister may, it would appear, entirely refuse to grant compensation.</P>
    <P>The order deals with two distinct things&mdash;with disablement and fatal injury.  In regard to disablement, it provides that a maximum figure of 30/- a week is payable.  That figure applies to a single man, and to a married man no matter how many dependents he may have.  Therefore, the maximum figure obtainable by a married man totally disabled, with a wife and five or six or even ten children, is 30/- a week.  Not only is that the maximum he can get from the State, but elaborate precautions are taken in this order to ensure that he can get nothing else either from his employer or any form of local or public funds.  I will deal with that later.  I do not understand by what process the Minister arrives at the conclusion that an employer should not be allowed to supplement the very meagre State grant in this case. So much for disablement.  With regard to compensation for fatal injury, the maximum sum that goes to the dependents, the wife and children, is £600.  It may be considerably less, but that is the maximum contemplated by the order, less any sums which may at the date of death be due to the State and less any sums granted <i>ex gratia</i> by an employer.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree that these terms are not generous.  I do not think they are just or well thought out. The order contemplates a flat rate of compensation and ignores all differences of earning power.  It is quite unlike the Acts which regulate compensation <Col N="85" /> for civil injury&mdash;for example, in the case of a person run down by a motor car.  In that case there are what are called Lord Campbell's Acts, where compensation is based upon the loss occasioned by the death or injury of the person concerned in the accident.</P>
    <P>This order contemplates a flat rate &mdash;the same compensation, and very meagre compensation&mdash;for everybody independent of overhead expenses, independent of commitments, independent of his children's prospects before he was killed.  It is based upon the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  The Workmen's Compensation Act of 1906 was, of course, a substantial change in English law.  It has been amended since&mdash;I think we had an amendment here in 1932&mdash;and the figure of 30/- a week for the person totally disabled is, I think, taken from that.  But the Workmen's Compensation Acts are now recognised as inadequate and anomalous.  Frequently attention is drawn in the courts by the judges to the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Acts which make it difficult to arrange the compensation on a rational or equitable basis.</P>
    <P>In olden times the doctrine of common employment&mdash;as lawyers call it&mdash;obtained; that is to say, if I were injured by a person in the same employment, the employer had no liability whatever.  In fact, the view taken of a workman was that, if he were injured, fatally or otherwise, that was too bad; but no liability fell on the employer, and the widow or crippled man was left to the workhouse or the charity of his fellows.  The Workmen's Compensation Act is an improvement &mdash;but not a very substantial improvement. I think everybody recognises that, even to deal with the things for which it was intended, it needs substantial amendment.  I want to suggest that the adoption of the Workmen's Compensation Act rules and sums for these particular persons is what I might call a lazy solution of this matter.  It was there to hand and was accepted, taken and put in.</P>
    <P>There is no analogy whatever between <Col N="86" /> a person injured by a war machine and one injured in employment. The employer is one individual or a firm, responsible only for a limited number of people.  There is no analogy at all between the liability of the State for its citizens and the liability of an employer for his employees.  It is a handy scheme for the Minister to adopt, but it is quite inequitable and unsuitable.  I suggest that the war has made many changes and has made people change their ideas in regard to various matters.  In the present circumstances, it would have been much more enterprising and much more just to devise a scheme to deal with this kind of personal damage.  I might recall to the Minister's mind, <i>en passant,</i> that after 1916, when funds were collected to compensate widows and men who had suffered imprisonment or wounds, both the National Aid Fund and the White Cross Fund made a distinction between persons from the point of view of their earning powers. Similar minimum regulations for compensation for wounds pensions recognise differences between officers and men.</P>
    <P>I understand that British Army allowances, since conscription, have different scales for different persons, according to their overhead costs, their educational commitments for their children and so on.  So much for the principle.  I see no analogy whatever between the Workmen's Compensation Act, which is applied in this case, and the situation which the order is intended to meet.  I think that the principle is thoroughly bad and that we need a different one.  If we are to have a different one, I suggest that it should be based on Lord Campbell's Act, that earning capacity should be recognised to some extent and that compensation should bear some relation to the actual loss.</P>
    <P>Since I shall have no other opportunity of doing so, may I put to the Minister some detailed points with reference to this matter?  Section 8 of the order sets out the rate of compensation for disablement.  It appears that, in the case of a non-earner aged 18 years or over, the total amount of <Col N="87" /> compensation is to be 18/-.  I wonder if that puts the non-earning widow and the earning widow in completely different positions.  It seems to me that it does.  Eighteen shillings is the maximum that can be got and one cannot claim from any other source.  The non-earning widow is at present receiving 10/- widow's pension.  If, unfortunately, she is totally disabled, the amount rises to 18/- under this order and her children's allowances continue, as before, under the Widows' Pension Acts.  On the other hand, if a widow who happens to be an earner &mdash;a school teacher whose husband is dead and who is supporting a family; a doctor or a nurse&mdash;is totally disabled, her income drops to 30/-, no matter what it was before, no matter how many children she has and no matter what her liabilities may be. That seems to me to be unfair.</P>
    <P>Section 9 (2) of this order provides that when a person is granted compensation, after the qualifying injury, he cannot receive any other pay, pension, or allowance from unemployment assistance or otherwise or any sum paid by his employer which would bring him to a higher figure than the figure contemplated by this order.  I fail completely to understand why that should be so.  Why should an employer be prevented from recognising the good services of an employee who may have been a long time in his service?  As I understand this order, the employee of a firm like Guinness could not get any compensation from the firm which would bring him to a figure greater than that contemplated by this order nor could his widow receive such compensation or pension, if he were to die. It is characteristic of the Department of Finance, if I may say so from long acquaintance, that the Workmen's Compensation Act is adopted in its entirety when it is against the interests of the claimant, but is not so adopted when it favours him. Under the Workmen's Compensation Act a man can get compensation and can also receive any amount which his employer may choose to give him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="88" /> Under this order, a man cannot get anything extra without having that money taken out of the State grant. The State considers the amount given and the State benefits accordingly. Of course, that can be evaded and avoided, but it cannot be evaded or avoided by big firms such as Guinness, to which I have referred.  I do not understand why the word employer is put in there.  I could understand the Minister saying that, after all, compensation from State funds comes from the same source, and that, therefore, the total amount to be got from local and State funds should be so and so.  That is arguable. One might say that the amount was small, but the principle would be sound.  But why an employer who wants to recognise an employee's service should be prevented from doing so, as he is under this section, I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the order deals with payment of medical fees.  It has one very peculiar repercussion which I do not think has been provided for.  Section 10 provides that the Minister may, out of the compensation paid, make a payment of £25 to a medical practitioner or hospital, or, presumably, divide it between them.  But take the case of a child under 14 years of age. In the case of a child under 14 years who is injured, no compensation becomes payable until the child attains its 14th birthday.  That is an extraordinary provision.  How is a child of eight who is injured to be maintained between eight years and 14 years?  If, as we must unfortunately contemplate, the child is in need of medical and surgical attention, how is that attention to be paid for eight, six, five or two years?  The maximum figure appears to be £25.  I do not know if the Minister can enlighten us and say that the matter has been seen to and that this is his real decision.  I doubt very much if that decision would have been reached if the situation, as I put it, had been adverted to.</P>
    <P>With regard to Part 3 of the order, which deals with compensation in fatal cases, it is contemplated that members of the family may be dependants.  There <Col N="89" /> is one notable exception to members of the family which, I think, is included in other cases, the adopted child.  No provision is made here for the adopted child.  I think such provision should be made.  When the point is made to the Minister he will, probably, agree because everybody knows cases of people who have adopted a child legally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that there is no legal adoption here but we all know cases in which a child has been adopted practically and morally.  The people concerned have taken all steps necessary to support the child and it could easily be established that the child was entirely dependent upon them.  The income-tax authorities recognise the responsibility of the foster parents.  I think an adopted child should be recognised under this order because, if the breadwinner is killed, the adopted child is just as much at a loss as if it were actually the child of the deceased.  I should like to see included, though I know it is not included in the Workmen's Compensation Act, provision for an aunt or an uncle because it is a fairly common thing here to have a nephew supporting an aunt.  If a nephew be killed, the dependency of the aunt should be recognised, provided it can be proved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have another peculiar provision in Section 21.  I had some difficulty in believing my own reading of the section, and I have a sort of lingering hope that my reading of it may not have been right.  It appears to me that if the dependant of a deceased person dies before payment has been made, that dependant will not be included in the compensation granted. I do not understand that at all. Surely payment should be made from the happening of the injury and on the basis of the circumstances as they were on that date.  Dependency should be recognised from that date until the date of the death of the dependant child or adult.  It seems to me extraordinary that, if there are five children, <Col N="90" /> if a claim is made and one or two years elapse before payment of the claim, one of the children dying a year and eleven months after the injury takes place and the Minister making his award on the following day, no award can be made for the child who died although it had to be supported for a year and eleven months.  One wonders what provision there is to meet the expense of supporting the child in that period. Again, this is taking the simplest book-keeping line, just as the Revenue Commissioners often prefer an income-tax of 7/6 to an income-tax of 7/3, because a tax of 7/3 is hard to calculate.  They never leave it at 7/- instead of 7/3 because it is handier.  Similarly the figure here is handier, but it seems to be entirely inequitable and wrong. Section 22 appears to mean, although I am very sure it does not, that the medical attendants and the undertaker will share all the compensation in respect of a person who leaves no dependants.  I am sure the Ministry of Finance will amend that if that is the proper interpretation of the section, but the other matter is much more important to amend.</P>
    <P>Section 26 (b) provides that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;if any <i>ex gratia</i> payment has been made by the employer of such person on account of such injury the Minister may withhold or reduce any compensation payable under this scheme in respect of such injury.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the equitable justification for that?  What justification is there considering the meagre terms that are given under the order?  If a widow is going to get £600 for herself and her six children, what justification is there for taking out of that £600 the £50 or £60 which the employer of her husband may have given her as an <i>ex gratia</i> payment?  I do not understand that position and I have not had much time to look through it but there are many cases where a person gets a year's salary in such circumstances.  There may be even a statutory right to a year's salary in some cases.  If a civil servant has a statutory right to get a year's salary, he will get this compensation also but if a person has not a <Col N="91" /> statutory right to a payment of that kind, and the employer, recognising the circumstances, makes a payment out of his own pocket, then the Minister may subtract that amount from the amount of the compensation awarded.  That seems to me to be an invidious proposal and I do not understand it at all. Remember the employer who makes this grant has to pay income-tax on it. The State does not lose anything on it at all.  The State permits a great many inequalities but that it should endeavour to benefit by the generosity of an employer to the widow of an employee or possibly the employee himself, is something that is very difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>In Section 29 of the order a very different principle, of course, is applied.  If anybody gives you anything the State will take it, but if you owe anything to the State, the State will also take that.  Section 29 is similar to a provision which we had in the Damage to Property Act.  Section 29 provides that the State will get its pound of flesh from the widow of a person who has been killed by war action.  It seems to be an extraordinary situation and a great contrast with Section 26 (b).  If an employer gives you anything the State takes it and the State makes sure that if you owe the Government anything, even if you have your income-tax paid up to the last period, the State will take out of the very meagre compensation whatever other income-tax has accrued between the period of the last payment of income-tax and the period at which compensation is paid.  That smacks too much of the Shylock method.  After all, take the case of a person who was liable for income-tax, an earner with a good earning capacity.  He may have practically no property.  He is killed by a bomb.  The compensation granted to his dependents is very small but out of this, whatever it is, the State makes sure that it will get whatever amount of income-tax is due.  That seems to me extraordinary.</P>
    <P>I do not want to stress this matter further, but I should like to hear from <Col N="92" /> the Minister something about these various provisions.  I should like to know why in circumstances which have no analogy whatever to workmen's compensation, the principles of the Workmen's Compensation Act were adopted.  I should like to suggest that it is not envisaging the problem in the correct way to take such an extraordinarily inadequate scheme as the scheme of the Workmen's Compensation Act and apply it to civilians who are injured.  I do not think any citizen would object&mdash;any citizen who survived with his health and his earning capacity unimpaired&mdash;to seeing proper compensation given to persons who presumably will be in a minority because this, like the Damage to Property Compensation Scheme, contemplates a state of neutrality.  I do not think any citizen would object to seeing his less fortunate fellow-citizens who have been injured put into the best possible position they can be put.  It would be much better if the principle were adopted of recognising a man's earning capacity than to take this flat rate scheme, which is unjust and inequitable.  I should like to put it to the Minister that the order is one which could easily be substantially improved on reconsideration. Whether the actual basic rates are improved or not, there are many things in the order which could be improved without any substantially increased expenditure to the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the motion moved by Senator Hayes.  I agree very largely with what he says and I should like to hear the Minister dealing with the points made.  I am not quite sure, however, that I agree with him that this is a motion simply brought forward for the purpose of having it discussed.  As far as I am concerned, I should be prepared to vote for the motion because I am convinced that this order provides no equitable method of dealing with the problem with which it purports to deal. To my mind, this method of dealing with people who may find themselves in our front line in the World War is miserable, to say the least of it; I am not sure that it is not dangerous <Col N="93" /> viewed from a broader standpoint.  I want to draw the attention of the House to this contrast.  It is only a very short time since we spent a considerable time debating a Bill to provide compensation for damage to property. That was brought in, as it should be brought in a democratic country, by means of a Parliamentary measure. It was debated, amended, and, at any rate, received full discussion.  That dealt with property; this with life.  This order provides compensation for people who may lose their lives and leave dependants or compensation for people who may be more or less permanently disabled, possibly disabled for life. What do we do for them?  For all our democracy, we have an emergency order made by the Executive which does not even provide a statutory right to compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a statutory right when we are dealing with property but no statutory right when we are dealing with what I think is fundamentally more important than property, the question of the welfare of human beings.  What do we find in it?  As Senator Hayes has pointed out, it is simply an optional scheme.  I have no doubt that the present Minister intends to provide compensation in each case which is proved to the satisfaction of the officials, but this is not a matter solely for the Department of Finance nor for the Minister for Finance.  It is a question of our responsibility as members of Parliament representing the citizens of the State.  It is not a matter of saying the Minister for Finance might have been more generous or the Department might have provided a more generous or a better scheme.  That is not enough. Parliament and the people of this country are responsible for the way they are going to treat the individuals who may find themselves in the front line.  I am convinced that this is the wrong way to do it.  Now I did not get a copy of the Dáil debate yet.  It had not arrived and I have not read last week's debate.  I did read a newspaper report and I was left with the impression that the attitude of the Minister for Finance was something <Col N="94" /> like this, that he would be extremely happy if it were possible to act more generously but having to face the present financial position he regretted that it was not possible to do so.</P>
    <P>I think it is quite possible with the present attitude of the people, which I can only characterise as apathy, that if I were Minister for Finance I might take the same attitude.  For that reason I am not in any way attacking him or his Department.  I believe there is extraordinary apathy on the part of the people&mdash;apathy as to the world position of which we are a very small part.  I do not think we realise what is happening in the world, but I am convinced, as the very existence of this order and the previous Bill for compensation shows, that although we may unitedly endeavour to keep out of this war, we cannot keep away from the possible effects of it.  We do not know whether they may be small or large, but we do know we are asking our people to stand together and to take certain risks.  What do we do in this order? We say to the people: you join the Army or some other service that may take you away from your home and this is the way we will treat your dependants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing about the Army in this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but I am saying that in effect we are saying to men who join the Army and other State services that this is the measure of treatment we give to their dependants and to the people.  I do not know how the Army or the A.R.P. services are to be dealt with and I am not dealing with them, because it would be out of order to do so in this debate.  We know there is a good deal of apathy and a good deal of failure to realise the position.  I want to draw the attention of the House to what I believe to be the fact, that there is a principle involved in all this.  In the last Great War men were sent out from various countries.  Some of them that came back were permanently disabled. Is it not well known that all over the <Col N="95" /> world people who came back after the last war were forgotten, and left with a miserable pittance?  There was hardly any work for them.  That was not confined to any one country and I am not at all sure that that was not responsible for the spirit that made another war almost inevitable.  We may say we are not immediately responsible for that, but we are responsible to this extent, that we should see that right principles are adopted in our little corner of this world.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that it is not a right principle to base compensation for those in our front line in this way. Can anyone deny that civilians have been in most countries more in the front line than the armies?  That may not apply to Russia, but it does apply to a good many countries.  The civilian is now just as liable to be in the front line as the military.  I believe that you cannot deal with this on the basis that this emergency order covers all the liability we may have to those who have lost their lives.  It should be withdrawn, but perhaps not immediately and a measure should be brought in and Parliament should face the matter fairly and decide what is the reasonable method.  I do not think you can fix it at 30/- a week.  A maximum of £600 invested in State loan will give less than £20 a year income.  That is the maximum income which presumably can be obtained only by a dependant with other dependants. What can you do on an income of £20 a year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this particular order is not fully known.  People know vaguely that the amount is 30/-.  If we look across the Channel we find that they were not able to continue with promises of small payments. They have had to accept a very considerably higher standard.  What is happening here is that numbers of our people&mdash;whether we agree with them or not&mdash;whom we honour&mdash;went to join forces outside this country.  A very large number, whether they found it necessary to do so or because <Col N="96" /> they wanted to, have gone to earn their livelihood in the neighbouring country and thereby subjected themselves to certain risks, but are entitled to certain rights of compensation. Is it wise to say that if an Irish citizen goes across to England and gets caught by a bomb the dependants would be very much better treated than we would treat them if he were struck by a chance bomb here?  I cannot deal with the position of people in the forces because that is not in the order, though I think the compensation should not be less.</P>
    <P>We will be told and with very considerable reason: Look at the financial position.  Can the country take more taxation?  I do not think it can.  I believe we are going to face in our personal capacity and as a State one of the most difficult years.  There will have to be cutting and it may be that every one of us will have to do with drastic cuts.  It may be that we will have to do with a much less expensive Government.  I suggest that it is not safe and that we cannot afford to tell people that those who come through this struggle safely can go right ahead as before, and that those who do not come through safely are to be left to be compensated on the basis that is provided in this order.  I am giving a purely personal point of view on which I feel rather strongly.  Senator Hayes has dealt with most of the points of this order in his criticisms and I do not want to repeat them, but I draw attention to the fact that, if I read this properly, a child under 14, who is permanently disabled, is treated by the State as somebody for whom the State has no responsibility at all.  He is out of the scheme, unless I misread No. 5 of Article 8.  I hope I am wrong.</P>
    <P>Again, I would like to emphasise that it seems to me that if there are private individuals, employers or others, who are able to supplement this amount, the State should encourage and not discourage them.  I think that principle is also wrong.  There is a provision made here which, I think, is a perfectly right one though it may cause <Col N="97" /> some hardship.  I refer to No. 33.  It provides that you cannot assign the right to compensation or the compensation you may obtain for the purpose of meeting a debt:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No payment under this scheme shall be capable of being taken in execution or otherwise alienated by process of law for the discharge of any debts or liabilities of the person to whom such payment is due.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we have any bombing here and somebody, through kindness, lends something to someone who has been hurt pending their getting compensation, under this article that loan cannot be secured by means of any legal claim.  I agree that it should not be but, when you come to the State's claim, whereas the private person who does a kindness and who advances some money cannot get any security, the attitude of the State, expressed in Article 29, towards any claims it may have is totally different.  I think that is completely wrong, whereas I think the other is right, even though it may cause some hardship.  It is typical to some extent of the whole attitude.  I think the attitude I adopt is quite different from that taken by a very considerable number of people in this country, I think it is quite likely that I am in a complete minority but I believe that the world of to-day is learning that individuals who may suffer as a result of this appalling catastrophe with which the world is faced cannot be left simply to struggle along afterwards.  I know that here and there all over the world statesmen and others are at any rate making promises and realising that the principles of lease and lend and all these other things will have to be extended to the rehabilitation of persons in their homes and taking care of those who may be left.  I, personally, fear that if this order gets to be understood &mdash;as it will, slowly and gradually&mdash;there will be intense dissatisfaction in the knowledge that our standard is one of the lowest in the world.</P>
    <P>It is provided here that if a claim is made by the State to any other <Col N="98" /> Government the Minister may&mdash;it does not say he must&mdash;pay to the claimants of any approved claim an amount not exceeding the amount which may be received from the other Government. I want to draw your attention to the position.  Supposing a British plane accidentally comes down here and does a certain amount of damage, the Minister will presumably be entitled to make a claim.  On what basis is he going to claim?  Presumably he would claim on the basis of the amount which would be paid if that person was living in England and had been accidentally injured by a plane in England.  That, to the best of my information, is considerably higher than what we are providing here.  I am told it is more than double.  Is not that a strange inconsistency?  I am dealing with one simple case, and I do not think it will give any offence to Great Britain because we know it has occurred.  I do honestly feel that the whole principle of this thing requires consideration, not simply an amendment of the details.  For that reason I second, and intend, if it is put to a division, to vote for, the resolution proposed by Senator Hayes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not here, unfortunately, when Senator Hayes opened his speech and I am not quite sure whether or not he proposes to put the matter to a division, but I feel that there is a good deal to be said for Senator Hayes' point of view and, while I agree with some of what Senator Douglas has said in support of it, there is a lot in what he said with which I do not agree.  We cannot look very lightly on this matter and, when I say that, I mean that we cannot take the attitude that we should go headlong into expenses the limits of which we cannot attempt to estimate at the present time.  We must remember that the taxpayer may have to be called on to foot the whole bill. We have had several speeches in the past&mdash;and rightly so, I suppose&mdash;from Senator Douglas objecting to taxation being placed on individuals and on industries to meet various expenses, and it is quite possible that we may have further speeches from Senator <Col N="99" /> Douglas when this bill will have to be paid.  However, as I say, I am in agreement with a good deal of what has been said and I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter altogether, and perhaps, if I may say so, remould the order nearer to the heart's desire.  I believe something could be done even if greater expense had to be incurred and I believe that a good case has been put up for at least an alteration in the order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is another instance of the failure of trying to legislate by order.  Apparently the Bill which was introduced has given fairly general satisfaction because all Parties had an opportunity of giving their views on it and, so far as I know, there is no grievance.  But here we have, as Senator Douglas very properly put it, more importance attached to property than to human life.  When we are dealing with property we institute legislation. When we are dealing with human life we make an order, which is not a very substantial thing to go on and the only opportunity we have of giving our views on these matters is that provided by Senator Hayes' motion.  I am not at all in agreement with a lot of what Senator Hayes has said.  For instance, I would not at all agree that compensation ought to be on the basis of the social standing of the person killed or injured.  I think all citizens of the State who may be killed or injured by accidental bombing are entitled to equal treatment and only equal treatment.  I am not at all in favour of the arguments used by Senator Hayes, but in the course of his remarks he contended, and I do not know how far he was accurate, that a person receiving this compensation was denied the right to obtain compensation or allowances from any other source.  I hope that is not true, because I have in mind a very large number of people who contribute to national health insurance.  If these people are incapacitated, surely they are entitled to draw their benefits from that organisation, and, similarly, in the case of employers who may have sickness or injury funds for their employees, <Col N="100" /> surely the relatives should be allowed to receive that compensation?</P>
      <P>I am anxious to hear the Minister on that point, particularly in relation to people who have been paying contributions to national health insurance. If they are going to pay them a miserable 30/- a week, do they intend to deprive them of their statutory rights to national health insurance, because if they are permanently injured, they are entitled to the same amount of benefit?  I hope that the argument of Senator Hayes is not correct, and that the Minister will be able to tell us that people who have contributed to National Health, or other provident societies, are entitled to the benefits accruing from the making of these payments, and that notice will not be taken of them in allotting compensation which, I believe, is 30/- a week.</P>

      <P>I would like to say that I am in agreement with Senator Quirke in asking the Minister to give consideration to the arguments which have been put forward here.  I know it is not easy to devise a suitable plan &mdash;it was a new danger sprung upon us &mdash;or to arrange quickly to alleviate the sufferings of the victims.  There are also the difficulties that Senator Douglas mentioned of the people who have suffered in the front line.  We might all be in the front line and, therefore, it is not possible for the State to plan with the same degree of accuracy, or the same approach to accuracy, as if the danger were limited. We have to bear that in mind and try to understand the state of mind of the Minister when he approached this problem of compensation, but the discussion has shown that a great many hardships, a great many snags, have been encountered in the proposals embodied in the order and what I wish to do is to join my voice with that of Senator Quirke and the other Senators in asking the Minister to reconsider the whole position.</P>

      <P>I am entirely in favour of what Senator Douglas and <Col N="101" /> Senator Hayes have said with regard to this order.  I had hoped that a Bill to deal with the matter would be introduced, instead of an order, so that we would have some opportunity for discussion on it as we had on a previous Bill relating to property damage which, in my opinion, was not so important as this one.  I quite realise that the Minister is always up against the question of finding the money and everybody is willing to criticise when the Budget is introduced, and practically all the year round as well, with regard to taxation, but I hope sincerely that the sum involved will not be very extensive, and even if we have other visits or incidents of the same nature, it would not come as a big burden on the whole State when it is a State charge.  We have had experience of the amount of work that was done here and the amount of compensation that was issued entirely voluntarily, in the last 25 years.  One point I would like to make is this: As far back as 1916, 32/6 could be allowed by an entirely voluntary association to a single man, 30/- now, in my opinion, would be entirely inadequate to meet the present cost of living, even if a widow had no dependants at all.  I also ask the Minister to reconsider the whole order, and I support Senator Mrs. Concannon and Senator Quirke in urging him to try to find a solution to help the unfortunate people affected by that affair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCampbell" hpid="Mr. Campbell Mr. Campbell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the motion.  Both Senator Hayes and Senator Douglas made excellent cases for the revocation of this order.  I think the Minister ought to reconsider the whole position in regard to compensation, and more particularly that section that any grant made by an employer would be deducted from the ultimate compensation awarded to the victims of the different forms of injury specified under this order.  I do not altogether agree with Senator Foran that he should not have regard to the position of a person awarded compensation under the order.  I think that some regard would have to be given to the position of the person so injured. In my opinion, a strong case has been <Col N="102" /> made, not for revocation, but for the reconsideration of this order, and I would like to add my voice to those we have already heard in favour of that.  The Minister has, hitherto, been sympathetically disposed to requests from this House, and I hope on the present occasion he will find it convenient to reconsider the whole position, and at least to make alterations that will be more acceptable to the people, more particularly in that section which provides that any sum given by an employer by way of compensation should be deducted from the final amount.  That is a peculiar principle to establish in an order of this kind, and I think it is altogether outside the scope of the consideration of a Minister. I hope he will give consideration to the matter of the whole order.</P>

      <P>I think it is fairly well accepted in the House here that the Minister for Finance, more than any other Minister, is fair game for attacks on all occasions.  He is attacked when he brings in his Budget providing for the cash necessary for the carrying on of the institutions of Government and of the State, and this year there was no shortage of circumstances for complaints of a grievous kind around the time that the Budget was discussed here, but no more than when it was discussed in the other House.  Also, when the Compensation for Damage to Property Bill was under discussion here, the House will remember the not very generous encomiums which were passed upon the Minister for Finance for his scheme of compensation.  It was mean, ungenerous, skinflint, and God knows what other adjectives of the kind were used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Finance I have to remember that we may have to pay all this compensation.  Bearing that in mind, the Minister may have to put on additional taxation.  Since I became Minister for Finance I have never hesitated to say that we are a heavily taxed country at present.  Our taxes&mdash; income-tax, direct and indirect taxes and the taxes on industry that have been referred to already, and those <Col N="103" /> which we have in a variety of other ways&mdash;have brought us almost to the limit of taxation, as far as the number of taxable things is concerned.  Everybody here, no matter how small his amount of tax&mdash;direct or indirect, and particularly direct&mdash;knows that position. Income-tax is heavy, and probably it will be heavier.  That is what I have to bear in mind.  It is all very well for individuals to get up and say that we should be more generous, that we should treat these people with greater liberality; but the same people, including Senator Douglas, will be eloquent and vociferous in their denunciatory attacks upon me when I come to the House to ask for approval for a Bill to increase the taxation.</P>
    <P>Nobody will be more eloquent on that subject than Senator Douglas.  I am not saying that he is not sincere in asking for greater compensation for these people.  I am not saying that he would not like to see these people get greater compensation: I believe he would, and that he is sincere in asking for it, but he should try to remember the other side of the story as well.  He does not do that to-day, and will not do it when I have to ask for a heavier rate of taxation when the next Budget comes round.  I cannot in justice claim for the scheme that it is a generous one, but we cannot put ourselves financially on a basis of comparison with the British.  First of all, they are the richest nation in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment. There is no other nation or State or Empire which can compare with it&mdash; none of them.  We cannot compare with them.  We do not value the life of any citizen any less than the citizen of Britain is valued by that State or Empire.  I would say the same with regard to any other country.  There are people here as willing to give service <Col N="104" /> and risk their lives&mdash;and they have proved it in the past&mdash;as any citizen of any other State.  They risked them when there was no promise of compensation of any kind for the risks they ran and the dangers they brought.  I would like to be thought as soft-hearted and generous even as Senator Douglas, but I have the responsibility of the State's finances on my shoulders and I have to think what the burden of injury to person and property may be upon the citizens of this State.  One cannot measure it now.  If we had any measuring stick to go by, perhaps we could afford to be more generous, but we do not know what it is likely to cost us. That is one of the greatest difficulties. We have suffered certain injuries to persons.  We are dealing with personal injuries at present although the injuries to person took place a good many months ago, in some instances&mdash; I think in the North Strand there were over 20 lives lost, unfortunately, in that calamity&mdash;yet we have received only three applications up to the present for personal injury in cases where there was loss of life.  Why there was delay I do not know.  It is very hard, therefore, to get any measure of what the claims may be and what even in one year the final figure that we have to deal with may be.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Hayes that there are items in this scheme which certainly do not show the Government or the Minister for Finance in a very generous and large-hearted light, but the Minister is not put there to be generous; he is put there to be the guardian of the nation's purse, though not to be ungenerous and certainly not to be unjust.  If I were dealing personally with this matter from the Opposition side, like Senator Hayes, I would probably speak as he has spoken; and if he were in my position he would probably be more effective than I am in speaking of this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very disarming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my position. Attention has been called to certain paragraphs in the scheme.  I went through this with the officials. <Col N="105" /> It is based on the Workmen's Compensation Acts and embodies the principles laid down there.  Senator Hayes says that these are out of date. Well, they are still the law of the land, and it is on that basis that workmen's compensation is paid.  I think there is a great deal to be said for the point made by Senator Foran that you cannot take the earning capacity into consideration in paying compensation of this kind.  Senator Foran described it as social distinction.  It would be very difficult to have a scheme so elastic that you could take into consideration the earning capacity or social position of the individuals injured.  The same principle would have to operate in the organisations that have offered services to the State, such as A.R.P., Local Defence Force and Local Security Force.  I am not saying that it would be impossible to discriminate to some extent, but it would be very difficult and it would give rise to very great dissatisfaction in the various organisations.</P>
      <P>As to the point raised by Senator Hayes and other Senators about deducting the amounts given by employers, that is in the Workmen's Compensation Act and it is also in the British scheme and in other schemes of the sort which I have seen.  However, I am quite prepared to re-examine it. We cannot deprive people of their statutory right to national health insurance but I think the intention is that it should be deducted.  I am prepared to look into that matter, too. This order is not, in precise legal parlance, a statute but it will have full statutory effect.  Senator Hayes mentioned Rule 36.  That is only put in to give the Minister discretion with regard to exaggerated or false claims.</P>

      <P>In the order, the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used throughout but it is intended that that word will have the force of &ldquo;must&rdquo; and that the Minister will have to pay the compensation set out in the order.  A question was asked by Senator Hayes about the amount to be paid for medical or hospital attention.  The £25 referred to will be in addition to any compensation paid.  That is one small item in respect of which we did not stick closely to the Workmen's Compensation Act.  We have increased the amount which may be paid for medical or hospital fees.  I am prepared to look into the question of the adopted child but I am afraid that our legal advisers will question our power to put that in, as there is no legal adoption in this country.  I have an idea that I raised that question before when I was in the Department of Local Government and that I was told I had no power to put such a provision in because there was no such thing as legal adoption here. However, I am prepared to look into the matter again.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes and other Senators referred to the non-payment of compensation to children under 14 years. There, again, the principle underlying the scheme is that of the Workmen's Compensation Act.  It was not usual to pay weekly benefit to children under 14 under that Act though medical benefit could be paid for injuries.  The school-leaving age being 14 years, payment of compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act was not permitted until after 14 years.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad is of opinion that the regulations in regard to petrol rationing should be more strictly enforced and that distribution should be restricted as far as possible to the requirements of essential services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset, I should like to give the House one or two figures which may be of value in getting a clear understanding of the position of motor traffic in this country and the supplies we have available.  A good many Senators will probably know that there are three figures of importance.  The first one is that up to the end of last year, 1940, our income from motor taxation was £915,000, a very considerable part of our revenue.  It had fallen to that figure from something over £1,000,000 previously.  Motor vehicles at the end of 1939, which is the latest date for which I have got definite figures, were <Col N="111" /> divided as between private cars, 52,000; commercial vehicles, 10,000 odd, and tractors, 1,200.  I understand that the number of private cars has fallen very considerably since, and that the number of commercial vehicles and of buses has increased.  The number of tractors has also gone up.  The third point is that we have been promised a total quantity of 20,000,000 gallons of petrol per annum, but in actual fact the whole of that quantity of petrol has not reached this country for the past year.</P>
    <P>I put down this motion because I feel that we have for the past year not only been condoning some very flagrant breaches of the law but we have been wasting a commodity, the enormous importance of which to the whole of our industrial and economic life, we do not yet seem to have sufficiently grasped.  We have got no emergency reserve.  We are living by the assistance of our neighbours, hand to mouth, and we are living with the assistance of people who themselves are rationed and who have very important preoccupations, preoccupations which appear to be getting daily more serious.  Before I put down this motion I read the report of the debate in the Dáil very carefully.  The motion proposed there asked for a commission.  I have approached the matter on rather different lines.  I agree with the Minister's outlook as indicated in his reply to that debate, but I felt that discussion here might be also useful.  I felt that when I put down the motion and I have been immensely fortified in putting it down by the number of people in every walk of life who, when they heard I intended to bring forward such a motion, wrote to me to say: &ldquo;For goodness sake do not do it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The proposer of the motion in the Dáil made the point that the rationing scheme had not been conceived so as to give an adequate amount of petrol to essential services and that a black market was naturally the result of that. The Minister in his reply did not deny the existence of a black market.  He agreed that it was there.  He said that it was possible to devise other means <Col N="112" /> of distribution but he concluded by saying that in his view a ration based on the horse-power of cars with a supplementary allowance for certain people who wanted more, was the best system of distributing petrol.  That is the system he has adhered to from the beginning.  He then gave the Dáil some broad figures to indicate what the situation had been and what it is at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Minister went into detail over the month of September last.  Well that month serves pretty well as an example for the remainder.  The figures he gave were, private cars, 143,000 gallons; commercial vehicles, 400,000 gallons; hackneys and that type, 139,000 gallons; Government services, 41,000 gallons; rail and bus companies, 184,000 gallons; industry and agriculture, 70,000 gallons, and two types of supplementaries which I have added made another 65,000 gallons.  That gave the total figure of 1,086,000 gallons in that month.  I think when the Minister gave these figures&mdash;I am not quite clear about it from reading it&mdash;he had before giving them subtracted the 1,000,000 given to the Army and the wastage which occurs. Whether that is correct or not I do not know.  Well neither speaker in the end made any really constructive suggestion for improving the situation which a very great number of people in the country, to say the least of it. regard as being unfortunate.  We started with a very simple, easy, cut and dried plan.  That has gone on without any variation in spite of the experience which has been gained since its inception.  Now this motion infers that there is an illegal traffic in coupons which are issued to specific individuals for definite purposes and if that inference is correct it means that petrol is being given to people who do not require it at the expense of those who do.  That is really an extremely wasteful procedure and I am asking the House to say that steps should be taken to put the whole position on a better basis than it is at the present time.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to take up the time of the House with specific instances. <Col N="113" /> Anybody can put up cases&mdash;doctors, racing people.  If one started <i>raméis</i> on those lines it would go on for ever. All of us to be quite fair know of professional types and concerns which are not getting sufficient petrol for their requirements.  What I would like to do is to try to direct some of the spare petrol to these people who are serving the public and who now have to supplement their supplementaries by illegal means in order to do so.  I am not such an optimist as to think that a position like this can be cured entirely, but I say this: if the thing is really tackled it may be made at any-rate less immoral than it is at the present time.  Up to the present you may say that a petrol coupon has been a Government cheque for a specific quantity of the commodity for any car in any place, and I feel sure it was not the original intention that this should be so.  I believe that if steps were taken really to enforce the law over and above the recent order which has come out, then the Minister would have a surplus which he could use for reserve or other purposes.  I took some trouble in examining and working out the machinery which was required to get some way out of this. But I do not propose to go into the details.  I will only mention two main things, and that is that coupons with counterfoils should be perforated not with the registration but the engine number of the car before being issued at Ballsbridge, and, secondly, that retailers should be forced to enter certain details in books for inspection. There are other very important details which I do not propose to raise here. I think that if that happened you would not have what has been going on up to the present, that is to say, a two-gallon coupon for a seven horse-power car in Donegal being cashed in Cork for a 30 horse-power car.  If locomotion were restricted there would not be the same desire and wish to pay 5/- to 10/- for coupons.  There are no doubt many ways of getting over any rule which is made, but there is also a very large number of ways of putting on the screw.</P>
    <P>I feel that if the Minister asked the Gárda and the detective force really to <Col N="114" /> take the matter seriously they would clear up this without very much trouble.  That brings me to the second part of my motion.  At the moment we are entirely dependent on two countries for our motor spirit, Great Britain and the United States of America, which are the only countries which can bring it to us.  I feel that our position under present circumstances lays on us a humanitarian obligation to ensure as far as we possibly can the lives of seamen are not risked in bringing petrol for other than what you may call essential purposes.  I use the word &ldquo;essential&rdquo; in a wide sense of the word but I feel that certain types of things should be restricted.  Most of us remember when we managed to do at different times of our lives without motors at all.  There is no great competition now and it seems to me hardly necessary that people should be able to hire cars for long journeys over this country.  I have particulars of such being done almost every day.  A great many of these journeys are made and they are no contribution whatever to our national necessity or national economy. I suggest, therefore, that the Minister should limit this type of locomotion and direct the petrol, say, into the more deserving tanks, those of the business and professional people, and keep the locomotion local instead of universal, as I said before, throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Finally, a word as to the practicability of devising means of improving the present method of distribution to the advantage of those who are not at present able to work to full capacity. Would it not be possible to delegate the examination of all applications for petrol to the county council authorities and the chief superintendents of the Gárda Síochána?  I feel that they have a very much more intimate knowledge of the circumstances of every one of the motor-car owners in their districts. The Minister would allot to each of these divisions, say, three-quarters of his available petrol.  He would start by keeping one-quarter in reserve and, having done that, he would allot it in proportion to the number of vehicles, private cars, machines and industrial <Col N="115" /> plant in each district.  I intend that he should adhere to the basic ration. That would remain the keystone of the whole system but I think I should also ask him to lay down the general lines on which distribution should be made. I think there should be a definite division between the private car which is used partly for pleasure and partly for business and the private car which the Gárdaí and the county authorities would say was used purely for private pleasure.  I think in that way you would start to increase the amount of petrol available for supplementaries and put it in the right place.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the Dáil that this would lead to a lot of criticism and that he felt to allow that criticism at all would be wrong and unfortunate. I cannot agree with him on that.  I know that there would be all these different accusations of political and other favouritism, of loss of employment, loss of revenue, that people, in theory, would shut up their cars&mdash;in practice I do not think they would&mdash; that officials had too much to do and the Gárdaí would have too much to do. All these things would be poured out, but I think they would very soon die and I feel that it is the duty of the Government to stand up to these things, not only to stand up to them, but I think it is their duty to put down abuses such as those to which I have attempted to draw attention.  I think that the public services which are still short of petrol and which require it should get it.  Finally, I think there should be, in the very serious circumstances that exist, more forethought for the future.  I do not want to repeat the words of the Minister, but he said he was working from hand to mouth and is giving out everything he can get and creating no reserve.</P>

      <P>I see very considerable difficulty in administering this matter, and I think the Minister is right in so far as he shut the door on individual discretion.  I know I tried &mdash;and I made a very strong case&mdash;for an extra supply and I was told there was no discretion whatever being exercised and I felt that was fair because the position of having to exercise discretion between private owners would be impossible.  I do not think the county council or the Gárda Síochána would be able to do it with any sense of justice.  I have not given much thought to this question except so far as any person who has to deal with this thing every day naturally cannot help thinking about it.  I feel that in so far as private cars are concerned there is really not much to complain about.  If the private car owner does not use all his petrol I think it is right, if he likes to give it to somebody else, that it can be done. There is a large quantity being used in that way.  The trouble of the black market arises from two other sources &mdash;the lorry owners and commercial vehicle owners and from the hire of hackneys.  There, I think, the Government should take steps to enforce the law to the utmost.  It is very wrong indeed that hackney car owners who get petrol for a certain purpose should sell it in any shape or form, if their cars are not in demand.  I think the Government should put all the machinery they have got to stopping that.  The same way with commercial vehicles.  It is utterly wrong &mdash;it is criminal&mdash;that commercial concerns who get petrol for commercial purposes should use it for any other purpose.  As far as the machinery goes, I do not see much source of improvement beyond the enforcing of the law to make sure that petrol given for commercial or hackney purposes is used for no other purpose.  I think that would place the whole matter on as satisfactory a basis as it can in practice very well be put.</P>

      <P>I intervene in this discussion because at the present time there is a good deal of dissatisfaction expressed in County Clare at the way petrol is being distributed to the essential services.  At the last meeting of the Clare County Council it was stated quite definitely, by responsible members of the county council, that there was not sufficient petrol to carry on ambulance services in a certain part of the county.  That is a very serious matter.  It is a matter of life and death.  In the flat distribution of petrol to medical men, the same amount of petrol is given to a doctor working in hospital in Dublin as to a doctor who has to travel 30 or 40 miles, say, in a sparsely-populated area in Clare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether Senator MacDermot is deputising for the Minister for Supplies or not.  Candidly, I would prefer that the Minister for Supplies should tell me that than Senator MacDermot.  I do not see why the Minister should hand over the baby to the doctors and ask them to formulate a scheme.  It is the Minister's responsibility to formulate such a scheme, and it is his duty to appreciate the difference that travelling ten miles in one place may take three hours, while in another case it may take as little as three-quarters of an hour, and where even one life may be in danger that some provision should be made.  I am not speaking without some knowledge of the matter because an authority in the country, speaking for the medical profession, has said that the matter requires examination and recasting.  I do not know whether the Minister knows the configuration of certain counties&mdash;he ought to know, anyway.  A doctor in a country area is not like a doctor in Dublin who can jump on a bus or a tram and travel very conveniently to his patient.  In the country, a doctor may have to travel ten or 15 miles to visit some sick <Col N="118" /> person, and if the ambulance service were to be held up, how are the patients in the country areas to be attended to?</P>
      <P>The Minister will possibly tell us there is not sufficient petrol to enable the country doctors to do their rounds. I do not know what is the position in regard to petrol.  All I know is that in my dealings with the Minister for Supplies I could not get any petrol for people who were prepared to drive me around.  At one time, petrol was supplied to Deputies and Senators up to a point, and then that was stopped. and I was unable to get petrol for a good many drivers who were willing to take me in their cars if I could get it for them.  Yet the very Sunday before this complaint was made by a public body in Clare, there were 17 motor lorries careering around the county&mdash;I do not know with what effect&mdash;bringing a few hundred men of the Local Defence Force to parade before a saluting base in Limerick.  I do not know what purposes the 17 motor lorries bringing a few hundred men to parade in Limerick were intended to serve in the matter of defence or training, and I do not know how many lorries were used in Tipperary or Kerry.  I put this thing in all seriousness before the Minister, because it is important in rural areas, and it is very hard to put a man of 45 or 50 years of age on a bicycle and expect him to do the work he used to do with the motor car.  It is certainly not just and not fair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather surprised when I read this motion because I did not know what my friend The McGillycuddy had in mind. and I have not been made very much wiser by the speech which I have heard.  I have some experience in the distribution of petrol and know a little about it. Private cars have been referred to.  So far as I know, there is hardly such a thing as a private car at all, because every car is used for some business purpose, in one way or another. Hackney cars are also very essential, because a great number of people have given up their own cars altogether, and the only way they can get to their <Col N="119" /> places of business is by means of a hackney car.  I would not suggest that it should be used for long journeys if trains were available, but in a county where the train service is very small, the hackney car provides a very necessary service.</P>
      <P>My friend Senator Hogan has referred to ambulances that have not sufficient petrol to do their work.  I am aware that the contrary is the case.  They are given, as well as I know, a reasonably ample supply, but it is often a question of distribution. One hospital in County Clare is about 25 miles from the point of distribution and all those things have to be fixed in regular order.  They will come in and ask for a supply of petrol the same evening, and that could not possibly be done, because all distributions have to be routed to prevent a petrol lorry from running in and out with a few gallons at different times to each customer.  In some cases, the hospitals themselves require reasonable reorganisation in order to give the distributing centre a chance to supply them.  Taking all in all, between transport, hackneys and hospitals, and I am closely connected with the thing for a long time, I do not know that there is any ground for the allegations which we have heard about the distribution of petrol. There is always a little leakage in every form of organisation, but outside the small leakage, I think petrol distribution generally is on a very sound basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>When I read this motion of Senator The McGillycuddy, I was wondering what kind of speech he would make, but, having listened to him very carefully, I am quite satisfied that I was right in thinking that he was completely out of touch with the position here as it actually exists.  Anyone would imagine from Senator The McGillycuddy's speech that there was wholesale evasion of the laws and wholesale disregard for all the regulations. I can assure the Senator that this is by no means the case, and even if he were to go on a whole-time job with the Minister for Supplies, who is, <Col N="120" /> all will agree, a very efficient man at his job, there would be just those little incidents here and there&mdash;those things cannot be avoided&mdash;but to say that there is anything like wholesale evasion of the regulations is completely fantastic, and a terrible exaggeration of the actual position.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Hogan's statement on petrol in Clare, I think I am right in saying that the Minister for Supplies has already refuted it by giving the actual figures.  He showed, at any rate, so far as I could read it, that the coupons for the petrol were actually in the possession of the Clare County Council at the time it was alleged they were not able to run the ambulance.  In connection with the 17 lorries which Senator Hogan said were touring County Clare, I think it is in fact a bigger exaggeration than the greatest exaggeration of Senator The McGillycuddy.  Senator Hogan paints a picture of 17 lorries touring County Clare and says that they carried a couple of hundred men to parade in Limerick.  I was in Limerick, and I did not count the lorries, but I did hear Senator Hogan's leader, Deputy Norton, say on the platform that it was one of the proudest moments of his life, that nothing ever gave him such pleasure as the fine parade on that occasion and more phrases of that kind, and I am sure he felt a certain amount of pride when he saw the men from the Banner County passing by, and thought of his colleague, Senator Hogan, and how proud he would feel if he were there also.  I think it is ridiculous for Senator Hogan to try to belittle a parade such as the parade in Limerick.  If we could only produce parades of that kind in every county, the question of our defences would be regarded as safe, having regard to our capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to Senator Hogan's views on the good of parading men in Limerick, those who are regarded as the best authorities on military matters we have got, and members of the Defence Conference composed of all parties, are agreed that such parades serve not only a useful purpose, but a very useful purpose, and should have the <Col N="121" /> support of all sections of this House and outside of it.  Rather than try to build up bogeymen, if you like to call them that, in connection with this petrol business, a far more useful purpose could be served if the members of this House and other people who have influence in the country would start a campaign to get back to the horse.  Nobody needs to be a prophet to say that inside 12 months petrol will not be as plentiful as it is now. Neither will fuel be as plentiful.  If we could make people horse-minded again, as they were before, and bring them back to the old custom of using horses for every kind of transport, we would be doing more good than we are in criticising the Minister for Supplies because he is not able to pull petrol out of his hat to oblige us&mdash;and if he does pull it out of his hat, we will criticise him because he gives it to certain people and not to others.</P>
    <P>We have as many horses in the country as we had before the people went crazy about petrol and before we started driving motor cars and using tractors for ploughing.  We have those horses and no outlet worth talking of for them.  In the national interest, the trend should be to put these horses to work.  We know the work can be done with horses&mdash;it was done before&mdash;and if there is any lesson to be learned from this war it is that we should not depend on outside sources for our means of tilling the land and transporting the produce to the mills and elsewhere. We might as well be dependent on shipping for our wheat as be dependent on shipping for our petrol supplies if we continue to depend on these petrol supplies for the production of that wheat.  We have still the horse and have men capable of working horses, and it is only a question of a push.  I would suggest that the Minister for Supplies and the Minister for Agriculture should lead that push to put the horses back on the land.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to take up the time of the House on the merits and demerits of the supply of petrol, <Col N="122" /> but it struck me when I saw this motion the other day, that, in view of what has happened over the weekend when the world war blazed up, Senator The McGillycuddy's motion may scarcely be worth while at all.  It is very doubtful if, in the next month, there will be such a thing as imports of petrol at all, or for that matter of a good many other items.  So, in another short while we would not be arguing as to how petrol should be distributed, but as to how to carry on services that we had, without cars at all.  That is a bald fact we have to face in the future.  I am not a prophet, but I believe we will have no petrol in a short time.  Instead of grumbling to ourselves about the shortcomings and difficulties of the present time, it would be far better for us to make up our minds and have confidence in ourselves, and make the most use of the things we have in peace in this country to-day and minimise the small number of disadvantages. We are a very lucky race. That is the general summing up I put on Senator The McGillycuddy's motion.</P>
      <P>The Senator mentioned the question of taking numbers of engines instead of ordinary methods and gave one case.  Let me give one personal point of view regarding that, in connection with the supply of turf.  A lorry-owner getting coupons for the transport of turf has many forms to fill in.  He has to say where he wants the turf, to whom he has sold it, the mileage between collection and delivery points and the number of tons carried by each lorry for which he wants coupons.  Every minute and every mile has to be accounted for in the petrol consumption.  These forms must be filled up in the most minute detail.  As the result of that system, quite a large number of lorry-owners who originally claimed they were prepared to haul turf but who were not in a position to say that they had purchased any or sold any, were completely eliminated from any supplies of coupons.  That is one typical example as to how tightly the Department of Supplies governs the issue of coupons for commodities such as turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="123" /> The same applies, as a general rule, to every other claimant for kerosene or petrol.  He has to give engine numbers and full details.  The man who has a threshing set must say for whom he is threshing, the amount of threshing for each person, how long it will take to do it, and he must also give the engine number of the threshing set.  A man who is falsifying these returns may not be caught the first or second time, if he is claiming a large amount of petrol or kerosene that he uses in a day's work.  He will trip up sooner or later and will regret it, as he will go out of business if his returns are not honest.  What better system is there, or what better idea can anybody suggest to the Minister to-night, than the one already in vogue?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many people colouring a lot of things in the world to-day.  Senator The McGillycuddy mentioned the question of people hiring hackney cars and going long distances. I agree that the principle is wrong but, on the other hand, the hackney people are dependent on their cars for a livelihood.  A sort of vested interest has grown up there.  Surely to goodness, if a reasonable amount of petrol is available, it is the responsibility of the Minister to show his sympathy for those people and try to maintain their means of livelihood to the best of his ability.  Surely it would not be fair to restrict the places a man would go or the distances he would travel.  He may be able to make his livelihood with one man on one journey, instead of making half-hour or one-hour journeys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you start interfering with the liberty of the subject in that way, it is hard to know where it will stop.  It would not be fair to the hackney proprietor to say he will be put in a ring or within a certain limit, in order to obtain his livelihood.  That would be a serious matter.  On the other hand, there is what is known as the utility car, which is very common in the countryside to-day.  Those utility cars <Col N="124" /> have been and are being used more for sporting purposes than anything else. That is something that the Minister might investigate.  A larger supply of petrol is given for that utility car than is given for the commercial traveller or the user of a private car for business purposes.  There might be a case for examination there.  I am satisfied that there is a case for examination.</P>
    <P>With regard to private cars generally, when the Department of Supplies decided to give a small allowance to private cars it put the mechanic back into work.  I know that from observations made by garage owners.  It is the experience of garage owners and of some members of the motor society that more employment is provided by repair work in connection with private cars than by any other branch of the business.  If that is so, then it justifies the action of the Minister for Supplies in giving a small supply of petrol to private car owners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="McGillycuddyReeks" hpid="The McGillycuddy The McGillycuddy">
      <NameTxt>The McGillycuddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the House misunderstood me on the subject of private cars.  What I said was that I would stick to the basic ration as the keystone of any altered system, but that it all hinged on who would get the supplementaries.  I had no intention to take a single private car off the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about the supplementaries but, considering the difficulties and the general selfishness of outlook of a lot of people, much of the criticism levelled against the Department of Supplies in connection with petrol and other things is completely unjust.  Perhaps, before the war is over, the people who are shouting most will realise how stupid a lot of their talk was.  I do not know what the percentage supplementary allowances are of the total amount issued, but I am sure it is small and hardly worth talking about.  There is a lot of criticism about supplies being issued to private persons.  Senator Honan suggested to-day&mdash;and it is true&mdash;that the bulk of the private cars one sees on the roads are being used for business trips.  The number of private cars on the roads now is infinitesimal <Col N="125" /> compared with the number on the roads in peace time.</P>
      <P>One sees very little travel on the roads except by lorries.  One sees a score of lorries hauling turf which is practically the only commodity being hauled on the main roads between Athlone and the West.  The best proof that the distribution of petrol must be as fair as it is humanly possible to make it is the return of railway receipts, both traffic and passenger receipts.  They have jumped to such an extent that lorries and cars must be off the road.  We have to admit that, generally speaking, we are in a very happy position.  There is hardly a fireside in the world that is not affected in some form or other by this war.  The extent to which people are affected in this country is slight compared with the troubles of people in other countries.  Motions of this kind are superfluous in the present situation.  It is indicative of a certain amount of rotten outlook in the country that we should have this sort of motion in this House and the other House.  In the near future, we may have a lot more to grouse about.  The people may have to suffer many jolts before peace is reestablished in the world again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that this debate has been very enlightening or instructive.  Senator The McGillycuddy did not give us any concrete cases of abuse.  The only case referred to was one the mention of which by another Senator will be disapproved of by everybody in the House.  I refer to the transport of the Local Defence Force.  When volunteers give their services to an organisation like the Local Defence Force, this House should not grudge them transport to a parade which was demonstrative and educative to the country.  I think that that matter should not be raised in the House.  It did not involve any waste of petrol.  I have no constructive contribution to make to the debate but I would appeal for better supplementary allowances to veterinary surgeons practising in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the fact that doctors will get increased supplementary <Col N="126" /> allowances by making applications to their associations.  The secretary of the Veterinary Association has made appeals on behalf of veterinary surgeons and, unfortunately, has been unsuccessful.  A veterinary surgeon in the country has to travel far greater distances than has a medical practitioner and his services are essential to the farming community. Besides, he has to carry equipment which cannot be carried on a bicycle or on horseback.  Although one might say that a veterinary surgeon should travel by horse, he cannot cover the long distances he is required to travel on horseback, nor can he carry the necessary equipment.  I appeal to the Minister to review the cases sent him on behalf of veterinary surgeons in the country. That is to suggest an increase.  I cannot suggest whose allowance should be cut in order to provide that increase.</P>
    <P>Senators may ask, when they see a lot of cars parked in O'Connell Street, where the owners got the petrol.  We are oftentimes led astray in connection with cars parked in this way.  The basic allowance for a small car is four gallons.  I certainly think that the person who licenses his car and contributes to the revenue of the local authority is entitled to that allowance. As a member of this House pointed out, some of that petrol is used to take invalids to Mass on Sundays.  Seeing cars parked outside churches on Sunday, I came to the conclusion that there was a waste of petrol.  On examining into these matters, one finds that there is no waste.  A large number of these cars were, probably, used to take invalids to church.  The same applies to racing.  We see cars at races and we think it is a waste of petrol.  But racing is subsidised by the State and, if people do not come to the meetings, the meetings will be a failure.</P>

      <P>You cannot park a horse as conveniently as you can park a car.  What seems a waste of petrol is, oftentimes, not really a waste at all. As an ordinary individual, I think the <Col N="127" /> forging of these coupons should have been detected far earlier.  It is all very well to say that the Department did not know they were being forged but I think the forgery should have been detected long before it was.  The fact that so many coupons were forged and petrol obtained on the forgeries suggests that there must have been a surplus somewhere from which they were able to draw.</P>
      <P>If we are going to endeavour to prevent the forging of petrol coupons in future a saving of petrol will result, and that petrol should be made available for legitimate car owners.  That is one source from which an additional allowance could be made available for members of the veterinary profession. Senator The McGillycuddy mentioned that we were not building up any reserve, but the fact that it was possible to get petrol by means of forged coupons shows that some little reserve must have been there.  Perhaps there is a variation in the amount of petrol which is wasted by evaporation during different seasons.  I do not think that the evaporation in winter is as considerable as in summer, and that fact also would allow of some additional quantity being made available.  The final remark I have to make is that perhaps we shall be lucky if it is possible to continue to distribute the quantity of petrol which is made available at present.  We shall be very lucky if we succeed in maintaining that allowance in future.</P>

      <P>The motion of Senator The McGillycuddy refers to two separate aspects of the problem of petrol distribution.  It asks that petrol rationing should be more strictly enforced and also that distribution should be restricted as far as possible to the requirements of essential services.  I shall deal with these two matters in the order in which the Senator raised them.  I should like the House to understand, in the first instance, that it is conceivably possible to devise a more effective system of enforcing rationing than that in operation but the problem that faces anybody who has to devise a plan for <Col N="128" /> controlling the distribution of the supplies of any commodity is how to obtain the greatest possible degree of compliance with the regulations with the least possible amount of supervision. Persons on the outside who are concerned only with the effectiveness of the regulations and who see loop-holes in these regulations and even instances of their successful evasion, do not concern themselves with the other aspects of the problem of the administrator or the deviser of the plan of control.  Nobody would have any difficulty in devising a watertight system of distributing petrol or anything else, if he had at his command the services of a Gestapo or of some secret agents who could travel all over the country, riding on the carriers of cars or if such agents could walk incognito in and out of garages.  With that vast organisation one could detect offences as quickly as they were committed or endeavour to eliminate the possibility of these offences occurring at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our problem, however, is to get regulations, which can be easily understood by the average person, enforced by a limited number of officers with no very unusual powers. A too elaborate scheme will break down and would, in any event, involve an administrative organisation which is not available to us.  A perennial problem in the Department of Supplies is the difficulty of securing a sufficient staff to administer all the regulations we should like to administer.  I am not referring now to a clerical staff or to an inspectorial staff, but to the skilled staff at the top which is essential to the supervision of any scheme of control.  It is within the limits of the available staff&mdash;and the Department of Supplies, as everybody knows, has drained the resources of the whole Civil Service and taken officers from every branch of the service for this particular job&mdash;that we have to devise a system that will work.  I am not going to pretend that our system of enforcing the petrol ration is 100 per cent. perfect.  It may not be 100 per cent. perfect but, in the circumstances of the case, I should like to assert strongly that it is not nearly as <Col N="129" /> imperfect as is sometimes suggested. It is possibly true that people who get petrol for use in vehicles of which they are the registered owners may use that petrol for some other purpose than that for which they got it or even dispose of the coupons to other vehicle owners for a price.  That can happen but our aim is to ensure that the supplies available to each class of vehicle owner will be so regulated as to ensure that it will leave no surplus, over and above the minimum required to do the particular job for which he employs the vehicle.  We cannot do that completely.</P>
    <P>I should like each Senator to put himself in the position of the man who has got to decide what the petrol ration is going to be.  We face that problem at the beginning of the month. Now that cars are being taxed monthly, there is only a very limited period in which information can be made available as to the number of cars that will be taxed for the ensuing month and in respect to which coupons have to be issued.  We get the number of these vehicles; we know the quantity of petrol that is available for distribution, and we must assume that each registered owner of a lorry is going to use that lorry in connection with his business or the business of somebody else during the month.  He has paid a tax on it, and it is at that stage that a decision is taken as to the quantity of petrol which each owner will get.  I do not think it is possible to make a decision on any basis other than to give a flat rate allowance to each owner calculated on the basis of the size and the type of his vehicle and the quantity of petrol it is likely to consume in the completion of a given mileage.  That is the system on which we work.  These basic allowances are determined at the beginning of each month.  A proportion of the petrol available is kept in reserve to issue in supplementary allowances, mainly to lorry owners engaged in certain of the more essential classes of work&mdash;the haulage of turf, grain, timber or other essential commodities of that kind.</P>
    <P>It may be that there are, here and there throughout the country, people <Col N="130" /> who have paid tax upon vehicles that they do not intend to use, merely to get coupons.  That cannot be decided at the beginning of the month when the tax is being paid.  Eventually inspection will reveal if such persons exist and, in fact, a number of convictions have already been obtained against persons who have offended against one or other of the clauses of the Petrol Rationing Order.  We have learned by experience and the allocation of petrol has been changed as experience showed that it should be changed.  The process of detecting offenders and bringing them to court has been improved, judging at least by the number of persons prosecuted and convicted.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Senator The McGillycuddy put down this motion with the intention of making a constructive speech.  I welcome these constructive suggestions on any occasion.  The problems of administration which arise in relation to these matters are all new problems to this country.  This is the first time we have ever had to face them and to devise ways and means of dealing with them.  They are problems which, in any event, change from day to day.</P>
    <P>It is useful that we should all pool our ideas in order to get the best possible method of working.  I do not want anything I may say to be regarded as discouragement to members of the Seanad or to members of the Dáil or members of the public in putting forward their suggestions, even though they may not be in a position to know the whole of the problem or the practical difficulties that may make the adoption of suggestions impossible. Senator The McGillycuddy suggested we should perforate the coupons with the engine number of a car in respect of which they are issued.  Undoubtedly that would be an improvement which would help enforcement, but I think it would make very slight difference in enforcement.  One of the rules of Government in administrative problems of this kind is that you can get a very considerable degree of enforcement with simple procedure.  In order to improve the degree of enforcement complication of procedure is very considerable. <Col N="131" /> The procedure suggested would create great difficulty.</P>

      <P>I want to give the Senator a picture of what occurs.  I have mentioned the time taken.  The issue of the coupons has to be done within a few days.  The ration cards come in, that is to say evidence that the tax has been paid.  A limited number of coupons have to go out. These coupons are issued by an ordinary clerical staff, and the problem of relating each of the coupons to a particular car would complicate the work of the staff very considerably. Notwithstanding that, I would say that it should be done if I could see that any considerable gain in enforcement would follow.  I do not think it would. I do not think the average garage attendant will lift the bonnet of a car to see if it is the correct coupon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if he did I was going to say once the car is driven away the coupon is filed in the garage office.  In due course it will be surrendered to the petrol company to secure replacement of the petrol for which it is issued, but it is not possible at that stage to relate the coupon to a particular vehicle which used the petrol.  It might happen that the adoption of that system would enable inquiries to be directed of the type that Senator The McGillycuddy referred to in a very occasional instance.  That is, the presence in Cork of a coupon issued for a car registered in Donegal which would have only four gallons a month. In order to secure conviction or the beginning of an inquiry in an isolated case of that kind it would be a very elaborate procedure to set up the perforation of coupons in the manner suggested by the Senator, nor do I think that any change would follow if we were to adopt the suggestion of using the officers of the local authorities or the Gárda Síochána to decide <Col N="132" /> the allocation of petrol within the limits of their own county.  I do not think these officers could do anything more than the officers of the Department of Supplies are doing.  There is a known quantity of petrol and a number of cars registered, and they would have to decide the quantity that each would receive on exactly the same principles as the decision is made now. I know that certain abuses have arisen. We decided to give petrol to hackney car owners, because we felt it essential in view of the curtailment of supplies to private cars that there should be available some emergency system of transport, and the hackney cars seem to provide that system.  Personal emergencies arise every day and night. People get sick and have sudden calls to go and see sick relatives.  They have to leave their homes sometimes in the middle of the night or at times when the public transport is not available. Urgent business requires people to travel from one part of the country to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We felt it would be impossible to distribute special allowances against emergencies of this kind as they arose. We felt that the simplest and best method to follow was to provide a reasonable ration to hackey car owners so that there would be available in each part of the country an emergency service with a supply of petrol.  In practice, of course, we could not ensure that the hackney car owner would only use his vehicle for these urgent calls.  The hackney car owner probably often found he made more profit by taking people to a dance or race-meeting or some other festive occasion which might make his clients ready to pay him better.  In any case they could always pack more into the car than would be the case in a commercial call. Many hackney car owners became reluctant to answer ordinary commercial calls or emergency calls because they wanted to keep petrol with the intention of keeping a supply for these more profitable journeys on social affairs.  I do not think that should induce us to stop the supply to the hackney car owner because there are still hackneys available in emergency in parts of the country, and if there is an emergency <Col N="133" /> most hackney car owners are decent enough to sacrifice the higher profit they would make on social calls in order to make their vehicles available in an emergency.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister got anything to say on the supply by hackney car owners to the black market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  One of the problems that has to be faced is that under the present circumstances the hackney-car owner may make more profit by selling his petrol coupons than by running his car.  It is conceivable that if 5/- or 10/- is paid for each coupon the hackney-car owner who gets his 40 coupons a month may make a substantial income by selling.  Of course he has got to keep his car taxed and the many responsibilities he incurs as a hackney-car owner will have to be met.  I do not know to what extent that is so, but nevertheless it is true that there are hackney cars continuing in operation, and if everyone could make more by the other system I am sure they would do it.  I think also the Gárda Síochána have certain duties in respect of persons who get a hackney plate, and consequently they have not only to be taxed but also there is an obligation to be always available.  It is the duty of the Gárda to see that that that obligation is met.  In many cases the hackney plate is withdrawn on the initiative of the Gárda, who report that a particular individual is not a <i>bona fide</i> hackney owner at all, in the sense that his vehicle is not always available for the public.  If there is any solution to this problem, or if any Senator likes to suggest a solution I would be glad to hear it.  I think it would be too drastic to stop the petrol supply to hackney owners. That brings me to the second part of the Senator's motion, which relates to essential services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can judge all services in respect of which motor vehicles are used as essential from some aspect. They are either essential to the country or essential to the individual.  From the point of view of the hackney car owner it is essential for him to get petrol, because otherwise he will have no <Col N="134" /> livelihood, but whether it is essential from the national or public point of view that the hackney car owner should have a livelihood is another question.  The same applies to private cars used for a variety of purposes.  I get letters by the hundreds from various classes of people&mdash;invalids who, because of deformity or otherwise, find it very inconvenient to use public transport services, people who have got to be brought periodically to hospitals and to doctors for special treatment without which they will not live; businessmen engaged in a particular class of business which takes them into parts of the country where there is no public transport service at all&mdash;a whole variety of cases of that kind in respect of which it can be clearly said that more petrol is essential to the individuals concerned.</P>

      <P>If the petrol ration were halved down to 10,000,000 gallons, what would the Minister still consider the essential things?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have tried to regard as essential solely those services which could be so described from a public point of view.  Let me again repeat that the system of distribution involves the granting of a basic ration to every car owner.  He gets that irrespective of the purpose for which he requires his vehicle.  We assume that most of the commercial vehicles in the country are used for essential services of one kind or another.  The delivery of the groceries to my house or some other work of that kind may not be essential; it may be a convenience to me, and vehicles are used for that purpose but, generally speaking, these commercial vehicles are used for fairly essential services.  Most of the private cars are used either in connection with business or as a personal convenience. People speak of private cars as being used for pleasure.  I think that is a mis-description.  There are very few cars, under present circumstances, used for purely pleasure purposes. They are used as a convenience.  They are used to save time; they are used to avoid the delay and trouble that may arise in connection with the public transport services; they are used to <Col N="135" /> facilitate business operations, rather than for purely pleasure purposes.  We assume that each car owner is paying the tax on his car because it is important to him for some reason or another and he gets a basic ration.  So far as the private car is concerned, that is a very small ration.  The total basic ration given to all private car owners is less than 10 per cent. of the petrol we distribute in each month.  We keep, as I have said, a balance of the available supplies.  That is given in supplementary allowances to those who we decide are engaged in essential services.  I may remind Senator The McGillycuddy that there was a period in which there was no basic ration for private cars at all, when the total available supply of petrol was much less than it is just at the moment, and when we had to cut out a whole lot of the classes of vehicle owners that are now getting allowances.</P>
      <P>The essential services are the public transport services, the conveyance of commodities such as grain, turf, coal, fish and perishable goods and things of that kind.  It is true that we have changed the basic allowances and the supplementary allowances as experience seems to justify it.  Senator McEllin referred to the utility wagons. We decided only at the beginning of this month that the ration given to these utility wagons would no longer be available, that it was unjustifiable to give a special allowance to the owners of these cars which were, in some cases, used solely for the same purpose as a private car would be used.  In respect of these utility wagons the ration given now is the ordinary private car basic ration, except where it can be shown that the vehicle is used for the conveyance of market garden produce or some other useful purpose of that kind, in which case a supplementary allowance is given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the criticisms of the system of petrol distribution are based upon misunderstandings.  A very typical case of misunderstanding was that referred to by Senator Hogan.  I read the report of the Clare County Council where it was said that people could not be conveyed to hospital because there was <Col N="136" /> no petrol for the ambulance, and I immediately set inquiries on foot.  The question that arose is not whether the allowance of petrol given to the ambulance was sufficient but what happened to the petrol that was given to the ambulance.  An inquiry is proceeding at the moment because I found that in this month the quantity of petrol issued to the Clare County Council for the use of its ambulances actually exceeded their own estimate of what they would need.  No doubt, there are some officials of the Clare County Council who were not at all enthusiastic at the prospect of an inquiry proceeding as to what happened that petrol.</P>
    <P>The private car owners who get supplementary allowances at present are doctors, veterinary surgeons, clergymen and midwives.  It may interest Senators to know that I have decided to give certain supplementary allowances to members of the Dáil and Seanad for the purpose of attending meetings of these bodies.  Arrangements for the introduction of that supplementary allowance are at present being made with the officers of these Houses.  In the case of doctors, I am well aware that there is a considerable difference between the type of practice done by one individual doctor and another, and that consequently the petrol needs of one doctor vary considerably from those of another.  I do not think, however, that I should take on myself the responsibility of deciding between doctors when the Medical Union will not do it.  I said to the Medical Union that I was prepared to give the same quantity of petrol to the whole medical profession and to let them decide to differentiate between one class of doctor and another, or between one class of dispensary doctor and another.  I said in effect: &ldquo;You pick out the doctors who are to get more and the doctors who are going to get less, and I will carry out your wishes in the matter.&rdquo;  They would not undertake that job.  They did send me a rather amazing suggestion, which was to the effect that dispensary doctors in areas where there was a rural district council should get less petrol.  The suggestion was amazing because I think we are all aware that rural district councils <Col N="137" /> were abolished some 15 years ago.  But even if they existed, I could not for the life of me see what relationship they would have to the petrol needs of doctors.  Examining the list, I found amongst those doctors who they suggested should get less petrol, were the doctors in Glenties, Oughterard and many outlying districts of Galway and Connemara.  I sent that suggestion back to them and asked them to reconsider it, but they have not come forward again with any better proposal.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to act upon the recommendations of the Medical Union in differentiating between doctors.  I think if there is to be differentiation, that they should do it.  I do not think it is desirable that I should do it, because if I were to attempt it, I would have to undertake an investigation of the kind of business which each doctor does, and such types of investigation should be avoided.  I think that if I gave more petrol to veterinary surgeons, the doctors would retort that I was placing the lives of animals above those of human beings, and while that may not be fair, it is a retort that could be made.  I can say straightaway in relation to the veterinary profession the same as I said to the doctors: &ldquo;There is a quantity of petrol.  If somebody within the profession will decide on a different system of allotting it, I am prepared to act on their recommendations, but they must indicate not merely those who are to get more petrol but also those who will get less.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I would merely like to say this: So far as humanly possible we will endeavour to enforce the existing regulations.  Enforcement is a matter for the inspection staff of the Department and the Gárda Síochána, and <Col N="138" /> they are being continuously used to track down offenders and bring them into court.  In many cases, offenders have been brought to court, but often in court the difficulty is to prove that something occurred, although you know it took place.  I do not know that any of the suggestions made here would improve the system of rationing, or make it more easily enforceable.  At least, if they would improve it, they would involve such an addition to our organisation that the game would not be worth the candle.  In relation to the restriction of supplies, we are doing that, subject to the basic ration, and I gathered that Senator The McGillycuddy and others are not in favour of an alteration of the basic ration. Subject to that, we are distributing the balance of supplies for commercial use, and determining their essential character by relation to the public need there is for continuing them.  If our petrol position should deteriorate it is only these users who will get supplies at all.  Senator The McGillycuddy made one mistake in quoting from my speech in the Dáil.  I did not say that we were guaranteed 20 million gallons; I said that the quantity we were told to expect in 1941 was 20 million gallons. What the supply for 1942 will be, I cannot say.</P>

      <P>We have no reserves, because we could not have got them, and that point is not easily understood. There are many people who think that if we had reduced the ration last year or this year we could have built up a reserve.  In fact, the system under which we are supplied would not allow of that.  The quantity we get is not a fixed quantity.  We get a new supply when our stocks have run out, and if we try to build up a reserve by cutting down the original ration we would merely delay the day on which we would get new stocks.  It is the policy of the petrol companies, and the reason is fairly obvious under present circumstances, not to allow the accumulation of reserve stocks here.  The danger of transporting supplies across the Atlantic is such that one can easily <Col N="139" /> understand that they do not wish to allow us to build up stocks against an emergency that may never arise.  So far as military reserves are concerned, they are in a separate category, and they have been taken out of the control of the oil companies but, for ordinary commercial or civilian purposes, it is not in our power to build up reserve stocks.  If the policy of the companies should change, we will have no difficulty in accommodating all the reserves they may decide to allow us.</P>

      <P>In spite of the chorus of disapproval from large portions of the House, I am still satisfied that this discussion has done no harm.  I agree, first of all, with Senator Quirke, that we would be much better off if we could go back to the horse and, indeed, if we never left him, there would probably not be this world war.  Down in Kerry, in fact, I myself have bought a pony and trap &mdash;I do not know whether Senator Quirke has done that.  I was somewhat distressed and alarmed at the umbrage which Senator McEllin took at my putting down the motion at all, but he did warn us of one important thing which we all have to consider, that in a month's time, there may be no petrol at all, and we will have to go back to the horse.  But, I was finally assured by the length at which the Minister dealt with the problem. I think he thought it was a matter of importance, and I am grateful for the detail into which he went and the way he explained the difficulties he has in the matter.  Personally, I have done a certain amount of administration of this type and I think he somewhat <Col N="140" /> overstressed the difficulties.  I do not think that the picture which he drew of himself and myself sitting on the back seats of cars and going into garages to find out what was happening is at all a realistic one.  I should not have thought it was necessary at all, if your garage proprietor entered his details&mdash;I know it is a bit of trouble for the proprietor&mdash;and, if an occasional visit were paid by an inspector, there would be no further abuses as soon as there were some prosecutions.</P>
      <P>However, that is only one point. Provided the Minister sees the law is really enforced, I think you will immediately have a very considerable difference.  I want to make it clear that I never for one moment desired or intended that we should go away from the Minister's very excellent plan of the basic ration.  What I want to try to deal with is the redistribution of the supplementaries, and the possible re-examination of the amount of petrol which is issued to hackney cars and to some other commercial vehicles. I did not at any time specify any particular type.  I never referred to turf lorries, although other people have referred to them.  I have done my best to try to keep the discussion on as general a line as possible.  If feeling in the House is against me I would like to withdraw the motion.</P>
