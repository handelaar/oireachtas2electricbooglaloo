      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to place members of the Defence Forces in such a position that unemployment benefit rights acquired before they joined the Forces will be preserved for them during their service in the Forces, and that they will have those rights available to them in full on the termination of such service.</P>
      <P>The second purpose of the Bill is similarly to preserve such rights to certain of our nationals who have been serving upon ships which were formerly on our register, but whose registration has been changed since the outbreak of the war.</P>
      <P>The Bill will cover all members of the Forces and all members of the Reserve called out on permanent service, with the exception only of those commissioned officers who have adopted the Army as their career, and will retire at the end of their normal period of service on pension.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this short Bill is to make certain amendments in the legislation relating to reformatory and industrial schools.  I might explain that a commission was appointed some years ago to inquire into our present reformatory and industrial school system under the chairmanship of the late Mr. Cussen, Senior District Justice in Dublin, who had charge of the Children's Court for many years and who took a keen interest in the problems submitted to the commission for inquiry and report.  I think I cannot do better than read for the Seanad a paragraph from the commission's <Col N="495" /> report which, I think, gives a fair summary of their views regarding the present position:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As a result of our investigations we are satisfied that, subject to the introduction of various changes which we have indicated in the course of this report as desirable, the present system of reformatory and industrial schools affords the most suitable method of dealing with children suffering from the disabilities to which we have referred, and we recommend its continuance.  We specially recommend that the management of the schools by religious orders who have undertaken that work should continue.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Some of the reforms and improvements recommended by the commission did not require legislation, and they have already been dealt with by administrative action.  Certain changes in existing legislation were also recommended, and most of these, together with a few other amendments that experience had shown to be desirable, are included in the present Bill.</P>
      <P>Before explaining the provisions of the Bill, there are a few matters of a general nature to which I think it well to make brief reference.  The first of these is that it is recognised and accepted as a fundamental principle that the proper place for the rearing and training of children is the family.  I think we are all agreed that no other system, no matter how perfect it might be, can provide for the child that care and attention which a good home can and does provide.  But, owing to a variety of causes, including the weakness and imperfections of human nature and, perhaps, also, the imperfections which we have not yet been able to remedy in our social system, there are children for whom the advantages of family life are unfortunately not available. There is also a small number of children who require greater discipline and control than is normally afforded by family life.  It is with these classes of children that the present Bill is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Existing legislation on the subject of reformatory and industrial schools <Col N="496" /> is contained in Part IV of the Children Act of 1908.  Under that Act, the obligation to provide such schools is placed on the local authorities, who the empowered to discharge their obligations either by establishing and maintaining schools under their own control, or by making arrangements with schools under private management to receive children from their areas who are committed to these schools.  All our reformatory and industrial schools are under private management and, with one exception, they have been founded and erected by religious orders from their own resources and public charity. The one exception is the industrial school at Baltimore, County Cork, which was erected by public subscription, in the raising of which a former Bishop of Ross took a prominent part. This school is under the management of a local board of which the Bishop of Ross is chairman.  Reformatory and industrial schools are inspected by Department inspectors and are maintained by means of capitation grants contributed partly by the State and partly by the local authorities from whose areas the children come.</P>
    <P>I think it may be well to explain briefly the chief differences between reformatory and industrial schools, since it is often wrongly assumed that there is little or no difference between them.  The fact that they are closely associated both in legislation and administration lends support to this assumption.  There are, however, important differences between these two types of schools and these differences have become more marked here owing to the manner in which our industrial schools have developed.  Take reformatories&mdash;these are intended for young persons between 12 and 16 years of age who have been found guilty of offences which would be punishable by imprisonment in the case of adults.  The most common offence is theft.  Of the 128 persons committed to the reformatory in 1938-1939, 76 were committed for petty theft and 32 for house-breaking and larceny, a total of 108 out of 128.</P>
    <P>Industrial schools were originally intended for children who were neglected by their parents, and children under 14 years of age who were guilty <Col N="497" /> of minor offences such as failure to attend school, petty theft, and so on. Parental neglect was sometimes due to or accompanied by poverty in the case of a great number of the children committed to industrial schools, and, in 1929, a short amending Act which, by the way, originated in An Seanad, was passed, which provided that a child might be committed to an industrial school on the grounds of poverty or destitution alone, provided its parents consented to this course, and also that they were given the right to obtain the release of their child if their circumstances improved, and the Minister was satisfied that they were in a position to support him.  This Act, I may say in passing, as amended, is incorporated in Section 9 of the Bill before An Seanad.  The passing of this Act, however, did not cause any serious increase in the number of children committed to industrial schools.  Its only effect, in fact, was that children who had been committed before that on such grounds as begging&mdash;receiving alms is the technical term&mdash;were now committed because of poverty.</P>
    <P>Of the 1,040 children committed to industrial schools in 1938-39, 414 were committed for that reason.  The total number of children in the industrial schools in recent years is about 6,200, and the number committed annually about 1,000, of which it may be taken that fully 90 per cent. represents committals due to poverty, with parental neglect in some cases; 5 per cent. arises from offences such as theft, and the remaining 5 per cent. through failure to attend school.</P>
    <P>The chief provisions of the present Bill may be explained under two or three general headings.  First, with regard to Sections 3, 4 and 5, these are intended to give the Minister a greater amount of control over reformatories and industrial schools.  As I have already mentioned, these are private institutions and, under present law, if one is not as well managed as it should be, the only remedy for me must be to withdraw recognition.  Section 6 is considered necessary, therefore, to provide safeguards against difficulties which will arise if recognition were to be withdrawn from a school in such <Col N="498" /> case under Section 49 of the Principal Act&mdash;owing to the fact that we have only one reformatory for boys and one for girls.  We would, in such circumstances, have to make special arrangements, and, therefore, the order closing the school should not be made, we think, without further consideration, if such a difficulty arose.  When I say closing the school, I mean in effect withdrawing State recognition from the school.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in Section 8 to raise the upper age for committal to a reformatory from 16 to 17 years and, in Section 22, to raise similarly the upper age for committal to industrial schools from 14 years to 15 years. These changes were recommended by the recent commission and they are in accordance with similar reforms elsewhere. I should explain that the raising of the ages now proposed does not, of course, necessarily mean that persons up to the higher ages mentioned who are convicted of offences need necessarily be dealt with by committal to a reformatory, or industrial school, as the case may be.  It may happen, of course, that the justice feels that the case can be dealt with by putting the youthful offender on probation and, in other countries, there seems to have been a feeling in recent years that the probation system should be tried out further.  There are, no doubt, opinions of the same kind here, but in the event of the justice deciding that probation is not suitable and that the only remedy is the committal of the young person, I would like to point out to the Seanad that in such a case we do not get over our difficulties.  The managers of these industrial schools, or even of the reformatories, have the right to refuse to accept any person committed whom it is proposed to send to them, and I think it may be assumed that in a case where the youthful offender who had been committed to a reformatory was approaching the upper age limit of 17 years, there might be reluctance on the part of the manager to accept him.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the case of the industrial school, although I have been pressed to raise the age and have done so&mdash;my own feeling had been that it <Col N="499" /> should be raised from 14 to 15&mdash; managers may be reluctant, in the case of children committed to industrial schools, if the offence is of a serious character and if the child is approaching the age of 15, to accept responsibility for him.  We are leaving the existing provision that such persons over 16 may be sent for Borstal treatment.  In the case of very, very serious offences, such as manslaughter or something of that kind, Borstal treatment will be necessary.  I, however, am not responsible for the Borstal; I am responsible for the administration of all the reformatory and industrial schools.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill which, I think, call for most care and consideration are those contained in Section 9, that is to say, those relating to the grounds on which a child may be committed to an industrial school.  These grounds are set out in the original 1908 Act which seems to have fulfilled its purpose very well and which is still quite sound in my view in its main provisions. They are summed up in Section 58 and, if Senators wish, they can refer to that section in order to get a clear view of what the provisions are. I should like first to mention that, as regards the 1929 Act to which I have already referred and in which it was provided that subject to certain safeguards, a child might be committed to an industrial school on the grounds of destitution, it may be contended that poverty is not and should not be a sufficient reason for committing a child.  I think, however, that those who advance that contention do not always bear in mind that the question of poverty is not the only circumstance which the court has in mind in coming to a decision. The court will consider the whole circumstances of the family environment at home and the conditions under which the child is living.  Regard will be had to his or her past career and the type of associates with which he or she had been keeping company.  The district justice will also, no doubt, take counsel with the officers of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children or his own probation officers, and my experience of the reports of <Col N="500" /> these officers is that they are very valuable. The ordinary report which we ask for from the police, when applications are made to me, for example for the release of boys or girls from custody, gives a certain amount of information as to the family circumstances&mdash;whether the parents are employed, the amount of income, the nature of the accommodation and other matters of that kind.  Something more, however, is necessary and the probation officers&mdash;of course, it is their sole business; the police have many other duties to attend to&mdash;make a close study of the circumstances, visit the family frequently, try to get to know what the difficulties are, if there is any lack of harmony in the home conditions for example or any other circumstances, which might be remedied by advice from either the probation officer himself or from the justice, so that it would be possible for the child to live at home.</P>
    <P>As the House will realise, the circumstances sometimes are such that the justice, while not anxious to interfere in any way with the family, may feel, if the best arrangement is to be made for the child's future, that the only decision he can come to is to take the child away from an unsuitable home environment.  In these cases of destitution it may, for example, happen that the mother of the family may have died and left the father in poor circumstances with a large number of young children, and perhaps no female relative is prepared to undertake the responsibility of looking after them. Similarly it may be that the father is dead or ill and that the mother is left with a large family to support.</P>
    <P>In cases of this kind the court, I think is really acting on a purely humanitarian basis, purely in an endeavour to provide temporary relief and assistance for parents who find themselves in these circumstances, by having the children, or some of them, committed to an industrial school.  I should like to repeat that in such cases, that is to say where committal is made on the grounds of poverty or destitution, the 1929 Act provided that the consent of the parents, or the surviving parent if one is dead, should be <Col N="501" /> obtained and that the child should be released again to these parents if the circumstances improve and they satisfy the Minister that they are able to support their children.  My reason for repeating that is that there seems to be a doubt in the minds of persons who criticise the provisions of the Bill as to what the actual position is.  The actual position is that in every case in which it has appeared to me that the circumstances of the family had improved sufficiently to enable those who are my advisers to say that the child could be released and that provision could be made for looking after it at home, the child was discharged.  I take it that the law binds me in that way and that I have no option.</P>
    <P>The principle underlying these provisions and the safeguards of parental rights which they afford are being retained in the present Bill, but some amendments are being made to overcome certain defects that have arisen in the application of these provisions. For example, cases have occurred where families have been deserted and left destitute by the father, or perhaps one of the parents has become mentally deranged, and therefore legally incapable of acting as guardian. Furthermore, the father may be in prison and may refuse to give his consent to committal of any of his children to an industrial school.  It is proposed in Section 9 (e), clauses (ii) and (iii), to dispense with the need for the consent of the parent concerned in such cases.  That is to say, if the father is in prison and if the mother outside thinks that she ought to give her consent, we feel that the withholding of the consent by the father should not prevent the court from having a discretion to commit the child.  The same applies to cases of mental incapacity.  This amendment of the law, I want to repeat, does not affect in any way the need for obtaining the consent of the other parent. There is always the safeguard even in these limited cases where we are amending the law, that the consent of the parent whom the court recognises as being the real guardian of the child for the time being, must be obtained. There is also the right of such parents <Col N="502" /> to have the children released at any time as soon as they can satisfy the Minister that they are in a position to maintain the child.  That is laid down in the proviso to Section 9 (e).</P>
    <P>The other amendments made in the provisions relating to the committal of children to industrial schools are of a minor nature.  As I have already mentioned, the upper age limit is being raised to 15 years.  Clause (c) of Section 9 refers to a provision in the Principal Act under which a child may be committed on the grounds that it is under the care of a parent or guardian who, by reason of criminal or drunken habits is unfit to have care of the child.</P>
    <P>This provision has not been found effective under present circumstances. It is felt that in order to secure the consent of the court to committal in such cases it would be necessary to prove reputed conviction against the parents such as drunkenness.  We inserted the word &ldquo;reputed&rdquo;.  I am informed that the word has a well-established meaning in law and following the canons of legal interpretation the insertion of this word will render the provision more effective and cannot lead to abuse.</P>
    <P>There is the further paragraph (i) in Section 9 intended to deal with the case where the father is convicted of a serious offence in relation to any of his children.  In such a case the proposal is that the court should have power to take any of the remaining children away from him if they consider that the matter is sufficiently grave and commit them to an industrial school.  The purpose of Section 10 is to reduce the period for which a young person may be committed to a reformatory.  At present this period must be not less than three years or more than five years and it is proposed to reduce these periods to two years and four years respectively.  The purpose of Sections 11, 12, 13, and 14 is fairly plain, and any detailed explanation of them that may be necessary can best be given on the Committee Stage.  In connection with clause (a) of Section 12 it might be mentioned that at present the manager of a school may release a child on licence after it has been 18 <Col N="503" /> months in the school.  It is proposed to reduce this period to six months in order to encourage managers to exercise their power of licensing to a greater extent.  Objection was taken to the word &ldquo;licensing&rdquo; but the word in regard to young persons is conditioned by the words &ldquo;licensing by the manager of the school.&rdquo;  It will be noticed further that licences in future, according to Section 14, will be known as &ldquo;supervision certificates.&rdquo;  If there is anything further to be done in the way of removing any stigma which seems to be held to attach to those who through no fault of their own have to go to industrial schools I would be only too anxious to do it.</P>
    <P>I think that the next section of which an explanation may be considered desirable is Section 19.  Here an attempt is made to place the responsibility for maintaining young persons in a reformatory or in industrial schools on the local authorities.  The present position is that unless the local authority of the place where the committal occurs pays, the cost has to be borne otherwise.  That has the effect of placing an unfair obligation upon cities like Dublin where committals of children for other districts are made.  I have already mentioned that reformatories and industrial schools are maintained by means of capitation grants paid partly by the local authorities.  The rates of grant paid by the different local authorities vary very considerably&mdash;in the case of industrial schools from 3/- to 5/- or 6/- per week, and in the case of reformatories from 3/6 to 8/- per week.  The managers of industrial schools have, on occasions, refused to accept children from certain counties as they considered the rates of grants paid by these counties insufficient.  Under Section 20, it is proposed to take authority to regularise this position and to fix, by regulation, appropriate rates of grant which must be paid by all local authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 21 proposes to make certain amendments in the law regarding the disposal of what are called parental contributions.  When a young person is committed to a reformatory or industrial <Col N="504" /> school the district justice may order his parents to pay a weekly contribution towards his maintenance if, in the opinion of the justice, they can afford to do so.  Under existing law these contributions must be paid into the Exchequer, and it is proposed to take power to apportion them between the State and the responsible local authorities.  The total amount of the contributions in question is about £3,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I wish to refer to a criticism which may reasonably be made against an amending Bill of this kind, viz., that its interpretation presents some difficulty as it has to be read in conjunction with the original Act which it amends.  I agree that there is some force in such a criticism and I can only say, in answer to it, that this Bill is considered necessary to make early changes in the law but that it need not be regarded as a permanent provision for dealing with the important social problems to which it refers, and the present is not a suitable time for making such a provision.</P>
    <P>I am only dealing with this one problem of juvenile delinquents.  I am only responsible for the administration of industrial and reformatory schools. The question as a whole is one for the Minister for Justice.  On the other hand, the question of general medical services for children would appear to be a matter for the Minister for Local Government.  I have no desire to prevent anyone making what legitimate criticisms they wish against the proposals, and I regret that the Bill so far should only represent my own particular part of the problem.  Unfortunately I was not able to come to the Oireachtas with a Bill in which all sections of the problem could have been dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Connell Mr. T. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister admit that this was&mdash;he said a good example, but I say a bad example&mdash;of legislation by reference. It will be almost impossible to study the full implications of this Bill as it is printed.  I pity people who will have the administration of it.  It will not have a great deal of interest for the ordinary man in the street unless he is <Col N="505" /> deeply interested in social questions, but I imagine that members of the Gárda and district justices will have considerable difficulty in grasping the meaning of the various sections.  For example, take Section 9, Section 13 or Section 21.  If I wish to know exactly the full meaning of these sections, I have first to get the original Act and rewrite them, putting in these amendments in the text.  It is only then that I can understand it.  Even that is not sufficient.  This 1908 Act was one passed 30 years ago by another Parliament, and I dare say it is full of references to petty sessions, lords lieutenant, chief secretaries and lords of the Treasury.  There are quite a number of our Guards and young lawyers who have never heard of such things. They have to look up the Interpretation Act to see what is understood by a chief secretary or what was the lord lieutenant mentioned.  I cannot understand what objection there was, or what difficulty there would have been in rewriting the whole of the 1908 Act with these amendments and bringing it before the House.  Then we would see at once what was implied, and those who would have to administer it afterwards would understand it.  That is the first criticism I have to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general principle of the method by which these particular schools are supported seems to be unsound.  The support given either by the State or by local authorities is in the form of a capitation grant.  The Minister himself, in the course of his speeches in the other House, and certainly other people in other places, more than once referred to the fact that, unless there were a certain number of these young people in these schools, the schools would have to close down.  That was looked upon almost as if it were something very much to be deplored, something almost in the nature of a catastrophe. The ideal position, which I suppose we can scarcely hope to reach, would be that there would be none of these delinquent or destitute children&mdash; that there would be no children who would have to go to one of these schools and no reason for the existence of these particular schools.  As I say, I do not suppose we will reach that, but <Col N="506" /> the nearer we get to it, the harder we work to reach that position, the more difficult it will be for these schools to maintain themselves under the present system of capitation grants.</P>
    <P>I say that, irrespective of the amount paid by way of capitation grant.  If the capitation grant were four or six times as large, the same principle would apply, because one might come to the stage when only 10 or 20 children would be maintained in a particular school, while the overhead expenses would be just as great as if there were 20 or 40 times that number.  The cost of rent, rates, and general upkeep and maintenance of the institution would have to be borne just the same.  I think it was admitted by the Minister himself that we are dependent for the care of these children to a considerable extent on public charity, that it is only on those grounds that they could be maintained at all, that is on the grounds of a very considerable contribution from public charitable institutions under whose control these children are.  I do not think that is right.  Public authorities&mdash;either State or local, or both&mdash;should be entirely responsible for the care, education and maintenance of these particular children.</P>
    <P>In previous speeches the Minister referred to the fine manner in which these institutions are run.  I am quite prepared to agree with him in that. He referred to the fact that they were just as good as any ordinary boarding school to which private people send their children.  I would not go so far, but if that were to be the case, I wonder what boarding school would accept children at an all-inclusive rate of 15/- per week, which is apparently the total grant paid by the State and the local authorities per head for these children. I should say that that is the maximum grant.  The figures which the Minister gave a few minutes ago would show that it is far from reaching that amount in quite a number of schools. The grants themselves are totally inadequate, and the principle on which they are paid is, in my opinion, unsound.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that he was dealing only with one aspect of <Col N="507" /> the case in this particular Bill, that is, the aspect with which he himself is particularly concerned.  I submit that he is not dealing in this Bill at all with the aspect of this particular question with which he ought to be most concerned, that is, the education of the children in these particular institutions.  The report on which this Bill is based made many and very important recommendations with regard to the education of the children in these schools.  Some of the children from these institutions go to ordinary schools, and I take it that they are dealt with as the children are who usually attend these national schools, but in some&mdash;even in a good number&mdash;of the schools, they are taught in the school itself.  Here are the recommendations of the commission and the references with regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>The commission find much fault or complaint with the position of the teaching of literary subjects in these schools.  They say that the teachers who are employed there should have the same qualifications and the same general training as the teachers in ordinary national schools.  That seems to be the obvious thing, and to be common sense.  They have not got those qualifications in the vast majority of cases.  Occasionally, a trained or qualified teacher is appointed, but he gets out as quickly as he can, at the first opportunity that arises.</P>
    <P>The commission recommended that the cost of the education of the children should be defrayed from the Education Vote on the same basis as if they were attending ordinary national schools, but, as the Minister himself stated, not only does this capitation grant cover the cost of clothing, feeding, housing and all that, but also the education and training, and the expenses of the institution, including books and so on.  They also recommend that future appointments of these teachers should be made on exactly the same conditions as obtain in the case of ordinary national schools, and that these teachers should have no duties other than teaching, that their work should be identical with that in the ordinary national school.  Surely it <Col N="508" /> ought to be one of the first concerns of the Minister, not alone to get these children committed to the schools, but to see that they are properly educated when they have been committed.  That cannot be done unless they are taught by people who are trained and properly qualified for that purpose.</P>
    <P>There is this further point.  These children who go to these institutions, are in the main, what we call &ldquo;problem&rdquo; children, and the actual teaching and training of such children is a more difficult job than it is in the case of the ordinary children who come from good homes.  They require more care and more individual attention, and, therefore, those who have charge of these children and who are teaching them should have even higher qualifications, more experience, and a better training than would be required in the case of the teachers in the ordinary national schools.  Yet, we find that these teachers are paid miserable salaries.  I am speaking now of the lay teachers.  The members of the religious communities, of course, have their own arrangements, and I cannot say, or do not wish to say, how they are treated.  I am thinking mainly of the lay teachers who are engaged in these schools, and reference was made specially by the commission to these lay teachers; they recommended that all who were engaged, whether lay or religious people, in the teaching of these children in literary subjects, ought to have special or definite qualifications.</P>
    <P>That is not the position now, however, and people may engage in teaching in these institutions who have no special qualifications whatsoever, so far as the Minister's Department is concerned, and the rates of remuneration paid, as a result of the grants given to these schools, are very low. The grants being what they are, these people cannot be paid a proper remuneration.  According to the commission the rates of pay for these people vary from about £36, indoor, to £192, outdoor, and I think that requires no further comment.  Apart from that, these people have no pension rights.  They may be discharged at short notice without any <Col N="509" /> pension rights whatsoever.  I do not blame the institutions concerned for that state of affairs, although I think they may be sometimes to blame. Apparently, they cannot afford to do any better.  I am thinking, however, of the interests of the children concerned, and surely that is a matter that ought to be the concern of the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>Now, when this matter was raised before, I understand that it was pointed out that the cost would be entirely too great.  I have been trying to look into that, and it seems that a sum of £29,000 was mentioned.  I do not know how that figure was arrived at.  According to the commission, there were altogether about 77 lay teachers at the time, and about 15 or 16 of these were trained.  I am quite certain that there is not that number of trained teachers in these institutions now; some of these teachers, who were trained, have got employment elsewhere in the meantime. This matter was discussed with the Department of Education about a year ago, by myself and others, and we learned at that time that if the recommendations of this commission were carried out, and if these teachers were taken over, there would be only about 20, I think, or even less, and certainly not more, of these lay teachers, who would have any qualifications that would entitle them to be taken over by the Department and treated, under the Department, in the same way as the ordinary national school teachers are treated, and that some of these would be trained and some of them would not be trained.  On that basis, we suggested at the time to the Minister's Department that he should at least take over these lay teachers and pay them whatever salary their service would entitle them to.  If that were done, I have no doubt that it would not cost more than £3,000 or £4,000 at most, in the year.  Even though it would cost that much, or a little more, at any rate it would be that much relief to the institutions concerned. They would not have to pay that much and, as a result, they would be in a position to get better teachers with better qualifications.  I have no doubt <Col N="510" /> that, once it could be shown that a teacher in these institutions had the same salary rights and pension rights as teachers in other positions, a teacher would take that employment, but he will not take it now, because he has no proper salary or no pension rights.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that that is a solution of the problem.  I know that the Minister himself, personally, is sympathetic&mdash;I have reason to believe that&mdash;and therefore I do not know what there is to prevent this being done.  If there is only £4,000 or £5,000 involved, I think it should not be sufficient to prevent the Minister from making this arrangement.  I do not know whether legislation would be necessary for that, or whether the Minister can do it administratively.  He says here that some of the recommendations can be carried out without legislation and by administration, and that some of them would require legislation.  I do not know under which heading this particular reform, that I am suggesting, could or should be carried out, but I am raising the matter now because this seems to be a suitable opportunity to raise it.  I am not so much interested in the position of particular individuals as in the fact that quite a very large number of children pass through these schools who are not getting the attention which, in my view, they are entitled to get, and which they cannot get under the present arrangements.  I should like to stress that, and I hope that the Minister, when he is replying, will let us know what are his intentions in that particular direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been described as legislation by reference, but the position at the present moment with regard to industrial schools and reformatories&mdash;they are two rather ugly words&mdash;and with regard to defective or delinquent children, can only be found by going through and discussing a British Act, an Act of 1929, and this Bill when it becomes an Act.  The position with regard to this matter is patchy, and, as the Minister said, the position in administration is also patchy and confused.  There is the Department <Col N="511" /> of Justice concerned in the matter, and there is also the Department of Education, and if one were to suggest such a thing as a clinic the Minister would hold up his hands and say that that was a matter for the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  It is important, however, that there should be a unified control in regard to this matter.  There are 6,000 children in these schools, and a very substantial number&mdash;about 1,000&mdash;are committed every year, and of these, if I understand the Minister, 90 per cent. are due to poverty or lack of parental control.  I think that that is an indictment of our present system and of our lack of unified control.  Having had a considerable time to think the matter over, particularly in view of a very reasonable and by no means exaggerated report in connection with it, I think that more thought should have been given to the matter, and that some effort should have been made to give us a more comprehensive Act than the present one&mdash;taking some account of the immense difference in outlook between 1941 and 1908.  I do not want to be harsh in a matter of this kind, but I do not think the Minister could give us any greater indictment of his own lack of enlightenment on this subject than to say that the Act of 1908 was a good Act and, in effect, that you cannot do very much more. As Senator O'Connell has pointed out, that Act was passed about 30 years ago.  It ante-dates practically all of our present social legislation, and the point of view with regard to delinquent children that was held even by decent people and educationists about the year 1908 has become very substantially altered by 1940 or 1941.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would expect that in our legislation and in our arrangements made for this kind of children that change in attitude which is universal all over the world, I might say, would be reflected.  I have no doubt that the administration of the Act has altered considerably and steadily for the better. From what I can discover about it I think the Minister was quite right in saying that the attitude of the <Col N="512" /> courts, of district justices, of police, of probation officers, and the general attitude has improved substantially but it is not fair, I think, to the children or to ourselves that we should allow the whole matter to be dealt with simply by tinkering&mdash;that is what this amounts to&mdash;with an old British Act of Parliament and by allowing necessary reforms to fall between two stools, or rather three stools&mdash;between three separate Government departments. I think the matter is one more for the Minister for Education than for anybody else.  Knowing that knots can very often be united or cut open, I do not know why it would not be possible to give the Minister for Education the main say in all this matter because I think the thought of to-day on this whole question, as Senator O'Connell has just indicated, is that this is a matter of education much more than a matter of punishment.</P>
    <P>I rose particularly to put the point which Senator O'Connell, from his great knowledge of the matter, has put so very well already, namely, the position of the lay teachers in these schools.  It should be remembered that at one time no training of any kind was necessary to become any kind of teacher.  Since I was a teacher myself, I can say it without any offence to any one&mdash;a man went into a school to teach when he could not find any other place to go to.  Then a system of training was made out for national teachers and just at the beginning of the last war, owing to a Chief Secretary named Birrell, considerable improvements were made in the conditions of secondary teachers and very substantial advances have been made since.  Both in our primary and secondary schools we now have trained teachers enjoying certain rights, as far as the lay teachers are concerned; in the case of secondary schools, not all the rights they would like but still a substantial improvement on the old position.  Similarly it is impossible to get a post at present under a vocational authority without having certain qualifications recognised by the Minister for Education.  But a small body of teachers in these industrial and reformatory schools have been left <Col N="513" /> entirely uncatered for.  Their position has not been improved at all and the schools still run on an antiquated, unscientific and, one might almost say, idiotic system of capitation grants. Therefore, as has been pointed out, the more children you have delinquent the more prosperous the school is likely to be, whereas our whole object should be to reduce these numbers.</P>
    <P>There is every case, as Senator O'Connell has said, for improving the position of these teachers, and it is a position which should be improved by legislation and by Government action and which, in all the circumstances, cannot be improved&mdash;although I think some efforts have been made&mdash;by those who manage and run the schools.  As anybody who runs a house at present can easily find out for himself, the capitation grant is entirely insufficient. Certainly the educational end of the matter should be undertaken by the State.  One would imagine that the matter is so simple that it would be done because one advocates no new principle.  We do give primary education at State expense; secondary education very largely at State expense; university education very largely at State expense, and vocational education almost entirely at State expense, using the word &ldquo;State&rdquo; to cover both local and Central Fund grants.  Why we should refrain from taking upon ourselves the responsibility for the education of defective children, who need education and who need skill in teaching more than any other class, is a mystery to me.  I do not understand at all why we should not have undertaken that particular burden. The amount involved is small.  Even if it were £29,000&mdash;I have been told by people who have taken the trouble to calculate it that it is considerably less than £29,000 a year&mdash;it surely would repay us.  First and foremost, we have 1,000 children every year.  You might say of every single one of them that either from the point of view of poverty or from the point of view of some kink or other, there is a grave defect in their home environment.  I think the Minister would agree that in every case, practically speaking, there is something wrong with their home <Col N="514" /> environment and very often there may be something wrong from the point of view of heredity.  They offer in a school a very serious problem.  They are more difficult to handle and to teach and they require, instead of less skill, more skill from the teacher.  Yet it is these very children we leave without any insistence upon training.  Certainly I think the reform in that particular matter of these lay teachers in industrial and reformatory schools is overdue.</P>
    <P>What Senator O'Connell has said&mdash; that is, that for future appointments the same standard as for national teachers should be insisted upon&mdash;is too obvious to labour it.  If the Minister were endeavouring to do justice to the present staffs who are, in the sense of diplomas, unqualified&mdash;some of them are very well qualified indeed in practice&mdash;if he were seeking a precedent for dealing with them, I think he is well aware of the precedent adopted when registration for secondary teachers became the law.  The same precedent was adopted, for example, when dentists were compelled to register.  There is no difficulty in allowing the people who have a certain amount of experience to continue and to get certain salaries.</P>
    <P>The analogy with the secondary schools is complete and there is no difficulty about it.  If the number is only 77 persons all told it should not be very difficult to deal with.  It should be understood that they are people who are doing very difficult work under difficult circumstances, who are very badly paid and whose grievance is against the State, against the community, which, I think, should take steps to remedy that grievance.  It is not so much the grievance of 77 persons; it is the welfare and the future of 6,000 children; and it seems to me that money spent on the education of those 6,000 children might very well come back to the State in less expenses for courts, less expenses for prisons and less expenses for policemen later on. I do not know of any educational field where one would be more certain to get a return than in this particular field, for a comparatively small sum of £20,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> The other thing that strikes one, as I said at the beginning, is that neither the Minister's speech nor the Bill itself gives any indication that experiments such as clinics and so on that have taken place with regard to defective children elsewhere are going to get any show here.  The names&mdash;industrial schools and reformatories&mdash;are indicative of the period from which the original Act comes.  It has been suggested to me that we have renamed in Irish a great many things.  These are two institutions we might easily rename in Irish and it would certainly be an improvement.  I know the Minister will tell me it is not his particular business, but I think if the Minister interests himself in the matter&mdash;and, of course, I know he is interested in it&mdash; he would have the support of a very great number of people in both Houses if he were to press very strongly for a remedy for the situation which leaves 6,000 defective children in the hands, very largely, of untrained persons, and he would find that any money spent on improving the position of the teachers and improving the quality of the teaching as time goes on would come back to the State and would be well repaid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's plea for mercy, I was glad to notice, did not fall upon deaf ears.  It is necessary that those of us, like the previous speakers and myself, who are keenly interested in the main problem, should lament that the Bill is only what it professes to be&mdash;an Act to amend and extend the Children Act of 1908.  The Minister suggests that in the midst of war's alarms, with all the anxiety with regard to the future, it is not possible to make a consolidating Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who have already spoken, and I, believe that the situation calls and calls urgently for a consolidating Act, and I grasped with delight at one of the closing remarks of the Minister for Education which held out a hope that we would soon return to legislation on the question of the child and the young person.  Perhaps that is a promise to codify the whole law relating to the child and young person, and that we may soon have a measure for that purpose.  In addition to regretting <Col N="516" /> that it is not a consolidating Act, and admitting all the difficulties at the present moment that prevail against introducing it, without the risk of its being an imperfect consolidation and, therefore, a premature thing, I regret the absence of a preamble.  This is the second time I have made this complaint, so I am afraid my colleagues will think it is the idea of a crank.</P>
    <P>There is no preamble to state what exactly has evoked this new piece of legislation or to what reformative purpose it is directed, and I have been at considerable pains to read over, not only the Act of 1908, but all the amending Acts introduced since that time.  I have read our own 1929 Act which has been absorbed into this as a portion of Section 9, and I have read the Scottish Act and I gather from my study, which was the best I could make&mdash;it was at any rate a careful and conscientious study&mdash;that the idea in this present measure is to deal with two classes of children and young persons, first, the child who stands in need, or has indeed been adjudged to stand in need, of more adequate care and proper protection, and to provide the means of that necessary care and protection so far as legislation can secure that desirable end.</P>
    <P>The second class covers what are known by that unfortunate description, juvenile delinquents, and the aim is that they may be taken out of that evil environment which is responsible for their being delinquents and put under moralising influence and to secure, again as far as legislation may be hoped to secure, that what was a potential criminal may be converted ultimately into a good citizen.  I am taking the liberty on my own account of preparing a preamble like this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Whereas new legislation is necessary to provide proper care and control for children adjudged to stand in need of it and that certain juvenile delinquents require different treatment from what they have hitherto received.</P>
    <P>And so on.  Thus, I am making this unfortunate Section 9, as it stands, concentrate in itself the whole measure in its spirit and in its object.  But, <Col N="517" /> as this is a Second Reading, we are bound, as I see it, by the rules of procedure to confine ourselves to the principle of the Bill, although there are many other things that call for criticism&mdash;friendly criticism I mean, not hostile.  Section 9, I submit, contains, in itself, the essential thing, the main thing, in this particular piece of legislation.  Now, one has to go to Section 58 of the Principal Act to see what that is and those who have studied the Principal Act will have noticed that our Government has made one admirable approach to the condification of the law dealing with children, because what is only Part I in the Act of 1908 devoted to infant life protection, was made in 1934 the subject of a separate Act, an admirably drafted Act it is true.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the first stage towards codification has been achieved and now we are dealing with the second part, that is to say, with offenders and powers as to industrial and reformatory schools.  After that comment, with your permission, Sir, I will read Section 58 of the Principal Act which this is intended to qualify, and I think that, as I read it, you will see it is an unfortunate thing to leave so much of it as it stands.  The very opening words of it are completely out of date, but they are not amended here.  It says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any person may bring before a petty sessional court any person apparently under the age of 14 years&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are making that 15 years, or, at least, the Dáil has agreed to that enlargement of the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;who:</P>
    <P>is found begging or receiving alms ...or, is found wandering and not having a home or settled place of abode... or,</P>
    <P>is found destitute, not being an orphan... or,</P>
    <P>is under the care of a parent or guardian who, by reason of criminal or drunken habits, is unfitted to have the care of the child ...or,</P>
    <P>is the daughter, legitimate or illegitimate, of a father who has been <Col N="518" /> convicted of an offence under Section 4 or Section 5 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1885... or, frequents the company of any reputed thief or of any common or reputed prostitute or is lodging or residing in a house or the part of a house used by any prostitutes for the purpose of prostitution or is otherwise living in circumstances calculated to cause, encourage, or favour the seduction or prostitution of the child.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, that is the old-fashioned method of avoiding what the British mind is so anxious to avoid, a definition.  They prefer, in what we might describe as a rigmarole, to attempt an exhaustive list of cases or instances rather than to approach it scientifically or philosophically and give a definition.  We are adopting that because all that goes before our Section 9.  The alteration is secured by the cancellation of the Act of 1929 and the absorption of it into Section 9 as an enlargement.  I venture to submit to the Minister that with a model before him and his draftsmen and his Department, where the thing is done scientifically and is made so easy of understanding, that it might have been worth while to take the trouble to borrow these superior passages from the Scottish Consolidation Act of 1937.  With your permission, Sir, I will read the way in which the Scottish metaphysical mind dealt with the difficulty.  This is Section 65 of the Children and Young Persons Act (Scotland), 1937:&mdash;</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this Act a child or young person in need of care or protection&mdash;</P>
    <P>You will observe there is not one iota of that illuminating description in Section 58 of the Act of 1908.  Here, at the very outset, there is indicated what type of child is to be dealt with by protection in an industrial or a reformatory school:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this Act a child or young person in need of care or protection&mdash;</P>
    <P>Because that is the category to which the child to be detained must belong unless he is being dealt with as a juvenile delinquent</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="519" />&mdash;means a person who comes within any of the descriptions hereinafter mentioned, that is to say&mdash;a child or young person who, having no parent or guardian, or a parent or guardian unfit to exercise care of guardianship or not exercising proper care and guardianship, is falling into bad associations or exposed to moral danger or beyond control.</P>
    <P>There you have set out clearly and unmistakably the three situations of the child in question.  He has no parent or guardian and consequently is in need of protection.  Senator O'Connell in his speech said that the onus and the duty were on society at large, and not upon people of a charitable disposition, to make contributions for the purpose.  I think that is a doctrine with regard to social responsibility that it is very important to have reiterated.  Senator Hayes made very much the same comment. The child or young person has no parent or guardian, or has a parent but that parent is unfit to exercise proper care or guardianship or if not unfit, is not exercising proper guardianship, in point of fact.  There are three intelligible categories which provide the reason for the law and the community to interfere.  The consequence of the absence of parental control is that the child &ldquo;is falling into bad associations or is exposed to moral danger, or is beyond control.&rdquo;  That is a matter of fact and the Scottish mind, with its characteristic clarity of vision, sees how these facts are to be established and how they are to be established is just as clearly set out in 2 sub-section (2):</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of this section the fact that a child or young person is found destitute, or is found wandering without any settled place of abode or without visible means of subsistence or is found begging or receiving alms, or is found loitering for the purpose of so begging or receiving alms shall be evidence that he is exposed to moral danger.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>First of all, you have the classes that are dealt with and then what would justify you in so dealing with them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> Here is something of enormous value, totally absent from the Act of 1908 or the proposed amending Act.  This is Section 66:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any education authority, constable or authorised person having reasonable grounds for believing that a child or young person is in need of care or protection may bring him before a Juvenile Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The antecedent condition is that there is good reason to believe the child is in need of care and protection as evidenced by the fact that it is, as set out in the other section, without proper guardianship:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall be the duty of an education authority to bring before a Juvenile Court any child or young person residing or found in their area who appears to them to be in need of care or protection, unless they are satisfied that the taking of proceedings is undesirable in his interests or that proceedings are about to be taken by some other person.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What I have emphasised as the central motive in what I have read out should be the central motive in all legislation in regard to children&mdash;that it should be inspired with a desire to promote the child's interests, called here the child's welfare.  I take the liberty to suggest that these two sections together are infinitely superior to Section 58, which is allowed to stand and which is merely given a certain amount of additional matter in our Section 9.</P>
    <P>On the subject of welfare, I hope the Minister will forgive me for one unfriendly remark.  So far I recognise the difficulties attendant upon the making of a code in present circumstances. I also recognise, as Senator Hayes has done, the fact that the Minister for Education has his heart in these reforms just as much as any of us, but there was this addition made on the Report Stage.  It is on page 4 of the Bill, the last proviso:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Provided also that if application is made to the Minister for Education by the parents or surviving parent, or in the case of an illegitimate child, the mother of a child committed on the grounds stated <Col N="521" /> in paragraph (h) to a certified industrial school, for the discharge from such school of such child, the said Minister shall, if satisfied that the persons or person making such application are or is able to support such child, orders such discharge of such child.</P>
    <P>I restrain myself from saying about that provision what I think about it in my heart.  The mother of an illegitimate child, about whose mode of life we have no information, is enabled to exercise a veto, an absolute veto, over a district justice in the exercise of his discretion in sending a child for detention in an industrial school.  It is imperative on him if he is satisfied just of this, that the parent is able to support the child.  Support it where or support it how?  In view of our Constitution about which we boast every hour of every week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a decision in a leading case&mdash;a decision by Mr. Justice Lindley&mdash;where the word &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; is used in regard to a child. It is not his well-being in the ordinary physical sense of the word that is in contemplation; it includes his spiritual health, his spiritual welfare, as well. Some of us are old enough to remember the extraordinary decision of a judge in our own Four Courts which, in a case of what I shall call the disputed possession of a child, awarded the child to the Protestant parent's family as against what seemed to everyone <Col N="522" /> the prior and better claim of the Catholic parent's family.  And the ground was that he held that the child would be better provided for in that family.  That is contrary to the English decision which is good sense and good Christianity.</P>
      <P>Of course, we always blame the draftsman, but I think the draftsman really nodded here for a moment when he put into the Bill the words, &ldquo;to support such child,&rdquo; because under Section 30 it is provided that &ldquo;if the Minister for Education after consultation with the manager directs that it is necessary for the protection and welfare of the youthful offender.&rdquo;  There the word &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; is used in its precise signification as opposed to the legal position.  You often find words used such as &ldquo;dwellinghouse&rdquo; in an Act of Parliament, and &ldquo;part of a dwelling-house,&rdquo; but these words are defined so that they can be used in their strict legal construction.  And I am sure the word &ldquo;welfare,&rdquo; when used in its proper sense, means both the physical and spiritual welfare of the child.</P>
      <P>I dislike Section 9 for a variety of reasons, but one of my great objections has been disarmed by the statement of the Minister when he admitted that the Bill is vitiated to some extent as legislation by reference.  That is unfortunate. Legislation by reference in Section 9 includes a great deal more than merely references to certain subsections of the Principal Act.  It also contains tortuous, complicated instructions beyond the powers almost of anyone to understand their meaning.  It seems to me to be dictated by a desire to placate people who talk a great deal in the abstract about protecting the rights of parents with children they find it impossible to support.  It seems to be nothing short of an outrage in the minds of such people to send children of such poor people to an industrial school.  It was in order to placate critics of that kind that some of this Section 9 has been introduced.  For instance, it is provided that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The court shall not make an order that a child should be sent to a certified industrial school on the grounds stated in paragraph (h).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="523" /> The grounds stated in paragraph (h) are that the child &ldquo;is found destitute and is not an orphan, and his parents or surviving parent, or in the case of an illegitimate child, his mother, are, or is, unable to support him.&rdquo;  In this case the justice shall not make an order committing the child to a certified industrial school, because the child has a parent.  I do not think these things would appear in such crude form if there had been a preamble showing what it was that was being done in regard to this legislation; and that we were dealing with children that needed better care and protection.  Why should the mere fact that the parent has an attachment to its child put it beyond the power of the local authority to come to the relief of the child and to put the child into better circumstances? We all rejoice in the fact that even amongst the lower animals, not to talk of human beings, there is that love that refuses to recognise the right of anyone to take away their offspring. The parent will cling to his child and refuse to part with it even though in calmer moments it would be seen that it was a crime against the child.  We are dealing here with reformative efforts.</P>
    <P>It is admitted on all sides that there are numbers of people who cannot maintain their children at anything like a human level.  They have difficulty in maintaining themselves even at a subsistence level.  If these people are not in a position to provide for themselves and their children, every Christian will hold that it is the duty of civilised society to come to their rescue.  We must save these people from themselves, and the children from temptation to which they would possibly be exposed.  But all these things are viewed by the abstract mind as unjust interference with the rights of parents.</P>
    <P>That is a very desirable interference with the liberty of the person because it is in the best interests of the person to interfere in this case.  It is not sufficient to leave matters just as they are here, with the veto arising out of it, if it is to be effective to preclude the juvenile court from sending a child <Col N="524" /> to an industrial school.  This must have weighed with the Minister.  The unfortunate thing is that in the Twenty-Six Counties all that is considered in legislation is the alternative of industrial school or reformatory school.  The Scottish Act from which, with your permission, I have quoted, gives the additional alternative of schools provided by religious orders or similar organisations.  In circumstances which would excite the mother or parent to veto the sending of the child, there is no reason why recourse should not be had to what we know to exist in this country&mdash;the religious orders which exist for the purpose of aiding those who stand in need of aid.</P>
    <P>There are many other things to which I should like to refer, but I feel that I must not speak too long.  As the Minister has suggested, he can deal with them, perhaps, on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Act may be cited as the Children Act, 1941, and this Act and the Children, Act, 1908, the Children Act (1908) (Amendment) Act, 1910, the Children (Employment Abroad) Act, 1913, and the Children Act, 1934, may be cited together as the Children Acts, 1908 to 1941.  That is part of the last section&mdash; Section 24&mdash;which remains on the reader's mind very properly, as it was placed to remain.  Instead of the necessity of enumerating these individual Acts, we should have the Consolidated Act at the earliest moment to replace them all.  When the commission was sitting to examine and report on the advisability of a Second Chamber, the late Chief Justice, who was chairman of it, stressed in particular this value of a Second Chamber, that it could devote itself to the codification of Acts, that, as in the case here of children and young persons, it could sit as a committee of friendly people undivided by political allegiance and not inflamed with a Party spirit in the slightest degree.  They could come together and give their minds and hearts to the formation of a code which would embody all the best of the preceding legislation.  I remember well that the Chief Justice supported the setting up of the Second Chamber largely because he believed <Col N="525" /> that that would be one of the tasks to which it would set itself or which it would be set.</P>
    <P>To-day I am quite sure that there will be no trace of the influence of Party allegiance.  It has been shown to-day, in the speeches already made, that on a task of this kind, which is a discharge of a duty to those who stand in need of aid and help, to obtain for them the best that can be obtained in the way of charitable aid and charitable sympathy, this House can do the work.  Therefore I agree with the Minister that it is difficult to set about a consolidating Act in the present period with the disturbance of the public mind, but a beginning might be made, and there is no reason why this House should not still further justify its existence by applying its energies to that.</P>

      <P>This Bill, like the Act which it purports to amend and extend, is called the Children Bill, but there is a tendency and temptation to refer to it as the &ldquo;Children's Bill.&rdquo; Even purists like Senator Magennis felt that that slight misnomer is quite justifiable, because it is a &ldquo;Children's Bill&rdquo;&mdash;a Bill really meant for the care and protection of the children.  That object was in the minds of those who prepared the Bill and it was for the same purpose that the institutions to which it refers were called into being. I am glad to say that this aspect of the Bill has not been overlooked in this House.  I read very carefully the debates on it in the other House, and it seemed to have been overlooked there to a certain extent.  We heard a great deal about the rights of parents, but we heard very little about the rights of children.  The institutions were presented to us as a sort of penal institutions to which an interfering government were fond of committing children, after seizing them from the bosoms of their families and bringing them before some district justice who, for the sake of keeping up the institutions, disregarded the rights of the parents.  That seems to be a very mistaken point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The preamble, therefore, that Senator Magennis has called for is really provided in the very title of the Bill&mdash;<Col N="526" /> the Children Bill.  It is not inadvisable, I think, to look back over the circumstances, &ldquo;the bitter cry of the children,&rdquo; which called into existence the institutions to which the Bill refers. They spring from the purest impulses of Christian charity, they were called into existence for the sake of the children, orphaned or deprived &mdash;by the misfortunes, whether culpable or otherwise, of their parents&mdash;of the care and nurture which helpless infancy demands, and that training which would enable the little ones to fend for themselves in after life and which is requisite so that every human being may be ensured a decent life here, and equipped to fulfil his human destiny in this world and the next.  It was under this inspiration many charitable institutions made the care of helpless children their special preoccupation, as Senator Magennis has reminded us.</P>
    <P>Some of the greatest saints have been associated with this good work&mdash; St. Vincent de Paul, St. John Bosco and St. John Baptist de la Salle.  In regard to the latter, Senators will be interested to hear that he undertook, among the most beneficent works that he carried out, an institution on the lines of our present industrial schools &mdash;though I wish we could have a more attractive name for them.  He instituted such a school for the children of the poor &ldquo;Wild Geese,&rdquo; our unfortunate Irish soldiers who were driven from their native land to become cannon-fodder in the armies of foreign princes.  It is very romantic and glamorous to read about the charge at Fontenoy and the &ldquo;far foreign fields&rdquo; but behind them there was a tale of sordid want and suffering among the families of the &ldquo;Wild Geese&rdquo; which one does not dare to think of.  It was to relieve to some extent this misery that St. John Baptist de la Salle founded the institution to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>In our own country we have a long record of such charitable care for children. Silhouetted against the very dawn of our history stands the appealing figure of St. Ultan of Ardbraccan. He was the first, I think, we hear of. For the children left orphaned and <Col N="527" /> abandoned, when their parents were swept away in the yellow plague, he had a school and a place of nurture at Ardbraccan.  In the old books where the characteristics of the saints of Erin are referred to, we read of St. Ultan: &ldquo;Ultan loved her children.&rdquo; The care and protection of helpless children runs like a golden thread all through our history, and even in the worst days of the penal times that care and protection was not neglected. When, with the relaxation of the penal laws, the religious orders such as those founded by Mary Aikenhead, Catherine McAulay, Margaret Aylward and Edmund Rice came into existence, they discovered that a remarkable number of such institutions had been provided by poor working men.  In the <i>Annals</i> of the Poor Clares of Harold's Cross I found that a poor working-man, called Patrick Quatermann, founded such an orphanage with the help of his fellow working-men, and they carried it on until it was taken over by the nuns early in the last century.</P>
    <P>The same is true of the orphanage that was taken over by Mother Mary Aikenhead from a group of poor men who called themselves the Trinitarian Orphan Society.  That shows the spirit that prevailed in connection with these institutions, and it spread all through the different classes of society until people began to have a social conscience. Some one has spoken of the difference between 1908 and 1941.  Now those two dates are separated only by a matter of 30 or so years, but, by the development of a social conscience, the care and protection of these children was first taken on by poor working-men such as Patrick Quatermann and others, and afterwards, when the penal laws were relaxed, by the religious orders, and finally became the care of the State.  In other words, the people themselves, acting through their Legislative Assemblies and through their Executive, assumed as a social duty the care and protection of children who are in need of such protection and care, either through being orphaned and deprived of their natural supporters, or through other misfortunes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> Now that the responsibility for the care and protection of these children has been taken over by the State&mdash;I speak of &ldquo;the State&rdquo; in the widest sense, as including local authorities&mdash; the functions of a parent in respect of these children have also been taken over.  I think it is well, therefore, to realise that there are some matters affecting the care of these children where parental control could be exercised more effectively.  I join with those who made a plea for the proper payment of teachers in industrial schools.  Very often the children who go into these schools, as Senator O'Connell has said, and as Senator Hayes reiterated, are &ldquo;problem children&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Their history has been such as to make it sometimes difficult to train them, and therefore you want to have very good teachers for them&mdash;teachers who are extremely well trained and well paid.  Perhaps the Minister might consider whether or not it is possible that, in connection with the training colleges, there might be a Department for the training of teachers who might afterwards be in charge of &ldquo;problem&rdquo; children, and that at the same time there should be some kind of clinic for dealing with such children.  Perhaps that might meet the suggestion made by Deputy Dillon in the other House and by Senator Hayes here, for these children are very often maladjusted either physically or psychologically, and if it were possible to have them examined, and if there were a special department in the training colleges to prepare teachers to deal with these children, I think it would do good. This is a matter that has only just occurred to me, but I think it would serve a useful purpose if such specially trained teachers were available for these institutions.</P>
    <P>There is another suggestion that I should like to make.  I am familiar with an excellent industrial school in Galway which is run by a Sister of great experience.  She tells me that girls who leave at 16 years of age are handicapped in getting employment in domestic work.  Now, the running of a house requires greater judgment and <Col N="529" /> training than is usually found in a girl of 16 years old, and the Sister's suggestion is that there might be an institution, or a few institutions, where girls who show talent in that direction might have further training from 16 to 18 years of age.  I should like to join with those who have protested about the use of terms like committal and detention orders in connection with these children, because I think that attached to them is a sort of stigma that could easily be avoided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be permitted to join in the plea that was so ably and eloquently put forward by Senator Magennis for a codification or consolidation of the legislation relating to children in this country.  One sympathises with the Minister's position regarding this need, but in the course of his introduction of the Bill he made two statements which do not appear to coincide.  He referred to the Act of 1908 as being on the whole, and with certain amendments which the present Bill proposes to give it, satisfactory. The facts, I am afraid, do not justify that optimism.  The Minister, of course, will plead that two other Ministers and two other Departments, are, of necessity, involved in any codification of the law relating to children, and that, of course, is so. He will also possibly plead that the present time is not the most propitious period for indulging in new legislation which would, of necessity, involve a considerable amount of research and re-drafting.  As against that, I can only put forward the plea that such legislation as was proposed by Senator Magennis is of such urgency that it should be drafted or prepared at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To point to one instance which, to my mind, clearly indicates the failure of the past Acts and the need for a more enlightened codification of child legislation, the crime figures for Cork City in the year 1940 tell a very sorry tale.  Of the total percentage of crime committed in the city, children under the age of 18 were responsible for 40 per cent.  I am not in a position to give the figures for any other part of <Col N="530" /> Ireland, but I take it that the children of Cork City are probably no better or worse than the children in any other part of the country.  I would then strongly urge the Minister that he should use every endeavour and any persuasive influence he possesses&mdash;and I am sure he possesses a great deal &mdash;to persuade his colleagues, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Local Government, to consent to a codification of the children legislation. I sincerely hope, before the present legislative year is out, in this House we will be having a further debate on the subject and that we will see the Minister introducing, not an amending Act but an Act entitled the Children Act, 1941.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to follow the general lines of the debate. I agree with a great deal that has been said and I believe that most of these points can further be dealt with in Committee Stage, that is in so far as the shape and form of the Bill will make it practicable to do so.  I sympathise with Senators Magennis and Crosbie in asking for a codification but I would like to make the Minister a somewhat simpler request which I think should not be impracticable. This Act and the Children Act, 1908, the Amendment Act, 1910, the Employment Abroad Act, 1913, and the Act of our own Parliament, 1934, are cited together.  In order to understand the law on that particular matter each person will have to get those Acts.  I suggest that somebody will have to do it and I suggest it might be done before the Bill leaves this House instead of leaving it to a very large number of persons who will have to do it in order to understand the law on the matter and who will probably make mistakes.  I recognise that there has to be a certain amount of legislation by reference and that when particularly short Acts of an amending nature come in it would be unnecessary to reprint the previous Act.  I think I have spoken on this on quite a number of occasions, both when the previous Government was in power and since this Government came <Col N="531" /> into power.  I want to protest strongly against introducing Bills of this kind which are amendments, of Acts passed before this State came into being without going to the trouble of consolidating, at any rate in so far as they carry on the previous legislation.  It means in effect that Parliament&mdash;the Dáil and this House&mdash;cannot and does not give the same care and attention to amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite a common practice to send out, as was done in this case, an explanatory leaflet.  The explanatory leaflet only tells us what the Minister hopes he is doing in the Act.  It has no legal value and it is extremely difficult for us to go through the law, as we ought to in this House&mdash;even if we accept, as most of us do, the main objects of the Minister &mdash; and see whether we can help him to discover whether he is actually doing it.  That cannot be done with a measure of this kind.  I did not do it in this case.  I found it was almost impracticable. When I took it up for an evening at home, I found I had not got the British Act and could not get it immediately. On a previous occasion I sent to Easons and got the British Act.  It referred to three other British Acts and I could not go on until I had time to send for them.  It is true, if you are prepared to do all your work in the Library here, you can get all these Acts, but the best work done by members of both Houses is done at home. We are entitled to, and can get all our own legislation and I do not object at all to the same extent to legislation of this kind referring to Acts which were passed by our own Parliament and which in a set of volumes of our own legislation can reasonably well be understood, but when we go back to British Acts before then I think the principle is definitely bad.  My object in speaking now is, first of all, to protest against it and, secondly, to ask the Minister seriously to consider whether it would be extremely difficult for someone to make the necessary amendment and to reprint it.  I think it would save a great deal of time afterwards at comparatively small expense.  That is not going as far as <Col N="532" /> asking for a codification of the law relating to children, but simply making clear all the Acts which are included here and which are to be cited together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Minister in trying to gather together the shreds and patches of various Acts and co-ordinating them into one treatise of a legislative character.  It is almost impossible to make anything of this Bill as it stands without having an immense amount of material available. I quite agree with Senator Douglas that it should not be so difficult to retain all the material of the Bill that it is intended to pass and to have legislation by reference as small as possible.</P>
      <P>The findings of the commission set up in 1934, I think, were generally acknowledged to be very sound, and I was glad to hear the Minister say that the majority of those findings were embodied in this Bill.  I cannot see how that is correct.  There is one glaring recommendation that is not embodied.  These institutions are educational institutions, the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; in this case covering a very wide field of social instruction.  I do not say that the present system of education in some of the institutions is not carried on very successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education is carried on with marked success in some we all know of but in others that is not the case and for two reasons: First, the buildings are not suitable.  Much has been said about the bad condition of national schools in the country.  Much could be said about some of the institutions in which this work is carried on.  We have had a recent example of it.  One of the institutions was visited by the Taoiseach himself, and I understand the conditions under which the work is being carried on are appalling. Children from that institution were sent back to a building that already had been abandoned by reason of its inferior quality and unsuitability as a place for receiving instruction.  Education cannot be carried on successfully in such environment.  Neither can education be carried on without qualified men in every sphere of education. <Col N="533" /> There are exceedingly able men in some of these institutions, but on the other hand there are men who have more or less drifted into those positions and whose qualifications are not of a high standard, to put it very, very mildly.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the commission had to do with buildings. They also had to do with the education of the pupils and naturally, in that connection, they had to do with the qualifications of those engaged in that occupation.  It laid down the standard. The standard of those schools up to a certain stage was to be the standard adopted in the national schools and the teachers were to have qualifications enabling them to teach such standards.  You will not get qualified men to take up this work if they are not paid for the work.  It is a well-known fact that the salary is not regulated by the State Department but by the manager of the particular school and, possibly owing to the smallness of his resources, he is not in a position to pay such salary as would induce a competent, fully qualified man to take up this work if he can get work of a similar nature outside the institution.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the institution for this, but I think the Department should regard itself as equally responsible for the education of those unfortunate, destitute children as it is for the education of the people of the country who are much better circumstanced. It seems an extraordinary thing that they should be looked upon as a class apart, and that any kind of teacher may take up the work if he is able to go through the elements of teaching without any knowledge of child psychology, without any training, perhaps, for that purpose.  I think that one of the greatest blots on this Bill is that the work of teaching is not paid for by the Department.  No matter whether those teachers are lay teachers, secular teachers, or, whether they belong to an Order, at least grants or subsidies might be given so that they could be paid by the Department directly out of Departmental funds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> There are lay teachers of seven or eight or ten years' standing working for meagre salaries and without any pension rights.  Some of those are not only trained teachers working five days a week, but working on Saturdays and Sundays as well on work assigned to them outside their ordinary duties of teaching.  I do not say that they object to this, but it seems a very undesirable state of affairs that the Government of the country and the State will not pay for the education of those children. They say: &ldquo;We give a capitation grant of so much a head.&rdquo;  That is a poor way of doing it.  It may be said that this grant system applies to other institutions, but if it does, it is on a more generous scale.</P>
    <P>I would earnestly appeal to the Minister to consider the position of the lay teachers in those schools.  I am informed that the amount required to pay them by the State would not be more than £5,000 or £6,000.  They should be given, too, the same pension rights as the national teachers of the country.  They are doing the same work, following the same syllabus, they are inspected in the same way and they get much more work to do&mdash;work extraneous to the work of teachers.  It would help the institutions to relieve them of payment of the sum of £5,000&mdash; £3,000 has been mentioned in one case&mdash;or at the very outside £6,000.</P>
    <P>In regard to medical inspection, I cannot say what provision has been made in the Bill.  Is it included?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say something regarding the supervision of the after-life of those children.  Notwithstanding the great work done by those institutions, somehow or other the mentality of our people associates the products of these schools with something very nearly approaching a taint, and very few of the people make any distinction between boys sent to reformatory schools and those sent to industrial schools.  The unfortunate child who is destitute and who has no one to look after him or give him protection is sent to an industrial school <Col N="535" /> and I think that type of child forms the majority of the groups sent to industrial schools.  I do not think the taint of mere poverty should ever be associated with children who are sent to such schools, because they are in need of care and protection and belong to a better grade in life.</P>
      <P>There are institutions throughout the land, such as the O'Brien Institute, where destitute children are kept by charity and the taint of pauperism and of the reformatory and industrial school never pursues them in after life. The child feels that there is a taint attached to him when he is in an industrial school.  We should, if we can, get away from the word &ldquo;reformatory&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;industrial&rdquo; seems all right&mdash;but &ldquo;reformatory&rdquo; implies that you are reclaiming from the criminal state.  To apply the word &ldquo;reformatory&rdquo; is bad.  If the word &ldquo;institution,&rdquo;&ldquo;national institution&rdquo; or some other name like &ldquo;Bosco Institution&rdquo; were applied to it, it would take away the whole traditional flavour of reformatory that haunts a boy, I might say, to his grave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would make the suggestion that if the Minister had cut all the shackles that bound him to the 1908 Act and built a system of his own, called by his own name, getting away from all the old titles and old ways and creating a clean system of education, whether it be industrial or reformatory education, people would have a different outlook towards it.  Boys educated in such institutions as I have mentioned can go out in the world and can fill the place in society that their training in life entitles them to.  You have many destitute children who once belonged to a good class of people, who are fit to occupy any place in society, but the taint of pauperism pursues them from the cradle to the grave.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that it was not the final word, although the Bill before us is only a thing of shreds and patches.  I admit that it is an improvement, and that it contains very desirable advances, but much is still wanted. When the Minister tackles this question again, I suggest that he starts from <Col N="536" /> bed rock to build up a new system appropriate to the conditions of our people.  In after-life, those boys and girls go out into the country and this taint or flavour that I referred to is a very serious matter for them.</P>
    <P>It was suggested here, at some portion of the discussion, that boys should be followed up to 21 and kept in such an institution.  I think that would be a disastrous development.  I think that boys reared in such an institution without a taint of pauperism would find homes with good families as members of the family.  Many old bachelors, old maids, or widows, would possibly adopt some of those boys and admit them to their households.  That, I think, would be a more desirable thing than retaining them in institutions until they were 21 years of age.  The suggestion was absurd and I do not think anything like it has been embodied in the Bill. After-care of those people is very important and I believe it would pay the Government to allot a reasonable amount of money for the upkeep of these people in private families until the age of 21, rather than keep them in an institution.  Many people would be glad to take them and keep them as members of their households and give them a different outlook on life.  At present, when they leave the institution, they are often treated as pariahs &mdash;they have no relatives or friends and no one to take them in or welcome them home.  There is a danger that in these circumstances they will become mere flotsam and jetsam in spite of all the valuable work done in the institution.</P>
    <P>The time, I know, is not opportune for making big constructive proposals for child or social welfare.  Present social conditions are a great deal responsible for the misery we have to-day.  The social and economic conditions of the present world system will have to be changed or those problems will trouble us for ever.  To some extent, of course, they will always be with us, but, I believe the present condition of world welfare is responsible for keeping the people down in ways of poverty.  I hope that the Minister, when he tackles the problem again, will <Col N="537" /> come down to bedrock and build up a national system that will not have the taint of poverty, or, perhaps, of crime, that it has at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCampbell" hpid="Mr. Campbell Mr. Campbell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is one subject, Sir, more than any other which calls for sympathy and understanding in its treatment it is that dealt with in the Bill now before the House, and, while I have some criticisms to offer in respect of it, I have no doubt that the Minister, when preparing this amending legislation, approached the problem with every feeling of consideration and sympathy for that weak and helpless section of the community with which it deals.  Unfortunately, however, his efforts fall far short of what many of us would like to see accomplished in this Bill, but, while deploring its shortcomings in general, and regretting that many of the most important recommendations of the Cussen Commission have failed to be implemented, I think it is only fair at the same time to admit that, in so far as the actual proposals of the Minister in the Bill are concerned, they do mark some improvement on the present position.</P>
      <P>Although this problem involves a relatively small percentage of the community it bristles with innumerable difficulties, and presents many obstacles to those engaged in dealing with it. From the time the child comes under the observation of the authorities for their decision as to whether it is in his or her best interest to be sent to an industrial school right up to the time when the child leaves the institution the problem remains one of extreme delicacy and difficulty.  Those charged with their custody and entrusted with the task of educating them, shaping their minds, and moulding their character so that they may be fitted to take the place they ought to take in the community when their periods of detention in these institutions come to an end, have a heavy responsibility imposed on them, a responsibility that calls for constant vigilance and attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to appear captious in my criticism, but the failure of the <Col N="538" /> Minister to avail of the opportunity provided by this Bill to give effect to many of the recommendations of the commission appointed in 1934 to inquire into the reformatory and industrial school system, and which presented its report in 1936, has been a source of profound disappointment to many of those who take an interest in this particular aspect of the social problem.  That commission's report included proposals for the amendment of existing legislation on the whole subject; and, in the explanatory memorandum issued by the Department in connection with this Bill, the statement is made that that recommendation to amend the law as it stands at present, was fortified and justified by the fact that the Department's own experience of the administration of the system had also shown that the amendment of legislation dealing with reformatories and industrial schools was vitally necessary.</P>
    <P>Now, while it is only fair to say that the Bill purports, and, in fact, does implement certain recommendations of the commission, it must be a matter of extreme regret, to say the least of it, that some of its more valuable recommendations have been completely ignored.  There might be some excuse for not adopting some of these recommendations on the ground of the cost that might be involved in putting them into force at the present time, when such heavy financial demands are being made on the State&mdash;though personally I do not think an excuse of that kind should be permitted to influence us unduly when dealing with such a vital matter as the welfare and safety of the orphaned and destitute.</P>
    <P>It does, however, seem difficult to understand why some, at least, of the recommendations of the commission in which no great expenditure of money was involved, were not embodied in the legislation now before the House. Why, for example, was not the commission's recommendation adopted that the term &ldquo;Committal Order&rdquo; should be abolished and &ldquo;Admission Order&rdquo; substituted for it; or, why was not the very proper proposal given effect to that the titles <Col N="539" />&ldquo;Reformatory School&rdquo; and &ldquo;Industrial School&rdquo; should be abolished and alternative suggestions adopted in respect of these schools; or, again, why was not the practical suggestion that primary teachers in these schools should have the same general training and qualifications in Irish as the teachers in the National schools embodied in the amended legislation now before the House?  Surely, the State would be involved in no great cost in giving legislative effect to these simple, but highly desirable, recommendations.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong in my presumption, but I mention these few examples because they do not appear to me to offer much difficulty in that respect, and I cannot understand why the Minister did not embody them in the Bill when he decided to amend the legislation dealing with reformatories and industrial schools.  Indeed, there have been so many omissions to implement the recommendations of the Cussen Commission that the Bill might be said to be remarkable not so much for the little good it purposes to effect by its passage into law, as for the amount of good that will be left undone by the failure to embody the many valuable suggestions and recommendations of the commission in it.</P>
    <P>One of the most important recommendations, involving the health of the children in these schools, suggesting that each school should have a medical and dental attendant paid by the school on a capitation basis at a rate prescribed by the Minister, apparently received no consideration whatever in the Bill.  Similarly, in the sphere of education, a proposal that where agricultural training is given, in addition to tillage operations, such adjuncts as poultry-keeping, horticulture and beekeeping should be included in the school curriculum seems to have met with a like fate.  Neither is any notice whatever taken of the highly valued observation of the commission that the conditions of service for lay teachers in the schools call for substantial improvement, and in connection with which the commission recommended <Col N="540" /> that future appointments should be on the same basis as the national schools, and that duties, other than teaching, should not be assigned to recognised teachers.  I could cite other examples in which valuable suggestions or recommendations have been completely ignored, but I submit I have quoted enough to demonstrate the futility of commissions when their labours receive such scant recognition at the hands of the State.  Governments invariably are twitted for their failure to give effect to the recommendations of commissions set up by themselves, and I do not think it would be unfair to say that this is one occasion on which one would have to admit that such twitting was justified.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Minister was only dealing with one portion of the Children Act of 1908, that is Part IV of it, which deals with the industrial and reformatory schools, and that he had perforce to confine his efforts and only seek to amend or extend those provisions which seemed to deal specifically with these institutions, and that other recommendations of the commission consequently had to be ignored, because they came within the purview of other Departments, may fairly be advanced as an excuse for the Bill's limitations.  But, while admitting this fact, it does seem a pity that the Minister, when he decided to embark on the task of amending legislation, did not seek the co-operation and collaboration of the other Departments concerned, for the purpose of submitting a more comprehensive Bill, one covering every aspect of this grave problem, and one approximating more to what the gravity of this aspect of the social question requires.</P>
    <P>It is to be regretted, too, that the Bill contains no proposals to remedy what are some of the most objectionable aspects of the industrial school system.  Two of the most undesirable features of that system are, firstly, the provision whereby children who are orphaned or destitute but who are not charged with any offence whatever, are committed to schools which are <Col N="541" /> certified places of detention for young delinquents; and, secondly, the lack of provision of suitable employment for children when they leave the industrial schools.  It seems to me a pity that the Minister did not make provision to discontinue an injustice which weighs so heavily on many of the past pupils of industrial schools, an injustice whereby orphans and destitute children are treated by the State as if they were young criminals.</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment pretend to make the case that the offences with which some children are charged, and for which they are sentenced to detention in industrial schools, are crimes in the real meaning of the word, but if in the eyes of the law they are offences incurring deprivation of liberty, separation from home and parents, and detention for reform or correction in certified schools, why must the poor and the orphan be compelled by law to share a common fate with these young offenders?</P>
    <P>Why must their whole lives be embittered by the conviction that even their best friends regard them as products of &ldquo;criminal schools&rdquo;, &ldquo;correction schools&rdquo; or &ldquo;reform schools&rdquo;?  The implication is, of course, that they, too, were sent to industrial schools for one form of delinquency or another.</P>
    <P>I have been told by one associated with past pupils of these schools over a long period of years, and who is in a position to know, that this injustice is bitterly resented.  It is, in almost all cases, an ever-present nightmare, a stigma that no amount of success in life can erase, and a life-long handicap in social intercourse.  It may be advanced in favour of the existing practice that the number of children committed for indictable offences is small, and does not adversely influence other children in these schools.  Admittedly the number of such committals is comparatively small&mdash;the Minister himself speaking on the Second Reading debate in the Dáil said it was only about 10 per cent.&mdash;but even that small percentage is sufficient to compromise the reputation of every child in the <Col N="542" /> schools, as is only too well known to those in intimate and daily contact with the position.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that an uplifting influence is desirable in the treatment of young delinquents.  The remedy should, however, be provided otherwise&mdash;not at the expense of thousands of poor and orphans.  Besides the present practice is decidedly wrong in principle.</P>
    <P>Would any supporter of the Bill in the House, in its present form, be resigned to have his own children sent to an industrial school if obliged to do so, due to some unforeseen misfortune? Would he allow them to enter an institution where their companions might include children sent there for some grave delinquency?  Would he argue, indeed, that these companions had really committed no offences at all? That they would not adversely influence his children in any degree? That, instead, his children's example would exercise a beneficial effect on such wayward companions?  That this association and companionship would leave no stain or taint on his children's character or reputation?</P>
    <P>On the contrary, he would have reason to expect that in the course of a very few years, when the reality of their position would dawn upon them, his children would bitterly blame him for thus permitting them to be condemned to the condition of social outcasts.</P>
    <P>This is a matter that calls for remedy and the solution I submit is one that would not entail any additional expenditure. Let one of the industrial schools be assigned for the reception of all children for whom school correction is considered necessary, due to delinquency or criminal tendencies.</P>
    <P>Let this school, and the existing reformatory for more grown boys, be designated &ldquo;approved schools.&rdquo;  The senior approved school would meet the purpose of the present reformatory, while the junior approved school would be available for delinquents such as are now under sentence of detention in the industrial schools.</P>
    <P>The remaining industrial schools <Col N="543" /> could then cater exclusively for the orphans, the destitute, and similar cases as at present, but let them be renamed: &ldquo;national boarding schools&rdquo; as suggested by the Cussen Commission.</P>
    <P>Thus one grave injustice could be terminated, while the titles &ldquo;approved schools&rdquo; and &ldquo;national boarding schools&rdquo; would be a wholesome departure from what the public has grown accustomed to regard with disfavour and suspicion.  There is decideldly a bad flavour attached to the titles &ldquo;reformatory&rdquo; and &ldquo;industrial school.&rdquo;  They are relics of an alien rule, and ought to find no place in our administrative terminology.  The Minister has told us he would be prepared to do anything to remove the stigma from those attending these schools.</P>
    <P>Now, in regard to the lack of suitable employment for children when they leave the industrial schools, I submit it ought to be the responsibility of the State to take steps to place orphans and destitute children in a position to earn a decent livelihood; or, alternatively to provide them with continued financial aid to enable them to live decently and in reasonable comfort while completing the knowledge of their occupation, or serving a period of apprenticeship.</P>
    <P>The money spent on these schools is, to a great extent, wasted, because of this inability to provide suitable work for these orphans and destitute children at the most critical period of their lives.  This whole problem of after-care, which mainly is concerned with the provision of employment, is so great that the management of the schools can touch only the fringe of it.</P>
    <P>Under prevailing conditions they have no option but to accept the best position that offers, though they are all too conscious that very often these positions leave much to be desired. How often these poor children are callously exploited by unscrupulous employers, aye, and on occasion, even maltreated by them, or their agents, is only too well known to those who <Col N="544" /> take an interest in this sphere of social effort.</P>
    <P>And, even the Cussen Commission, with ample evidence before it on all aspects of industrial school work and its attendant difficulties, did not offer a single practical suggestion on this, the most important aspect of the whole system.  And neither is this very grave aspect of the matter so much as alluded to in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like briefly to refer to the matter of Press reports.  Such is the publicity given by the Press to some court cases where children are committed for indictable offences that the public has come to regard every child admitted to the schools as a young criminal of some sort.  This attitude is obviously unjust to the thousands admitted to the schools on grounds of destitution, loss of parents, or similar causes.</P>
    <P>The practice, too, of using the threat of committal to industrial schools, in proceedings against children appearing in the courts, serves also to confirm public opinion in an unjust estimate of children who through destitution or orphanhood are sent to these institutions. Many of these cases are regarded as such good copy that they are prominently featured in the news columns.</P>
    <P>Some time ago a boy of 13 years was charged with murder.  The case got appropriate notoriety in the newspapers. It was decided to have the body committed to an industrial school. Accordingly, I am told the schools were canvassed for a vacancy, intimating that the charge of murder would be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Some days later the newspapers recorded, for the enlightenment of their readers, that the justice &ldquo;refused informations on the murder charge and ordered that the boy be sent to a certified industrial until he had reached the age of 16.&rdquo;  Nor was any other explanation given as to why the boy was considered suitable for detention in an industrial school.  Readers were left to draw their own obvious <Col N="545" /> conclusions, and we may presume that they were even further confirmed in their estimate of the pupils of such schools.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the Second Reading in the Dáil, the Minister compared these schools with ordinary schools, and said that particular industrial schools were carried on very well and in close proximity to secondary schools of the same order, and that, if Deputies were to visit these two schools under the same management they would agree that there was very little difference between the treatment the children got in the industrial school and that which they got in the secondary school.  I am quite prepared to accept the Minister's statement in that regard. I believe, and will admit quite frankly, that the treatment meted out to the occupants of those schools would be the same, having regard to the Christian charity of the people operating those schools.  They are operated mainly by religious Orders, and I am sure that they will not make any distinction so far as the general treatment of pupils in either school is concerned. If this particular boy happened to be in the secondary school, I would like to know what the Minister's reactions would be; that is, if he had been sent, not to the industrial school, but to the secondary school.  I wonder if the Minister would feel quite happy about his children being associated with that boy.</P>
    <P>The public misconception in this matter causes untold difficulty, when the quest for employment for children leaving school has to be made.  In the vast majority of cases it is absolutely fatal to success to own any connection with an industrial school, while to produce a reference from one with a view to obtaining any position of trust, is sufficient to prejudice all hope of success.  To remedy this to some extent a provision should be included in the Bill prohibiting any reference by the Press to cases appearing before the courts where juveniles are concerned or where there is question of committal to a school.  The present provisions dealing with Press reports on such cases are useless and altogether inadequate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> It is all nonsense to say that no stigma attaches to those children who have been inmates of an industrial school.  Let us not try to deceive ourselves into the belief that a child on leaving an institution of that kind does not do so carrying a very heavy handicap. The Minister, speaking on the Second Reading debate in the Dáil on this matter, went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With regard to the feeling that some Deputies have about a stigma on children who have been in industrial schools, I cannot quite understand that.  I think it should be fairly well known that the vast majority of the children in industrial schools, as was mentioned here, have not been charged with any offence; and any persons who take it upon themselves to insinuate that there is a brand or stigma on industrial school children are entirely ignorant, as well as being very malicious and very unChristian.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, every right-thinking and decent-minded person will admit that it is most malicious and unChristian to refer so to these unfortunate and helpless victims of a system that has little regard itself for true Christian ideals. We would be foolish to delude ourselves into believing that a boy coming from an industrial school to seek employment in any industry stands in the same relation to a boy who comes from an ordinary school.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister was limited in his action in this Bill by the fact that other Departments were concerned. I hope he has given us some indication that this is only the first step in legislation to remedy the effects of this whole industrial and reformatory school system.  I join with Senator Magennis and others in hoping that the Minister will take steps in the near future to make a really serious effort to codify and crystallise the whole law relating to this matter. Such legislation is long overdue and, after the Minister has completed the steps he has taken now, I hope he will proceed to give us a more comprehensive measure in the near future.</P>
    <Col N="547" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a number of very interesting speeches on this Bill, and I am glad to see that the House has taken such a keen interest in it.  There has been a good deal of reference here to the matter to which I called attention myself&mdash;the example of legislation by reference, which we have in this Bill.  I think that, possibly, the difficulty of interpretation, if and when the Bill becomes law, could be overcome by publishing a reprint of the operative sections of the Principal Act, together with the amendments made in it under the present measure.  Of course, it is only Part IV of the Children Act with which I am concerned, and while I quite agree with a good deal of what Senator Magennis and other speakers have been saying about the necessity to consolidate all this legislation, there are great difficulties in the way.  Even in Great Britain, a very considerable time elapsed&mdash;I think at least a quarter of a century&mdash;before the Consolidation Act was brought in in Scotland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is the difficulty that a great many other Departments besides the Departments of Justice and Local Government are concerned. I am reminded that the Department of Industry and Commerce, for example, is concerned in the matter.  It would need a great deal of time.  Take that one Department alone: the codification of legislation dealing with juvenile employment and the implementation of new legislation, if it were considered necessary, would, I imagine, demand the attention of the greater part, if not the whole, of the resources of the Department for a period of time.  Then, with regard to the Department of Local Government, as Senator Magennis has pointed out, they are responsible for the law relating to infants, as also the questions of boarded-out children and medical treatment.  Even in that one Department, if one considers the extraordinary scope and number of the Public Health Acts, it is obviously a task of great difficulty to consolidate all the legislation.  In any case I think that, even if we had the opportunity at present to undertake this <Col N="548" /> work, it would be rather premature. The work itself would be imperfect until we have a further examination of the whole question.  For example, after the war we do not know what changes in social policy or social legislation may be brought about, and I think we must necessarily bide our time until we see how the situation develops.</P>
    <P>Certainly, I should like very much if similar legislation as that to which Senator Magennis referred&mdash;the admirable Act that was passed in Scotland&mdash; were to be passed here, but it is really a matter in which, I think, the Department of Justice would have to take the initiative, as I suppose three-fourths of the Act deal with court questions. Then, as I mentioned, there are a great many different subjects in connection with local government which, obviously, would have to be dealt with, and perhaps, on account of the huge amount of social legislation that is now going through Parliament, it might be better if the matter were dealt with by subject rather than by an attempt to consolidate legislation which, no sooner would it have been consolidated, might require to have important amendments. However, it is a matter for experts and I think that even those who have pressed the case feel that the time is not opportune.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Connell referred to the rates of grant being insufficient.  Well, if the position is, as I understand it to be, that the original intention was that the local authorities should be responsible for the maintenance of these schools and that it was a local service in the first instance, I do not see how we could possibly defend transferring the entire burden of the cost to the Exchequer.  If Senator O'Connell had had contact with Exchequer matters, from time to time, I think he would realise that it would be quite fruitless to approach the Department of Finance on that matter.  We must first find out whether we can at least get the same amount of assistance from the local authority as the State is prepared to give, and that is not a great deal.  If we advance to that position first, we may be able to advance further later on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> I do not think it would be feasible to bring over lay teachers and put them on our Vote for Primary Education, giving them the same recognition, status and emoluments as the ordinary national teachers.  I am afraid that we could not possibly justify the differentiation between the lay teachers of literary subjects in these schools and the Brothers or Nuns, for example, who probably are doing the greater part of the work, if not the most important work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood Senator O'Connell's suggestion to be that we should take over the lay teachers and that it could be done at a less cost, or only a fraction of the cost of putting all the literary teachers on the basis of national teachers, leaving the members of the religious Orders to be dealt with later.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>In what way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not three meals a day guaranteed to them, nor have they sickness benefits or old age pensions, and that is a very important distinction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it might be questioned whether they have three meals a day guaranteed to them any more than to anybody else.  Senator Magennis raised an important point. In reference to the general question of the consent of the parents he did not seem to be quite satisfied as to the position I am taking up.  This is a matter to which I gave a great deal of consideration.  Certain advice that I received seemed to indicate that in order to cover very exceptional cases <Col N="550" /> one should definitely amend, and, so to speak, set aside&mdash;even though it would be only in a limited number of cases, which would be set out&mdash;this question of the consent of the parents having to be given.  On going through the matter, however, I found that the thing was impracticable.  The number of such exceptional cases is very limited, and I felt that a lot of the contention in regard to the vitiation of that principle of parental consent in the question of destitute children would fail.  In fact, I think that the general attitude in both Houses would be that, whatever necessity there might be for amending the law, the principle laid down in the 1929 Act would have to be observed fundamentally.</P>
      <P>In the case of the mother of an illegitimate child it may happen, for example, that the grandparents take over the child, and if the grandparents or a sister of the mother are prepared to look after the child, the question would arise whether we will give power to the court to take the child away in that case.  I think, however, that the answer to the Senator's point is to be found in the cases set out in Section 58 of the Principal Act, to which the Senator referred.  That section sets out various reasons on account of which, if the court is satisfied, the child can be taken away.  For example, under Clause (f) of that section, the child can be committed if he</P>
      <P>&ldquo;frequents the company of any reputed thief, or any common or reputed prostitute; or (g) is lodging or residing in a house or part of a house used by any prostitute for the purpose of prostitution, or is otherwise living in circumstances calculated to cause, encourage, or favour the seduction or prostitution of the child.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is also a provision (d) where the child</P>
      <P>&ldquo;is under the care of a parent or guardian who, by reason of criminal or drunken habits, is unfit to have care of the child.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the general character of the mother <Col N="551" /> is such that the police feel that it is worth while taking the case to court under one of these three headings, if not under some other heading of Section 58, I think that provision would meet the type of case that Senator Magennis has in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>But the proviso would appear expressly not to do what the Minister has just contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only intended that the proviso should apply to cases of destitution.  If, in fact, the proviso applies to the other cases and if, as the Senator contends, the mother of an illegitimate child, where the conditions were not suitable, was to have a veto in other cases except in the case of destitution, I do not think that would do.  It is a matter, however, that I should like to look into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit, with respect, that the intention of the amendment was to open a door in the case of a destitute child, who might have, as the Minister said, a grandmother or other relative, or even a charitable organisation, willing to take care of it.  I contend that that is not the proper interpretation of the words as they now stand.  Perhaps the Minister will bear it in mind between this and the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The main problem, of course, referred to in the present measure is that of destitute children. As Senator Magennis has pointed out, we have first the case of children who are in need of protection and care, and secondly we have the children of the delinquent class.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made by Senator Hayes and other speakers to the names of these schools.  We have not been able to reach agreement as to the names.  In regard to the suggestion that the name should be &ldquo;national boarding school,&rdquo; I do not feel that would secure general acceptance.  However, it is a matter that is worth looking into further and it may be possible to get titles other than those at present in use before the Bill is finally passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes also seemed to feel <Col N="552" /> that these children are all defective. I do not quite understand what he means by defective.  As far as mental power is concerned, I think they are not defective.  I have a report here from one of my inspectors dealing with one of the largest of these schools. The institution is highly efficient, and it is quite obvious that the children in that school, which may be taken as very representative, are practically the same as, possibly somewhat better than the average school, say, in Dublin City. I do not quite understand what the case is when it is suggested that we have to deal with defective children or problem children when it is quite clear, as I have said, that 90 per cent. of the cases, at any rate, clearly arise from poverty, while another 5 per cent. are cases where the children fail to attend school.  If the remaining 5 per cent. were examined I think it would be found that the offences perhaps were not very serious, but that either the question of neglect or of environment or bad associates, possibly all three combined, compelled the justice to feel that he had to commit the child.  The problem of defective children, if it is going to be approached from the point of view of mental backwardness, is not really one that comes up appropriately under the Department of Education, unless we are going to have duplication of the services.  We have a schools' medical service, and in fact at the present time an investigation is being carried on, and has been carried on for some time past, into the question of defective children, under the auspices of the Local Government Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister allow me for a moment?  Perhaps the word &ldquo;defective&rdquo; was unfortunate because it is applied, I know, to children who are mentally backward.  I know there is a schools' medical service which deals with this.  Surely, on the Minister's own showing, if 90 per cent. of these children have been reared in circumstances of poverty so extreme that they have been taken from their parents and if 5 per cent. of them have been very bad at their school attendance, then the school in <Col N="553" /> which all these children are together offers a problem of a different character from the ordinary national school.  A class of these children could not be compared with an ordinary class in a national school, for example. Perhaps the word &ldquo;defective&rdquo; is not quite satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand they are on a somewhat different basis.  If the suggestion were made that they require medical care, the first question that arises is the difficulty of having medical examination of children before they are actually committed.  It seems to create a difficulty.  If they are to be medically examined immediately after committal or while under the custody of the court, that would be a matter for the Department of Justice. The present position, we think, is not unsatisfactory, that they are examined when they arrive at the industrial school and, in accordance with the recommendations of the commission, we have a full-time medical officer, a lady, who visits the schools pretty frequently and takes an interest in serious cases. Moreover, she may get the records from the school medical service which has records.  The Department of Local Government undertook some time ago to let our medical officer know the medical record of children or young people who were being committed so that our medical inspector takes up the work where the school medical service leaves off, and I think that that position is fairly satisfactory.  Each school has its own medical officer who is available in case of illness and so on and who looks after the children generally.  We have this medical inspector visiting the school from time to time, and if more serious cases come under her notice she can take steps either to have them released or to get proper medical treatment for them in any case where there is any difficulty about getting it.  That is so far as the purely medical side is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we come to the other side of the problem child, whether it is a psychological problem or whatever one might call it, the Brothers and Nuns in charge of these schools have a very <Col N="554" /> long experience of handling these children.  Some of them have spent a lifetime at the work, and with the religious background and the amount of attention that is given to their spiritual welfare in these schools and the knowledge that those in charge of the schools have of the children's circumstances, the opportunities they have for meeting the parents of the children during the course of visits to the schools and so on, I cannot feel there is really a need for an expert psychologist or that the problem is at all comparable to what it may be in other countries.</P>
    <P>I feel&mdash;I may be quite wrong&mdash;that the want of religion in other countries is very often responsible for the terrible form this problem takes among them.  The absence of religion makes them feel that some kind of scientific substitute, such as psychological treatment, is going to make up for it.  I have no wish to decry scientific treatment. I think we ought to make all the possible use we can of it and certainly that we ought to investigate the problem, but I do not think we should lightly assume we have quite the same problem here in that regard as they have in other countries.</P>
    <P>Senator Mrs. Concannon made a valuable contribution to the debate.  I think it was very appropriate and will merit the gratitude of those interested in the problem that she was able to show that the growth and development of the industrial schools here have an entirely different background from the somewhat soulless institutions elsewhere, that they were started as charitable institutions in the first instance to meet a public need and they have preserved that character all through.  If they are lacking in other respects, or if we are not giving them sufficient aid, at any rate we have that tremendous advantage in regard to them, that we know that those responsible for them and who are looking after the young people committed to them are full of anxiety, not alone to prepare them to spend a useful life but, as Senator Mrs. Concannon said, to work out their destiny in the best way, not alone in this world but in the <Col N="555" /> next.  May I point out to her that if it is felt that children would benefit by special instruction in domestic subjects, for example, in carpentry, metal work or building construction, arrangements could sometimes be made, at any rate in the large towns, to send them to classes at the vocational or technical schools.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that Senator Campbell is quite sincere but either we approach the problem from entirely opposite points of view&mdash;and if we had a heart to heart chat we might not feel that we had such widely different opinions&mdash;or else I think that one or other of us must be under serious misapprehensions.  The Senator has repeated with great eloquence and emphasis that the recommendations of the commission have not been carried out.  May I point out that only a small number of the recommendations, in any case, certainly less than half, would fall to be dealt with by legislation.  A great number of them would fall to be dealt with, as, for example, the question of medical inspection outside this Bill.  A great deal of the matter under educational recommendations would fall to be dealt with by administrative means and perhaps I am somehow responsible by not emphasising, though I certainly mentioned it in my opening speech, that a great many of the recommendations had been implemented administratively. There were about 47 recommendations and, of these, 13 are in the Bill now before the House.  A further 16 have been carried out administratively by the Department.</P>
    <P>There are two, both referring to this important question of the recognition of teachers of literary subjects, which have been accepted, and the intention is to implement them as soon as emergency conditions terminate.  With regard to ten others, they are still under consideration; five recommendations seem to be a matter for the Department of Justice; one for the Department of Local Government and five raise new questions, as, for example, the matter of mental defectives. A number, only five, have been <Col N="556" /> rejected.  As regards the committal order, I do not know whether there is a great deal in it.  If the position is as Senator Campbell says, that this matter of a stigma is very important, I am not quite sure that either the changing of the name of the schools or the changing of the term &ldquo;committal order&rdquo; to &ldquo;admission order&rdquo; is going to alter the situation very much.  It is a matter we can look into further.</P>
    <P>With regard to teachers, the position is as I have stated.  The Government accepted the recommendation but, owing to the war situation, the matter has been held up and I do not feel that the situation has improved&mdash;I feel it has rather disimproved and is likely to disimprove from that point of view&mdash; so that, much as I would like to be able to say the matter is receiving attention or that there is hope the promise will be carried out in the near future, I have to say that I do not see very much prospect of it.</P>
    <P>Referring to that matter of the stigma, the Senator used the expression that the State were treating these young people as criminals&mdash;as young criminals.  I do not know whether he really meant that or not.  I think that possibly some of the people, such as those who approached the Senator and have approached myself on this matter&mdash;ex-industrial schoolboys&mdash; have an inferiority complex in the matter and that they are terribly afraid.  The Senator mentioned the question of social intercourse.  They are unduly afraid, I think, that if it should come out that they have been in industrial schools, it will injure them.  I cannot say that that is not the position in certain cases, but, as a person of commonsense, I feel it is a matter that could be greatly exaggerated.</P>
    <P>I would be greatly surprised in the City of Dublin, for example, where these institutions are so well known, that it could be alleged, firstly, that because a boy was in an industrial school he was a young criminal, or secondly, that after he left the school, the fact that he had been there could be used against him in such a way as to interfere with his prospects in life. <Col N="557" /> I know that the opinion is strongly held, and the Senator has referred to the injustice of this thing, and the terrible results on the boys concerned&mdash;he referred to them as social outcasts.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Campbell himself would be the first to disagree violently with me if I were to suggest that this 5 per cent., or a proportion of this 5 per cent., who have been charged with petty theft or something else, should be taken apart and branded, if there is a brand all ready, with a stigma ten times more indelible and put into a separate institution.  Surely, if we are going to reform these boys&mdash;they are young in any case&mdash;the best course is to treat them as normal human beings, make them feel that things are normal, that they are not being taken out and given what I might call special penitential treatment.  I think the Senator would disagree very strongly. It is a matter to which we have given a great deal of consideration.  There are administrative difficulties, but these should not stand in the way, and I do not feel that if the matter is gone into closely and carefully, that would be regarded as a solution of the problem, that because boys who have been in industrial schools feel that some stigma is attaching to them, that that can be got rid of.  It will probably still be there, but that it can be got rid of by penalising the other people and making matters more difficult for them, is a solution that would not commend itself to me, at any rate.</P>
    <P>The Senator spoke of an alien rule. Well, the names, of course, are probably relics of an alien rule, but even under institutions that were set up under alien rule there was a good Irish and Christian spirit in accordance with the general feelings of our people.  I think that that is so in connection with the industrial and reformatory school system.</P>
    <P>As regards parents being happy about having their children in the schools, a great many parents, as the figures show, have no objection.  In about 40 per cent. of the cases at least, the parents have given their consent showing that, in their regard at any rate, they have not that feeling about <Col N="558" /> stigma.  I must say that I think dwelling on this subject rather tends to exaggerate the idea that there is some stigma attached.  There may be something in what the Senator said about the publication of these cases, particularly if the names are published.  I think it is not good, but I am told that in the city newspapers the names are not published as a rule.  If that is so, then the situation is fairly good in Dublin. I do not know what it may be in the country.  Complaints have been made to me about the unnecessary publication that is given to these cases. Of course in some of the provincial papers great publicity is given to court cases generally.  However, it is a matter in which, if I had my way, I should certainly like to have as little publicity as possible.  Certainly these cases should not be made the subject of scare headlines and, as far as possible, the names of young people concerned should be kept out of the Press.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to the question of providing employment for these young people when they leave industrial schools.  Everything possible is done by the Orders in charge of the schools to try to provide employment. I have returns here showing what has been achieved in the case of some of the more important boys' schools.  I see that in the last two years employment has been found for numbers of boys as bakers, blacksmiths, carpenters, dairy workers, farm labourers, factory hands, gardeners, hairdressers, mechanics, porters, messengers, painters, plasterers, pages, shoemakers, tailors, weavers, etc.  In other schools we have had in addition to these classes, employment provided for boys as post-office learners, clerical officers (Civil Service), shop assistants, electrical workers, printing workers, cabinet making and poultry workers.  This varied list shows that a huge amount of work is being done to try to prepare boys for employment.  It is not easy to secure employment for them at the present time.  In some trades, machinery is constantly being introduced and unless schools are equipped with the very latest machinery, there is the possibility that when the boy leaves the school he will find that his trade no <Col N="559" /> longer exists.  The Senator knows a great deal about that subject.  It has happened even in the case of boys who had better opportunities because they had their parents, because their fathers were in constant employment and were well able to push them ahead as apprentices to their trade.  Nevertheless, we know that they were left high and dry because of changes in the trade or industry.  We had a number of trades that, before machinery began to make its appearance to the extent it has in recent years, broke the backbone of the problem of finding employment for these young people but some of these trades are now dying out. That is a matter that received the attention of the commission of inquiry.</P>
    <P>We may be able to do something more in the way of improving vocational training&mdash;that is one of the matters that is receiving constant attention&mdash;and possibly do more to help to provide employment.  Employment is only provided, however, through the personal intervention, the personal representation and contact of the managers of these schools.  It is an extraordinary tribute to them that they have been able to place such a large number.</P>
    <P>I think that one of the difficulties that arises in Dublin is that of getting over trades union regulations in providing employment for a large number of these boys.  The Senator, and those associated with him, could certainly contribute very substantially towards the solution of this problem, and towards enabling the managers of the schools to get employment for a large number of their boys in suitable occupations, not in those wretched occupations where they are sometimes treated as slaves.  Perhaps one of the reasons why they have to take up these less desirable occupations is because employment, where the remuneration is more substantial, is closed to them because of trades union regulations.</P>

      <P>At the present moment there is not, but when times improve, I think the trades unions, seeing that most of these boys must come from households where the fathers were themselves trade unionists, might realise that the old spirit to which Senator Mrs. Concannon referred, should be still alive amongst us.  Here is a very practical way in which we could see that it is alive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, more could certainly be done if we could get more co-operation for the managers of the schools upon whom this whole responsibility is thrown, first of trying to find employment and then of trying to keep in touch with the boy or girl for some years after leaving school to find out how he or she is going on.  If we could get the same assistance from the unions as we are getting from the religious and social organisations at present, who are taking a very keen interest in this matter and who, I understand, are going to have a nationwide organisation to help to look after these young people, considerable progress could be made in this matter. When these young boys and girls take up employment they frequently go to places where they have no friends and they may meet with difficulties. Societies here in Dublin have kindly undertaken to help to look after them and to assist the managers of the schools upon whom, of course, a special responsibility rests to do what they can with regard to these children. Nevertheless, these organisations being organised throughout the country and having a very admirable personnel, can do very much to assist.  They look after the social side, and no doubt they try also to help to find employment, but the unions&mdash;I submit again, while not emphasising the matter unduly&mdash; can certainly do a great deal also.  If an important man in the movement like the Senator would meet the heads or the managers of these schools from time to time, I am sure he would be able to do a great deal to assist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think these are the chief points <Col N="561" /> raised in the debate.  Senator Cummins referred to the unsuitable buildings, presumably at the boys' reformatory. This was housed until recently at Glencree.  The buildings were not suitable for a large number and they were difficult to maintain.  The reformatory has been transferred to Daingean, County Offaly, to more suitable buildings.  It was formerly an ecclesiastical college.  These buildings are never likely to be condemned as unsuitable for a reformatory.  There was a portion unsuitable but that was demolished some time ago.</P>
    <P>As regards contributions, the State capitation is 10/- and the local authorities capitation varies from 5/- to 8/-. A number of county councils pay 8/- that is to say the total capitation grants received through managers of the reformatories are from 15/- to 18/-. In the case of industrial schools the State pay 7/6 for children over six and 5/- for the children under that, and for children not over it varies from 4/- to 6/-, making an average of 4/10, so that the total capitation received for the industrial schools would be from 11/6 to 13/- a week.</P>

    <Title>Inquiry Into Air Raid Warden Service&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <Col N="562" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a select committee, consisting of seven Senators to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, with power to send for persons, papers and records, be set up to inquire into the position of the air raid warden service in Dublin, and to report on what steps, if any, should be taken to allay the dissatisfaction which exists among members of the service;</P>
      <P>That the quorum of the Select Committee be four.</P>
      <P>When I raised the question of A.R.P. services on the adjournment of this House some months ago I stated that, in my opinion, the A.R.P. services were just as vital to the State and to its well-being and independence as the Army, Local Security Force, or other important services, but that I felt that the people&mdash;and, to some extent, the Government&mdash;did not fully recognise this fact.  Since then there has been considerably more publicity and more recognition of the actual value of these services to us.  Also, since then it has become much more evident that in this war which is raging in Europe the civilian population is too often in the front line.  It seems to me that it is just as vital that the morale of the civilian population should be maintained as it is that the morale of the Army or other forces should be maintained, should we have the misfortune to find ourselves at war.  This would be impossible without an efficient air raid warden service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it seems to me to be essential that the warden services in the cities should be placed and maintained on the highest possible level of efficiency.  You cannot do this if there is a certain amount of justifiable dissatisfaction or discontent.  Personally, I have met most of the area wardens in Dublin and I know personally a considerable number of the wardens who do not hold as high a rank.  I feel certain that the Parliamentary Secretary, at any rate, will agree with me when I say that we have been fortunate in that we have got together <Col N="563" /> a number of efficient, energetic and patriotic men who have given a great deal of time and service during the last 12 or 18 months.</P>
    <P>As to whether a committee of the Seanad, as stated in my motion, is or is not the best method of dealing with the matter I have a somewhat open mind.  When I handed the motion in, it seemed to me that that was the best way but I put that forward as one method or suggestion which need not be pressed if that is not the general view.  What I do hold is that, as soon as possible, all causes of dissatisfaction should be examined and rectified, and that there should be no delay about it.  I propose to place before the House a number of matters which are the kind I would place before that committee if it were appointed, or which will have to be dealt with in some other manner. First of all, I will deal with some of the matters which are very important.</P>
    <P>I find that there is a good deal of, shall I say, disappointment, if not dissatisfaction, at the delay in the issue of full equipment.  At a meeting of the area wardens of the City of Dublin on December 12th, 1940, attended by the Parliamentary Secretary, an assurance was given that helmets, identify cards, badges and armlets had been provided and that a complete issue could be made almost immediately.  I have seen most of the area wardens of the City of Dublin and I am informed that this has not been fully carried out.  For instance, in one area the warden asked for 180 identity cards quite recently and could only be supplied there and then with 100.  That is a minor point, but surely we ought to have by now an adequate supply of identity cards.  I feel that there was a blunder, that the cards must have been there.  Badges and armlets have been generally supplied, but on making inquiries I find that almost every area is a few short. The number is small, but it is just the kind of thing which, if I were an area warden, would make me feel extremely aggravated.  To have most of the wardens equipped and a few not equipped apparently reflects on the area warden where, in actual fact, it is not his fault at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="564" /> In the case of helmets, the position is rather more serious.  It varies, as far as my information goes, in different areas.  The majority of areas are short and, from the information given to me, I would say that, approximately, 1,000 more helmets are required before all the Dublin area will be adequately equipped.</P>
    <P>This is regarded by the area wardens as a serious matter.  Immediate distribution was promised on December 12th, 1940, and area wardens so informed the wardens under them. Helmets can now be bought in Dublin shops for 12/6 each, but this is immaterial, as I am informed that helmets suitable for A.R.P. wardens are actually available in Government stores.  These helmets have, it is stated, &ldquo;P&rdquo; or &ldquo;police&rdquo; or other unsuitable markings on them and, therefore, require painting before use. The Parliamentary Secretary agreed that all wardens' helmets should be painted black with a 2½ in. white &ldquo;W.&rdquo; Area wardens obtained an estimate for the painting of helmets at a cost of 3d. each, but sanction for this expenditure was refused.</P>
    <P>Whether it was the inability to find or approve of 3d., or whatever the reason was, I really do not know, but the fact is that a very large number of wardens are still without helmets. In one area the number of wardens on strength is 546, while the number of helmets issued is only 357.  That means that, in the event of an air raid, 189 wardens in that area might have to go on duty without helmets or might have to remain inactive during a raid.  A similar position, in a greater or lesser degree, will be found in all the areas, according to my information, or at any rate in most of the areas.  In connection with helmets there is one matter to which my attention has been drawn and which I should like to raise now, although it is only indirectly concerned with the question of the warden service, and that is this.  It seems to me that the Department concerned ought to offer a helmet to all the clergy in Dublin who may require it.  If we had a serious position here the clergy would have to go out in a time of danger and, <Col N="565" /> although they are not directly concerned, as I say, with this matter, I think some steps should be taken to provide them with helmets.  I am told that none of the clergy have been provided with helmets.  However, that is only an aside and is not strictly concerned with the subject of my motion.</P>
    <P>In the case of boots which, rightly or wrongly, it was decided to distribute to A.R.P. wardens, I have been informed that none of the areas have been supplied with sufficient boots, and I am further informed that this deficiency has been seriously aggravated by the fact that the sizes of the boots supplied to the various areas did not correspond to the specific requirements which were sent in beforehand by the areas.  Some of the areas have boots on hand which will not fit the wardens, and it is stated that the Department refused to take these boots back and change them for boots of suitable sizes.  That has been stated to me, but it seems incredible.  In one area, I was informed definitely, 200 wardens have not yet received boots. I do not know the position in other areas and I do not claim to have consulted all the areas concerned, but I have been in touch with most of them and I find that in most cases they are short of boots.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to call attention.  It was decided some time ago that one stirrup pump should be provided for each warden post.  Most of the warden posts have got stirrup pumps, but not all, and as far as I can ascertain there should be no difficulty whatever in supplying stirrup pumps to all of them. Something, evidently, has gone wrong and you have the rather ridiculous position of having most warden posts supplied with these pumps and others without them.</P>
    <P>Then there are several areas in which there are sectors which have no accommodation for wardens' posts.  The Parliamentary Secretary promised that these sectors would be inspected and that an effort would be made to provide accommodation if it was considered that such posts were necessary.  The area wardens responsible believe accommodation in these <Col N="566" /> sectors to be really important, and they are naturally puzzled and cannot understand the delay.  Except in the sectors to which I have referred where there is a lack of accommodation&mdash;and that is only a comparatively small number&mdash;accommodation for wardens' posts is available, and in most areas this has been provided by the goodwill of private individuals or firms who have given this accommodation for wardens' posts free of charge.  In most cases this includes free light and furniture, and in some cases, but by no means in the majority of cases, it also includes free heat.</P>
    <P>A problem facing area wardens is to see that wardens' posts will be ready to be manned at a few hours' notice, or even at a few minutes' notice in the case of a sudden emergency.  Therefore, the question of the provision of heat, light and minimum furniture, where these have not been given free of charge, was raised with the Parliamentary Secretary and he was asked if the Department would equip such posts and to what extent they would be equipped.  According to my information, his answer was, yes, but that the extent to which such equipment would be furnished&mdash;quite naturally, in my opinion&mdash;would have to be settled after the inspection of the posts, and so on; but that, generally, chairs, tables, light and heat should be provided.  Until an emergency occurs, wardens' posts will only be required for training purposes, and the total expenditure for light and heat could not possibly be heavy unless we were subject to periodic air raids.  The area wardens to whom I have spoken are most desirous that the areas under their charge should be most efficient and should be ready for any emergency. It seems to me that it is important that at the earliest possible date there should be a definite, authoritative statement as to the extent to which expenditure will be sanctioned for the provision of heat, light, and so on, where they have not been provided already.</P>
    <P>I am informed, for instance, that a transformer station in one area in Dublin is being used as a wardens' post.  The wardens in the area themselves <Col N="567" /> provided electric wiring and fixtures, but in order to complete the position and provide heat and light a further £5 was required&mdash;I think it was an Electricity Supply Board estimate. Sanction for that was refused.  It may be that that was too much, but it seems to me that in a serious matter like this a wardens' post should not be left unheated because an Electricity Supply Board estimate may be considered too high.  I am not suggesting that it is, because I do not know the facts, but I do know that sanction for that payment was refused.  In the Group Headquarters in Buckingham Street sanction was refused for £2 3s. &mdash;which I know was an Electricity Supply Board estimate&mdash;to provide heating.</P>
    <P>Now, there is another matter.  I am told that ever since 1939 the question of putting up notices in the streets&mdash; such as will be familiar to some of us in cities all over England and Scotland &mdash;indicating to the public where wardens' posts are, has been under discussion. A few do exist here, but they were provided at private expense.  The area wardens whom I have consulted think that the time has come when these notices should be all over the city.  I am told that the Parliamentary Secretary agrees with that view, but somehow or another, whatever has been happening, they simply are not there, as we know.  Another matter is the question of a uniform.  It was decided to supply suitable clothing or uniform for A.R.P. wardens, and a meeting was held on 9th January, 1941, at which the Parliamentary Secretary was present together with the Chief Warden for Dublin, Mr. Laurie.  There were also present three officials from the General Post Office Stores Department and the nine Dublin area wardens.  The question of a suitable uniform was fully discussed and it was decided unanimously that a two-piece uniform would be the most suitable. After this meeting the area wardens very naturally and, I think, properly, informed the wardens under them of this decision.  Not only that, but forms were provided and sent out to all the wardens of the city and they were <Col N="568" /> obliged to send in measurements immediately for this two-piece uniform in order that there should be as little delay as possible in providing the uniform and having the correct sizes. According to the information given to me, if it is correct, without any further consultation with the wardens, the uniform approved by them and which they had informed the wardens in the city was to be issued, has been rejected and some kind of one-piece boiler suit is to be substituted.</P>
    <P>I need not go into the particular advantages of a two-piece suit, though it is more economical because if one piece gets damaged there is only one to replace; it is also very much freer in use and generally has a better appearance.  But my point is that if you call a meeting of responsible men such as the area wardens, who have a very large number of men under them, and you agree on a type of uniform and put them in the position of informing the men who are working under them that that uniform is going to be provided, and then cancel it, whatever the reason may be, without a meeting and proper explanation given, which could be passed on, is just bad management and a ridiculous way of doing things.</P>
    <P>Remember this is a voluntary service, with all classes of the community, rich and poor, working together, and working very harmoniously, with a general spirit of good fellowship.  If my information is correct, and I think in this particular case it is, that and the shortage of other supplies, when they were told they could be delivered immediately, places area wardens in a rather unfair position.  Either they must accept the blame themselves or must satisfy their men they are not to blame, which leaves them open to the possible accusation that they are attacking the Government or something of the kind which I am perfectly certain none of them wants to do.  If I am satisfied of one thing it is that Party politics has not at all interfered with the efficiency of the warden service in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I would like to refer.  The Parliamentary Secretary is stated to have agreed to, <Col N="569" /> or at any rate to have himself approved of, certain badges of rank so that if area wardens, group wardens, etc., had to take over complete authority at a bombing incident their badges of rank would be such as could be easily recognised by the Gárda, the Local Security Force or others with whom they might have to deal.  These badges of rank were agreed upon after considerable discussion between the Parliamentary Secretary and the area wardens but, there again, as I am told, without any reference back to the area wardens' council, they have been vetoed and I think some others are going to be substituted.  The marks of rank that were agreed on, I am told, without actual knowledge of this fact beforehand, were very similar, but not identical, to the marks which are used in A.R.P. services in England.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word with regard to message centres.  It was decided, and I have no doubt quite rightly decided&mdash;and nobody questions it&mdash;that in all areas in Dublin the message centre should be open every night from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.  That was decided on January 6th last.  The principle that such message centres, where wardens might have to stay all night, should be heated when they were manned was accepted, but some area wardens state they have not had the cost of fuel refunded.  I am told in one message centre they had to go without fuel for 28 days.  They closed down for three days and then the fuel arrived.  There is something wrong there.  It can be remedied, I am perfectly certain, but it is a legitimate ground for dissatisfaction.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which perhaps may be regarded as more debatable though I think I ought to mention it.  The wardens who man these message centres come from all classes. Quite a number of them are working-class men, some of them unemployed. The Parliamentary Secretary was asked and, it is understood, gave his personal approval at any rate to the idea, that each area might receive a maximum of 3/- per night to provide a cup of tea and a sandwich for wardens working at message centres before going out into the cold in the early morning.  I am told on an average <Col N="570" /> there would be about six in a centre so the 6d. each does not seem very extravagant.</P>
    <P>In a letter dated February 18th, sanction for this expenditure was refused although the message centres are still to be manned.  Well-to-do wardens, of whom there are quite a number in certain districts, could quite easily bring a flask of tea and sandwiches, but it is impracticable for some working-class men and certainly for unemployed men who have very little money indeed to live on.  Ordinary wardens &mdash;I am not referring to the area wardens&mdash;that I have spoken to about this have said they disliked bringing the food with them or do not want to do it because they want to be on an equality and they do not want any distinctions drawn between them.  The area wardens could doubtless appeal for funds for this purpose, but they feel &mdash;and I entirely agree with them&mdash;that the A.R.P. warden service is voluntary public service and should not have to appeal for charity.</P>

      <P>Senator McEllin and I can look up the dictionary when we go outside.  I think we would probably find there is not much difference between us.  I am told, but I am not quite sure of this, that civil servants who have volunteered for fire-watching in Government buildings&mdash;that is another volunteer service&mdash;will get 3/- a night each for that particular work. The request for 3/- per night for refreshments for all wardens in a message centre seems to me a reasonable request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter which I do think requires to be rectified and rectified speedily.  There is very considerable dissatisfaction at the unaccountable&mdash;&ldquo;unaccountable&rdquo; is my word&mdash;delay in refunding wardens for expenditure incurred by them for purposes which have been approved by the Parliamentary Secretary.  On the Parliamentary Secretary's instructions, all officers of the A.R.P. warden service kept a very close tally of money expended on A.R.P. such as phone calls, postage stamps, fares, etc., <Col N="571" /> during the month of November and submitted a list of these expenses to the Defence Department, in order that they could have some figures on which to work.  The November accounts have not yet been paid.  Neither have the December, nor the January, nor the February accounts.  Admittedly, each area received £5 imprest, but in most areas I am told the amount which was owing swallowed up the whole of the imprest at once.  They now find it difficult, despite repeated requests, to obtain reimbursement of the imprest amount.  The amounts owing in the different areas are not, from the public point of view, large. I am told they vary from £12 to about £26 or £27, but for an individual in a volunteer service to have that out of his pocket even for a short time seems to me unreasonable.  The amount that the wardens are paying out in their area, that is an area which may have up to 700 wardens, is only £2 a week and they think, and I think, that is not excessive.  The area wardens expressed to me the view: &ldquo;We do not mind how much time it takes&rdquo;&mdash; and I can say definitely that that is so, they do not mind how much time they give to work for the service, but they do not think it is up to them to finance it as well.  It seems to me that it is only right that all moneys due to area wardens up to January 31st last should be paid at once and accounts for February should be paid before the end of March and so on.  That will mean that no individual will be any substantial amount out of pocket.  I think that everyone will agree that no warden or wardens should be out of pocket for expenditure properly incurred by them.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I feel is of considerable importance is the amount of petrol allowances.  One area warden wrote to me as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The warden service is undoubtedly a vital service, yet we have been totally unable to obtain any petrol supplies for the warden service, although Mr. Laurie, the chief warden, has made application for eight gallons per month for the area <Col N="572" /> warden, and six gallons per month for the group wardens.  We have also put forward a scheme whereby a duty car could be available in the city and the area headquarters&mdash;this car to take the area warden and staff to the scene of any incident should it occur.  A car was offered us free of all charge, this car to be licensed and taxed by the members of the warden service&mdash;all that this car would require is ten gallons of petrol approximately per month. Although this scheme was put up and approved by the chief warden, no reply has been received from the Defence Department.  Grave misgiving is caused in the wardens' minds owing to the fact that no petrol is available in the area.  If an incident happened at Ringsend any night, the area warden of No. 7 would have to walk from Sandymount to Ringsend, which would probably take him threequarters of an hour.  A similar state of affairs exists in the other areas.  Yet petrol is supplied in moderate quantities to L.S.F., A.F.S., and other services, but apparently the warden service is not considered of the same importance and nothing is to be done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I find wardens I have consulted have all expressed similar views and they are definitely uneasy.  If you run your minds back a little bit to the bombings in Dublin you will remember that the one thing that impressed us all was the speed with which the wardens were on the spot.  Through no fault of their own it would be practically impossible under present conditions to repeat it.  We all know the difficulties of supplies of petrol, but I still feel that if it is going to be treated seriously there should be no delay at all about making it available for the service in moderate quantities.  Care should be taken that it would not be wasted, and I do not think it would be wasted, but the case for a supply is, I think, unanswerable.  Furthermore, the want of any petrol is making it impossible to have the collective exercises which many people think should take place to a greater extent periodically.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> Another question that has come to my notice has been the distribution of respirators, or gas masks, as they are commonly called.  The Department of Defence complained to the Dublin Corporation about alleged delay in the issue of respirators and the complaint was passed on to each area warden including those who had completed the work as far as possible.  I understand that the position is as follows: Area No. 10 commenced this work ten weeks ago; Area No. 7 commenced a week later.  Both these areas have completed distribution except for institutions and a few stragglers.  Most other areas did not commence distributing respirators until after Christmas and the work was seriously held up owing to bad weather. Because petrol was unobtainable, the delivery of respirators to fitting centres was very erratic and, in several instances, the public had to be turned away because the respirators had not arrived.  A further serious delay of 10 days was caused owing to instructions being issued by the Defence Department to the effect that this work was to be suspended for the three days prior to the registration for evacuation, and during the week of the registration itself.</P>
    <P>The distribution of respirators was completely held up in three areas as there were no small size respirators available.  The Department of Defence purchased respirators in the following proportions:&mdash;Large size, 35 per cent.; medium size, 55 per cent.; small size, 10 per cent.  These were the percentages found suitable in Britain.  Before distribution, wardens in Dublin took a census which showed these proportions to be entirely wrong, but the Department of Defence maintained that the census could not be correct, despite the fact that a little reflection would show that there are more large families of children in Dublin than in any city of the same size in Britain. It is also probable that the Department of Statistics could have given the necessary information.</P>
    <P>There is another matter apart from the general question of supplies on which, personally, I feel rather strongly.  That is the treatment of certain unemployed persons who have <Col N="574" /> been and still are air-raid wardens. Since the wardens' service was established it has been joined by a number of men in all areas who were receiving unemployment assistance and felt that they could give some useful service to the State while seeking ordinary employment.</P>
    <P>All the area wardens I have met speak highly of the assistance given by unemployed persons and there is considerable, and, I think, justifiable, resentment at the treatment many of these persons are now receiving.  They have been told that, if they do not join the Construction Corps and leave the warden service, unemployment assistance will cease and in a number of cases wardens who did not join the corps have actually had payments stopped.  I think the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary was called to this matter, although, strictly speaking, it is not in his Department, and he was sympathetic, but it does not seem he was able to get it stopped.  I regard this as a most serious matter and I have asked a number of area wardens to give me details of unemployed wardens who have had unemployment assistance stopped.</P>
    <P>I propose to submit these details to the Parliamentary Secretary or to whatever Minister is responsible with an appeal that it should be dealt with urgently.  I have one instance, and I am aware that the experience of the man concerned applies to quite a number of cases.  This man joined the warden service, right at the very beginning, in 1939.  He is unemployed, he has an invalid mother and a blind father.  He has been trained in the warden service and was sufficiently good to be made a post warden, and now, because he said he preferred to stay on at the work he was trained in and which he thought of national importance, his unemployment assistance was withdrawn.  I call that a scandal, in plain English.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is more than a scandal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have before me details written out by one of the area wardens who has not, admittedly, been as long in the service, though I may <Col N="575" /> say that the vast majority of those who have been in the service were in since 1939.  The conduct of the unemployed men who are in the service has shown that they are not the type of men who could be said to be dodging looking for work.  The cause of the stopping of their unemployment assistance is well known to be that they will not join the Construction Corps although it is not put in that way.  It is stated that the applicant is &ldquo;not genuinely seeking and unable to obtain suitable employment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This particular man appealed against the decision to stop his assistance and, according to his statement&mdash;and I am informed by the warden concerned that he is a responsible type of man&mdash;when he came before the Court of Referees the chairman said to him: &ldquo;You know you are receiving money from the Government&rdquo;&mdash;I object to that phrase anyway&mdash;&ldquo;and that you are receiving it for nothing and you should surely do something in return for it.&rdquo;  He told the chairman he belonged to the A.R.P. service, and the reply he got was that that was useful, but not good enough, and that he should join the Construction Corps.  He stated that there was no mention that he was not looking for work.  Afterwards, he received notice that his unemployment allowance had ceased.  I do not want to take up the time of the House with other cases, but I propose to give the Parliamentary Secretary the names of a number of others, because this is a matter of very real importance.</P>
      <P>I am not saying a word against the Construction Corps.  I certainly do not want to prevent men joining it, but men, long before there was a word of a Construction Corps, finding themselves want to prevent men joining it, but with time on their hands because they had nothing to do, voluntarily allowed themselves to be trained for public service.  That those men should now be penalised, is a matter about which I find it difficult to find Parliamentary words in which to express my feelings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of small matters which I have noted, but I do not propose to take up the time of the House <Col N="576" /> in discussing them at length.  It has been suggested to me from one source that the shelters should be opened regularly, to see that they are properly aired and have proper equipment.  I am told that that is not being done in some districts.  I also understand that it is the duty of the nearest air warden to have a key and, in the case of danger, to open the shelter immediately. Once that is done it is Division B of the Local Security Force which takes charge.  I think there should be some practice or exercise to see how long that would take and exactly how the co-operation between the two forces would work.</P>
    <P>That is a suggestion that has been made to me and I pass it on for what it is worth.  One of the wardens to whom I have spoken or who has written to me. &mdash;I am not referring to the area wardens&mdash;mentioned the fact that in some areas recruitment had not reached the approved full strength and in some other cases it exceeded it.  In the areas where it exceeded it, the men who were recruited feel that they should not be asked to resign, now that they know their posts, have done their work and have been trained.  Another suggestion was that the chief warden of Dun Laoghaire and perhaps of Dublin have duties sufficiently important to justify their giving full time to the job. There again I have not discussed the matter fully, but I pass the suggestion along as something which should be considered.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to emphasise that I do not believe that any of the things which I have mentioned would by itself be the full cause of the discontent which I have found to exist. I am quite satisfied that that discontent is not confined to area or group wardens, but that it exists to a greater or a lesser degree amongst wardens all over Dublin.  From various letters and suggestions that have reached me, I am satisfied that this discontent is due, not only to the matters to which I refer, but also to the fact that a great many wardens feel that the service has not received the public recognition that it deserves.  As I have already stated, <Col N="577" /> in war as we know it to-day, the civilian population is often in the front line, and in a small State like ours, where defence against air attack cannot possibly be equal to that of large and wealthy countries, the danger to the civilian population would probably be greater than elsewhere, should we have the misfortune to be drawn into the war.  The air raid wardens feel that their work is of first-class national importance and, while I am sure that they do not want individual praise, they do feel that there should be some recognition.  I personally feel certain that the Parliamentary Secretary, the Taoiseach and the Government do recognise the value of the warden services, but I do not think they have succeeded in conveying this view to a public, which is still unfortunately somewhat apathetic.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence, to whom I wish a safe and speedy journey to the other side of the world, made a speech recently on the radio in order to express thanks to persons who had assisted in the registration scheme with a view to possible evacuation in Dublin.  I did not hear the speech, but I am informed by a number of persons who did hear it, that he praised civil servants, teachers and others, mainly people in paid positions in the State service, for the work which they had done in connection with the scheme of registration. Through what seems to me a very unfortunate oversight&mdash;I do not suggest it was intentional for a moment, but it was an unfortunate, almost culpable oversight&mdash;he omitted any reference to the wardens in spite of the fact that it was the wardens who distributed the leaflets to the houses in Dublin.  They got only 12 hours' notice that they had to distribute at once 110,000 leaflets to all the houses in Dublin.  That meant that the wardens had to give up the whole of the following Saturday and Sunday and also had to be on duty, night after night, at registration centres to help in the work there.  I think it rather unfortunate that there was no reference to the very important work which they carried out in connection with the registration scheme.  I <Col N="578" /> do not want to over-emphasise what was an obvious error, but I think the public ought to know, because they do not know up to the present, the amount of work that was done by the warden service.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that I have talked to a large number of wardens. Quite a number of them have come to me and written to me.  I know almost all area wardens, and I have found nothing amongst them but praise for the work done by the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is not my job in the Seanad to &ldquo;butter&rdquo; him up, but I would not be doing my duty if I did not say that this was the view which I found almost everywhere amongst the wardens.  They say that he is most ready to come to their meetings and that he will listen to the points put forward in their discussions in the most amicable way.  I think it is only right I should say that the warden service does not believe that he is in any way to blame for the state of affairs which exists, at any rate in respect of the matters which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>There is, however, a general impression which may be right or wrong&mdash;I cannot, of course, deal fully with it&mdash; that he does not get the assistance from other Departments to which he is entitled and that he is not adequately backed by other members of the Government.  That that was true some time ago we know, because the Minister for Finance told us quite openly that, for a considerable time, he did not approve of the service but that he had changed his mind.  There is no conceivable reason why that should be the position.  However, I am not fully competent to deal with that matter at this stage.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like to refer in conclusion though, perhaps, it is outside the scope of the motion.  I am rather inclined to think that in the Air Raid Precautions Act a mistake was made, and that it would have been far better to have given the Parliamentary Secretary and the Department of Defence complete and absolute control <Col N="579" /> of warden services all over the country.  This is not said by way of criticism of the officials of local authorities who have been doing their best in difficult circumstances but, as I said at the beginning, I consider that the welfare of the civilian population in war time is a matter of the first importance.</P>
    <P>If somebody were to propose that you should have the Department of Defence not in charge of the Army but only partially in charge, as a kind of go-between, you would have a ridiculous state of affairs.  I regard the warden service as somewhat in the same light.  And, while I do not consider that any of the matters I have dealt with should have special attention from the Government as a whole, I do think it would not be waste of time to consider them, seeing that we are dealing with an emergency. Should a crisis develop it will afford very little time, if any at all, for special consideration.  I believe if the Parliamentary Secretary had full control of these matters, and they were removed from the local authorities, it would be far better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I shall begin by dealing with the last note sounded by Senator Douglas.  As a corporation official I am quite satisfied that this system of dual control is the main cause of the difficulty in the administration of the A.R.P. service.  As Senator Douglas has said the cause of all the trouble is not one individual but the joint and several control of two Departments.  The corporation says one thing, the Department of Defence approves, or it may approve, and then the matter goes to the Department of Finance and is turned down.  Meantime <Col N="580" /> the warden service is left to carry on without any leadership and do the best it can in its own area.  I think the statement put before the Seanad by Senator Douglas is a mild statement having regard to the actual facts as far as Dublin City is concerned.  If I, as an air warden, had time to prepare all the facts in order to put my case before the Seanad I would put it, I do not say more effectively, but certainly more forcibly, in regard to some of the matters mentioned by Senator Douglas. I have had personally to bear the burden of these things and like other air wardens put a great deal of time and energy into the work.</P>
      <P>Now, the warden service in this city is in a very different position from any other A.R.P. branch of the Defence services.  It first began by bringing together nine citizens and asking them to train and to organise that service. We did that to the best of our ability and with very little direction from the Ministry or other Departments.  We found that in regard to things that we put forward, and that were sanctioned, we were afterwards badly rapped on the knuckles.  The City Manager appointed nine citizens to try to organise this service among the citizens and to get the co-operation and support of the citizens.  It was a big burden to place on nine individuals. Each air-raid warden has a difficulty in dealing with his personnel and on the whole it is simply marvellous that we succeeded in retaining the services of many of these wardens.  Each individual difficulty may be small but taken collectively they are overwhelming in connection with a voluntary organisation.</P>
      <P>There is a very great difference between supervising these services and supervising the fire-fighting services and the rescue services.  In the fire-fighting services you have the superintendents of the fire brigade chiefs, but as far as the warden services are concerned you had nine individuals trying to get support and co-operation of all other citizens.  It must be remembered that in some cases the citizens are practically hostile and in many cases they give very little effective support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> I wish to stress the fact that I am perfectly satisfied it is the system of dual control embodied in the Act passed by the Oireachtas that is responsible.  If the direction were left to one body, such as the corporation, I think it would be a much better system.  If the Ministry for Defence, through the Parliamentary Secretary, were left to do the work it would be better, but to have two separate authorities with the over-all influence of the Department of Finance is anything but satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to deal in detail with all the points so completely, and may I say, so mildly put forward by Senator Douglas.  I wish to refer to one point the Senator mentioned towards the end of his speech relating to surplus wardens.  When I was appointed a warden I set out to get in to each section as many people as possible. I now find I have to solve the question of the increase in the establishment.  I did not think about having more wardens than would be sanctioned by the Department of Finance.  The first establishment was 108, and we had as many wardens then as we have now.</P>
    <P>We started recruiting and got something in the region of 250.  We were told that our establishment was 108. The rest should get out then, but we did not get out.  Then the establishment was increased from 108 to 208.  We still have more wardens than the establishment figure.  Even if we could get equipment for the authorised establishment it would not be so bad, but everything is doled out in bits and scraps, which makes it exasperating for any person giving his time voluntarily. This is spare time which we could easily devote to something else. It is very hard to distribute in any sort of equitable manner this partial amount of equipment.</P>
    <P>In the Clontarf area we have 30 sectors and, on the instructions of the Parliamentary Secretary himself, a stirrup pump was to be delivered for each sector, or to each post which is the centre of the sector.  We got 20 stirrup pumps to distribute and they are still in headquarters because I could not distribute 20 stirrup-pumps <Col N="582" /> amongst 30 posts and give two-thirds of a pump to each post.  Therefore, the 20 are still lying at headquarters. I do not know why the remaining ten could not be delivered to us.  If we had got them, we could have distributed the whole 30 together in five minutes, but we could not divide 20 amongst them and leave ten posts hankering after them and asking why they did not get a pump.  I do not want to claim that wardens are superior beings or that they are doing anything wonderful. They are giving voluntary service, however, and I cannot see why these things should occur and equipment should be issued in bits and scraps.</P>
    <P>The same thing has arisen in connection with the question of distribution of boots.  We have measurements in for approximately 220 male wardens. That is above the establishment allowed to us of 208 and that includes entirely the lady wardens.  I have that on my conscience and have these people to pull my ears because I have not the measurements of about 30 ladies for uniforms.  All I could do was to get the measurements of people who I expected would have the greater danger and who would be giving greater service in case of actual emergency. Anyone would say that we should not have recruited more than the establishment figure, but we recruited them in our enthusiasm and on the authority of the Parliamentary Secretary himself.  We are not going to tell them now that they have to get out, that the corporation or the State does not want them there.  They are waiting for equipment and the sooner the matter is rectified the better for all of us, and the better for the working of the service and for the citizens as a whole.</P>
    <P>In connection with boots, even if we were allowed the figure of 208 it would not be so bad, but we got only 154 pairs and these were distributed at a time when none of us&mdash;no matter who&mdash;would like to go outside in the snow and frost without something like these rubber boots to keep our feet from getting soaked with mud and slush.  These boots were used at the <Col N="583" /> time of the distribution of respirators and were a Godsend to those who got them.  However, we got 154 pairs for the establishment figure of 208, not taking into account the fact that we had 250 members and approximately 30 lady wardens.  We got short rations in everything.  These figures will leave us short, but they are also the cause of jealousy amongst individuals.  A pair may happen to fit one man and not another, and the latter cannot understand why he does not get a pair. If we could only get our requirements, we would have less bickering in the warden service.  The inequality of the distribution puts an individual in contact with the wardens in a constant state of uneasiness.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas spoke of the equipment for posts and for group headquarters. The bare fact of the matter is that we never got sanction for anything but area headquarters.  Where group headquarters are maintained they are maintained entirely by the wardens themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so; not in the group cases now.  As far as the sectors are concerned, the posts are in residential areas like Clontarf No. 7 or No. 11.  The posts are houses of citizens placed at our disposal on the guarantee by us that we would interfere with them as little as possible until the actual emergency occurs, when everybody's house would be at our command.  That is operated up to the present, but, in a few cases where we had to get outhouses and other sheds as posts, we could not get sanction for any system of heating or lighting.  We might say that, in the old days, they subscribed for their own rifles and uniform, but those days are gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I do not claim anything extra for wardens over some of the other voluntary defence forces who have been subscribing, actually in Killester, which is A Group in my area, the wardens have had to subscribe for heat and light, and the light <Col N="584" /> is only a candle or a lamp in their building, which is only a hut lent or handed over to us through the good graces of the Ex-Servicemen's Association. We have got the building there, but there is no heat or light except what the wardens themselves have subscribed to provide.  During the distribution of respirators there, I visited that sector and found men working in candle-light in this small, little house. I asked long ago for electrical connection and the wardens decided also to have a coal fire and that they would provide the coal.</P>
    <P>I believe that it was my area to which Senator Douglas referred, where we had to close down the message centre for two nights through lack of heating.  There was no coal supplied. We tried to buy coal ourselves, but we could not get it.  The authority to which we appealed was the Corporation but we failed to get it there.  Ultimately, I issued an ultimatum and informed the control centre that we were closing down, that we could not ask people to maintain the message centre during the night without heat. We closed the centre for two nights in succession until the coke arrived.  It was coke that we asked for, as coal would be too smoky in those slow-combustion stoves with bad ventilation. After two nights the coke was supplied to us by the corporation.  I do not know why there should be these delays between two authorities.</P>
    <P>I am not going to delay further over the question of refunds of expenses. I do not want to put in any personal case of my own, but I know that every area warden has had to pay out of his own pocket in most cases.  Up to the end of the year we have got that money refunded, but that was only after having received replies that such and such a payment would not be sanctioned and we had explained how the expenditure had been incurred.  As a matter of fact, if the area wardens had not paid for things themselves, there would have been no services.</P>

      <P>About five or six <Col N="585" /> months after the expenditure had been incurred, and after looking for sanction for two or three months, we had got the money back all right, but every area warden is out of pocket.  I think the final straw which went very near to breaking our backs was the refusal of sanction for refreshments.  Refreshments simply mean a cup of tea and a bit of bread and butter for wardens on duty from 10.30 p.m. until 8 a.m. Mind you, these men have gone out and done that duty at night and have had to go off to work straight away the next morning, and I think it is ridiculous that the State would not provide them with some facility for refreshments to enable them to go straight to their work as they have to do.  As a matter of fact, we have provided them, all the time they were there, with tea and bread and butter, and that has been entirely out of, not my pocket, but out of the Deputy Warden's pocket at present.</P>

These are the cold facts, and I think it is absolutely ridiculous to be hedging about giving these men who are on duty a cup of tea or a bit of bread and butter during the night.  I believe that we should be provided with some facilities also for getting the tea and the butter, because these things cannot be got in the shops for a service like this.</P>

    <P>For instance, when my deputy goes to a shop to get these provisions, since they are not for his own household, he finds it very difficult to get tea, and it is very difficult to get butter.  We are told now that it cannot be allowed. Certainly, you do not want one warden bringing in, perhaps, a flagon of whiskey or something of that nature, and another just bringing in a little bit of bread, without butter, because he cannot afford anything else.  It must be remembered that many of these wardens are unemployed men. In connection with any rationing <Col N="586" /> system I think some way should be found to enable wardens on duty to get a cup of tea and a bit of bread and butter.  I do not know what explanation there is for all this confusion, except, perhaps, bungling and confusion between two authorities or two departments, and I shall leave it at that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say, except that I think that Senator O'Donovan entirely understates the position when he says that there are two authorities.  There are, in fact, a great many more than two authorities. It has been emphasised that this air warden service is free service given by citizens in an emergency.  Like many others of that type of service it was thought at first that it would only mean one night a week, but actually it means a great deal more.  For certain periods, such as when they were giving out gas-masks or making arrangements for the evacuation of the children, some of these people were working every night in the week.  Many of them had to do duty for a good part of Saturday and Sunday, as well as the other nights in the week.  Although I am not directly concerned, I have some knowledge of that because my house is used as a post.  There are certainly more than two authorities concerned, and I think that that is a great cause of the difficulty.  The Parliamentary Secretary, who is here present, is known officially, I think, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, but the Minister who speaks on these matters is not the Minister for Defence but the Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures&mdash; now happily removed to America, which may, of course, make a substantial improvement in this service.  Now, apart from these authorities, there is the Dublin Corporation.  So that, in effect, you have the Dublin Corporation working through the City Manager, you have the Minister for Defence, you have the Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures. and you have the Parliamentary Secretary, and over all these there falls constantly, of course, the black shadow of the Minister for Finance.  In effect, then, you have five authorities, and it <Col N="587" /> is difficult for anybody who wants to get anything done to know to which of these authorities he ought to go or which of them he ought to blame.  In that connection, I am inclined to agree with those who say that the Parliamentary Secretary, who is in immediate contact with this matter and who has contacts of a good and sound nature with the people who are doing the work, is not to blame, but I think it would be no harm for him to tell us whether he requires Ministerial sanction for these things and, if so, what Minister it would be better to go to in order to get things done.  I understand that a Parliamentary Secretary is not in the position of a Minister and therefore I presume that any promise he may make is subject to consultation with and sanction by the Minister, but in this case it is not clear what Minister's sanction is required.</P>
      <P>It is said that these wardens work without fee or reward.  A point that was put to me by certain air-raid wardens is this.  If one of them is killed or injured on his way to or coming from his duty, is there any compensation for his dependents?  Some suggestion was made that something could be done on the basis of the Workmen's Compensation Act, but quite clearly, in certain cases, that would be entirely insufficient.  I think it is right that some definite declaration should be made in regard to that particular matter.  A warden is carrying out a national duty just like a policeman or a soldier, and if he is killed or injured in the course of his duty, I think there should be some arrangement with regard to compensation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but, as Senator O'Donovan said, I think it is unfair to <Col N="588" /> ask people, who are giving their time and service free, to insure themselves. As we all know, the type of person whose dependents would most need money will be the type of person who will not be insured.  That is one point. The other point that I should like to make is that the area wardens were told at one time&mdash;I was certainly informed by one of them&mdash;that the posts which they had selected would be subject to military inspection by the Department of Defence, that they would be told where a post could be suitably situated and that it would be put into a suitable state for service.  I was told that myself when I was proceeding to take certain steps in connection with the basement of my house with a view to making it into an air-raid shelter, but nothing of that kind has been done, and I should like to know if it is intended to do that kind of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other point with which I wish to deal is in connection with incendiary bombs.  Eye-shields are required in connection with that service and if they are not worn the work cannot be done and the warden concerned is in danger of being blinded. These shields have not been supplied, and one wonders whether or not they will be supplied.  I think it is a great tribute to us nationally, that the spirit of voluntary service should be so widespread amongst the people and that there should be such an excellent response from the people; but I suggest that there is no analogy between the present circumstances and those that obtained when certain people gave their time and service and bought their rifles and uniforms in other days. The men who are giving these services now are paying their rates and taxes as well as giving their time and service, and I think that the most that a native Parliament or Government should require these people to give is their time and service and that all necessary equipment should be supplied to them.  As I have said, I have no connection with this particular service and I do not think anybody should enter into these absurd arguments about whether the Local Security Force or the A.R.P. is the more important service.  What is important is <Col N="589" /> that we should have these services and that we should have them as highly efficient as possible.  What seems to be happening now between all the authorities is that men who are giving their services freely, who are very enthusiastic, have been given so many difficulties to overcome that they are becoming disheartened.</P>
    <P>On the other point of withdrawing the dole or benefits from unemployed men who are air-raid-wardens, that I think is an example of lack of co-ordination between Departments and I am sure if it is taken up by the Parliamentary Secretary it can be remedied. But it seems quite clear from what one knows about it that an unemployed man who has been a year in the air-raid-warden service, and is a skilled man at that work, is much better left in Dublin to do air raid service than to be put into the Construction Corps to dig trenches on the Curragh or anywhere else.</P>
    <P>It is all to the credit of any unemployed man who has joined that service and who in the miserable circumstances which must surround that type of man has continued and persisted in it.  I can see no justification whatever for asking these people to join a construction crops.  It is really like asking a skilled man who has a skilled job to do to turn round and do an unskilled job. It is contrary to commonsense and contrary to justice, but I feel it is simply one of those examples of the machine working and that when proper steps are taken it will be adjusted.  It is very difficult to adjust these things, and I think we should assure the Parliamentary Secretary that, as far as we are concerned here, anything we can say and do will be devoted to helping him to remedy these difficulties of which, I am sure, he is extremely well aware.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr. Moylan) Seán Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have got off very lightly. Senator O'Donovan said that Senator Douglas had altogether understated the case and Senator Hayes said that Senator O'Donovan also had understated the case.  I thought that other members of the Seanad would <Col N="590" /> continue along this line and that eventually we would have a pyramid of understatement to which it would be impossible to reply.  It is right that every Department of State should have its deeds and its misdeeds discussed in public now and again and that they should be subject to approval or condemnation, and I welcome this debate on the question of A.R.P. and particularly on the wardens' service, particularly again, the manner in which Senator Douglas dealt with it.  If he belonged to another religious persuasion I would say that he was praising me with faint damns, but I do think there is a little bit of damning in what he did say.  The trend of the attack on the A.R.P. position seems to be that, while I am the best of good fellows, the people who work with me in my Department, other State Departments and members of the Government are really the black sheep hiding behind my virgin innocence. Senator Hayes put the point that there were at least half a dozen trenches and lines of barbed wire to overcome before the person who is really responsible can be found.  I am not a Minister.  I would like to be. There are advantages in being a Minister&mdash;and disadvantages, but for the purposes of the functioning of the Air Raid Precautions Act I want it to be quite clear that I am wholly responsible and that there has been an Emergency Power Order which gives me full Ministerial control in regard to A.R.P.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If anything has happened that is wrong and if there is any blame to be attached to anybody then I am blameworthy. I am rather a forthright, definite character, I think.  I have been bred to the illusion, perhaps, that civil servants are people who carry out the orders of the political heads of their departments.  I have never allowed anybody to tell me what I should do, and if any decision has been made at any time then I am wholly and finally responsible for that decision. While I say that I am very thankful to Senator Douglas for the manner in which he has dealt with the matter and for the opportunity that has been given for discussing the question, I do not know that I quite <Col N="591" /> approve of the methods by which this position was reached.  You cannot have inordinate or Army discipline in a civilian organisation, but I do think that we have got this organisation into such a position that there is machinery within the organisation for expressing opinion in regard to any grievances that arise or any difficulties that exist and for rectification of any possible wrong.  I think, from that point of view, there really was no necessity for having such a debate as we have had at the instance of the wardens, whether they were the area wardens or whether they were, as Senator Douglas says, belonging to the rank and file.</P>
    <P>The first thing that Senator Douglas has raised is the question of equipment. The number of service respirators which was necessary for the warden service was 2,644.  The number of respirators issued was 2,466.  Those are service respirators.  The number of civilian duty respirators required was 5,750, and the number issued, 4,994.  I am talking of issues by the Department of Defence.  The number of armlets needed was 4,630 and the number issued was 4,630.  The warden strength is supposed to be 4,500.  The number of badges needed for all services in Dublin was 10,400 and the number issued was 10,400.  The number of pairs of rubber boots necessary was 8,150 and the number issued by the Department of Defence was 8,150 pairs. There is quite a lot of other material issued by the Department of Defence. I think eye-shades were mentioned by Senator Hayes as being necessary. Eye-shades, as well as quantities of protective clothing, sleeves, aprons, gloves, and so on, have not been issued to the wardens for the reason that a good deal of that material is easily damaged and would do better in store as long as we can keep it there.  In regard to helmets, the number of helmets demanded for all services in Dublin was 8,850 and the number issued was 8,320.  About 500 have been retained in store for the purpose of certain assembly work that has to be done with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, somebody said we had a dual monarchy!  Wardens and everybody will understand that while you have in the Department of Defence a magnificent organiser, such as I am, it is not always possible to get the type of man who is his duplicate, and this whole question of building up such an organisation is a very difficult one and has many kinks.  We have not been able to secure all this material without tears.  I cannot very well explain why these things have not been issued immediately.  I have no doubt that we can have a good explanation from the City Hall, if the wardens are anxious to attend their usual meeting to discuss the matter.  As I say, when I heard of the &ldquo;Mutiny on the Bounty,&rdquo; the &ldquo;bounty&rdquo; being in this case the rather insignificant sum of 3/-, it was rather a shock to me, because, immediately before I left Dublin a few weeks ago, everything was calm and everyone was reasonably satisfied, but it came as a bolt from the blue to find that we had terrible trouble in the warden service over a few minor matters.  I do agree that if all these charges were exactly as they appeared when put by Senator Douglas, the cumulative effect would have been very bad on the warden service, but it is not quite as black as it has been painted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been painted black yet.  That is one of the troubles.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to boots, I mentioned the number <Col N="593" /> that had been issued by the Department of Defence.  A great deal of dissatisfaction has been expressed by the wardens because the correct sizes were not given to each particular area.  Some people claimed that they had too many sizes 9 and 10 and other areas claimed that they had not enough 9's and 10's, but too many 7's and 8's.  I think that would be a matter of easy adjustment in this magnificent organisation which Senator O'Donovan and his colleagues have built up, without bringing it into discussion in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Surely 4,000 or 5,000 wardens, when they have so many pairs of boots, could make a general effort to get the sizes re-distributed.  I can talk at length about these particular matters, but I do not propose to do so, because the facts are as I stated, and if there is any difficulty about adjusting the matter, the easiest way to solve the problem is by discussing it inside the wardens' council.  I suggested at a meeting of area wardens that they should look on themselves as a sort of cabinet, or headquarters staff of the wardens, regarding themselves not as concerned merely with their own particular area, but informing themselves of conditions outside their areas, and being helpful to each other all over the city.  If that were done it would be easy to settle this matter.</P>
      <P>Regarding stirrup pumps, that matter was raised also.  There are 571 wardens' posts in Dublin and we have issued 500 pumps.  I think that is the exact number that has been issued so far to the wardens.  I can quite realise that there is a certain amount of jealousy, but, surely that can be got over, and, in the meantime, more pumps can be procured.</P>
      <P>With regard to wardens' posts&mdash;this organisation must be regarded for what it is, a volunteer organisation, and it would lose the real utility it has if it became anything other than a voluntary organisation, because its greatest effect for good seems to me to lie in the fact that it is an expression of that civic spirit which it is most desirable to cultivate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to wardens' posts, if we have to provide, build or rent. 571 posts throughout this city, it will <Col N="594" /> mean a tremendous cost, particularly because, if we do that one thing, we shall have to do others along the same lines.  We have tried to get, as wardens' posts everywhere, rooms in the citizens' houses all over the areas, where possible, and we think that we are not expecting too much of the citizens and householders in Dublin when we ask them to provide for the men who are in the local warden service a room which they can utilise if and when the need arises for its use.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that these things are not in any sense to be regarded as fixed and permanent posts provided definitely by the Government.  We have tried to get them as far as possible from the citizens as their contribution to the whole effort, and, where there is a real necessity for a post, and where it is not possible to provide the post by the ordinary means then the Department of Defence will do that through the action of the corporation. But, sometimes it has seemed to me that some of the wardens would like to run the organisation on a perfectly regimented and de luxe basis.  When I was a very small boy I had a very ordered mind, and I thought it would be a brilliant idea to knock down all the fences and dig up all the hedges along the country roads and put nice stone walls with copings and nice regular concrete pathways in their place.  I was often thankful in after years that no person with such a view of order got the opportunity of carrying out my juvenile ideas.  Some of our wardens would like to have everything spick and span at all times and everything all correct.  We cannot have that and I am afraid it would be bad for the warden service if everything was regimented into that position.  I will admit, in regard to the point made about uniforms, that there is something to be said in favour of the wardens' point of view.  But, again, the wardens should really remember that one of the difficulties about the provision of a uniform was the fact that they found it impossible to make up their own minds about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>We did make up our minds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>They were made up for you.  First of all we had a uniform which was apparently of the type that is used in another country by air-raid wardens.  It was a boiler suit, an ordinary boiler suit.  That was regarded as very good by many of the wardens. Then somebody else got a brain wave that, instead of supplying that particular suit, the Department of Defence should supply a waterproof coat.  We departed from that, however, by deciding that instead of a waterproof coat we would waterproof the overalls. Then somebody said that it would be impossible to waterproof the overalls.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The case is like that of the Circumlocution Office which was so careful that it never did anything.  We had a discussion finally about these uniforms and the wardens made up their minds to have a particular type of uniform.  It is said here that I agreed.  I have taken on myself the job of going along to wardens' meetings for the purpose of keeping as close to the organisation as possible and for the purpose of resolving any difficulties as quickly as possible for the wardens. That does not mean to say that I can convey, at these meetings, an immediate and definite sanction to every proposal but I can offer an opinion, which opinion is generally the one which finds favour.  A certain type of uniform was decided upon.  The military advisers of the Department of Defence raised certain objections to the particular type of uniform issued because they said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This is a civilian organisation and we do not want non-combatants to be mistaken by an enemy for members of the combatant forces.  Therefore, the uniform should be so distinct and different in marking from Army markings that there will be no possibility of mistake.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think, however, that in this matter the wardens' demand is unreasonable. However, a few weeks ago I was ill for some days and had to leave Dublin.  Meanwhile it was decided that in accordance with the views of the Army, the boiler suit would <Col N="596" /> be the best type to issue.  I did not agree with that.  I do think that the two-piece uniform should be provided with markings altogether different from those on the uniform of the Army.  The markings on the uniforms of the combatant forces must of course be distinct from those of other forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>We were quite satisfied with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Something also has to be said in regard to message centres and the provision of food to wardens on duty during particular hours.  When the question of manning these centres first came up, the wardens demanded, as far as I know, an electric fire, a kettle and other equipment.  I was told that if they got these cooking facilities, they would provide food themselves.  It did not seem that they wanted much food&mdash;a cup of tea or something like that.  Afterwards a demand was made for a certain amount of money&mdash;3/-.  It is said that I immediately agreed to the 3/-.  I was present at the meeting as far as I remember when the decision was made by the wardens to ask for the 3/-.  I have a minute of the particular meeting which states that the city manager was to forward proposals in regard to the matter to the Department of Defence.  There were two mistakes made in that matter. One was that the demand for the amount asked did not come from the city manager. The other was that somebody in my office pointed out that this could not be agreed to, as it had too many ramifications and that if we were to consider the question of the provision of food for men in the mess centres, the Department of Justice would be concerned for the provision of food for the members of Local Defence Forces throughout the country.  We could not do one without the other.  It has been stated that certain civil servants are getting 3/- a night as fire watchers in some Government buildings.  That is quite a different thing altogether because these men cannot go home at all.  They are obliged to have their tea at night and their breakfast in the morning in the offices in which they are on duty and they <Col N="597" /> have to go to work in the morning immediately they finish their watch.  A certain allowance is made in these cases, but I do not know how much it is.  In regard to the message centres I think something should be done.</P>
      <P>In regard to the payment of accounts, here is where I am on perfectly safe ground.  In building up the organisation from scratch, as the nine area wardens did in the case of this organisation, the operations at the beginning were altogether divorced from the Department of Defence.  They were carried out on the instructions of the City Manager.  It was only some time after, in September, 1939, that the wardens came along to see me. They put up certain proposals and indicated certain difficulties.  We got on fairly well, but there was a further meeting early in 1940 where complaints were made again about payments.  My memory is that after certain difficulties had been ironed out, the payment of outstanding accounts was made up to the 31st March.  In regard to the payment of these accounts, the wardens were not wholly free from blame because an account cannot be paid until it is rendered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes members of the warden services simply made statements that this money was owing but never sent in the bills.  The main difficulty of payment arises after March 31st.  I set out in every possible fashion to find a way out of the difficulty.  Everyone knows that in connection with the expenditure of any public money there must be accountancy; and there was a very keen edge in connection with these matters because there was the Corporation Finance Department and the State Finance Department to be got over.  However, up to the 31st October, 1940, every item of the air wardens was paid.  It was decided that for the month of November that each area warden should keep a definite account of the money expended so that a comparison of expenditure might be made and that any avoidable expenditure should be eliminated.  In order to avoid the difficulty that had arisen about the payment of such things as heating, lighting, caretaking and cleaning, we decided to put an imprest of <Col N="598" /> £20 in the hands of the Dublin Air Raid Precautions Officer, giving him authority to make immediate refunds to any area warden for expended money on these matters.  We went further, acting on the same principle. In order to cover every item of expenditure, we put into the hands of each area warden an imprest of £5.  This money was meant to cover any expenditure which the area warden was likely to incur in running his organisation. It was intended that each area warden should have £5 always in hands for his running expenses and, in order to secure this position, all he had to do was to submit the accounts of any money expended in order to secure a refund of the £5 imprest or of any amount of it that was expended.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to the November payment, I really wanted to get the November payments from every area, in order to make a comparison of the costs, and to see how the money was being expended.  Money is not easily got and it has all to be accounted for. I got a certain number of accounts from some of the area wardens in December and some in January and repeated applications were made to those who had not sent in their accounts to send them in.  Finally, I got the last of these accounts on February 22nd of this year.</P>
    <P>It will be understood that while I make no criticism of any man without a thorough examination of the position, there was need for examination of the accounts where one area warden had no expenditure and another had £20 expenditure.  I do not suggest, for a moment, that the £20 was not justifiable expenditure, but when one man ran his area for nothing it was well to examine the expenditure of all areas.  I do not absolutely deny that, from December onwards, there was a need for any complaints by the area wardens with regard to money, but I submit, Sir, that only those accounts which had been submitted could have been paid and where there was a need for comparison, as in this case, no account could be paid until all were submitted.</P>
    <P>With regard to petrol we had <Col N="599" /> arranged to secure certain quantities of petrol for wardens up to a particular period.  But the situation with regard to petrol became so acute that the Department of Supplies shut down upon us and refused to give us petrol for any purpose.  We have of course earmarked, or put away, a certain amount of petrol that we will use in an emergency but we have been refused further supplies from the Department of Supplies.  With regard to the suggestion that there was an offer of a car&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Now with regard to the distribution of respirators I think what Senator Douglas said was that there had been a good deal of criticism made by the Department of Defence with regard to their distribution by the wardens.  The distribution of respirators left a good deal to be desired.  The officials of the corporation were responsible for their distribution.  Men were employed to control their distribution and to oversee the work.  We found it necessary to administer a rebuke to the Dublin Corporation for the manner in which their officials had handled the work.  How word of that rebuke was conveyed to the wardens and how the suggestion was made to them that my dissatisfaction with the work of certain city officials was really a complaint in regard to the wardens is something I cannot understand, but I make no apology for the rebuke administered to certain officers employed by the Dublin Corporation and want to emphasise that at no time was any criticism directed by me or my Department to the efforts of the wardens.</P>

    <P>There are certain regulations which have passed through the Dáil and, I assume, through the Seanad, if it was in existence at the time, which controlled the question of U.A. payments, and, for good or ill, we will have to accept the fact that that legislation is in operation.  It is quite conceivable to me that unemployed men in the warden service were affected by that legislation but, again, if area wardens <Col N="600" /> were concerned for unemployed members, not only was I in control of the A.R.P. services but, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the question of unemployment assistance and benefit was my particular concern.  Only one area warden ever made any representations to me in regard to unemployed wardens affected by the U.A. legislation and I think, in all but one case, we were able to put the thing right.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that we were able to evade the legislation, but we were able to make such a case as did straighten out the difficulties.  Very often&mdash;Senators, not being in politics, would not know, of course&mdash;Deputies who take the trouble to examine this question of their constituents who are affected by the legislation are able to put it straight by representation.  If Senator Douglas or the area wardens will put up the case of any particular warden who is so affected, I, in my Pooh-Bah-like position as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, can say to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce: &ldquo;What about this poor devil; what will we do about it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures has been referred to as having been translated to another sphere.  He has been, since my connection with the A.R.P. service, my immediate superior, and he has for many years been my very good friend. Like Senator Douglas, I, too, wish him the best of luck in his journey, but the charge has been made that he neglected in a radio address to praise the wardens.  If I remember rightly, Senator Douglas's co-religionists, when they went to Massachusetts in the 17th century were met by the members of another sect with cries of: &ldquo;Praise the Lord and a hangman's rope.&rdquo;  Praise is a peculiar thing.  I have praised the wardens so often&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and deservedly praised them so often that, if I expressed any further praise of the area wardens, I am afraid they would begin to doubt the fact that I was <Col N="601" /> really in earnest.  However, there is no word of praise too high to give to the wardens.  They have really built up a first-class organisation, and I know that they are wholly in earnest.</P>
      <P>We cannot have perfection.  We cannot get enough money for any service in the country to make it perfect but, after what Senator O'Donovan said in regard to the candle in the shed in Clontarf, people who may possibly read the Seanad Debates in a couple of hundred years' time may have forgotten about Brian Ború, and may believe, as a result of Senator O'Donovan's statement, that Clontarf was in 1940 the Valley Forge of another heroic nation.  I think it is not as bad as that.  I believe we have done as much as is humanly possible with the amount of money we have been able to get.  Again, a question was raised about the difficulty of carrying out exercises.  I have urged the wardens time and again, as I have said in another capacity to the Local Security Force: &ldquo;Parades are useless, but exercises are of tremendous training value.&rdquo;  I have told the wardens that there is a sum of money available for the carrying out of those exercises and the wardens know that.</P>
      <P>I am very thankful that the matter was raised, as I am anxious to keep this warden organisation in being and as successful in working as it has been. The wardens do believe that I am really interested in every concern of theirs and I would like to assure them, through Senator Douglas, that we can adjust most of the difficulties under which they labour.  They will have to remember that I have many difficulties, too; so has the Dublin Corporation; and there is necessity for a little &ldquo;give and take&rdquo; on the part of everybody concerned with the warden services. Again, I would like to express thanks to Senator Douglas for the manner in which he has raised this question, and assure him that I am not unmindful at any point of the wardens' good services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that this matter was brought forward.  I do not think it would be wise for me to follow the Parliamentary Secretary in a critical manner and to dispute, as one <Col N="602" /> might do, and perhaps try to reply logically to some of his statements. One thing that is outstanding in my mind is that the majority of these matters are adjustable.  That is clear: it is equally clear that some things have become lost, stolen or strayed and that we need a sort of war transit insurance in order to be sure that supplies sent out arrive quickly.</P>
      <P>There is another matter on which I do not think he has got the right angle and on which I would like to make myself very clear.  He seemed to be under the impression that a number of area wardens and others had asked me to bring this matter forward in the Seanad.  That is not true: I wish to emphasise that.  The matter came to my notice: I do not mind being called a busybody if necessary.  I realised, from conversations with ordinary wardens whom I met, that a good many matters, some of which I raised before, were not all that they should be.  I then had a conversation with one or two wardens and took action without consulting any single warden in putting down the motion.  After the motion had been put down I received a number of letters mostly not from area wardens in which a good many matters were raised.  I then asked a number of the area wardens to meet me, as I was not at all sure whether I could fully reply on information which came from some various sources, and I asked them a good many questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that a few of the things I mentioned to-day would not have come to my mind had they not been mentioned to me by some of the wardens. On the other hand, the information I obtained was entirely on my own initiative, through my taking this matter up and I am very convinced of its importance. I would like to make that clear. Furthermore, I was not quite sure whether this would be the best way to deal with it but, after a good deal of consultation and considering all aspects of it, I came to the conclusion that there was not really anything which could not usefully be ventilated in public.  While I am quite sure that if I had gone privately to the Parliamentary Secretary and asked him to deal with this simply by having a meeting <Col N="603" /> of wardens he could have made the same speech to the area wardens, it would not have had anything like the same effect or the same usefulness as by being made in public, because this is a large and a very important service.</P>
    <P>Now, there was more than one disappointing thing from my point of view in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement.  There are several matters into which I am not going, such as into the theory of why 8,250 boots were required and 8,150 were issued, except just to say that I was a buyer of boots of the ordinary kinds, and I would say that it is utterly impossible to adjust sizes if you simply have the exact number, and that no matter what you do it is essential to have a somewhat larger stock than those that are immediately required.  In the same way I cannot help feeling that this issuing of the exact number of armlets, even to the margin of error of not one getting lost, may be a very correct method, but it is not what I would regard as good business.  However, I do not consider that these things are very important, but I am particularly interested in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement with regard to petrol.  A certain amount of petrol is now available for deliveries of goods to shops and so on, and I am very glad that it is so, but I do feel that the statement that there can be none at all for the ordinary purposes of A.R.P. in Dublin is most disappointing. I do not think a large quantity would be required, and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will use his influence in every way that he can with the Department of Supplies to see at any rate that enough is available to maintain the exercises which he regards as necessary and which I regard as necessary.  I need not go into further detailed criticism now.</P>
    <P>I was very much interested in the Parliamentary Secretary's knowledge of the history of the particular denomination to which I belong, but it might interest him to know that after three of my co-religionists had been willing to be executed for their Faith in Massachusetts, the persecutors got <Col N="604" /> tired of it and did not execute any more.  There may possibly be some analogy, but I shall leave it at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, in the opinion of the Seanad, a national register of consumers should be prepared forthwith with a view to the immediate rationing of certain essential commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is put down, Sir, because our experience of recent times indicates that essential commodities are becoming scarce and because more and more difficulties are being experienced, particularly by the wage-earning section of the community, in obtaining normal supplies or even smaller than normal supplies of these commodities. The intention of the motion is that whatever is at the disposal of the country and whatever our supplies are they shall be equitably and properly distributed.  I think there will be no difference between any members in this House on that particular matter, that we should have an equitable distribution of what is available to all classes of our citizens, in so far as that can be achieved.  What really is at issue is, what is the best method to obtain that.  In this country we have not had rationing of any commodity except petrol until it was announced, since this motion was put upon the Order Paper, that tea was to be rationed.  I think it would be relevant to set out very briefly what the history of these things is.  The war has been on for 18 months.  Twelve months previously, at Munich, in September, 1938, I think it would be fair to say that notice was served upon all concerned that war was pretty sure to come, and the present Minister for Supplies, who was then Minister for <Col N="605" /> Industry and Commerce, accepted that notice and, speaking on the 30th September, 1938&mdash;that is, nearly a year before the war broke out&mdash;at the opening of a new factory of Templeton Carpets, Ltd., at Abbeylands, Navan, was reported as saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Both I and the officials of my Department have for some weeks past completely neglected our ordinary activities, and, instead of exploring new industrial possibilities, and the necessary legislation, have been hastily devising plans to meet the possible emergency of a European war&mdash;the rationing of petrol, the provision of necessary supplies, and the control of their distribution....  I sincerely hope that the fruit of the work we have been doing for the last month or two will never see the light of day, and will lie in the pigeon-holes of the Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, quite clearly the Minister conveyed the impression, which I think he repeated at various periods afterwards, that as far as he was concerned he had a cut-and-dried plan for meeting emergencies, and of course the obvious and the greatest emergency, on the economic side, was a shortage of materials.  Two years later than that, on the 28th August, 1940, when the war had been on just a year, the Minister was able to state that the supplies position was satisfactory.  He gave an interview to the <i>Irish Press</i> on that date.  He said that with regard to coal the position was reasonably good, and that supplies were still freely available. With regard to tea, he said that present stocks could, if necessary, be made to last for a period of from nine to 12 months without formal rationing.  In other words, the stocks of tea in August, 1940, could have been made to last for a period of 12 months without formal rationing, which is presumably the kind of rationing the Minister now proposes to introduce.  With regard to sugar, he then said that there was 18 months' supply, and that, with economy, our supply of flour was secure for almost 12 months ahead.  With regard to timber, he said that there were large supplies within the country and further supplies being purchased.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" /> Asked how our food supplies would be affected in the event of an effective blockade of Britain&mdash;according to the report in the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash;the Minister said that &ldquo;our existing stocks of imported foods are sufficient to meet our full requirements for a long time to come.&rdquo;&ldquo;There is no need for anxiety on that score,&rdquo; he said.  Now, that did not depend on future supplies or upon the future course of the war. That statement, I should like you to note, depends on the stocks in hand in August, 1940, that we were told were sufficient to last for a long time to come.  Finally, the Minister, who has given so many reassurances on that matter, in reply to the question: &ldquo;Generally speaking, are you satisfied with the position?&rdquo; replied:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think we have been very fortunate in being able to accumulate large reserve stocks of all essential foodstuffs since the war began. Measures taken by the Government to facilitate imports, to stimulate home production, and to control the use of supplies, have all worked successfully.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the position on the 28th August, 1940.  Just before Christmas a sudden change occurred in the Minister's outlook upon petrol, and petrol supplies were practically stopped. Subsequently, it appeared that the flour position was not so satisfactory as he had previously stated, and a circular was sent, I think, to members of both Houses, asking for their co-operation in a grow more wheat campaign.</P>
    <P>Upon that a request was made by the Opposition that the Dáil should meet and the Dáil met on the 16th January of this year.  In the debate on the 16th January in the Dáil the Minister for Supplies again took an optimistic and reassuring view of our supplies, and more particularly of our tea supplies.  He denied, with the vigour with which we associate him&mdash; unfortunately, it is very often a vigour of misstatement&mdash;but he denied with great vigour that there was any difficulty about tea except, I think, that one wholesaler had made a mistake and stopped giving out his tea to retailers. He said, in the course of that debate, that preparations should be based on <Col N="607" /> the worst assumption and that in case of shortage rationing would be adopted, but I think it is reasonable to say that his preparations, in so far as they were preparations at all, were based upon the best assumptions.  He also said in that debate that, before the war, different schemes had been considered and alternative plans prepared and were ready for adoption.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult, in the light of what actually has happened, to know what the plans that were prepared were.  One wonders whether he had any plan, for example, after the position which arose about tea.  What actually happened was that the Minister, on the 16th January, said&mdash;and contradicted everybody on the question&mdash;that there was a satisfactory position with regard to tea.  People living in Dublin knew there was a difficulty in obtaining tea and even before that meeting I had occasion to go to a town in Tipperary and I found that tea was very difficult to obtain there.</P>
    <P>But in spite of that, the Minister persisted in saying that it was plentiful, that there was no difficulty and, I think, that no difficulty was to be anticipated.  Within less than a week, the Taoiseach, the head of the Government, went on the wireless to say that the tea position had changed and now, long after that, nearly two months after that, we arrive at the position when after another month tea will be rationed.  One is tempted to say that what the people require is an accurate statement of the position as the Minister knows it and not reassuring statements which turn out very shortly to be a complete misrepresentation of the actual position.</P>
    <P>Now we are going to have a rationing system taking effect, I think, on the 5th April, a month from to-day, but the position is with regard to tea, that before that rationing system comes into operation, stocks, at the request of the Minister himself, have been laid in by people who are fortunate enough to be able to buy them, that prices have gone up, that there has been a considerable amount of hoarding, that the strong and the vigorous customers &mdash;using the word &ldquo;customer&rdquo; in all its <Col N="608" /> senses&mdash;have been able to get tea, here, there and everywhere, that people who can only buy it in very small quantities, who depend upon a weekly wage, who always buy in small quantities and must buy in small quantities, find themselves in a difficulty and that the weak, the infirm, the kind of person who cannot stand in a queue in different shops, finds himself with very little tea indeed.</P>
    <P>Before the Minister brought in his scheme, which I hope he will be able to explain to us in some detail, the retailers had been obliged to bring in a rationing system so that the prepared plans do not emerge, if they are prepared plans at all, until the situation has gone very far and very considerable harm has been done.  I think it is right to say that the public would cheerfully accept and at any time since the war began, given proper leadership in the matter, would have cheerfully accepted practically any step with regard to essential foodstuffs or essential commodities of any kind which it could be demonstrated to them would effect two purposes: The first purpose would be the preservation of employment and the second the giving of a fair deal to the poorer and the weaker classes.  In the case of the poor, I mean not precisely the destitute or the ill or those who have to receive relief of any kind, but a very substantial class of citizens who have a weekly wage and who are obliged to buy in small quantities, who buy from week to week, not to say from day to day, and who have no means, no matter what the national emergency may be, of laying up stocks.  It seems to me that before the situation gets worse&mdash;and it seems to be clear that instead of getting better it is going to get worse&mdash;with regard to other commodities, the fairest and the most sensible system would be to have a national register of consumers, to issue ration cards, to make clear what was going to be rationed and thus to have a system which could be applied equally not only to tea, but to other commodities as well.</P>
    <P>What other commodities are there? The Minister, although optimistic about the flour position in August, 1940, was not so optimistic about it <Col N="609" /> latter and, given the weather we have been having for the past few weeks, it may very well be that the question of bread will be an important one after the next harvest.  I know it would be a very difficult thing to ration but some attempt should certainly be made.  One of the things that the poor in this city find it almost impossible to buy at the moment in any quantity or the quantity that they require is paraffin oil, and I am told that other articles, such as soap, may be very difficult to obtain, not to mention supplies of certain wearables which are very important.</P>
    <P>The situation by which one is constantly reassured that everything is all right and one suddenly finds a great shortage is one that naturally presses hardest on the smaller person.  For example, in regard to building materials, I think the Minister's statement about timber would hardly be endorsed by anyone connected with the building trade.  The situation about timber, it is alleged, has been let entirely drift until it is now very bad.  I know, for example, with regard to copper tubing there was no difficulty at all about getting supplies until three weeks ago and then suddenly it was found no supplies at all were available.  Surely the policy adopted should not be a policy of reassuring people and then having sudden scarcity, sudden curtailment and difficulties for the retailers.  The retailers should not have placed upon them the burden of doing something which the Government should have taken upon itself to do a long time ago.</P>
    <P>This matter of equitable distribution, whether by rationing or otherwise&mdash;rationing would appear to be the only system&mdash;was raised in the Dáil on the 16th January and then it was pointed out that such a thing was not necessary.  For example, in other countries where ration cards have been issued special arrangements can be made for special cases&mdash;diabetics, for example, and persons suffering from other illnesses.  For example, at the present moment in Dublin, as far as coal sold by the bag is concerned, people who buy in small quantities <Col N="610" /> naturally&mdash;and I presume it is inevitable&mdash;get bad value, but at the present moment the coal being supplied to bellmen is of a type, I have been told, and I have actually seen it in some houses, that is very difficult to burn in the ordinary grate.  Slack is of some use to a person who has a good supply of coal, but slack and very bad coal is of no use at all to the person who has to pay for the sticks he uses to light his fire, who finds that what he is supplied with by the bellmen is something which will not, in fact, light at all.</P>
    <P>We have a very difficult situation and I think the fairest way for us to face it would be to make a national register.  I do not understand, for example, how this present system the Minister has is going to work with regard to people who move from place to place.  A simple example which strikes me is that a number of students will move out of Dublin soon for three or four weeks and will move back again.  Will they be registered with retailers here and in their homes as well, or how will it be arranged?  How would the present system, as far as we can gather it from the advertisements in the newspapers, be arranged?</P>
    <P>Another matter is, for example, quite a number of people in Dublin get tea from the St. Vincent de Paul Society which issues tickets exchangeable at certain retailers' shops.  How is it proposed to help them?  It seems to me that in this last scheme, as adumbrated in the Press, if it is intended to charge 10/- to every tea retailer, hardships will result.  Does it mean, Sir, that every person who sells any quantity of tea in his shop must pay 10/-?  If so, and it appears to be so, a great number of small shopkeepers who sell small quantities of tea, such as ten to 20 pounds in the week in small packets, will suffer by it.  If you walk through Clanbrassil Street, through Lower Clanbrassil Street and down New Street and Patrick Street, along to the quays, you will find a big number of shops, all of them smallish, and mostly selling tea, but not turning over large quantities in the week.</P>
    <P>If everyone is going to be compelled <Col N="611" /> to pay 10/- for a licence for tea, it will interfere very much with their trade, because very few of them are living any more than from hand to mouth, and they will be forced to adopt the device, which has always been adopted, of passing the cost on to the consumer. Since their consumers are people buying in small quantities, the amount passed on is going to increase very greatly the cost of tea per pound.</P>
    <P>I feel, Sir, that the only way in which we can relieve the situation, which is bound to get worse, is by honestly telling the people what the position is.  I do not think it is fair or correct to say, for example, that we are the most effectively blockaded country in the world, and that everybody is blockading us.  That, I think, is entirely contrary to the truth.  We can hear on the wireless from one particular direction that we are in an area blockaded by a ring of steel, but we know that there are other people who are sending us stuff, and who, in a better situation, would send us more, but their situation is not going to improve, apparently, from the point of view of shipping and shipping space, and, therefore, neither is ours.  In that situation, we must have a scheme which will be applicable to a particular article, and which can easily be extended to other articles as occasion arises.</P>
    <P>I do not argue at all about the amount given, because I realise that it will depend on the amount available, but I understand that although the trade figures have not been published, they have been made available, and that we have got nearly as much tea in 1940 as in 1939, although not as much as in 1938.  That being so, it is very difficult to see why we have a shortage now, and why it is the shortage should have come upon us very suddenly, and that no effort should have been made to bring about a rationing scheme until great inconvenience has been caused to the public, and a much greater inconvenience to retailers who themselves, in the first place, adopted a scheme before the Minister came forward with his.  It seems that the Minister has a very strong and rooted <Col N="612" /> objection to an admission that rationing of any particular article is necessary, but that is a position which no responsible person could take, and, at any rate, it is bound to be found out, as it has been in regard to petrol and tea, and probably will be found out later with regard to other articles.</P>
    <P>As I said, Sir, the most equitable distribution for all our people would be a distribution with ration cards, based on a national register, and people will, I think, be prepared to cooperate willingly with any system which would ensure, and have as its object, the preservation of employment and the giving of the best possible deal to the poorer and weaker sections of the community.  Therefore, Sir, I move the motion.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's reading of extracts from my speeches might have conveyed that impression to some of us.  Everyone knows that it was pretence.  The Senator knows that he read only carefully chosen extracts supplied to him by a Press clipping agency which supplies a similar service to members of the Dáil.  If he had read my speeches as carefully as he seemed to suggest, he would have found that I never failed to avail myself of any opportunity when speaking on matters relating to supplies to warn the public that, no matter how satisfactory the position in relation to particular commodities was at a given time, that circumstances would inevitably change and that we could not foretell what the future might hold for us.  The history of the Government's activities in relation to the maintenance of supplies was very imperfectly told by Senator Hayes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> It is quite true that in the late autumn of 1938, developments in Europe were accepted by the Government here as a warning that war was a possibility and the Government acted upon that warning and established in that year an Emergency Supplies Branch in the Department of Industry and Commerce, a branch which was charged with the responsibility of preparing plans against a possible war position.  In accordance with the policy of the Government, as announced in public at the time, that branch endeavoured to ensure that whatever reserve stocks were accumulated were acquired and maintained by the private interests normally engaged in trading in those goods.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, easy for Senators and others, in the light of the knowledge which they now possess as to how events did, in fact, actually work out, to suggest that the Government might have taken more vigorous action in the winter of 1938 and the spring of 1939 and, no doubt, if we had then the precise knowledge which we now possess, as to when exactly the war would start, as to what countries would be involved, as to the course of its development, we might have been more vigorous and more accurate in our planning, but in those years, we were planning against a possible war, and, against that possible war, we took action to accumulate reserve stocks.  That action was not as unsuccessful as has been suggested.</P>
    <P>If we are to have controversies now concerning the Government's activities in those years or criticism of the Government because of its failure to foresee events in the precise order in which they occurred, it is, of course, possible to retaliate by quoting speeches of the critics and showing how their forecast of events so completely misled them as to oppose, at that time, most of the measures the Government was then taking to prepare against a war situation, but that is not going to get us anywhere at present.  I can say, in relation to most of the essential commodities, that this country entered the war period better prepared than many European countries, better prepared in respect of some commodities than even Great <Col N="614" /> Britain, where knowledge as to possible future events might be expected to be more accurate than here.  The fact that we have gone through 18 months of war with no serious consequences developing is, I think, a testimony to the efficiency of the work done by the Emergency Supplies Branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce in the pre-war years.  It is true, of course, that the war was much slower in developing to its maximum intensity than was anticipated at the time, and that for a long period after it commenced, its effects on our economic life were much less than we had anticipated.  That slow development of the war, and that lack of immediate consequences from its outbreak on our people, led the people into a position in which they were rather inclined to expect that these conditions were those to be associated with a European war and that they need not change.  Senator Hayes quite obviously appeared to hold that view, because he quoted some extracts from statements made by me some time ago for the purpose of criticising the Government in consequence of the fact that, at a subsequent period, the conditions then described as existing had changed.  It is, of course, an easy matter to criticise the Government in times like the present when conditions are changing very rapidly, and when the circumstances existing on any one day may be completely reversed in a very short period, and plans have to be made anew, or a new arrangement brought into operation to deal with the new situation.</P>
    <P>It is true that when the Dáil met in January last I stated that there was no shortage of tea.  I did not make that statement merely for the purpose of reassuring the people or promoting a false optimism concerning the position. Before I went to the Dáil I, as a prudent man, took certain precautions. Contact was established with the Government Department in England that controls the allocation of tea supplies to this country, and we were informed by that Department that there was no change in the position relating to our tea supplies under which we were receiving the same periodical allocations as we had been assured <Col N="615" /> would be forthcoming.  That is to say, we were receiving the same quantities of tea as those imported by us in pre-war years.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Senators are not quite familiar with the position under which our arrangements concerning tea imports were made.  In pre-war times the bulk of the tea imported into this country was bought on the London market through London brokers.  It is true that some comparatively small quantities of tea were bought in Amsterdam, and some were imported direct from the countries of origin.  It seemed to us a useful arrangement to make with the responsible authorities in England from where the great bulk of our tea supplies would have to come in any event, that they would undertake to provide our whole requirements while we, on our part, would not compete with them either in the countries of production or for shipping space from those countries.  That arrangement was made, and under that arrangement we were assured that we would receive our normal quantities of tea based on our imports over an agreed period before the war.  That arrangement had continued in operation until January of this year.</P>
    <P>Certain arrears of allocations had accumulated because of difficulties arising in Great Britain.  Through the disorganisation of transport or the destruction of stocks or other causes, allocations which had been made to us did not arrive and certain allocations were in arrear.  Nevertheless, up to the date on which the Dáil met, we had received, and on that date were expecting to continue to receive, as had been arranged with the responsible British authorities, our full normal imports of tea calculated on the datum year.</P>
    <P>I have stated that before I went to the Dáil telephonic communication was established with the Tea Controller in Great Britain and a statement was made by the officer in charge there that the position was unchanged, that our allocations would still be made on the basis of our normal imports.  While some discussion took place concerning the arrears due to us, no assurance was <Col N="616" /> given in respect to them.  Before I went to the Dáil, not merely had I arranged for that check-up with the British tea control authorities, but the officers of my Department had met the Tea Importers' Association, an organisation of tea importers in this country which speaks for some 80 or 85 per cent. of the tea importers.  They had stated their view of the position based upon their knowledge of existing stocks. They expressed their view that these stocks were adequate to maintain normal supplies to all retailers, and expressed the opinion that there was no need to consider the introduction of a rationing scheme.  It was on the basis of the information given to me by the Tea Controller of Great Britain and the Tea Importers' Association of this country that I made the statement, not that our tea position was satisfactory, but that there was no shortage of supplies, that we had been able up to then to give to each retailer, with some occasional temporary lapses, 100 per cent. of his normal sales, and that we hoped to be able to continue to do so in future.</P>
    <P>After the Dáil debate terminated, however, a communication was received from the Tea Controller in Great Britain to the effect that owing to losses consequent upon the sinking of ships and the destruction of stocks in Great Britain, it would not be possible for them to allocate to us for some time to come our full quantities of tea, and that these allocations would be reduced by an unspecified percentage.  It was after that information was received that the decision was made to introduce a rationing scheme, not because there had been any sudden disappearance of stocks within this country, but because it was then known that future supplies to this country were going to be less than normal and that difficulties would arise.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a rationing scheme involves a considerable amount of organisation.  It is true that we might have made plans to have operated a formal rationing scheme from a somewhat earlier date than the beginning of April, if we had been willing to create a new organisation for that purpose and to recruit a staff from outside sources.  It has, however, <Col N="617" /> been the policy of the Government to endeavour, in the interests of economy, to find staffs for new emergency services by the transfer of officers from other Government Departments and consequently it was necessary to arrange for the transfer of an adequate staff to the Department of Supplies before the necessary steps for the inauguration of a formal rationing scheme could be taken.  In the meantime it was desirable to restrict deliveries from wholesalers to retailers to the extent of 25 per cent. That was done.  It is possible that that restriction on supplies may have caused temporary difficulty here and there.  But I would like Senators to know that during the previous war deliveries of tea from wholesalers to retailers were restricted ordinarily to about 60 per cent. of the normal, and occasionally to 40 per cent. of the normal, without a rationing scheme being introduced or considered necessary.</P>
    <P>It is true that during the last war there was rationing of other commodities, including sugar, which facilitated traders in distributing limited supplies of tea.  We could contemplate a diminution of supplies from wholesalers to retailers being sufficient if we could have relied completely upon a measure of co-operation forthcoming from traders and the general public.  We feel, however, that circumstances are such that we could not base our plan upon the assurance that such co-operation would be forthcoming. Therefore an order was made to provide for the rationing of tea and that order is now in force and the formal rationing of tea will begin in the course of a few weeks.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Senator Hayes to advice given to individuals to acquire stocks last summer.  There is nothing that the Government did that has been more frequently misrepresented than the giving of this advice. The idea is conveyed that that advice was given wholly to enable wealthy people to put themselves in a position of security by storing up supplies while such supplies were available.  I ask Senators to remember the circumstances in which that advice was given.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> The Government had reason to believe that an invasion of this country might take place.  They feared that if it did take place large districts might be cut off from the sources of supply of essential goods.  They felt it was necessary, in order to prevent destitution and starvation arising in these districts, that immediate steps should be taken to get in stocks of essential foodstuffs and other commodities. Consequently traders, both wholesale and retail, managers of institutions and householders, were urged to make purchases of reserved stocks.  It was felt that that would be the quickest way to get stocks distributed throughout the country.  It was given also for other purposes.  Flour, sugar and coal were amongst the commodities mentioned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At that time in July last it must be remembered that it was possible for us to import substantial quantities of coal and wheat.  So far as coal was concerned there had been scarcity, but after the occupation of France by the Germans a position arose in which large numbers of boats loaded with coal that we could get were in British ports.  This coal had been destined for France, but could be purchased by us provided we could clear the coal that was in our ports. The coal storage in our ports was limited, and the only way we could secure full advantage of the situation would be by getting the public to purchase so as to enable us to clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same position arose in connection with wheat.  We were purchasing wheat at that time.  The Irish harvest was coming in and it was necessary that wheat in our port stores should be cleared.  The sooner they were cleared the more we could get in.  By asking people to buy stocks at that time we were increasing the storage available for people who could import fresh stocks.  But the situation has changed. <Col N="619" /> We are not asking people to lay in stores of coal or wheat at the present moment.  We are, in fact, preventing them, because it is necessary to keep the existing stocks under strict control and to secure their equitable distribution.</P>
    <P>So far as coal is concerned it is necessary to maintain supplies for industrial concerns that otherwise might have to close down and for that purpose restrictions are placed upon sales to householders.</P>
    <P>There is another purpose served by the restriction and Senator Hayes made reference to it, and that is the need of securing full supplies for those who have to purchase in small quantities from bellmen or hucksters.</P>
    <P>Arrangements had been made, so far as the City of Dublin is concerned, by my Department with the coal importers which will ensure that all bellmen and small coal traders will get their full normal purchases of coal. These arrangements are of such a nature that they ensure that these traders will get due quantities of the best quality coal imported. It is necessary, however, to know that we cannot under present circumstances obtain the quality that we ordinarily purchased.  Since the beginning of the year the British Government instituted a system of export licences.  Previously we obtained coal without restriction from whatever source in Great Britain we desired to obtain supplies, but for reasons of their own the British Government restricted the export of coal to this country to certain places in Great Britain producing coal of a quality we did not previously purchase.</P>
    <P>We are getting only restricted quantities of high-volatile coal and are now being required to take quantities of low-volatile coal as well.  There is nothing we can do about it.  Senators aware of the position in Great Britain will understand that these restrictions have been placed upon us on account of factors in the situation which have resulted in many areas in Great Britain being short of coal.  In many parts of Britain coal is rationed as it is rationed here, despite the fact that their total <Col N="620" /> production of coal is considerably in excess of their home consumption. That restriction of supply is due to causes other than the difficulty of production. On that account, these restrictions have been placed upon us. If we are to get coal at all, we must take the type we can get.  It is a matter of taking that or doing without.</P>
    <P>The arrangements which have been made in relation to bellmen and small traders involve the taking of a fixed percentage of every cargo of coal that comes in and putting it into central dumps from which these small traders will be supplied.  Thus they are ensured that they will get preference in the matter of quantity, and that they will be protected in the matter of quality. Incidentally, we have also arranged that they will be protected in the matter of price, and arrangements now in operation to some extent involve that the ordinary householder is paying a little more for the coal he purchases so that the coal available to the very poor will be sold at a lower price.  These arrangements have been in operation now for a short while.  They are not fully complete, but, so far as I know, they are working satisfactorily, and, while there is some discontent concerning the quality of coal that is provided now, that quality, as I have said, cannot be improved for the present.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, not possible to say what the future may bring.  It may be that the coal situation will ease.  To some extent, the sharp reduction in imports during last month was due to temporary causes: the quantity of coal imported was substantially less than the quantity for which licences had been granted.  Difficulties in the transporting of that coal had arisen.  These difficulties may become easier, in which case the coal ration may be increased. On the other hand, the difficulties may become greater.  On that account, the Government has taken, and is taking, positive steps to extend internal production of alternative fuels.  I may mention also that, some time ago, there was set up under Government auspices a company of a non-profit-making character charged with the responsibility of purchasing coal for reserve <Col N="621" /> purposes.  That quantity of coal which that company was able to purchase for reserve purposes was limited, but it has succeeded in building up in Dublin and elsewhere reserve stocks of coal, small in relation to our total annual requirements, but sufficient to ensure that, in circumstances of extreme emergency, some fuel will nevertheless be available.  That coal will not be released until a very definite emergency situation has arisen.</P>
    <P>Now, let me deal more closely with the motion.  It suggests that a national register of consumers be set up and I gather from Senator Hayes's remarks that he is of opinion that the most effective method of rationing is on the basis of a national register of consumers. Personally, I do not agree with that.  In our present circumstances and in the circumstances that we can foresee, rationing upon that basis will not be the most effective method of controlling the supplies of the limited number of commodities which may be in short supply.  It is necessary to remember that our conditions are fundamentally different to those of Great Britain.  In respect of a wide range of foodstuffs, not merely is no shortage anticipated, but there is more than sufficient to supply all our own requirements.</P>
    <P>Concerning meat, milk, butter, eggs, bacon, vegetables and other foods of that nature, all of which are rationed in Great Britain, we are producing more than we ourselves consume, and in relation to those foods there is no need for rationing.  It is true that the Dublin <i>Evening Herald</i> suggested in its issue of yesterday that the rationing of meat should be undertaken.  I cannot see any reason why we should ration meat&mdash;a commodity which we produce in such abundance.  Of course, there is a temporary difficulty due to the foot-and-mouth disease, but I do not believe that calls for the introduction of a rationing scheme.  In the case of butter, difficulties due to accidental causes have resulted in a temporary shortage.  As Deputies are aware, we produce here far more butter than we consume, but our production is limited to certain months of the year.  It is the ordinary practice <Col N="622" /> to extract from the surplus production of those months and put into cold-store sufficient butter to meet our winter requirements.  That practice was upset last year, by reason of a sharp fall in production, due to the prolonged drought in the autumn.  If that had happened in time of peace, the difficulty would be met by importing the necessary quantity to make good the deficiency, but we found it impossible to import butter under present circumstances.  Consequently, the butter stored for winter needs was less than required.  The Department of Agriculture, which has control of our butter situation, thought it sufficient to deal with that position by limiting supplies to retailers and asking retailers to ration supplies to customers. That system of rationing would not have been adopted if the shortage were likely to be permanent.  Everybody knows that the shortage will end in a few weeks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There will be full normal supplies of butter available again.  In the case of flour, the position at the moment is somewhat similar.  It is an easy matter for us to calculate the quantity of wheat available in the country and to determine how long that wheat will last, on various assumptions as to consumption. It is necessary that we make our available stock of wheat and flour last to the end of September.  There is very little prospect of adding to that stock. On the basis of the highest consumption of flour recorded, that stock will be inadequate to last to the end of September. On the basis of consumption during the last quarter of last year, it will be sufficient, but, for some reason, that consumption was somewhat below normal.  Therefore, we must take measures now to economise in the use of flour between this and September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The diminution in consumption which it is necessary to achieve is not very great&mdash;not more than 10 or 15 per cent.  Probably, if we could succeed in eliminating the wastage of flour and bread throughout the country, we would achieve a sufficient reduction in total consumption to serve our purpose. <Col N="623" /> We have considered the desirability of introducing a rationing scheme, even though the total reduction to be effected in consumption is small, and even though the shortage will continue only until the next harvest.  I say, only until the next harvest: even if, for any reason, the total yield of wheat should prove to be less than is required to cover our needs for a year, it will be possible to acquire and retain for home consumption other cereals which will ensure that flour will be available in sufficient quantities, though there may be an admixture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is much too early to say definitely.  It is necessary to take into account not merely the acreage sown but the climatic conditions between this and September.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Minister has not abandoned the hope of importing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little hope of importing.  I have very little hope of it.  It is possible to think that some of the various arrangements we are trying to make will yield some fruit, but these prospects are not such that we can base our plans upon them at all.  If wheat comes in, naturally, we shall be better off.  We had hoped to get a certain number of thousands of tons of wheat this year.  It had been purchased from last year, and ships had been chartered from last year, but we have already been told that a substantial quantity of that wheat has been lost, and, consequently cannot be expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that we have to spread out our existing stocks until the end of September, and our decision not to introduce a formal rationing scheme for that purpose was made, first, because we believed that it would be impossible to achieve a proper rationing scheme for that purpose, and, secondly, because a formal rationing scheme for bread has many objections, one of the most important of which is that in the case of the poorer classes <Col N="624" /> of the community bread is a much more important item in their diet than it is in the case of well-off people, and we feel that if we were to introduce a flat rate reduction by rationing based on normal consumption, it would mean a real hardship for the poorer sections of the community, whereas it would only mean an inconvenience for the rich.  Consequently, if a situation should arise that we are unable to get the required reduction in consumption by voluntary effort on the part of the public we shall have to devise some means to ensure that normal supplies will still be available for the poorer classes, even though the cut in the case of the people who can buy more food, and a greater variety of food, may be more severe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in other countries they have succeeded in introducing a sort of graduated scheme of rationing whereby the poorer people are enabled to get their proper supply of the necessary foodstuffs, and the richer people get less in regard to certain commodities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that, but I think it is only adopted in countries where they have a general rationing scheme in operation.  I do not think we could have that here, nor do I think that it is required in our circumstances. I think that if we can get the avoidance or elimination of waste and a voluntary reduction in consumption by those who are in a position to purchase alternative foods or a greater variety of foods, and if we have the co-operation of hotel and restaurant proprietors we shall be enabled to have sufficient flour to tide us over that period.  That will also mean that managers of institutions and similar places where stocks of flour are normally maintained, or where emergency stocks may be held, should use these stocks now and restrict their current purchases.  It will involve, perhaps, in the case of hotel and restaurant proprietors, the making of certain orders, because I have appealed to them to restrict the use of bread in their premises without result, and it may be necessary now to compel them to do so.  It will be much wiser for <Col N="625" /> them to do that by voluntary methods because the introduction of compulsion may cause serious inconveniences for them.  However, the position with regard to bread is the most important at the moment.  It is obviously of very great importance and it is necessary to keep the matter under continuous review between this and the end of September in order to see that the best possible use is made of the limited supplies available.</P>
      <P>If we leave flour and butter out of the picture on the ground that the difficulties that exist or are anticipated in relation to either of them are of a temporary nature, there is no item of food of common consumption in respect of which we anticipate that it will be necessary to operate a rationing scheme, other than in the case of tea.  In some countries they have introduced general rationing and I know that a number of people here have been influenced by the experiences of these countries and have urged that we should have a general rationing scheme here.  In these countries, however, general rationing was introduced, not solely for the purpose of securing equitable distribution of supplies that might be short, but also for other purposes, which included the release of manpower from non-essential occupations to the armed forces or for war production, and also the compulsory saving of incomes to assist in financing the war effort.</P>
      <P>Our circumstances are entirely different.  So far as we are concerned, it is our aim to maintain normal supplies and normal civilian employment as long as possible, and to encourage people to buy and consume those commodities of which we have an abundance, those foods which we produce in excess of our requirements, and a number of industrial commodities which are produced from native materials, or of which the materials of manufacture are still available.</P>

      <P>A general registration of the population, or a national register on the lines suggested by Senator Hayes, may be desirable for a number of reasons.  I do not want the House to assume, from my remarks, that a decision not to establish such a register has been taken.  No such decision has been taken.  I know that various other Departments of the Government are considering the advantage which the existence of such a register might be to them in their work.  The only thing I wish to say is that, for the purpose of rationing, so far as we can foresee at present the need for rationing, such a national register is not required.  Of course, we are anxious to avoid the task of having to compile such a register if it can be avoided, because it is a colossal task.  The preparation of a census will give some indication, and only some indication, of what is involved in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not the preparation of the Parliamentary register give some indication?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but again that is merely intended to reflect the position at a particular date, just as the census only gives the position with regard to a particular date or period.  On the other hand, a national register, if it is to be of any value at all for the purpose of a rationing scheme, must be accurate, not in relation to any particular date, but for every date, and the compiling of such a register and <Col N="627" /> keeping it up-to-date will involve very considerable organisation and a substantial staff.  It is not practicable to do that work on any other basis.  The register will be merely a nuisance and a source of disorganisation if it is inaccurate. Its value will depend on its accuracy, and its accuracy will depend on the continuous checking of the information contained in it, and the Government is not prepared to do that unless there is clearly an advantage to be derived from it.  If it is not necessary for rationing, they will not do it, but if the situation should change, as it may, to such an extent that you might have to ration a number of other commodities, such as sugar, butter, and other foodstuffs that at present we have in abundance&mdash;if we have to have a general rationing scheme for such commodities, then we might decide to prepare a national register for that purpose. So long, however, as we are confined to a limited range of commodities &mdash;at the moment, so far as we can see it, there is only one commodity&mdash;that system of rationing is not required.  We believe that not merely is the method of rationing tea which we have adopted a practicable method, but we believe that in our circumstances it will prove superior to the method in operation in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the method? Will the Minister explain the method of rationing tea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It consists of the registration of householders with retailers rather than the distribution of a card with coupons to every individual. The system in operation in Great Britain has many difficulties.  I am satisfied it is by no means perfect, and I think that fact should be stated because there appears to be in the minds of a number of people the idea that the introduction of rationing will automatically guarantee that they will get supplies of the rationed commodity. It is, I think, common knowledge that in Great Britain people hold ration cards for a number of commodities which in fact they cannot get or can only get occasionally.  The sole purpose <Col N="628" /> of rationing, at least the form of rationing we are introducing, is to ensure that while supplies are short there will be as equitable a distribution of them as possible and that nobody will be able to obtain more than the stipulated quantity.  There will, of course, be certain evasions of any regulations that are made but, by a rigid system of inspection and by having penalties sufficiently severe to deter people from taking the risk of evading the regulations, we feel we can make them effective.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes also referred to certain other commodities which are in short supply.  One of these is paraffin oil.  No system of general rationing is applicable in the case of paraffin oil. Where you have a commodity that is not purchased by everyone but only by a limited number of individuals in the community, a rationing scheme based upon the issue of purchase permits to consumers is not practicable unless those consumers can be easily identified, as in the case of motor car owners. We know who the motor car owner is and can easily identify him and issue purchase permits to him, but in the case of consumers of paraffin oil, control of the distribution to ordinary consumers has got to be done through the retailers.  It is necessary that a system of control over retailers should be instituted and that is being prepared. The sole purpose of the control is to ensure that full supplies will be available to those who require it for essential purposes, like owners of agricultural tractors, and that the balance will be as equitably distributed as possible amongst those who require it for other purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have dealt now with the various matters raised and with the subject-matter of the motion.  To sum up, so far as the motion is concerned, we are not proposing to establish a national register of consumers for the purpose of rationing.  I do not want my remarks to be interpreted as meaning we have any objection in principle to the establishment of such a register. It is merely we do not think it is necessary for that purpose at the moment. If it should become necessary, then that will be done.  We are arranging <Col N="629" /> to introduce rationing in relation to such essential commodities as will be permanently in short supply, so far as we can foresee.  Where temporary difficulties arise we are trying to avoid these difficulties by other methods, but if these other methods do not succeed then rationing will have to be resorted to.  We do not think, however, that we should ration any commodity except because it is short and because it is necessary, therefore, to control the sales of it to individuals, but wherever any shortage should appear inevitable in relation to a commodity of common consumption then rationing on some basis will be resorted to.</P>
    <P>The system of rationing coal, to which reference has been made here, is working reasonably satisfactorily. I would not regard it as an ideal system if we had definite information as to how the coal position was likely to develop in future, but so long as the position is uncertain&mdash;there is some possibility of our being able to remove control altogether&mdash;then that system will do.  It is working reasonably satisfactorily but it may be necessary to reinforce it by a system of registering coal traders and imposing upon these coal traders certain legal obligations, default in relation to which will involve penalties for themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <P>Does the Minister say there is hope it will be possible to remove control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely gave one indication on which my hope was based and that is the fact that last month the quantity of coal which was imported was very much below our needs, but was substantially less than the quantity for which export licences had been granted.  That fact indicates that the failure to import the full quantity of coal was not due to any decision on the part of the Mines Department of Great Britain to prevent us getting it. It was due to purely accidental difficulties&mdash;non-availability of ships, etc. The situation may improve.  If the situation does improve&mdash;and there is some reason to expect it will improve with the coming of the summer months &mdash;then we may be able to relax our <Col N="630" /> restrictions on the delivery of coal supplies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several purposes it is hoped to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it apply to everybody, no matter how little tea he sells?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It applies to anybody who desires to register as a retailer of tea.  A person who so desires will be put in a privileged position.  He will be ensured that he will get supplies of tea sufficient to supply the prescribed ration to the customers who are registered with him.  We think it is not unreasonable that he should be asked to meet some part of the expense of providing that system in view of the advantages which he derives.  These advantages may be not so obvious at first, but they will, I think, become obvious in future.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, it is desired to prevent people applying for registration as tea retailers who do not expect to be able to establish their claim to be so regarded.  One of the difficulties in initiating a registration scheme of this kind is that everybody may fill up an application for registration form in the hope that by doing so he will be able to get into this trade of selling a commodity which is in common demand, and selling it on a basis which will ensure he will get supplies from a wholesaler for the purpose of meeting the requirements of his customers.  The imposition of a fee may prevent these purely frivolous applications.  It is necessary, of course, to remember that the fee is not an annual fee; it is a fee which the retailer will pay once and never have to pay again, no matter how long the rationing scheme may operate.  Its primary purpose is to defray part of the cost of instituting the system.  Its secondary purpose is to ensure that the method of control will work a bit better.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that lorries engaged in agricultural operations are not being supplied with petrol.  I am also aware of some tractor owners who have not been supplied with petrol last month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible to deal with individual cases here.  So far as the records of my Department show, all lorry owners have received a ration of petrol for the present month, and all tractor owners have received their prescribed ration of petrol for this month.  We frequently get complaints from people to the effect that they did not receive their ration of petrol, and you find they did not apply or forgot to furnish the necessary cards or particulars, or something of that kind, but in any case where the particulars are furnished to me, if the person is entitled to petrol I will see that the necessary coupons are issued.</P>
