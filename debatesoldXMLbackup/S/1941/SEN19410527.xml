      <P>The Minister for Education has asked me to apologise to the House for his absence.  He has to attend on the Estimates for his Department in the Dáil and could not possibly be here.  The Government and the Minister for Education appreciate the good work done by the teachers in industrial schools and recognise the difficulties under which that work is frequently carried out.  Everyone is agreed upon this and the Government has already accepted the recommendation that these teachers should be treated as well as teachers in national schools.  This reform is estimated to <Col N="1322" /> cost about £40,000 per annum, and the only question at issue was whether it should be introduced in these difficult times or postponed until the present emergency has passed.  The position was very fully discussed and debated in the Dáil and, as a result of representations made to him, the Minister promised to consider the possibility of introducing at once a partial scheme to improve the position of the teachers in question pending the adoption of the complete scheme when the emergency has passed.  It is not yet possible to give particulars of this scheme, but it is proposed to provide a further sum to be devoted to raising the salaries of the teachers to the same level as the salaries of teachers in national schools. I think Senators will agree that the Minister has gone as far as can reasonably be expected in present circumstances to deal with the position, and I hope they will not press the amendment. Accordingly I move that the Seanad do not insist on amendment No. 1 made by it to the Children Bill, 1940, with which the Dáil has disagreed.</P>

      <P>I think that the Seanad should not insist upon this amendment.  Our function is to put up cases and make the best case we can for them and if what we want is not forthcoming we really have no remedy, but when something is done in the direction we want to proceed we ought to be duly grateful and gracious about it.  In this particular instance the matter is not one out of which political capital should be made.  It is simply a question of remedying the position of a small number of teachers who are a very small proportion of the total in the country.  I understand from what the Minister for Education has said and from what Senator Quirke has said here that the intention is to proceed at once with a partial scheme to bring the teachers in these schools up to the level of national teachers.  That, I presume, would imply that they would eventually get the same pension rights that national teachers enjoy.  It is a very sound decision.  What was important was that a beginning should be made this year.  The scheme which has been hinted at will <Col N="1323" /> not only help the teachers, but will also help to relieve the burden upon the managers of these schools, and thus give us a better scheme of industrial education both from the point of view of the children who are the first consideration of all, and from the point of view of the teachers both lay and clerical who have to deal with them.  I agree that this House should not insist on the amendment.  I think the Minister for Education has given us fair consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very definitely the final stage in the passing of this Constitution, and I think it is only right, as there have been certain criticisms and opposition to certain sections of the Constitution, to state that every section and group in this House and probably in the other House is of opinion that, as the law, it should be obeyed and worked to the best possible advantage as long as it remains the law.  No political differences in regard to its passing should make any difference as far as loyalty to the State is concerned.  There was one matter referred to by Senator McEllin on the Second Stage to which I did not reply because, to be candid, I thought he was making what was a Party point and I do not think the public are now interested in Party points.  I certainly am not and I did not want to deal with it but on reading his speech, and hearing some of the comments that have been made on it, it occurred to me, that if unreferred to on the other side <Col N="1324" /> his speech might cause a certain amount of misunderstanding.  The reference was to neutrality.</P>
      <P>There are certain matters on which there have never been any differences as far as I know on any side, and the most obvious of these is partition.  On that I may say everybody is agreed. One other thing on which there was never any disagreement, as far as I am aware from any quarter, is that the only body that could declare war was the Oireachtas or Parliament.  The impression that might be obtained from Senator McEllin's remarks&mdash;that, in fact, was obtained by some people who heard him&mdash;would be that in the early stages there was a difference of opinion on that point.  It seems to me that if there was a difference then and if there was still a difference it would be a very serious matter.  I am certain that there is no difference of opinion and also that there was no difference of opinion then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, of course, reasonably obvious that no Constitution can guarantee neutrality.  It was not possible to guarantee it to Norway or Holland, although their Constitutions were as independent as it was possible to make them.  What a Constitution can provide is that no one other than the properly constituted Parliament can involve the country in a state of war except when a country is wantonly invaded.  Whatever faults there were in the earlier Constitution, there was in it a definite provision stating that the State should not be involved in war, except in the case of actual invasion, without the assent of the Oireachtas.  That provision was of vital importance, for this reason, that that particular Constitution&mdash;we need not go into whether it was desirable or not&mdash;was, in fact, passed by the British Parliament and, consequently, anything stated in it had the effect of an act of renunciation.  Although we did not accept the position, the nations of the world at that time considered that the British Parliament had the right to involve this country in war, and it was, therefore, of extreme importance that the first Constitution should contain that clause and that that renunciation should be agreed to by the <Col N="1325" /> British Parliament.  I am sure if all Parties had been represented they would have been absolutely united on that point.  It would be a bad thing if the impression were to go abroad, in debating the matter from a Party point of view, that there was ever any disagreement on that point.  I am quite satisfied that there was not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This, as Senator Douglas has said, is in a very special sense the Final Stage of the Bill, because in future, if it is to be amended, except in case of a general election, it must be amended by way of referendum. I should like to go on record as thinking that it is not sound that, so soon after it has been introduced, it should be in the position of being unamendable except by referendum. However, that is something which we cannot help now.  There were some statements made in the course of debate which would imply that certain people are against this Constitution and it was compared with its predecessor. I am not against this Constitution and I hope&mdash;I should like to express <Col N="1326" /> the hope publicly now on the Final Stage of the Bill&mdash;that in its amended form, or any other form it may take, it will have the support of the people.  But I am against claims made foolishly and flamboyantly for it.  I do not intend for the moment to go into these but I want to refer to two points.  One is the language point. I did not compare this Constitution with the first Constitution.  I was misunderstood in that.  I merely said what I think is nothing but the simple truth &mdash;that this Constitution proceeds from the other and that but for the first Constitution this Constitution could never have been introduced, would not now have the force of law and would not now be at this stage of discussion in the Second House of an Irish Parliament. I think that when this Constitution is praised it must not be forgotten that but for the courage and the intelligence of the people who signed the Treaty with the British in 1921, and but for the resoluteness of other people who put that Treaty into operation, in spite of opposition of various kinds, there could not now be an Irish Parliament.  I think that Senator Magennis, who in spite of threats of violence, with his eyes open and in the light of a person well able to weigh the evidence, voted for the original Constitution, deserves to be numbered amongst the people to whom a meed of praise in that particular respect is due.</P>
      <P>These amendments include one which provides that a Bill passed in both languages shall be signed in both languages, and that in the event of a difference in the interpretation of the text, the Irish text shall prevail. Senator Fitzgerald took some exception to that, and as I suppose is the habit of all of us, including the best of us, went too far in discussing the capacity of the Irish language in the matter of law-making.  Unfortunately we have not got the text of his speech, but it is not a debating point I want to make.  The Irish language had not been used in law-making and was never used as such until the year 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It therefore naturally has a great <Col N="1327" /> deal of leeway to make up.  It is not true to say that when you pass a law in the English language, you are dealing with terms of certain and clear meaning, and that if you use the Irish language you may be lending yourself to more loose expression and more difficult interpretation.  I think Senator Fitzgerald and all of us know distinguished lawyers in the other House who make a very comfortable living by inducing the courts to take from the law an interpretation which sometimes was not intended by those who drafted the law.  That, I suggest, indicates that the English language or any other language when applied to the law, allows a very great wideness of interpretation.  The Irish versions of these Acts which have been made with great skill, great patience and with considerable research over a period of years, are not only a very valuable piece of work, as the Taoiseach said, from the point of view of the development of the language, but are not infrequently clearer than the English.</P>
    <P>It often happens, Sir, as you will have had some experience, that you know, when a member of the House gets up to speak he will occupy a considerable time, not be out of order, and not raise any great disturbance in the peaceful calm of the legislative chamber.  On such occasions, in the other House, I often, for more than half an hour, examined the Irish text of a Bill without the English text for the purpose of seeing whether the Irish text did convey to me a very clear meaning.  In a great many cases I found that it did. While I am entirely in agreement with those who say that we cannot revive or improve the Irish language by speech-making&mdash;efforts of which we have some examples in this House and many examples elsewhere&mdash;I do think it is an excellent thing to use the Irish language in this particular way. Whether a mere translation should be allowed priority over the original form is another question.  The translation work that has been done is very valuable, and I am glad there has been no neglect of it.  For the person who says that we are making Irish laws which, <Col N="1328" /> therefore, must be interpreted in Irish, I have no sympathy at all.  I have simply pity.  I do not think he understands the position.  On the other hand, it is not right to say that when you make a law in the English language you are making something which is certain and to which only one interpretation can be given, while, when you make a translation of that law into Irish, it is open to a great many interpretations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Constitution itself, it is of interest to note that this amended form of the Constitution is, in fact, a form which gives more power to the Executive than the original form of the Constitution passed in 1922. Perhaps, sir, there are fashions in everything; that besides fashions in ladies' hats there are fashions in Constitutions. The Constitution in 1922, framed when the conditions and the circumstances were different, had a certain number of frills which were then very much in fashion.  Conditions have changed and since then there has been a hardening in the way of giving more and more power to Governments. This Constitution, in spite of the protestations and pious expressions of opinion in certain parts of it, does, in fact, give more power to the Executive as against the individual than its predecessor. Perhaps that is necessary in modern times, but apart from the merits it is no harm that we should know what the precise position is.</P>
    <P>The Constitution contains a number of pious theoretical clauses, a certain number of statements, and it is made clear that these are not to have the force of law.  The others which deal with the liberty of the subject may be altered by ordinary legislation.  That seems to be the effect of recent judicial decisions.  Any legislation giving more power to the Executive against the individual will be deemed to be within the terms of the Constitution.  Of course, as Senator Douglas said, the Constitution cannot guarantee the individual and the nation as against a majority, as against a certain type of citizen.  Our truest guarantee is the outlook our own people preserve in the State.  Our greatest guarantee is the <Col N="1329" /> way in which our own people act in certain contingencies.  Men and women are much more important than the provisions in the Constitution, and there was never a moment in history when that was clearer than the present.  It is an old Irish saying that it is not beautiful bodies but stout hearts that win battles and, as far as we are concerned, all the talk about Constitutions bringing us freedom and solving our problems and all the rest is, perhaps, beautiful but not in accordance with hard facts.  We should, I think, make it clear that our people must obey the law when the law is made and that nobody should do or say anything which would tend to bring the law in this country into disrepute and disrespect.  We should rely more on attitudes of this kind than what is set out in any document.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one or two observations on what Senator Hayes has said, and I hope it will not take long.  I do not know whether he quite realised my point of view with regard to the language position but I still maintain my own view when he says that the Irish text is clearer than the English text.  He can only say that because, having read the English text, he knew what it meant and then looked at the Irish text to see what it meant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. I very frankly agreed with the Taoiseach in that matter.  When the Minister for Defence in the Dáil introduced a Bill or Estimate I sometimes read the Irish version without looking at the English text and I understood what it meant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only assume that you understood it correctly by looking at the English Act from which it was translated to see if it contained the same idea. When Senator Hayes makes the case for an Irish translation I am at one with him.  I want to see that practice go on just as in Latin and in French until you evolve a precise language from which no judge can disagree. From constant use in this way these languages have evolved an exact legal phraseology which is not the case <Col N="1330" /> in Irish.  Therefore, I would agree in having Irish translations the same as at present so that we would reach a time when people could look back and say the form of words in Irish to convey an idea was such-and-such.  My particular objection is taking the Irish text as the legal text because the Irish language has not been used for law-making in the same way as say the Latin or French language.  As time goes on we will have terms in Irish more exactly defined and a phraseology evolved that might be regarded as legal language.  To accept that as the position now would be ridiculous. When we consider the Irish text we must consider the English text at the same time.  I am prepared to take certain things in Irish but here is a case where a thing in one language may mean one thing and in another language may have a different meaning. Where there is a difference of opinion and the matter comes before the courts the court will have to interpret the meaning.  In this case the courts are making the law by precedent or interpretation which is the way in which the laws were made under the old Irish system.  When such a case comes before the court as often happens they may say the meaning is something that the Legislature had not intended.  That would be a case of law made by interpretation and something which was not intended.  It might be something which did not make for the well being of the people in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then the Government comes along and arranges to make another enactment, in the sense of making the law what it was originally intended to be, and not as interpreted by the courts. If the less precise text which is, in fact, an interpretation of the text in English, was by legal interpretation made to mean what it was not meant to be, we could not summon the Dáil and Seanad together in that case, and it is suggested that there would have to be a plebiscite if the law was to be changed. With regard to that plebiscite, the Taoiseach said, and I hope he will prove to be right, that the changing <Col N="1331" /> of the Constitution in this way is not going to be a great hardship, because he says the plebiscite could be held at the same time as a general election.  I hope that is so, because Senator Douglas and Senator Hayes spoke of this as if it were very much of a Final Reading.  I do not like to think of it in that way.  It is a question of <i>terminus ad quem or terminus a quo.</i> I would prefer to regard it as <i>terminus a quo.</i>  If I thought the effect of this law would be that it was going to be imposed on the Irish people as a sort of permanent thing, no matter what mutations time would bring, and if restrictions were imposed on its amendment, that would be disastrous. All Constitutions are based on the moral law.  It is the one basic law.  Constitutions provide for the continuity of government and provide certain adaptations of law regulated in accordance with the universal law, and the peculiar circumstances of a particular country.  In this Constitution we have what is known as the pious parts which are not law.  They are purely theoretical. They are merely pious expressions and aspirations based on the moral law.  I do not think this is the Final Reading or that this is passing in a form which cannot be amended.</P>
    <P>The position before this was&mdash;it is a position to which, I hope, we shall get back&mdash;that you had a Constitution which was so arranged that it could develop by growth.  When experience over a certain number of years showed that a certain change in that basic law, as then enacted, was required for the common good, it was a perfectly simple matter to make that change.  If I were to undertake to sit down and write you a new Constitution, it would have the same handicap that this Constitution has.  The proper method would be, after a period, spent by the Irish people, living in this Irish society, and experiencing the various circumstances which change of time brings about, to be able to change the Constitution from time to time, not making it a thing of rags and tatters but enabling it to grow harmoniously so that, at the end of an unstated number of years, you would have a general form of basic law <Col N="1332" /> which would be such as a long period of experience had shown was suited to and apt to the circumstances of the people of the country.</P>
    <P>After the lapse of a certain number of weeks, we know that any minor change in this large document will require submission to a referendum. That will, ultimately, have to take place.  Whatever Government is in power then, I hope the form it will take will be practically a re-drafting of the whole Constitution for submission to the people.  I hope that the Constitution will contain a clause stating that, over an undetermined number of years, any Article in it can be changed by ordinary law.  There is something which is completely unnatural, something which completely refuses to face up to the circumstances of human life, which are constantly changing, in saying that, after one period or two periods, at a given moment, this is going to be the form of the State.  I want to say that, perhaps unwittingly, Senator Hayes summed up the view of a much more distinguished and authoritative person than himself when he said that all this talk about the enormous significance of constitutions is misleading. A distinguished French writer, at a time when the Taoiseach's friend, the Abbé Sieyés, and others were amusing themselves producing unlimited numbers of constitutions, commented on &ldquo;A Constitution for man.&rdquo; He said:&ldquo;&lsquo;Man,&rsquo; where is he; I never met him.&rdquo;  He knew the Frenchman of that period and the Russian, but this man for whom the Constitution was made he did not know at all.  I wish the Taoiseach had read that very profound thinker on constitutions before he prepared this Constitution.  I am not going to worry myself about that because, like Senator Hayes, I agree with the view of Leo XIII on this matter. You may remember that, towards the end of the nineteenth century, the French Catholic Party had largely taken the line that the Third Republic had no binding power on their conscience because it was only a usurping government.  If anybody takes the trouble to read the letters&mdash;for instance, the letter &ldquo;au milieu des Sollicitudes&rdquo;&mdash; addressed by the <Col N="1333" /> Pope to the French Catholics at that time he will find that he dealt with those who say that this exact form of constitution is right and that that is wrong.  In France, during that period, they had monarchies, republics, the Napoleonic empire, the Bourbons and others and the Pope pointed out that much more important than a Constitution are the specific enactments made by governments from time to time and that one way of securing that these enactments would be good for the people, and properly directed to the common good, was to see that the right people were put in power.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question that this Constitution gives more power to the Executive than did the previous Constitution.  Experience shows that, if a body of men are to be burdened with responsibility, they must be given appropriate power to carry out the responsibility imposed upon them. Therefore, I do not, personally, see any great harm in the fact that this Constitution gives greater power to the Executive than did the previous Constitution. There is always the idea that, somehow or other, you should give a Government responsibility and then reserve all sorts of powers, so that you can blame them, on the one hand, while withholding power from them, on the other hand.  As we have a democratic form of government, no Constitution will save us from unwisdom or venality in the whole people. The people themselves must decide who are the best rulers for them, give them power and make them responsible. Therefore, so far as I am concerned, I propose to let this Constitution pass as it stands.  I could have proposed many amendments which, I think, would, at the moment, be an improvement, but I do not accept this as a Final Reading.  I do hope that, when the Constitution is radically amended, as I hope it will be, it will be left in a fluid state, so that the Legislature, as it experiences the changes which time brings, will be able to modify it, from time to time, and that, only after a long period, when you might say it sets forth the traditional way of life of the people, will it be accepted as in any way a permanent document.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1334" /> I have endeavoured to avoid dealing with anything contentious on this Bill. I do not propose to go into the question whether the previous Constitution had any relation to neutrality or not. As regards neutrality, there are certain wrong ideas and I do not know whether they are innate in this Constitution or not.  It is assumed, somehow, that in this country, because there is, what is technically called, neutrality in relation to a certain matter, therefore, everybody's mind has to become a perfect blank on that matter&mdash;that one's mind is to cease to function or to weigh degrees of good and degrees of evil. That is somehow related to this theory that a Constitution is a supremely important document upon which the whole future of the country depends&mdash; that everything depends on certain words being set forth in a certain enactment.  The truth is that we tend to exaggerate the State.  The State is a specific entity in itself.  If every person in this State were most deeply convinced, in relation to the present war or any other matter, that right was on one side and wrong on the other, that would not interfere with the neutrality of the State.  Here and now, I again say that I recognise as binding, not as a code of action but as binding upon my conscience, any law enacted by the Parliament of the State, according to this Constitution.</P>
    <P>I recognise that that is binding upon me, but I do resent certain suggestions that when the State is, for instance, neutral, my mind must become a blank.  The State can become neutral and every one of us can form his own judgment on certain matters.  That does not in any way imply any kicking against the goad or any refusal to accept the law of the State.  I have been formally in Opposition for quite a number of years, and during that time I have tried to the best of my ability&mdash;in Parliament and out of Parliament&mdash;to impress on the people of this country that, once a law has been enacted&mdash;and it cannot be a law if it is against justice&mdash;no matter who enacts it and no matter how much we may like or dislike it, that law must be obeyed&mdash;not solely because otherwise the police will come after us, but <Col N="1335" /> because it is only by obeying it that we can remain at peace with ourselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe in a strong executive, and have always done so. Furthermore, I am as conscious as Senator Fitzgerald or Senator Hayes that there are fairly narrow limits to what a Constitution can do for the liberty and welfare of the citizens. Nevertheless, it can do something and there is a difference between having a good Constitution and a bad one.  I think well enough of our own Constitution to disapprove still of the step that we are asked to take in this Amending Bill, which consists in putting it in the power of either House of the Oireachtas, acting perhaps on the instructions of a Whip of a single Party, to suspend indefinitely the constitional guarantees after this war or any other war is over.</P>

    <P>It is true that the possession of sound ideas of freedom by the mass of the people is a better guarantee of the preservation of freedom than any Constitution can be; but it is precisely during a period when enormous power is given to the executive, and when very great restrictions are put upon the liberty of the individual, that the ideas held by the masses as to what is proper and what is not are apt to become atrophied.  That is especially the case when there is a very rigid censorship in force.  In the course of last week's debate, one Senator alluded to the fact that no objections had been raised by any responsible body of opinion in this country against the possession and use by the Government of tremendous executive powers.  However, if such objections had been felt, the probability is that they could not have been expressed; as, if they involved any matter that the Government considered of great importance, the censorship would not have allowed the objections to appear in print.  I am not saying that there should have been objections in the past.  I am saying that, perhaps, there might be a very proper objection in the future and, particularly, there might be proper <Col N="1336" /> objection after this war or any war is over.</P>
    <P>Some day, not necessarily in connection with this war and this Parliament, but perhaps some future war and some future Parliament, there may be an improper attempt by a dominant political Party to preserve its own rule beyond the period when the people want it, and to keep the Executive endowed with overwhelming and despotic powers over the life and property, and even the minds, of the individual citizens.  Consequently, I proposed a change in amendment No. 22, which the Government is introducing, but I failed to make my proposal acceptable to the Seanad.  Now I feel obliged to maintain my objection to the amendment as it stands, and to go on record, therefore, as being in opposition to this Bill, seeing that that is by far the most important provision in it.</P>

      <P>I think it was Senator MacDermot who, on an earlier stage of this Bill, pointed out as an interesting commentary on the development of the situation that, of the storms of controversy which howled so dismally around the cradle of the Constitution, there is left hardly an echo.  I recall especially all the fears entertained regarding Article 41 and its supposed threat to women, who would henceforth be confined in their kitchens.  I was told of one woman who could not vote for the Constitution because she could not feel she could deprive herself of the evening walk which was her sole recreation.  Fortunately, all these fears have been set at rest, and if there is any grouse at all about Article 41, it will come from me.</P>
      <P>I object&mdash;and I am glad the Taoiseach is here to listen to the objection&mdash;that no attempt ever was made to implement a pledge made by Article 41, in which it was stated:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1337" /> If those words mean anything, it is that there should be something in the nature of family allowances, and that a woman should not, through the unemployment of her husband, the normal breadwinner, find it necessary to go out to work, or that her family should be unable to exist without the fruits of her labour.  That is implied in that Article and, as far as I know, no attempt has been made to implement it, other than a vague promise to consider family allowances.  I take this opportunity to remind the Taoiseach that the State is pledged to that, and I hope that formal consideration will be given to it.  I welcome the tone of the discussion on this Bill.  We are all united in the belief that the Constitution deserves our loyalty.  We need loyalty to the Constitution&mdash;especially at a time like the present, when the liberty, the democracy, and the sovereignty, of which it is the charter, may be threatened.  We want all Parties to unite, under the Constitution, in being loyal to the country of which it is the fundamental law.</P>

      <P>I heard Senator Hayes waxing indignant over the time lost in another place in listening to long speeches.  Hence, I do not intend to tax the patience of Senators to-day.  I believe, though I may be rather optimistic, that there will be no division on this Bill and, therefore, I presume that there has been just the usual bit of window dressing.  I do not see why I should not follow suit, though whether my mannequins will be as successful as theirs, I do not know.  I will not deal with this or that Article of the Constitution.  I do not think there is anything wrong with this Constitution&mdash;whatever may be wrong with the constitutions of those in the opposite Party.  Probably, this debate will act as a tonic for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an ordinary individual, I resent the deprecatory note which runs through Senator Hayes's speech.  He &ldquo;damns with faint praise,&rdquo; unquestionably. Comparing this Constitution with the previous one, I do not know why every tub should not stand on its own bottom and, if it has no bottom, <Col N="1338" /> let it roll, as they say in Enniscorthy. We are considering the present Constitution, and the amendments thereto. It is not proposed to challenge them, and I do not see why we should indulge in comparisons at all.  We are reminded that but for the first Constitution we would not have had the Second Constitution.  May I add that but for 1916 we would not have had the first Constitution, but for '98, '48 and '67, we would not have had '16, and so on, <i>ad infinitum.</i>  I do not believe that that argument is really worth threshing out to any great extent. I am afraid that a lot of this criticism may be traced in its origin to an old Irish saying which Senator Hayes, I have no doubt, will be able to translate&mdash;&ldquo;Briseann an duthchas tre shúilibh an chait.&rdquo;  In other words, can anything good come out of Israel, especially when Israel happens to exist not collectively, perhaps, but singly, in this House?  I do not think anyone ever intended or ever claimed that the Constitution in this or any other form was to be a cure-all for all the evils that have afflicted Ireland.  I do not think anyone suggested it in that sense at all.  I do not think anyone ever held for one moment that the woes which afflicted us, economic and otherwise, would vanish as by a magician's wand. Even its most ardent advocates never claimed that for it, in my hearing or elsewhere.  It is merely pushing an open door, so to speak, to claim that.</P>
    <P>When it was pointed out that a Constitution could not of itself do everything, that everything depended really on the mental and physical make-up of those who meant to push it through, when that was claimed by Senators on the Benches opposite to me at present, I felt inclined to say, in the memorable words of Dickens: &ldquo;Who's denigin' of it, Betsy?&rdquo;  No one ever claimed it. My hearing is not as good as it used to be, fortunately, especially when people come to me on various matters, but if I understood Senator Fitzgerald aright, I think he alluded to Aristides. Is that correct?</P>

      <P>That only proves that my hearing is just as bad as I thought it was.  However, he alluded to the fact that there were certain notions inherent in the Constitution which were not strictly in accordance with the fact.  I do not know what these notions are.  Personally, I read the Constitution fairly thoroughly and if people seek to read into the Constitution what is not in it, of course, we cannot guarantee a sufficient supply of grey matter to everybody.  Senator Fitzgerald suggested that he could, and he would, if he could, suggest several amendments, and all that sort of thing.  If he really intended to suggest amendments, I do not know why he should not screw up his courage to the sticking point and test the verdict of this House.  He said he did not put them forward because he hoped this would not be a final Constitution. There is no finality about anything.  Finality is a word that cannot be applied to any phase of human affairs and no one ever claimed that this Constitution was a cure-all or that it was final.  In politics, we all know, there is no finality and I think in not putting forward the amendments which he might have, Senator Fitzgerald was merely playing for safety.</P>
      <P>I have risen for the sole purpose of protesting mildly, as befits the wearer of the toga, against the opprobrious implication which runs through the speeches of the Opposition, the implication being that this Constitution is something which is not as good as the previous one, something they could have done very much better and something which needs revision.  Having expounded these views at great length, they sit down casually and do not test the verdict of the Seanad.  Perhaps they are wise in their generation.  I think Senator Fitzgerald said something, incidentally, about the verdict of the people.  It appears to me that on a certain occasion&mdash;of course, I may be far out&mdash;this Constitution was submitted to the verdict of the people. Of course, I may be labouring under a delusion, but, if so, I share it in common with a great many of my fellow-countrymen.</P>

      <P>I wish to endorse <Col N="1340" /> the protest that has been made by Senator MacDermot.  I think it is a most dangerous provision in the Constitution that these emergency powers can be extended indefinitely.  In fact, it is practically in the hands of the Government of the day as to how long these powers may be continued.  I am sorry the Government has not seen fit to introduce an amendment to put some form of constitutional restraint on the undue prolongation of these powers. It cuts at the basis of the whole Constitution in an attempt to defer the return to normal methods of democratic government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should explain to the Seanad that I did consider very carefully the suggestion made by Senator MacDermot in regard to making the Uachtarán a guardian of the Constitution in case there should be any disposition on the part of the Executive of the day to prolong the period of emergency or to prolong the special powers they had during the emergency, beyond the time when the emergency had really passed.  I would like to say this that had that proposition come from the main Opposition in the Dáil and had I thought that there would thereby be a greater amount of general agreement on a very important matter I would certainly have done my utmost to get my colleagues in the Government to accept it and to get <Col N="1343" /> general acceptance of it.  But, it appeared on the last day that in the Seanad, and generally so far as I could see from any views I had been able to find elsewhere, that that proposition would be more strongly opposed perhaps even than by members of our own Party and I felt it was better to leave it as it is.  I should, perhaps, say that in the whole course of the discussion of the Constitution from the theoretical standpoint there has been no person who has been dealing with it with whose views I was able to find myself more closely in agreement than those of Senator MacDermot.  The difference was that he approached it very much more from a theoretical standpoint than I.  Any theoretical views I might have had I put to the test of practicality, how they were going in fact to work out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to this particular matter as to whether on the one hand you would have an Executive which was abusing these powers or on the other hand you would have a President who would be more detached but who would not have the immediate responsibility and might be moved by representations made to him and views put before him to take an action which would, at a critical moment, hold the hands of the Government and prevent them taking action which they felt it their duty to take, and put them in a time of crisis to the very difficult task of having a plebiscite, between these two considerations, though theoretically I will admit it might be better to give some such power to the President, I think that in the long run from the point of view of the safety of the community in general and the principle that responsibility should go with power it was better to leave it as it is and so I finally came down on the side of the fence of leaving it as it is.  So that I did not bring in that amendment and we are leaving it as it is.  With regard to the general matter of the Constitutional points that have been raised, I would like to take upon myself the role of a plain blunt man and leave all the delicate refinements that have been made here.  I <Col N="1344" /> think that the Constitution in the long run is a very practical matter.  From the practical point of view it is the set of rules under which the various Parties in a democratic country agree to work.  It is the set of rules under which we work, the rules under which the game is accepted by everybody to be played.  Once the rules are accepted there is no difficulty, but if you have changes to the set of rules then in the long run you have difficulties.  It is desirable that there should be as little tricking with these rules as possible and that they should be as little run along Party lines as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not know would it seem farfetched if, in dealing with this difference between a Constitution which is easily changed and a Constitution which is not, I were to refer, by way of comparison, to divorce.  There is a difference of approach, but leaving aside the very human side, I think that the fact that a relation can be changed easily is bad, that it is a temptation to try to change, and that if the relations are fixed and determined to the extent to which they are fixed and determined I think it is a good thing.  Apart altogether from fundamental considerations I do think it is desirable that the Constitution should not be very easily changed.  You can have revolutions and a very nasty situation can arise if a Party can be accused of changing the State organisation for its own benefit or to enable itself to get a particular advantage.  I think it is desirable that within reasonable limits it should be fairly fixed.  Of course, it would be absurd to have it cast-iron or absolutely stereotyped because as it has been said by many speakers we are living in a changing world and new conditions are arising every day, and what is suitable at one time may be found quite unsuitable at another.  But I think if there are changes, although there may be no continuous growth, it will be&mdash;I cannot get exactly the words that express it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to commit myself.  What I want to point out is that instead of the Constitution being subject to continuous change, there should be a certain period after which a change could not take place too easily.  It was first subjected to a period of trial and after that period a change can be made only by Referendum, requiring full discussion and a movement of public opinion. I think that on the whole that was the better way to deal with it.  It was a conservative tendency and it tended to hold back these changes so that we could be certain that they did not occur prematurely. I do not mind in the slightest what may be said hereafter.  The past is past and history will be written about it, if it is considered of sufficient importance when viewed dispassionately in the future.  What, however, is important is that we should have a document which we are prepared to accept as the fundamental rules under which we are prepared to live and work. If we get the people as a whole to accept these rules, change will be made when change is necessary.  This gives us a basis of peaceful government for ourselves, a basis on which we can adjust our differences of opinion.  We shall have, of course, differences of opinion.</P>
      <P>We should not be human if we had not these differences of opinion.  What is important is that the clash of opinion, when it is strong, should not become so violent as to disrupt the whole community.  We have in this State, therefore, rules of organisation and rules of democratic representation which enable our community to adjust all differences of opinion from time to time, and adjust them in a peaceable way, a set of rules which everybody should know.  If you want to do any piece of important work you must first know the rules.  My hope is that the people as a whole will come to understand these rules and to see what is good in them; if there are any things in them which are not good gradually a public opinion will develop which will enable these rules to be changed for the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the past, we are all <Col N="1346" /> children of the past in one way or another.  He would be a very foolish person indeed who would try to claim that there was something peculiarly original in what he did.  Some of the greatest discoveries, things that have contributed most to human advancement, have been things that were discovered at a particular time because other things that occurred at the same time made them possible.  The idea of flying, for instance, is a very, very old idea, judged in one light.  It was tried in various forms at various times, but finally it became practicable only when the internal combustion engine was invented. The fact that it is possible for us to frame a Constitution for ourselves is due to the efforts of people who have gone before us.  I should certainly be sorry for anybody to think that we in passing this Constitution did not pay full and meet tribute to the work of the people who went before us, work which enabled us to enact for the Irish people a Constitution of their own making.  As far as I am concerned, I am glad to have lived at this time and to be one of those who have been able to do something to assist in passing into actual effect a Constitution which nobody can gainsay is an Irish Constitution made by Irish representatives for the Irish people, without any element of dictation or interference from outside.  It is our own Constitution in that sense.</P>
    <P>When I say that, I am not passing any criticism on anybody who went before us, because it is quite true that we would not have been able to legislate in this way if other people had not done something else before us. I can only say that looking back I still believe that perhaps I was right in the attitude I took.  I do not know. That is a thing nobody can ever tell with certainty.  I can only say that if I had done otherwise it perhaps might have had a different result.  I can only say that I, and those who were with me, believed we were right in what we did at the time.  It is very foolish to think that there will ever be agreement on that matter, on this side of the grave anyhow.  I am glad to have this Act passed through the House.  I <Col N="1347" /> have asked that controversies about it, controversies which might be harmful, should be brought to an end, and that we should always endeavour to get for it that acceptance by the people which will mean peace in our own land.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 2 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>References in the Principal Act and this Act to the sale of milk shall be construed as including references to milk sold to a creamery and subsequently sent to and marketed within the Dublin sale area, and the Dublin District Milk Board, with the approval of the Minister, may impose such conditions as to purchase and sale of such milk as it may consider necessary to regulate milk supply and price within that sale area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say in passing that when the original Act was introduced there were numbers of people sending milk to Dublin for years and that continued. They were paid at the same rates as people within the area.  In two of the areas there were creameries but these creameries have disappeared.  The individuals who used the creameries and were the original suppliers continued <Col N="1348" /> sending their milk to one of those who acted as a wholesaler.  I do not wish in any way to deprive the farmers in one of these areas of the right to send milk by this creamery to Dublin, but I want a guarantee that no individual will have any privilege over wholesalers in the city.  From time to time I have heard complaints that one particular firm is able to put milk on the market here cheaper than other wholesalers.  It was said that distributors were able to buy milk from this particular concern as cheaply as from the producers.  That is the story that is going around.  I should like to see some provision so that if there was any abuse of that kind the Milk Board with the consent of the Minister would be able to check it.  When speaking on the Committee Stage in the Dáil the Minister doubted if there was any abuse. I am not so satisfied.  The reason for my amendment is that if there is any abuse the board could take whatever action they thought necessary, with the consent of the Minister.  I do not want to take power from the hands of the Minister.  I do not desire to do an injustice to anybody, but I do not want anyone to be in a privileged position. I am anxious there should be some provision whereby the Milk Board would have power and be able to exercise it when they satisfied the Minister that it was necessary to do so.</P>

      <P>The creameries should be allowed to supply milk here.  I have no doubt that, if they were allowed, the creameries would send more milk here, and consumers would receive it at a much cheaper price.  If we were honest about our work, and were prepared to supply something to the poor living in the cities in the way of milk, we ought to try to get it conveyed here and sold as cheaply as possible. The price charged in the city here is anything from 1/8 to 1/10 and up to 2/- per gallon, whereas down the country it is sold at 6d. or 7d. per gallon.  I admit that you could not convey milk to Dublin at that price, but the producers would be well satisfied to sell it here at 1/- a gallon, and it should be distributed to consumers in this city at 1/4 per gallon.  That is what I wish to convey to the Minister, and the only way that can be done is to give a clear field to the creameries in the South of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to the creameries, particularly those in the south, sending milk to Dublin, but I think that the suppliers of milk to these creameries should be placed in the same position with regard to regulations as the suppliers in the cities. There is a control exercised over them that is not exercised over suppliers to creameries.  There is no supervision exercised over the latter regarding the buildings in which cows are housed, or the conditions under which milk is produced. As long as there are equal conditions for all, I have no objection.</P>

      <P>The amendment, as worded, would give the board a certain amount of control over the supply of milk coming from creameries and that is already provided for in the Bill. Two classes of creameries send milk to Dublin.  The first class had the right to send milk in under the Principal Act.  They are being limited as to the amount they may send in.  The second class includes those who supplied milk to Dublin during the stoppage at the end of 1939.  They are limited to the amount they sent during that period.  The point with which Senator Byrne desires to deal <Col N="1350" /> is not covered by this amendment. The place which Deputy Byrne wants to get at is, I think, Edenderry.  They were a creamery but they failed and they went into the liquid milk business in Dublin.  They hold a licence to collect milk from suppliers and send it to Dublin, but that licence limits them to their present suppliers, so that they cannot enlarge their business to any great extent.  The only addition they could make to their business would be by their suppliers getting more cows.  They can get no new suppliers.  There is, I think, no danger from that source and this amendment is not necessary.  I am afraid the amendment would not cover the case the Senator has in mind because the limitation would have to be made under the Creamery Act and not under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister says, that the amendment is loosely drafted.  I have no desire to give the Dublin Milk Board any more control over creameries than they have. I do not want to prevent people sending in milk from Edenderry, but I do not want people to be in a privileged position so that they can sell more cheaply than others.  When the south of Ireland creameries send milk to Dublin, they get the same price as I get or anybody else gets.  It is not fair to the people who have to pay that price that somebody else should supply milk more cheaply.  All I am asking is that no section have a privilege over the other.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-sections (2) and (3).</P>
      <P>My object in putting down this amendment was to give point to some rather general remarks I made when this Bill was receiving Second Stage consideration. So far as I understand the position at present, there is a kind of protectionist ring around Dublin. Those who live in Dublin production area have the right to sell milk in the Dublin sales area and nobody living outside Dublin production area has got that right.  Am I correct in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>The only exception to that general principle is that certain creameries, in Tipperary, I think, have a limited right to sell a certain amount of milk in the Dublin sales area.  This Bill proposes to preserve that limited right but to preserve also the limitation.  The object of my amendment is to allow creameries or anybody outside Dublin production area to sell milk in Dublin sales area on exactly the same terms as if he lived in Dublin production area.  The proposal is that there should be complete free trade in milk and that the Dublin consumer should benefit by that.  I suggest that the only way we can get a supply of milk for the Dublin consumer which is cheap as well as reliable is to facilitate the import of milk from foreigners in Tipperary and other parts of the country where milk production is one of the primary agricultural activities and where it can be produced more cheaply and under more natural and convenient conditions than it can in almost any other part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" /> The principal effect of leaving out these two sub-sections would be to remove the limitation on these extern creameries as a source of supply for Dublin sales area.  I think I suggested that it would be desirable, in the public interest, that a supply of milk from such a source should replace the present supply of milk which comes from Dublin cowsheds which, in the nature of things, cannot be satisfactory, as they are said to be somewhat insanitary. I would go further and say that the only hope of providing a cheap supply of reliable milk for the Dublin consumer, which ought not to exceed 4d. a quart in price, will be if you develop these somewhat distant creameries as a source of supply even if it means that there be some restriction on the production of milk in the Dublin production area.</P>

      <P>I am not clear as to what Senator Johnston wants to do.  He is a man whose opinions I value and on most subjects he is well informed.  I do not think he knows as much about this subject as he does about other subjects.  I presume that his proposal is that the Twenty-Six Counties should be at liberty to send milk into Dublin. They would, I presume, get the fixed prices and we would have so much milk that we would not know what to do with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole point about this &ldquo;ring&rdquo; is that five counties have been supplying Dublin for many years. Everybody else who was sending milk to Dublin for a year or two years before the Act was passed is still entitled to send milk here.  There are men from Tipperary, Cork and Kerry still sending milk to Dublin.  Members of the Oireachtas who do not live in Leinster at all are sending milk to Dublin.  At the time the Act was passed a large number of people in those five counties and other counties dairied the whole year round&mdash;even in winter, when it costs much more to produce milk than at other periods of the year.  The result was that, when other people flooded the markets at <Col N="1353" /> other times of the year, the distributors brought milk down to such a price that the people sending it to Dublin could not possibly produce it.  The idea underlying the Bill was to give those farmers sending milk to Dublin the cost of production and something for themselves.</P>
      <P>We hear from time to time about farmers getting higher prices, and we have had many discussions and motions in this House about giving farmers a living wage, putting them in a position to pay a better wage to employees, and to employ more, and thus to get more people to live on the land.  In this instance, something was done for a large number of farmers, not alone in the County of Dublin, but in the Counties of Wicklow, Meath and Kildare, and others not in the scheduled areas, such as Carlow and part of Wexford, where there are individual farmers who have been all the time sending milk to Dublin, and trying to get a price which would enable them to continue even under difficult conditions. We know that the milk had to be produced under the Milk and Dairies Act, or, as it was generally known, &ldquo;The Clean Milk Act.&rdquo;  The result was that anybody sending milk to Dublin had to get a special licence from the Dublin Board of Health, and had to have the premises in a certain state of repair, and so on.</P>
      <P>It is ridiculous for Senator Johnston to tell us now that milk could be produced at a lower rate.  If it is to be produced in Dublin, we should get the cost of production and a decent living. It cannot be produced and sold in Dublin at certain periods of the year at 1/4 a gallon.  As I said the last day, what Senator Johnston visualises could be arranged if there were an all-the-year-round price.  That could not be done under present conditions, where we are working on summer and winter prices, and I defy anybody to say it could.  I have been in the trade long enough to know that.  It cannot be produced in the winter at the prices suggested. I say, from practical knowledge and experience, that if this amendment is carried, it will simply nullify the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only circumstances <Col N="1354" /> that would prevent me from supporting the amendment by Senator Johnston is that it would not cure the existing evil.  We are exporting subsidised milk to another State at the rate of about 6d. a gallon, in the form of butter.  While we are seeking cheap food for our own people, if we are to subsidise milk or butter for anybody, why not do it for our own people of the towns and cities?  There is a certain amount of free milk given to the very poor in the towns, I admit, and everybody is thankful for that, but free milk is not what is required at all.  Cheap milk is needed.  If this milk which is sent away in the form of butter, and subsidised by the taxpayers, were pasteurised at the creamery, it could be distributed to the people as food, and that would be a more practical use of the money than subsidies for people in another State.  I am sure an organisation for distribution is not beyond the power of the Minister and his staff.</P>
      <P>Practical people believe that that butter exported and subsidised at a very cheap rate should be used at home, either in the form of milk or butter&mdash;and especially in the form of milk given to the poor people.  I would not in any way interfere with the legitimate business of the dairying institutions in and around Dublin, but twice the amount of milk could be used as is used at present if the price were reasonable.  The subsidy on exports could be withdrawn and used at home and in that way the dairying communities around Dublin would still have their own market for their own milk at their own price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to Senator Byrne, I would like to say that I am not at all in favour of encouraging an outside supply of milk to the Dublin market, if that supply will come only in the summer time.  Any contracts made with creameries or with anyone supplying milk should insist on an all-the-year-round supply, and no contract should be tolerated which does not include a provision that a reasonable proportion of the milk be supplied during the six winter months.  Surely the creameries sending milk to Dublin from <Col N="1355" /> the south-west&mdash;although their milk supply does fall off considerably in the winter time&mdash;retain even in the winter months far more milk than is necessary to maintain any volume of whole milk sales they are likely to arrange with the Dublin consumers?  The total amount of milk processed in that part of the country, even in the winter time, must be far in excess of the requirements of the Dublin consumers in the winter time.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Senator who spoke against the policy of subsidising butter for export.  It should be possible to sell butter at a price which includes no element of subsidy from the taxpayer. If by expanding that proportion of the creamery output which is consumed as whole milk in Dublin, a larger return can be made to the farmers in the dairying districts, that would go some little distance towards solving the problem which is now solved by the very undesirable method of subsidising the export of surplus butter.</P>
      <P>Further, I would say in answer to Senator Byrne that the producer-retailer who lives conveniently near Dublin&mdash;say, within a radius of 20 miles&mdash;should be in a position to produce a tuberculin-tested grade of milk which does not require pasteurisation and which is better because it is not pasteurised.  That kind of milk is admittedly the highest of all qualities of milk for human consumption and should command a price higher than the price I contemplate for this other milk from the creameries which is pasteurised.  The main problem, as I see it, is to provide for that majority of the people of Dublin which is not very well off, a quantity of milk which is safe from the point of view of health and at the same time cheap. By cheap I mean that it should not cost more than 4d. a quart.  I believe it should be possible to get milk at 4d. a quart for the people of Dublin, if these sources of supply in the large-scale producing areas are properly developed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad that <Col N="1356" /> Senator Honan raised the particular point which he raised.  We had a very important meeting on Saturday, at which there were present representatives of all the Parties in the county, representatives from the county council and practically complete membership of the county committee of agriculture.  The whole discussion hinged on what could be done to relieve the dairy farmer.  It was pointed out that the Minister for Agriculture, some date anterior to this, said that the dairy farmer was hard hit and that his sympathy went out to him.  We all appreciate that something must be done to rehabilitate agriculture in the country.  Sixpence a gallon, which is being obtained at the moment, is not an economic price and, as a result, the very minimum of labour has been employed in the last four or five weeks, at a time when the farmer ought to be encouraged, because of the necessity for the increased production of food, to employ the maximum of labour.  There was a great discussion on the terrible position of the agricultural community over a great many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all right to appeal to the Minister, to make speeches in the Seanad or Dáil, and to have all the broadcasting on behalf of the agricultural community, but as I said at the meeting on Saturday, you must have some tangible premises&mdash;you must have something to go on&mdash;if you go to a Minister, or the Government, and ask them to do something better for the farmer.  In any case, the general consensus of opinion was that sixpence a gallon was not economic.  That being so, something must be done to get a better price for milk.  There, of course, you are up against many problems. The cost of living goes up.  It was agreed that, at least, it should be 2d. per gallon more.  Somebody pointed out that 1d. a gallon meant nearly £1,000,000.  Then you are right up against it again.  In the course of the discussion somebody made a point analogous to the point raised by Senator Honan.  It was pointed out that a certain quantity of butter is <Col N="1357" /> used for home consumption&mdash;it is quite easy to determine the exact amount&mdash; and that a considerable quantity of butter is manufactured for the export trade.  The meeting held that there should be a dividing line drawn between the home market and the export market.  If the farmers generally were permitted to sell in the city and urban areas the milk that is being used for the manufacture of butter for export, they would get at least a uniform price, in season and out of season, of 1/- per gallon.  We, and other members of the boards of health, know very well that the price we pay under the free milk scheme in the board of health is much more than that, but it was agreed at our meeting that 1/&mdash; could be realised.</P>
    <P>I may say I was amazed at one point.  The statement was made by a very responsible citizen at our meeting that there were thousands of poor people and others who want more milk and cannot get it in the City of Limerick.  I state here authoritatively that I know exclusively rural areas where poor people and others can get scarcely sufficient milk for use in their tea, apart from having milk to drink, although it is recommended by medical opinion as being one of the most essential foods.  In rural Ireland, in a dairying county such as County Limerick, they can get very little milk to drink. There is a scarcity of milk because the farmers are precluded from selling it. Only a limited number are allowed to sell it.  The point raised by Senator Honan is very important and, as I said, it was analogous to one raised at a very serious discussion to which, I may say, Senator Martin O'Dwyer contributed. Farmers cannot sell milk indiscriminately. They must conform to the legislation passed in 1935.  But while that legislation had some good effects, such as pasteurisation and improvement in hygiene, it has had serious reactions upon a big section of our poor and struggling community.  Therefore, if something could be done along the lines suggested, if the farmers could be accommodated in that way, it would help to stabilise conditions and would result in a generous supply of a splendid <Col N="1358" /> food to the masses of our people who are precluded from having it at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understood Senator Johnston correctly, he is definitely opposed to the production of milk by the Dublin cowkeepers. In my opinion, milk can be produced as hygienically in Dublin as anywhere else, if proper restrictions are applied. The Dublin cowkeepers are producing milk under very strict supervision. There are dairy inspectors, sanitary staff and veterinary surgeons to inspect the herds and the dairies and the dairy yards where milk is produced.  Senator Johnston should know very well that the Dublin cowkeepers put their cattle out to graze in the summer-time in the fields in the vicinity of the City of Dublin.  The Dublin cowkeepers' cattle are out grazing in the open fields from some time in April, according to the conditions of the weather, up to the 1st November.  It is true they are in the stall for the winter months.  But some of us know the length of time that cows in farms in the country spend in the open fields and the length of time they spend in the cow-sheds during the winter months.  How much time do cows in rural areas in the months of November, December and January spend in the fields as against the time they spend in the cow-sheds? I know perfectly well most of the time is spent in cow-sheds.  In my opinion, the cow-sheds in Dublin are under much more strict supervision than are the cow-sheds in the farmyards throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another advantage in milk being produced in the city or in its vicinity.  If a strike should occur the milk is convenient to the city and can reach the consumers without any trouble.  Other considerations also arise.  Cowkeepers are heavy ratepayers in the City of Dublin.  They pay big wages.  A number of dairy boys are employed in the city.  A very big percentage of men are also employed in milking operations.  If it does mean that all that employment should be moved from the city to the country it would be a very serious <Col N="1359" /> matter for all those who follow their livelihood in that direction.  I said before and I repeat now that Dublin milk is produced, in my opinion, under stricter supervision than it is being produced throughout rural areas and I cannot for the life of me see&mdash;I would like to be enlightened&mdash;what objection anybody can have to milk being produced in Dublin if it is produced under proper conditions, and I submit that it is produced under proper conditions in the City of Dublin where it is properly looked after.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that I cannot agree to the recommendation of Senator Johnston that these two sections should be left out of the Bill, because the object of the Bill is to secure some reasonable measure of orderly marketing, and to secure as steady a supply of milk of high-grade quality at reasonable prices.  If these two sections are deleted, as Senator Johnston suggests, and the market is thrown open to what he describes, for want of a better term at the moment, as free trading in milk, I see nothing ahead but chaos&mdash;irregular supply, difficulty in guaranteeing quality, and difficulty in regulating prices.  I do suggest that if his suggestions were adopted, the position would be very much worse than it is at the moment; that, in fact, the deletion of these two sections would defeat the whole object of the Bill.  Consequently, I would suggest to Senator Johnston to consider seriously the withdrawal of these amendments, because I do not think they are in the interests of the milk supply, either in the quality, prices, or any other aspect of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to the provision in these sections regarding the licensing of sending of milk to Dublin from the creameries. At the time the milk supply to Dublin was stopped an order was made that creameries in County Limerick could send up a supply of milk and I may say that I myself was very much in favour of sending up the milk; indeed, if I myself had had my way the milk strike would have been treated <Col N="1360" /> in a very different manner.  I must say I was in a minority of one.  The farmers objected to sending up milk. I did not agree with them, but after all, they looked upon it in the trade union spirit and I would ask the Minister very seriously not to insist on this because, undoubtedly, it will lead to a perpetuation of the bitterness and strife.  It will enable certain creameries to pay larger prices and that will cause the cutting of supplies from other creameries and it will lead to great bitterness between the creameries.</P>
      <P>On this main question of main supplies to the cities I would like to point out that, when all is said and done about the necessity of organising local supplies and having regulations as to the quality and security of contract, the fact remains that milk in Dublin and other cities is being sold at a price that the majority, or half, the population cannot pay.  People cannot drink milk at the price it is being supplied.  When milk is cheap in the country there ought to be some way of supplying cheaper milk in the cities.  It may be that the cost of distribution may be too high and depôts were established to reduce costs considerably, but we must remember that there is not the consumption there should be.  It might be possible that milk produced within the vicinity of the city could be produced at one price and it might be possible to allow in a cheap grade of milk to supply those who are not able to pay the higher price.  The main thing is not a question of creameries or producers or anybody else; it is a question of supplying cheap milk to the inhabitants of the cities and towns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Johnston I think was trying to achieve by this amendment that there would not be any limitation of milk coming in from the creameries.  Well, this section applies only to creameries that are coming in as the result of supplying milk during the strike.  That is a matter not worth bothering about because I presume that if the Seanad agrees with Senator Johnston's view the matter could be made right at the next stage, but I <Col N="1361" /> am afraid that the general principle Senator Johnston seeks to achieve by this Bill is in direct conflict with the whole legislation.  Legislation was brought in to regulate the marketing of milk here and practically to confine the supply of milk to the five counties surrounding Dublin.  When we brought in the 1935 Act it was recognised that suppliers outside these counties would have a distinct grievance if they were prevented from supplying milk, so it was provided in the 1935 Act that any supplier outside these counties who had established his connection would be permitted to continue to supply milk. It was also provided that all those creameries which had supplied milk more or less regularly&mdash;I think it was 45 weeks out of 52&mdash;would have the right to continue.  I think Senator Johnston's intention is that all these creameries&mdash;that is the creameries who supplied milk before the strike and the outside suppliers&mdash;should be permitted to supply milk without any limitation. Well, that of course, if it were permitted, I am afraid would nullify practically everything we have done in the Principal Act, and I think the Principal Act has done a certain amount of good for the suppliers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I remember when I was bringing in the Act I did not claim that it was likely to bring cheap milk, but I said the consumer would still get milk at the price he was getting it at but that the producer would get more.  The consumer did not have to pay more, but there was a regular market and more satisfaction generally in the scheme.  There were other matters raised.  Another matter was this&mdash;take the creameries that came to our rescue during the strike.  I promised these creameries on behalf of the consumers&mdash;I said, if you, the creameries, came to the rescue of the consumers here in Dublin I promise you will be permitted to continue when the strike is stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was obvious, of course, that we should reward them according to the effort they made.  In other words, if <Col N="1362" /> they made a great effort to supply a good deal of milk, they should be permitted to supply a good deal in future. It is hardly reasonable to expect that those who only came to the rescue, more or less in a token way, by supplying a few gallons of milk should be allowed to send unlimited quantities now.  Really what we are doing in this Bill is to permit them to send the same quantity, taking it on a weekly or monthly basis, that they supplied during that period.  There were 47 creameries which came to the rescue at that time.  These 47 creameries would be quite free to supply milk to Dublin for all time, but only seven of them have elected to remain in the business so that it does appear, taking the price here in the city and comparing with it the price down the country, that there is not very much in the Dublin business at all.  I think the creameries that are in the Dublin business are not making any great fortunes as compared with the creameries that are not.  At any rate, the fact is that of the 47 creameries that might have remained in this business, only seven have decided to remain.</P>
    <P>Speakers here thought that we should do something to increase the consumption of milk in order to cut out exports of subsidised milk products. That is a very obvious thing, and it is hardly likely that if it were possible to do anything in that direction, it would have escaped the attention of either the officers of the Department or myself.  For instance, if we could get every person in the country to consume twice as much milk &mdash;and that is rather a big proposition &mdash;we could reduce the export of dairy produce only by 20 per cent.  There is not the slightest hope of getting consumers in the country to consume twice as much milk as at present, but even if we did, we should still have to export a very considerable quantity of dairy products.  Take butter consumed at home.  That is all being subsidised. I want to make that clear, because I thought from some remarks made by one or two Senators that the home consumer was contributing to the bounty on exports.  He is, of course, <Col N="1363" /> contributing as a taxpayer, but this year there is no such thing as a levy being collected.  A levy was collected last year, but it was more or less a book-keeping transaction.  This year we are not collecting a levy at all, and we are paying 6/- a cwt from the 1st April on all home consumed butter, so that we are subsidising home consumed butter as well as exported butter.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say&mdash;I have often thought it myself and have said it at conferences in my Department&mdash; that it is a pity that we should have to export butter and pay a subsidy on it while our own people are not consuming enough butter and milk.  I know that is true but when you come to try to make any practical proposition to deal with the matter, it is quite a different question.  Obviously we could increase the consumption of butter at home by reducing the price by 1d. or 2d. per lb. but that would not achieve the other object we have in view.  We would have to reduce it by as much as 6d. to achieve that object and that would cost an enormous amount of money.  If we were prepared to pay an extra 1d. a gallon to suppliers of creameries it would cost £1,000,000.  If we were to pay 3d. a gallon more, which is the general demand throughout the country, it would cost £3,000,000.  All these things are impossible and while I might agree that creamery suppliers are not doing very well, and that it would be a great thing if we could get our own people to consume twice as much milk and butter, it is very difficult to achieve that.  It could be done if we had a few million pounds at our disposal because we could provide cheaper milk and butter for home consumption.  Senator Johnston advocated bigger supplies from the creameries for the city so that the poor might be able to buy milk at 4d. a quart.  I do not think that the consumer would get any better value even if milk came in in greater quantities from the creameries.  I have already given an instance where only seven out of 47 creameries thought it worth while to continue sending milk to the city.  Evidently the creameries <Col N="1364" /> are not prepared to sell milk very much cheaper than the figure at present prevailing around the city.  In any case milk is available at the moment at 2d. a pint.</P>

      <P>In quite a number of shops it is available at 2d. a pint, but that is only during the cheap periods of May, June and July.  Another point made was that if the farmers were permitted to sell their milk in urban areas we would not have this big quantity of butter for export.  I have already told Senators that even if you could get the urban areas to consume twice as much milk, we should still have to export considerable quantities.</P>
      <P>These points are not altogether connected with Senator Johnston's amendment. As Senator Ua Buachalla has pointed out, Senator Johnston's amendment is against the whole spirit of this legislation because this legislation was brought in in the first instance to give the farmers of these five counties some hope for the future and some system of orderly marketing.  If we depart from that and say that the creameries can send in as much milk as they like, we shall undo a lot of what we set out to do in the beginning. The five counties are a big area and to expect 40,000 gallons from this area is a very small matter, when one realises that Kilrush creamery which caters only for part of County Clare&mdash; which is not a very outstanding agricultural county&mdash;deals in the busy season with that quantity of milk.  To expect these five counties to produce 40,000 gallons&mdash;an amount which they do not always send in&mdash;is not giving very much of a monopoly.  The supply is spread over a very large area.</P>

      <P>I do not want to get into a Second Reading debate but this amendment covers a very wide field.  What I feel about the Minister's attitude towards milk regulation is that he has not sufficient regard for the interests of the consumer.  That is, perhaps, only right; he is representing agriculture and the farmer has his full consideration.  Undoubtedly the whole purpose of the Bill is to protect the vested interests of producers in a certain area.  Does the Minister not feel an obligation to discriminate between the efficient and inefficient producer? I think he will admit that a large number of those producers have a very poor record as regards milk yields. Are all these producers in cow-testing associations?  If they are not in cow-testing associations and the yield is small, what right have they to be protected? I think that is an aspect of the whole question to which the Minister should have regard.  Is the Minister satisfied that the system of distribution is efficient?  I cannot believe for a moment that it is efficient when one sees milk cans carried in every sort of conveyance supplying one house here and another house 300 yards away.  One can only conclude that the system is most wasteful and overlapping.  If the Minister could apply some test of efficiency to the producer and, at the same time, set up some central organisation for distribution, it would enable ample compensation over a number of years to be paid to producers who are displaced. I feel convinced that that would substantially reduce the price of milk to consumers.  Milk stands in a totally different category from any other food. While there is undoubtedly inefficient distribution in the matter of bread, the effect on the consumer is different.  Most consumers, if they wish, can make their own bread but no consumer can make his own milk.</P>
      <P>As I said before on the Second Reading, I am in favour of travelling towards socialistic means to get milk to the consumer at the lowest possible price consistent with a fair wage and a fair price to the producer.  I hope the Minister in any future legislation will approach the matter from that angle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with Senator Johnston, but I am opposed to the amendment. I am satisfied that if the Senator was in the position of the Minister and listening to the dairy farmers trying to get their grievances rectified, he would never have put it down.  We had a milk strike in this city not so long ago which caused very serious disturbance, and were it not for the creameries throughout the country Dublin would have been without milk.  That strike was not without justification.  Furthermore, in the five counties around Dublin if even half of the farmers went into milk production they would supply the whole city, but only one out of every three is producing milk.  I am not too sure of my figures but taking that estimate as near correct it is one reason for my attitude against the motion.  The dairy farmers of this country have been to the Minister many times to get a fair price based on the cost of production for their milk.  In this debate we are all agreed that cheap milk is very essential for the poor of this country.  We all agree that it is very proper and very desirable also that it should be good milk, and produced in good surroundings where it is properly handled.  The bulk of the farmers in this country are not in a position to handle milk as it should be handled for human consumption. To produce milk fit for human consumption you need a proper water supply installed and good hygienic conditions insisted upon.  The officials of the Department are insistent on everything being done in the proper way.</P>
      <P>It is said that milk is produced and sold at 6d. per gallon to the creameries, and that Dublin is overflowing with milk, with plenty of milk in the country.  The big problem is to get rid of surplus milk.  It appears to me that a higher grade cow might enable the people of this country to produce milk cheaper than they do. Where we go wrong is looking for a cow to produce 400 gallons annually. On the continent they have animals that produce 600 gallons annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason that we have a cow <Col N="1367" /> giving such a low yield annually is that we produce beef animals for export and more or less neglect the dairying side of the business.  I am not at all sure that it would not be a desirable line to tax the live-stock industry in order to subsidise the dairying industry.  The dairy cow is the foundation of the live-stock industry and mother of the human race.  I agree that a supply of good milk and cheap milk is desirable.  But there is the other side of the picture where you have the farmers all grumbling at the cost of production.  A higher grade cow might go a long way towards solving the difficulty.  I do not know whether that has ever been gone into in this country, but the matters I mention would I believe be very helpful in producing cheaper supplies for the poor.  There is also the question of the distribution of the milk in our cities and towns which is very costly and cumbersome at present. If that could be done in a more economic way it would also ease the situation and make for cheaper milk. I sympathise a good deal with the sentiments expressed by Senator Johnston, but I feel I must oppose this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am not at all satisfied with the way in which this amendment has been treated.  The Minister made a considerable point out of the existing legislation governing the milk supply of Dublin, but after all it is not the primary object of the Legislature or of this Seanad to preserve existing legislation, but rather to act in the interest of the welfare of the country as a whole.  I would ask the Minister why he should not consider driving a coach and four through the existing legislation to get a cheap supply of milk for the Dublin people without reducing the price paid to the producer.  I agree with those Senators who emphasise the important part played in this matter by the cost of distribution as a big factor in making the price of milk in Dublin so dear. The Minister in his remarks did not mention if he has any policy for cheapening the cost of distribution.  If <Col N="1368" /> I had any assurance that the Minister or his Department were looking into this problem of producing a scheme to cheapen the cost of distribution then I should, with a clear conscience, withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion standing in the names of Senator Lynch, Senator Campbell and myself, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order, 1941, tabled on 14th May, 1941, be and is hereby annulled.</P>
      <P>We, of the whole Labour movement throughout the country, regard this order as the culmination of an apparently definite effort on the part of the Government to enslave the workers. Everything contained in this order deprives the working class of rights won by years of suffering and sacrifice on the part of the people.  To our mind, this is the most reactionary order introduced since the setting up of the native Government.  The workers are very disturbed about the whole trend of Government policy so far as it affects them.  By this order, the Trade Disputes Act, wrung from a Conservative Government in Britain, goes overboard. That was one of the greatest and best safeguards the workers had won by legislative effort.  By this order it is shelved.  The trade boards also go into oblivion.  How long this position will last entirely depends on the Government.  The trade boards were established to deal with sweated industries and unscrupulous employers who were exploiting juveniles and women who had not the protection of trade unions.  That protection goes into oblivion.  The Agricultural Wages Board, set up by the Government themselves&mdash;a board to which the agricultural workers might make application to have their wages and working hours improved&mdash;also disappears.  The Wages Board ceases to function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We see that the Government is introducing a Trades Union Bill in order to model trades unions in the way they would like them.  The Conditions of Employment Act&mdash;a measure for which the Government got great credit and which was very much appreciated by the working class&mdash;goes overboard also. The Seanad will realise that the <Col N="1371" /> working class, so far as they are concerned under this order, are without any protection whatever.  In many arguments the Minister and the members of the Government have denounced the vicious spiral.  A spiral, apparently, is vicious only when it trends upwards: it is not vicious when it shows a downward trend.  There is nothing to prevent an employer or a body of employers from reducing wages and changing conditions but the power of the organised workers, which the Government intends to interfere with in another manner.  This is all very ominous so far as the working class are concerned, and they are very disturbed.  I challenge the Minister on this statement: there is no section of the community which shows more consideration for the emergency than the working class of this country.</P>
    <P>The average increase since the emergency began does not exceed 4/- per week, and everybody here will realise that the cost of living has gone very much higher than that covers.  The pursuit of prices by the workers&mdash; which the Minister and the Government so very strongly denounced&mdash;is not evident there.  There is ample evidence, on the other hand, that the working class appreciate the emergency and are prepared to make sacrifices in order to meet it.  And this is their reward&mdash; Emergency Order 83.  Legislation by order has been denounced time and again by the members of this Party. When the previous Government were in office they introduced a kind of Emergency Powers Bill, and some of us in this House visualised a time when a Government would use an Emergency Powers Order to persecute and penalise the workers of the country.  That time has come; the order is there.</P>
    <P>These are law-abiding citizens, these are people whose rights are concerned under the Constitution and, by an order laid on the Table of the House&mdash; not by any Bill or measure that we could criticise, amend or alter&mdash;the rights are torn from them which have been secured by generations of effort and sacrifice.  That is a deplorable condition of affairs brought about by a native Government.  That is one reason <Col N="1372" /> why we are opposed to legislation by order.</P>
    <P>The efforts of the Government are entirely misdirected.  If they wish to secure the co-operation of the workers in industrial matters, they should take them into their confidence more and recognise their difficulties.  It is futile to talk of controlling wages while we leave prices practically untouched&mdash; and that is the condition to-day.  It matters not to us whether our wages are £10 or £1 per week: what really matters is what we can get for that money for ourselves and our families and what standard of living we can maintain.  If the Government can ensure that this standstill order will not worsen the already bad conditions of the working class, then we have no complaint and we are with them wholeheartedly. We submit, however, that by this order they are definitely worsening the conditions of the workers all over the country&mdash;agricultural and industrial.  Consequently, we think that this order should be annulled or restricted in the light of its possible effects.  Its repercussions throughout the country may cause a disturbance in the conditions which, happily, have prevailed up to the present.</P>
    <P>I suggest&mdash;and I think the Minister and the Government generally will have to agree&mdash;that at no period in this country has there been less industrial strife than since the emergency arose.  The workers have shown their appreciation and recognition of the Government's difficulty.  They have not pressed unduly for increased wages or taken advantage of the position to exploit the community in general.  No; they have been satisfied with about half the amount they were entitled to in increased wages to meet the increased cost of living.  This is a standstill order only in so far as going up is concerned; retreating or returning is not an offence under it.</P>
    <P>If any employer gives an increase in wages he is liable to a penalty of a fine of £100.  My knowledge of employers generally is that even if the £100 fine were not there, they are very reluctant at any time to give an increase <Col N="1373" /> in wages, but with this menace of a £100 fine over their heads they are not very likely to give any increase in wages.  There is nothing in this order to prevent the employer worsening conditions.  For instance, it is mentioned in the order that in the event of a man or woman, as the case may be, having a certain wage, it is an offence to take on another and pay him a higher rate, but, remember, it is no offence whatever to pay him less than the former employee had.</P>
    <P>This order is almost all-embracing. Few can escape the net of the schedule, and I am not going to waste time in pointing out the few that have escaped the net.  One very noticeable one is the undertaker.  I do not know whether that is intended.  The whole matter is an extremely grave subject for the workers of the country.  Only last Sunday, at a conference held in Galway, many of the Labour people who attended there, who are Government supporters, were very vehement about the attitude of the Government in connection with this order, and some of them got in touch with their Deputies and Senators to impress on them what it meant to them.</P>
    <P>There is a number of Senators in this House who have been nominated by the Government Party as Labour men.  I put it to them that they can hardly support an order that is going to enslave the working classes of this country.  I have already pointed out how they are going to be enslaved by this.  I am sure it would be very interesting if they would tell us how they could possibly justify their support for an order of this nature.  In conclusion, I wish to say that this is the most reactionary order that has ever been put through this House since its inception. I sincerely hope the Government will reconsider their whole attitude on these matters, because at the present time we want co-operation; we want goodwill; we want common support, in order that we may carry on through the emergency.  Nowhere will that support be more heartily given than by the working classes of this country, but I submit, to put these people in chains, as it were, is not the way to get <Col N="1374" /> co-operation.  The workers can be led. They are not going to be driven.  This order is certainly driving them with a scorpion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the motion.  I take it that one of the functions for which this House was established was to prevent hasty or indiscreet legislation.  It has attempted to do that and it has succeeded in some instances but, I think, on no previous occasion has it been faced with a duty along these lines in a matter so serious in its repercussions as the motion under discussion.  When the Emergency Powers Bill was given to the Government fears were expressed by the Labour members that the over-weening ambition of a Minister, the desire for a petty triumph, political or otherwise, might lead him into indiscretions.  It was never thought that the first indiscretion, the gravest of indiscretions, attempted to be perpertrated would have its reactions on the workers, the wage-earners, the bulk of the population of this country. At a time when there was full appreciation of the necessity for co-operation with the Government in the trying period through which it was passing, at a time when the Government should do everything to strengthen and encourage such co-operation, it is astounding to find them embarking upon this policy of slave-making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think words can be found to sufficiently emphasise the evil that will be done if this legislation by order is persisted in.  It takes a wise and discreet Government to exercise all the powers that were entrusted to this Government when they were given the Emergency Powers Act.  Unfortunately, they are not long in possession of them when this thing is launched as a thunderbolt.  It is a war upon the working class and the standard of life of the working class.  It is incomprehensible that men who surely had studied the history of the trade union movement and its Christianising influences since the middle centuries should have taken the preliminary steps to set back that movement and to throw the workers of this country into the condition they were in before <Col N="1375" /> they joined their unions.  If, when they are intending to do this, they could show us that the standard of life was not being lowered, that a continuing lowering process would not take place in the standard of life of the workers in proportion to the increased spiral of prices, if they could only give us one consoling suggestion as to how the difficulty of the lowest paid class of the wage-earners would be met, then there would be some toleration for this.</P>
    <P>We on these benches are not promoters of strikes.  We are not desirous of creating a breach as between the workers and the Government or the workers and the employers, so long as we get a fair deal.  But, when a fair deal is not forthcoming, then the forces we speak for will get out of our control.  The leaders of big unions cannot guide those unions in the way that discretion would be the lodestar of their efforts.  At a time when this country is at peace, proposals are launched that have not been suggested in war conditions.  It is not a war measure.  It is an emergency measure. I would ask the Minister to be very careful and I would specially appeal to this House, in pursuance of one of its chief functions, to prevent this act of hasty legislation which will have a very disturbing influence throughout the whole country, not alone in the big centres of population but in the rural areas.  I would ask the Minister to withdraw or to modify this very dangerous order.</P>

I wonder would it be too much to ask the Minister if he would make at the beginning of the debate an explanatory statement as to what the order actually means and how it is going to work so that the debate may proceed upon understanding lines subsequently?  I think that if we had that from the Minister there would be no objection to the Minister speaking again.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this order apparently has been very much misunderstood.  It is not an attack upon the standard of the workers of this country nor of the wage earners. It simply states that in our situation, with the realisation that the supply of commodities available is likely to become short, where prices are likely to be raised and where there is going to be competition between the stronger and the weaker for their accustomed share of the pool, we should all, in regard to our actual purchasing power, stand fast.  Because we do not wish that anyone should try to get the better of his neighbour&mdash;and that, unfortunately, is the natural tendency, and one which is not confined to the employer class but is found among the workers themselves&mdash;and because we wish that one man should not try to get the better of his neighbour in these circumstances, we have made this Order.  There is nothing in the Order to induce an attack upon the workers' wages, and there is nothing in the order that implies that anybody should try to reduce the money value of the wages which any worker or any class of worker receives. The main purpose of the order is to see, first of all, that the remuneration should stand at its present level.

      <P>There are other forms of remuneration.  Let nobody say that this order relates only to wages.  It relates to all forms of remuneration whether secured by way of dividends or whether secured by way of fees or by way of wages and it says that in the present circumstances no such increases shall take place.  Now, <Col N="1377" /> I think the purpose of the order is clear.  It is simply this that in view of the general attack that is going to be made upon the standard of living in this community as a whole, that everybody will be prepared simply to stand fast at this particular moment.  Any person who tries to detach himself from his neighbour, anybody who says: &ldquo;Well, when the standard of living, as a whole, is going to decline, is going to be depressed, I must hold myself apart from the rest and my standard of living must remain untouched,&rdquo; is not standing fast.  He, in fact, is retreating.</P>
      <P>He is breaking the ranks, he is precipitating a panic which would inevitably lead to economic disaster for the whole of us and, therefore, all we are asking with regard to this order is that we should all at this moment, and for the next three or four or five months, as this crisis is building up, stand fast. I am quite prepared to say, in relation to the general body of the workers of this country, that they have realised their responsibilities in this matter during the past 12 or 14 months.  They have behaved with commendable restraint. That is, as far as the general body of the workers is concerned, but I cannot say that applies to everybody because there have been some instances, for one reason or another, perhaps largely because circumstances were particularly favourable, that the remuneration of some persons has been linked with the standard of living and that they have secured compensation in whole or in part for any increase which has taken place.  You have, as I said in the other House, certain occupations in which the workers have secured increases in remuneration as high as 12/- or 13/- a week&mdash;in others, and they are the great bulk of the workers, they had secured some increase, and it has been of the order of 2/- or 3/- per week.  You have still other occupations in which they have secured no compensation whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point of that is this.  Those who were fortunate enough to secure the higher rates of compensation secured them at the expense of the rest of the community and at the expense of people who are not able to help themselves <Col N="1378" /> in the present circumstances. For instance, you had an undertaking which manufactures an article whose selling price depends on its labour cost and, if the labour charges in that undertaking go up, in consequence of that increase the price of that commodity goes up to the whole of the community.  It is obvious that the person who has got that increased remuneration in that industry, whether it is in the form of wages or dividends or directors' fees or in the form of salary, has got it at the cost of the rest of the community.  You have at the other end of the scale many people who are in precarious employment, people who are facing the day when, because of the fact that the supply of raw materials and other essentials for their industries is running short, are going to be thrown out of their employment. They cannot come along and say to their employer: &ldquo;Well, you must compensate me for the rising cost of living.&rdquo;  They have got to hang by the skin of their teeth to their job at what they were getting at the outbreak of war or what they may have been getting 12 or 14 months ago.  It is quite obvious that the person getting increased remuneration at one end of the scale is getting it at the expense of the person at the other end.  That is the situation we are facing up to. If we are going to allow this position to get out of control when we are faced with a dwindling pool of commodities, and of manufacturing commodities in particular, and a dwindling ability, a dwindling capacity, to keep that pool full and when we have everybody trying to get their accustomed share out of that pool, and when their ability to get that share depends on their purchasing power in terms of our currency, if you have one or other element in this community able to secure an increase in remuneration to satisfy an intensified urge to retain their former share in that pool, while other people, who are not in the same fortunate position, have to content themselves with a standardised purchasing power, then the man who can, by reason of the fact that he stands at a key position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps in accordance with usual procedure I may be allowed to deal with the order, article by article.  Article 1, Part 1, of the order merely prescribes that the order may be cited as the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order No. 41.  Article 2 is a definitive article.  It states that the expression &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Industry and Commerce; the word &ldquo;employ&rdquo; means employ under a contract of service, and the word &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; includes remuneration paid either for time work or for piece-work, remuneration paid for overtime and remuneration consisting wholly or partly of commission calculated on a percentage or other basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 3 prescribes that the expression &ldquo;the operative date&rdquo; means the date on which the order is made. Article 4 prescribes that each of the following employments shall be a scheduled employment for the purposes of this part of the order, &ldquo;subject to the operation of an order made by the Minister under paragraph 2 of this Article&rdquo;.  The employments in question are the manufacture of wearing apparel, the production <Col N="1381" /> (otherwise than by way of agriculture) of any commodity which is used as food or drink by man&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The list also includes the manufacture of tobacco; the manufacture of textiles, the manufacture of articles made wholly or mainly of textile material; the manufacture of soap, candles, polishes, paints, distempers, varnishes or fertilisers; the manufacture of articles made wholly or mainly of metal; and, in fact, as Senator Hayes has said, all the articles which are scheduled on the last page.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an addition to those?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, employment in the service of any railway, air-transport, or canal company, employment in the service of any person in whom is vested by statute or otherwise the ownership, control, regulation or management of a harbour, employment in the service of any person carrying on any undertaking for the supply of electricity or gas, employment in the service of any person carrying on the business of banking, employment in the service of any assurance company, etc. The whole purpose of that is simply to ensure that where the labour costs in industry would have an adverse reaction on the cost of living, nothing shall be done within our control which would operate to increase the cost of living of the community as a whole. That is the general purpose of these three sections and the Schedule.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of motion, in the same form as this has been discussed. On that point, Section 2 of Article 4, prescribes that the Minister may, whenever and so often as he thinks fit by order declare that any employment specified in the Schedule shall cease to be a scheduled employment for the purposes of this part of the order.  Section 4 of the Article prescribes that for the purposes of the Schedule certain bodies shall be deemed to be local authorities.  Article 5 defines the word &ldquo;employee&rdquo; and states that &ldquo;employee&rdquo; means any person of the age of 14 years or upwards, who is employed in any scheduled employment. Paragraph 2 goes on to declare that the Minister may whenever and so often as he thinks fit, by order declare that any particular class of persons employed in any scheduled employment shall be an excluded class. Paragraph 3 of Article 5 states that a person who is the director of a company shall be deemed for the purposes of this Article not to be employed by that company.  That is merely because the position of directors is dealt with in another part of the order, but the directors of a company are exactly in the same position as the employees of a company.  Their remuneration cannot be increased either.  Article 6 prescribes that no employer shall pay to an employee, who is in his employment on the operative date, any remuneration at a rate higher than the rate which was the remuneration of such employee on the operative date&mdash;that is to say, that he cannot increase the wages of <Col N="1383" /> his employee, unless, of course, the employee gives him a greater return for the rate of wages which he has been paying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory minimum fixed in many instances is exceeded. In many cases the rates are above the statutory minimum.  The main thing is to preserve the statutory minimum as a minimum.  The provision of the statute guarantees that anyone getting more than the statutory minimum will continue to be paid at the existing rate whatever it may be. The remainder of that article is to make sure that the general principle will be observed, that the existing rate of remuneration will still be adhered to, but that it will not be increased. Section 7 merely prescribes that the Minister may require employers to keep such records as the Minister thinks fit &mdash;that he will keep a full record of the wages paid to all employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it contemplated that persons employed by the Department of Industry and Commerce will do this work of inspection, or is it the intention to employ other people from outside to do it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is believed that the present inspectors could do this work.  Section 8 prescribes that the power of trade boards to fix, cancel, or vary minimum rates of wages is suspended, but any rates of wages fixed by a trade board which were obligatory immediately before the operative date shall remain in force.  The minima prescribed by the trade boards will still stand as in the case of other remunerations. This article also prescribes <Col N="1384" /> that no rules in relation to the minimum rates of wages or the minimum rates of wages for overtime shall be made by the apprenticeship committee under Section 8 of the Apprenticeship Act, 1931.  But any rules in force immediately before the operative date shall continue in force.  Section 3 of this article sets out that no agreement shall be registered under Section 50 of the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, in the Wages Agreement Register on or after the operative date. Section 4 sets out that no rules shall been made by the Shops Wages Board, under Section 46 or 47 of the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1938, on or after the operative date, but any such rules which are in force immediately before the operative date shall continue in force.  Senators will appreciate that so far as the registration of agreements under Conditions of Employment Act is concerned this article will have little effect.  No rules have been made by the Shops Wages Board, and the number of agreements are definitely very few.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whose fault.  I am merely stating the fact. Article 9 provides that the provisions of the Trades Dispute Act, 1906, shall not apply to any Act done in contemplation or furtherance of a strike which is designed or calculated to cause an employer to contravene Article 6 of the order.  The purpose of that is that you cannot give the protection of the law to an action which is designed to make an employer break the law.  If the Government makes an order which has the force of law it cannot give protection to those who seek to have that law broken.</P>

      <P>If after the coming into operation of this order an employer closed down his business and then opened later paying a lesser rate of wages is there anything in this order to compel him to raise the wages to the original rate or, alternatively, would a trades union be precluded from taking action?

I am prepared to see that these courses are not adopted, but our intention, when the order was being drafted, was that nothing more would be done than to say: We shall have to stand at the level at which everything is at the present date until such time as we can see what steps are necessary to ensure that the sacrifices which will have to be made in the future will be shared equitably as between those in privileged positions <Col N="1387" /> and those not in a position to protect themselves at all.</P>

      <P>As this debate is taking the form of a conversation, may I suggest to the Minister that he should consider the introduction of legislation to take the place of this order in due course.  Nothing done under the order would be invalidated, but the whole matter would be put in proper form by legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>There are objections to that course.  This order is clearly designed to deal with an existing emergency. If we proceed to put through legislation, we have to make it either permanent or temporary.  If it is to be temporary, we have to fix the date at which it will cease to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody knows, as yet, what that date should be.  Again, legislation is not so susceptible to amendment as this order is.  The order deals with a situation which may change from day to day.  If we introduce legislation, we shall have to pin ourselves down to a definite principle.  Everybody will have to accept the principle and we shall then have to consider the details of its application and freeze them in the form of law.  It is open to Senators to say that we could amend that law afterwards by Emergency Order, but it would look a silly thing to put up what purported to be a permanent <Col N="1388" /> structure and then proceed to tear it here and there to make it fit the circumstances of the time.  It is better to proceed the way we have proceeded&mdash;by way of order which is, of its nature, elastic&mdash;and try to meet all the difficulties as they arise when we give practical effect to it.  That is why we have proceeded by way of order instead of by way of legislation.</P>

      <P>I did not suggest that the Minister should do as he proposes to do now.  I should feel guilty and sorry to suggest that he should read out every article of the order.  I suggested that he should tell us the general purpose of the order.  The questions which have been put as regards one portion of the order and the answers which have been given have left our minds fairly clear as to what that portion of the order means. I want to rid the Minister of the misapprehension that I wanted to put him to the labour of reading out the whole of the order.  The portion of the order dealing with dividends is fairly clear.  The purpose I had in mind in intervening has been served and I am grateful to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to support the motion and, in a few words, to request the Minister to withdraw the order, if at all possible.  The first reason is that I feel there is no need for the order.  As a worker who has worked in <Col N="1389" /> every branch and amongst every section of the workers in this city&mdash;the organised workers&mdash;and as one who understands the rural workers also, I feel that they realise their responsibility quite well.  The Government need have no fear that they will do anything drastic.  As Senator Foran has stated correctly, since the war broke out and despite the fact that the cost of living has increased out of bounds, the number of strikes and amount of labour trouble have been very small.</P>
      <P>If the Government were to go to the workers to-morrow and request them to make a sacrifice, even to the extent of giving up some of what they have, I am quite certain that 95 per cent. of them would be prepared to do that in the national interest.  However, they resent the idea of being driven to do something.  The Minister has stated that now is the time when all should stand together.  I am quite sure he is aware of the stand the workers have taken here right through the troubled times of the last 20 years.  At every critical period in this country's history, the workers were always ready to make their sacrifice and to take their stand on the proper side.  One need only visit the suburbs of this city in the evening time to see the stand the workers have taken to-day.  They are in the Local Defence Force and the Local Security Force; after their hard day's work they are prepared to engage in regular drill and do that without reward.  They are prepared to give up their lives, if necessary, for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another reason for requesting the withdrawal of this order.  The very fact that this order is there gives too much of a chance to certain enemies of this country&mdash;enemies of the Government and enemies of the working class &mdash;to make propaganda like this: &ldquo;Is it not too bad?  We were to give you an increase on the 1st June, as we understand the way in which the cost of living has gone up, but the Government has made an order and will not allow us.&rdquo;  There is a bad type who would do that&mdash;those who never gave <Col N="1390" /> anything to the worker but that which was dragged out of them.</P>
    <P>From every point of view, it is a pity that the Government should make this order and I hope that the Minister will see his way to withdraw it. I am glad he has stated that he is prepared to examine it in detail and at least modify it.  I intend to vote for the motion and press for the withdrawal of the order.  I would be more content if there were no question of a vote and if the Minister would give the House an assurance that he would amend the order.</P>
    <P>The workers had to fight hard and make sacrifices for what they have to-day.  It was only after years of sacrifice that they came to their present position here.  They realise now that the fight has been lessened and that the greatest amount of sympathy they have got has come from the present Government.  This order comes now as a shock to the workers and, therefore, I hope that the Minister will withdraw it.</P>

      <P>One hardly can contemplate this motion without a great deal of sympathy for the movers of it.  I am sure we are all agreed that it is moved with the utmost sincerity and out of a belief held by the movers that an effort is being made to dragoon the worker in one way or another.  At the same time, we should not allow our sympathies to screen from us the facts and truth of the situation.  While I, personally, have a good deal of sympathy with the movers of the motion, I can only say that, on balance, I have more sympathy for the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I think they are entitled to a great deal of sympathy, and for these reasons, that these people are in a better position to realise what is involved and what is at stake.  They are in a position better to appreciate the importance and the urgency of this order, and because, further, the unpleasant duty devolves on them to draw up the order and to promulgate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that, other than to express my own conviction that the <Col N="1391" /> order is a proper one and is called for, I have anything more to say that is new.  Some of the points raised already certainly would tend to entice one to digress and proceed to discuss various theories and entice one, maybe, to turn to a review or criticism of others, but I do not think that would be very helpful.  I do not think it is called for.  These discussions might be interesting but, however much one might enjoy them, I do not think this is the place or this is the time for them.</P>
    <P>In this country, as I suppose in every country, the community is made up of various classes.  It is unfortunate that we have to use the word &ldquo;classes,&rdquo; but we have just got to use it because there is no better word available just yet.  The community is made up, as we all know, of the capitalist, the middle-man, the rentier, the worker, the unemployed, and that unfortunate element of the community that has permanently to depend on the State and other institutions for whatever income it enjoys.  Each of these classes is affected by this order, some of them affected directly, some of them indirectly, but each of the classes is affected by the order.  The ultimate object envisaged is the well-being of the whole community.  That is the ultimate object of the order.  It does seem to puzzle some people, or we are led to believe it puzzles them, that the restricting of increases in incomes of both capitalists and workers in the present emergency is in their best interests, but such is the truth.  I agree at once that the effect of the order is to restrict liberty, and the restriction of liberty is against our grain, but restriction of liberty in this instance may well enable us to enjoy later on a greater measure of economic and social freedom than might be possible should we be unwilling to forego some of our liberty to-day.  At the same time, I, for one, am not convinced that the mass of the Irish people, workers and capitalists alike, feel that any great injustice is being perpetrated on them by this order.  People interested in the problems of the workers, people studying social conditions, are quite well <Col N="1392" /> aware how often workers, admitting that they speak as individuals, declare their willingness to forego some of their liberty or some of their freedom if the foregoing of such freedom would lead to greater security.  I admit that in these cases they speak as individuals but, nevertheless, taking a fair number of individuals as statistical samples, one is entitled to come to the conclusion that they represent the mind of the whole, and I am convinced that the workers, left to themselves, do not feel that their freedom is endangered in any way.</P>
    <P>The object of this order, as I understand it, is to prevent hardship due to a possible dislocation of industry and commerce or, at least, its object is to postpone such dislocation for as long as possible.  Anybody watching events and studying these problems will realise that very serious developments are taking place, developments that, whether we like it or not, are going seriously to affect economic conditions in this country.  Our overseas trade is seriously affected.  Income from that trade is contracting.  Income from what investments we have abroad is contracting also.  But the outstanding fact that emerges is this: that supplies of very many commodities, supplies of raw materials, are decreasing in quantity. As a consequence of this, there will be a tendency for prices to rise. Those in employment, especially those people in what may be called utility services, as well as all those who are sufficiently organised or sufficiently strong, will endeavour to counter the rise in prices by demanding increases in their remuneration.</P>
    <P>And this can only lead to one result, a further rise in prices and again a further rise in wages.  Anybody familiar with production accounts, trading accounts or profit and loss accounts of many of our businesses will be familiar with the great importance of the item of wages in these accounts.  Now an increase, an important increase at any rate, in this particular item of wages must be transferred.  The increased cost of production, because that is what I have in mind, must be obtained some way.  There will not be much <Col N="1393" /> chance of getting general economies inside a business, so it will eventually be sought to pass the increased cost of production on to the consumer.  Now this must lead to great economic friction resulting eventually in the inability of the public to purchase the commodities at the prices demanded, the prices that are essential to meet cost of production.  This in turn must mean the slowing down in the demand for industrial services of all kinds, raw materials, capital goods, labour, and so on, with complete loss of employment for many and worsening of conditions for those who are left in employment. As I have said, those people in sheltered positions or those people who, through organisation or otherwise, are able to defend themselves against rise in prices, certainly can do so for a time, but only for a time, and they can do it also only at the expense of the other more or less defenceless members of the community, and it is the purpose of this order to secure firstly the interests of the workers themselves, and secondly of the non-workers, and for that reason especially I welcome the order.  If there were some way of enabling those elements relying on fixed incomes to compete for their share in the pool of commodities things would be all right.  If there is no way of doing that it is obvious that these people are open to suffer grave injustice. Now the preventing of such injustice is the duty of the Government and hence this order.</P>
    <P>I may say in passing that the operation of this order will ensure that certain people will not be allowed to get away with undue profits.  Now in certain quarters there appears to be a certain anxiety to have a definition of the term &ldquo;reasonable profit.&rdquo;  It would be very, very hard to get agreement on this point.  Economics is not an exact science.  It is not an experimental science, and that being so, while there is a very great measure of agreement on many matters, there will be disagreement on some, and on what is a reasonable return on capital there would certainly be very grave differences.  But considering the sheltered position which most industries <Col N="1394" /> have in this country under our industrial revival policy, the amounts that have been fixed in this order are, to my mind, very reasonable and very fair.  Now it is not my intention in fairness to the Cathaoirleach and to the House to discuss individual cases, but, in passing, I might remark that we have heard a good deal in public about the profits in certain industries, bacon curing, milling, shoe making, braid manufacture, and so on.  In some cases returns as high as 25 per cent. have been paid, and people may rightly declare, and I, for one, have no hesitation in declaring, that it would seem that undue rewards have been taken.  Now at the same time I do not for one moment agree that the making of these high profits or of high profits generally implies what is commonly known as profiteering.  As a matter of fact, it is with the utmost pleasure that many of us have been watching the growth in efficiency of management, of technicians and of labour in our industries. This efficiency is what has led to these profits being made.  To me these profits were a barometer, the reading of which gave me the utmost satisfaction.  Given normal conditions, given fair play on the part of labour and capital, I think we can say that it is not impossible in this country to establish a sound industrial arm. To get back to the point, capital is called upon to make its contribution as well as labour.</P>
    <P>There may be cases of hardship.  I should be very surprised myself if some such cases are not revealed, but on the whole reasonable business men, reasonable industrialists, having their own particular interests as well as the interests of the nation at heart, will not allow agitation or propaganda to get the better of their commonsense. Labour may feel uneasy at the possibility of some elements being in a position to profiteer.  I believe certain increases in prices may reasonably be expected, but I do not think that there is much danger of profiteering.  The operation of this order, together with proper vigilance and activity on the part of the Prices Commission, should effectively prevent any tendency in <Col N="1395" /> that unfortunate direction.  At the same time I would say that the Government will be very wise to keep a close eye on developments.  Rationing in this country in regard to foodstuffs can have only very limited importance but, should it appear necessary at all, I certainly hope that expedients such as price-fixing or Government control will be adopted. It is very difficult to say what the future may have in store for us, but I think there is one thing of which we may be sure.  That is, if we can manage to escape the extensive destruction of life and property which is such an appalling feature of this war, more so than of any war that has been fought so far, we should be able to get back to a sense of proportion and values and to develop an economic and social order more in consonance with our national resources and our national genius.  The facts are simply these, that this country can produce flour&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It can produce milk and meat.  Ireland can produce materials for good houses and comfortable hearths.  Ireland can produce good, warm and colourful materials for clothing.  Irish playing fields and the Irish fireside are still capable of giving us good clean recreation and entertainment. A hundred and one things may disappear from the lists of imported articles.  They may even disappear from the lists of commodities produced here.  Our trains may move somewhat more slowly than they move to-day.  Other forms of transport may become rare but, notwithstanding all these things, I for one am far from believing that the change will be disastrous. Granted the will, granted good sense on the part of our people to accept necessary changes, granted a spirit of co-operation, that change in my opinion would be most beneficial. I think it was the Minister for Supplies who told us on one occasion recently that if our economic and social difficulties cannot be solved within the system then he would be prepared to <Col N="1396" /> go outside of it.  For my part I like that approach to our problems.  It gives one hope.  Would to God that our people to-day were sufficiently educated to its importance.</P>

      <P>The last speaker told us that economics was not an exact science.  I have always heard that economics was the dismal science and, certainly listening to the last speaker, I have been convinced beyond all doubt that it is.  I was also interested in what the Minister had to say in the opening part of his remarks, prior to the tea adjournment.  He gave us some of his reasons for the introduction of this order.  Listening to Senator Buckley, my mind went back to the Biblical phrase, that the hands were the hands of Esau, but the voice was the voice of Jacob.  We have listened to Senator Buckley putting forward what, I submit, was a replica of the statement put forward by the Minister.</P>

      <P>He does not live on the South Circular Road.  In both statements we have been given what are supposed to be arguments in favour of this order.  We are told that it is for the purpose of ensuring equality of sacrifice, arising from the lessening amount of raw materials available for industry.  We have been told that unless this lessening amount of raw materials is dealt with in the manner set forth in the order, we shall reach a calamitous state of affairs in this country in the near future.  I cannot accept that.  I consider that that argument is completely fallacious.  If that is the reason for bringing in this order, then why are not these raw materials equitably rationed amongst those who have to use them?  That would ensure equitable distribution and it would obviate this standstill order on wages which anybody who seriously studies the order, must realise will fail and have no effect.  Rationalisation of the cost of industrial raw materials would effect the purpose which we are told lies behind this order.  Furthermore, if with the order there was a collateral <Col N="1397" /> order dealing with the cost of living, by those two methods then, the end desired by the Government might be attained, and there would be no necessity for the order in its present form. Now I think that is the basic argument of the Minister and his economic supporters in this Chamber, and I intend to show within the limited time at my disposal that the attack which the order makes on the workers will have a serious effect both economically and socially in this country.  Besides, I hope to prove that the order is inequitable and harsh in its incidence.</P>
      <P>In studying this order I accidentally came across an historic precedent which might be of some interest to this House to hear because the order&mdash;outside of this precedent&mdash;is probably unprecedented. To find the first precedent for an order of this character limiting wages, we have to go back to the time of Edward III to the edict passed in the year 1349.  In that year a statute for labourers was passed by Edward III stating that he had been advised by his prelates and nobles&mdash; notice it was not the trades unions&mdash; that the workers of that particular time would have to take the same wage as was paid in the twentieth year of his reign, and by that ukase he made a standstill order affecting the workers of that particular time.  The Minister may, or may not, take comfort in the fact that he is in association with such royalty, and has such a royal precedent for his harsh and heinous order, but I doubt if the workers of this country, in this supposedly enlightened and democratic age, will get the same comfort and satisfaction from an order which plunges them back into the savage conditions of the Middle Ages.  Now I think the workers are entitled to more consideration from this Government than they are getting under this Act or this order.  We have had many grandiose promises in regard to conditions, but, strange to relate, instead of having our conditions of employment improved, we find that we get an order of this character, and if Edward III chastised the villeins and serfs of 1349 with whips, it seems our Government intends to chastise us with scorpions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1398" /> Now Governments should be particularly solicitous of the interest of the workers.  They are the poorest and lowest paid section of the community. They are the most defenceless section of the community, and a moral obligation is imposed on every Government to look after the interests of that defenceless section primarily.  That is not done by this order, which affects all alike, as if the interests of all those concerned from wage-earners to coupon-clippers and dividend hunters were the same.  We know they are not.  It is wrong to inflict an order, or in other words to employ a guillotine to deal with the interests of the wage-earners and those other people alike.  Another thing which this order does is this: it interferes radically with the personal contract of service which the wage contract is.  It may be said, in reply, that the State has a right to interfere in all and every matter concerning the citizen, but still there is a sanctity about the contract of service, the rate at which the worker will give his service for the remuneration to be paid for those services, which is different. But here in this order the contract is absolutely abrogated and the worker has no longer a right to vary that contract in an upper direction, and consequently the contract of service is interfered with.  In this matter again we find that the workers of Ireland have from the 7th May been plunged back into the condition in which the English workers found themselves in the 14th century.  Now it is questionable if the Emergency Powers Act gave authority to deal with the matter comprehended by this order, and certainly that Act would have received different attention from us if it were thought that economic matters of this character vitally affecting the livelihood of so many wage-earners would be dealt with in this manner.</P>
    <P>It is no answer to say that sacrifices must be made alike all round.  There is no comparison between wages and salaries and dividends.  In regard to wages, we must remember that they are spent fully on essential commodities to maintain the worker in his daily occupation, and anything which <Col N="1399" /> depresses the standard which he enjoys unquestionably affects his ability to carry on and to work.  The labourer has a wage only, but that is not so in regard to the remuneration taken from industry in the way of dividends or salaries.  Any limitation placed on dividends, or salaries, while it might affect in some minor way some luxury of those enjoying dividends or salaries, does not in the same way affect them as it does the worker because the worker only receives that bare amount which keeps him from week to week as a worker in industry.</P>
    <P>How, then, can it be said that the order makes the sacrifices equal all round?  It does no such thing.  Where this order affects wages, it will seriously affect the health and comfort of the workers, the basic foundations of the community. That will result from the way in which it reacts on the economic conditions of the workers.  To say, therefore, that all must contribute alike in this emergency, which has not been defined&mdash;I asked before tea if &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; would be defined, and it was not&mdash;is, in my opinion, a piece of sophistry.  The employers may forego some luxury.  They may take their car off the road.  They may give up some pastime or pleasure and, in that way, meet the situation.  But the worker cannot give up anything, because everything he receives is essential to his life and to the lives of those dependent upon him.</P>
    <P>One would think, from reading the schedule to the order, that wages were on a majestic and munificent scale in this country and that they could bear this impost.  Wages are not of that high character.  Since mid-September, 1939, through a rapid rise in the cost of living, real wages have been seriously reduced.  Food, as represented by wages, when it becomes limited, brings about the deterioration of which I have already spoken.  Consequently, it has the retroactive effect that the social services are again called upon to a greater degree and taxation and rates must be again increased to <Col N="1400" /> meet the greater call which the low wage-content of industry necessitates.</P>
    <P>The schedule to the order embraces a very large number and a vast variety of workers.  If we take the average wages for 1939, we find that, far from the inflated wages which some people say the workers enjoy, the average was round about 50/-.  It was not 60/-, 65/- or 70/-, as some people would lead us to believe.  The cost of living since mid-September, 1939, has gone up by 26 per cent., and, to that extent, real wages have deteriorated. It is real wages with which we are concerned, and not nominal wages.  As Senator Foran said here this evening, it does not matter whether workers are paid £10 or £1, it is the amount of commodities the wage is capable of bringing into the home that is important. The operation of the cost-of-living figure has considerably reduced nominal wages.  On analysis, you will find that real wages to-day, as a result of that, are on an average nearly 40/-. Certain increases have been secured in some industries, which increases must be added to that figure.  These increases are not as large as the Minister indicated, both in the Dáil and here this evening.  In his statement in the Dáil, which he repeated here this evening, he said that wages had been increased by 9/-, 12/- and 13/-.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Wages may have been increased in some cases by these figures, but the number of them is small.  While it is difficult to give a correct assessment of increases-I am drawing somewhat from my own experience in saying this&mdash;it will not be inaccurate to say that, instead of wage increases being 9/-, 12/- or 13/-, they would be nearer 5/- and 6/-, and that only in a limited number of occupations.  Quite a large section of workers have not received any increase whatsoever in their remuneration to meet the increased cost of living.  I can leave to the imagination of the House the effect of that steep and stupendous rise in the cost of living where it operates on wages which have not been increased or which have been increased only by 5/- or 6/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another case of hardship <Col N="1401" /> under this order.  I refer to some new factories established in recent years. The employees, in order to get over initial difficulties, agreed to work at a lesser rate of wages than that at which they would work if these initial difficulties did not exist.  Some of these factories have now got on their feet, or are about to get on their feet, and will be able henceforth to run economically. Under this standstill order, the workers in these factories will not now be able to secure any increase in their wages although they have shown great consideration in that they refrained from asking for a standard rate in these industries during their growing and formative period.  That is one grave inequality caused by this order. Perhaps the Minister did not consider the existence of such factories when he was making the order.  If he inquires into the wages paid in some of these industries, I think he will find that they have been low because the workers desired to afford the factories time during which they could get on their feet.  The employees of these factories will be severely and harshly dealt with and, to that extent, the order is unfair and inequitable in its incidence.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the order from the other side.  Under the order, dividends can be paid at the rate of 6 per cent. by such a factory over a period of three years where dividends have not yet been paid.  The equality of sacrifice does not seem to operate there.  Let us take one glaring and outstanding case of a similar character&mdash;that is, the case of the railways in this country. We all know the economic conditions through which the railways have passed in the course of the past few years.  We all know that the railwaymen have been particularly solicitous for the interests of those railways and desirous of keeping them operating.  We know that they have forgone large amounts in wages in that effort.  The figures which I am about to quote will give some idea of the sacrifice which railwaymen have made since 1921 to sustain the railways now to be affected by this order.  In 1921, the peak rate for porters was 66/6.  Then, by the process of reduction, this was lowered <Col N="1402" /> to 49/-, a difference of 17/6 per week. That affected no less than 8,000 workers on the railways here.  Taking this reduction from the year 1921 to the current year, railwaymen have contributed over £7,000,000 towards the continuation of the railway system.</P>
    <P>Since then, the Irish Railway Wages Board was formed.  We know the function of that board and what it endeavoured to do.  In 1926, cuts were employed to reduce the wages of certain of the lesser paid categories by from 4/- to 6/3 per week, and these still operate and have amounted to £2,000,000.  The reductions granted by the board, which terminated last year, would equal £500,000.  The recent increases granted&mdash;2/6 to the G.S.R. employees and 5/- to the G.N.R. employees&mdash;would correctly be described as part of the operation of the cuts.  Taking the G.S.R. employees, the 2/6 increase leaves a number of men in Dublin with a rate of 41/- and in other parts of the country at 36/6.  This compares very unfavourably with the conditions enjoyed by the directors, despite the &ldquo;equality of sacrifice&rdquo;.  It would amaze anybody to learn what the directors are paid in comparison to the ordinary railwaymen.  Furthermore, despite the huge remuneration received by the railway director&mdash;I understand it is a sum of about £18 per week&mdash; they also, since 1938, have secured an increase of 29/-, where the average railwayman has secured 2/6 per week.</P>
    <P>One would hardly feel that Order 83 is seriously intended to apply to these grades of railwaymen, whose sacrifices amounted to £7,000,000 and in respect of whom there is a claim for an increase of 7/6 which, if granted in full, would amount to £180,000, leaving a very large margin still unrestored. Further, while the companies have refused&mdash;as apparently they have done&mdash;a demand for 7/6, that demand was pending before the Railway Wages Board; but the board is now inhibited from dealing with it.  There again, as in the case of the new factories, the workers who were anxious to meet the railway companies and to sustain the railways, and who over a long period of time contributed this large sum of money out of their wages to that end, <Col N="1403" /> are now, when the railways are making a little money, stopped from receiving any portion of that increased revenue. Surely there is a gross injustice to the workers in these particular industries and occupations.</P>
    <P>Again, there is the case of other railway companies whose headquarters are in England.  They have agreed to wage increases for their employes in that country, which automatically would pass to their employees in this country but, under the operation of this order, these companies cannot now pay those increases.  I trust the Minister will take serious notice of these anomalies&mdash;as, unquestionably, they are anomalies.  He said this evening that he has power to withdraw or amend the order.  Perhaps he would look into the matter in the light of the facts I have just given.  The low wages content would be affected by the increase in the cost of living and, as time goes on, that wages position is bound to be adversely affected by this order.</P>
    <P>I would like to give the House a slight idea of what is considered a satisfactory dietary for certain grades of persons, such as the inmates and staff of certain poor law institutions, and also the amount necessary to maintain a soldier.  Comparing the two, it will be seen to what extent the wages of the industrial worker fall below the necessary minimum and how he and his dependents are physically prejudiced by that.  In the Dáil report of the 23rd April, 1941, the cost of maintaining a soldier was given as about 10/- per week.  This figure is based on wholesale buying, which the ordinary worker cannot avail of. The cost of maintaining inmates and staff of the Dublin Union was 6/9¾. We may take, as a moderate estimate between these figures, 7/- per adult. If we take an average family of two adults and three children and allow 7/- for the adults and, say, 6/- for the children, we will find, on the basis of the dietary I have mentioned, that 32/- a week is required as the minimum&mdash; bought at wholesale prices&mdash;to maintain this type of family.  We must add something to that for clothes, light, rent, fuel and sundries.  If we add a <Col N="1404" /> figure of 24/-, I do not think it would be over-munificent to that family.  Thus we get a figure of 56/- per week to meet the maintenance cost of that particular family.  When the wages are below that figure the health of the industrial workers is bound to be affected.</P>
    <P>The <i>Trade Journal</i> for March gives some statistical information in regard to the persons engaged in certain industries, including transport, food, textiles, etc.  These relate to 1939. There have been advances in the cases which I have instanced&mdash;probably about an average of 5/- or 6/- per week.</P>
    <P>What do we find?  We find that in the manufacturing industries, employing 100,000 persons, men and women, the average earnings per week, when employed, amounted for men to 59/4, and for women to 31/6.  But more significantly in connection with this order, over 52 per cent. of the men's wages when employed were 60/- per week, 38 per cent. were below 50/- per week, 24 per cent. were below 40/- per week, and 11 per cent. below 30/- per week.  Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that all those people have had the advance I have spoken of, from 1929, say, of 6/- per week, and we find that 38 per cent of our employed workers are in receipt, when working, of less than sufficient to provide for a family on a scale shown to be necessary to maintain them on a healthy subsistence level.  Surely that is an argument, and a serious argument, against the operation of this order.  When you consider that the amount spent on clothes, rent, light and fuel are fixed expenses, the only adjustment that can be made is on the other side, namely on the food side.</P>
    <P>We were told that the cost of commodities was rising and that it was due to that rising cost&mdash;I understand it is called the spiral&mdash;that this order has been made necessary.  But is it not a fact that very largely the increase in the cost of living, in relation to these commodities, has occurred outside of this country and consequently the costs affected, or which can be affected, in this country are small in comparison? Therefore, the order, which is restricted to the jurisdiction of this <Col N="1405" /> country, cannot seriously affect the rising cost of commodities and, consequently would not have the effect which the Government intends that it should have.  In England, instead of the English Government following the precedent of the Statute of Labourers of Edward III, which, I think, they had a greater right to do than we have, they set up a tribunal to deal with wages demands from day to day and wages demands are being heard and adjudicated before that tribunal day in and day out.  Surely that would be a far more sensible way of dealing with the issue than bringing along a standstill guillotine measure such as we have here in this order.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the position of the workers is going to be much more seriously menaced in the future because we have been told that with the declining quantity of raw materials and the rationing of raw materials, it would be necessary to work short time or rotational schemes of employment. These schemes of employment are bound to cause a further deterioration in the economic life and condition of the worker.  I think we can only face with alarm the position in this country in the approaching winter when the worker is prohibited from adjusting his wages within industry.  I think also that limited wage expenditure is bound to affect very seriously that element of the community that depends on the expenditure of wages for its existence, namely, the shopkeeping community. Again, that in turn is bound to affect the economic position of the farmers who have agricultural goods to sell, but who cannot sell those goods when the wages content has gone down.</P>
    <P>All those reasons are, in our opinion, sufficient to cause the Minister serious pause, to think seriously over this order.  He has heard it analysed and, I presume will hear it further analysed in this House this evening from various standpoints.  I trust that, having heard the debate here this evening, and probably seeing the difficulties of the situation which were not obvious to him before, he will withdraw or annul this order.  I make a very serious appeal to the Senators present here this evening, of all Parties, and especially those of other Parties who <Col N="1406" /> have a labour interest in this House, as we have, that they have a duty to the people they represent to see that this order is annulled.  It is harsh and unfair and inequitable.  It will not do what it purports to do, and it would be the greatest wisdom if it were annulled or withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">

      <P>Senator Lynch, speaking from the Labour Benches, said, after Senator Liam O Buachalla had spoken, that the professional economists were somewhat dreary.  I do not know whether the Trades Union Congress economists are anything more cheerful than the professional university economists.  By my rearing and associations, my natural sympathies are with labour, and when I read the order I did not like it. When I heard the Minister this evening I liked the order still less because he revealed to me that the order, in certain respects, was worse than I originally thought it was.  But if I have to listen to another speech like Senator Lynch's, I will certainly go into the Lobby with the Minister, or any Lobby, to assert my disgust with the complete failure of that particular Labour speech to face up to any of the problems we have to deal with now. This solution of the Minister's may not be the right solution, but Senator Lynch did not give us any notion at all.  He said that the order would be analysed this evening.  He did not analyse it.  He did not take any step at all towards analysing it, and one wonders whether he has given any consideration to the making of anything but the kind of speech we usually hear, which can be used in support of everything from the Labour Benches, no matter what it is, and which shows no variation.  It does not show much grasp of the problem to be solved. When Senator Lynch was talking about the 14th century, I wondered why he did not tell us when Edward III's order about labour was annulled and whether he really believes that the workers were subjected to savagery in the Middle Ages, as contrasted with their magnificent treatment, let us say, in the 19th century or during the industrial revolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, on this particular order, <Col N="1407" /> when I got it, the first thing that struck me about it was that there were parts of it with which I could agree and other parts with which I could not agree; that it was a very difficult thing to understand and that it would be more satisfactory if it had been introduced as a Bill.  I think the Minister's argument, that it could not have been a Bill because it had to be temporary is completely answered by any Parliamentary experience we have since 1922 and, indeed, by all Parliamentary experience.</P>
    <P>There is nothing to prevent the Minister from bringing in a Bill and making it temporary, but certainly I think the Minister's own knowledge of this order has been improved by his attempt to go through it and explain its provisions as on a Committee Stage. There is no doubt that, instead of making this order and laying it on the Table of the House to come into operation within 21 days, some effort might have been made to get the opinion of both Houses and see whether we could get some agreement about it.  We discovered from the Minister's explanation to-day that this order was made under the Emergency Powers Act, 1939.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is clear on the face of this order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is, but what I was coming to was this: in this order the Minister can make other orders, and he can make these other orders to any extent he pleases, and it has to be ascertained whether the other order would be subject to discussion in this House or in the Dáil.  I want to put it to the Minister that this is not so.  This order is submitted to this House under Section 9 of the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, which says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every Emergency Order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made&rdquo;,</P>
      <P>and that if an annulling resolution is not passed within 21 days it shall have the force of law.  Section 10 says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...every Emergency Order and every instrument made, granted, or <Col N="1408" /> issued, or direction under an Emergency Order shall have the force of law&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>so that it appears to me that the Minister can proceed to make any order he pleases, bring under its application any class of employment, and that it will not only have the force of law, but it will be removed from any form of Parliamentary debate.  I do not know whether that is the position, but I suggest that it is a very wrong position that the Minister should have that power.  When this Act was being passed, I think I commented upon it and said that I did not want this particular Act, which was given to the Government in the small hours of a Sunday morning, if it was to be used against labour, and I do not give to labour the absurdly narrow meaning that my friend Senator Lynch gave it. It is now being used to regulate labour, but this order apparently gives power to make endless other orders which are not to be subject to discussion.  That is one thing which seems to me to be undoubtedly wrong.  There is another question: I wonder can the Minister do anything to remedy that position by inserting a proviso&mdash;he probably can&mdash; that any order adding to the schedule must be laid on the Table of both Houses of the Oireachtas, and if not annulled in 21 days to have full force of law.  He probably could do that, but it is not my function to tell the Minister how he can get out of a legal difficulty. That is a consideration of the method.  Now, there are two parts in the order; it deals with wages, not as the Minister says, to effect a standstill in wages, but to ensure that wages cannot rise.  There is a very definite danger that they may fall, because with our economic position and our overseas trade declining, it may very well be that people may be afraid of unemployment and be willing to accept a smaller wage rather than lose their jobs.  I know that, from a trades union point of view, the trades union leader is more interested in the man who is working than the man who is idle.</P>

      <P>Question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what I am talking about.  I think the trades union <Col N="1409" /> leader is more interested in the man who is working than the man who is idle but as a matter of cold fact anybody who has lived in a working-class house knows that a man who has a constant job, who is sure of his job at a particular wage is in a much better position than the man who has a supposedly high wage, but is not sure of his job.  For instance take the difference between the man who has a constant job in the engineering branch and a man who has a high wage per hour in the building trade.  It is an unreal wage and is not as good in fact. Now there are in abstract economics, Sir, very good reasons for standstills in wages and dividends but the dividend part of this order is not very necessary.  The Minister, I am sure, understands the matter and he will correct me if I am wrong, but it seems to me that the provisions of the Budget make the dividends part of this order pretty well unnecessary.  Even the dividends part of it does not seem to be very well thought out because for some businesses any one is aware that 6 per cent. is small but for certain industries it might be very big.  We can all imagine the case of people who, by hard work and efficiency, had been creeping up from dividends of 2 per cent., 3 per cent. and 4 per cent., and now they find they cannot go beyond 6 per cent.  I think that might be very unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept, and I do not think the House accepts, the division of the world into two classes, the people who work for their wages and the people who live on dividends and salaries and spend them on luxuries.  Surely, we have progressed far enough to make such a division an absurdity as if we did not know that working people ever spent anything on the pictures and the racecourse. That is an absurd division, and we all know that it is absurd.  The defence for the wages part of this order is that it is a way of preventing the cost of living rising, for if wages go up the cost of living goes up.  Workers who are well organised, and who, because they are well organised, are comparatively well paid, will do better than any other class.  The cost of living will rise with disastrous results to our trade <Col N="1410" /> and our currency and to unemployment and the very badly paid and unorganised workers will suffer.  There is a case in the abstract, therefore, for preventing the rise in wages and in the cost of living, but I want to say that the position must be considered equitably and justly from the point of view of the people of all kinds.  The Minister phrases it that everybody must stand fast; that everybody should stand together. There is not much use of a man with £1,000 a year telling the messengers with £2 5s. a week or 35/- a week: &ldquo;Listen, boys, we will have to stand together,&rdquo; unless he is going to do something to share with them.  I can understand very well that the well-paid people should not be allowed to take the community by the throat and say: &ldquo;We want more, we don't care who gets less,&rdquo; but, at the same time, when you talk glibly about standing fast you must have some advertence to the people you are addressing.</P>
    <P>Now, as has just been pointed out, the cost of living here has risen from the beginning of the war only one point less than in England.  From the beginning of the war to mid-February, it had risen by 27 points in England and by 26 points here.  The most remarkable thing about the figures is that the rise in the cost of food in England has been 24 points and the rise in the cost of food in Eire has been exactly the same.  The rise in the cost of clothing is much less here than in Great Britain, but taking food, clothing, fuel, light, rent and sundries, the two totals were practically identical.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that because food has been subsidised in England?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just coming to that.  Probably it is.  The total figures are 27 points in England and 26 points here.  The objectionable feature of this order is that it is introduced in May, 1941, more than a year and a half after the war began and that it practically stands alone.  The Government, in this matter as in other matters, have pursued a policy of doing nothing at all about certain problems and then suddenly, getting into a great panic, they believe that by putting an order <Col N="1411" /> into operation, they have done something to solve the problem.  I want to suggest that this, done by itself and done at this stage, is not going to be effective.  In England the Chancellor of the Exchequer gave a promise in the Budget that he would keep the cost of living down to its present figure, that he would keep it between 125 and 130, that is 25 or 30 points more than before the present war began.  As well as that, he is subsidising essential commodities. There is also in operation there a very drastic system of rationing. Here we have not got a system of rationing, except in so far as the lowly-paid purchaser is rationed by his inability to purchase.  We have no subsidy either for essential commodities.</P>
      <P>It will be remembered that, speaking in this House to a motion in my name asking for the preparation of a general register of consumers, I said that we should have rationing of essential commodities and that, accompanying that, we should subsidise certain essential commodities so that persons in the lowest wage categories would be sure of getting at least some share of them. At present, they do not get any share of them at all sometimes.  I know that the cost of living in this country in certain matters is entirely outside the power of the Government to control, but the increase in certain items which go to make up the cost of living is due to Government action long before the war.  If vigorous steps had been taken to control the cost of living I have no doubt that it would not have gone as high as it has gone in this country.  If it is impossible to prevent a rise, then, at any rate, there should be a subsidising of essential foodstuffs for people who are in receipt of very low wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point that has to be remembered is that in England the question of family allowances is being considered. I do not know if these things have been considered here but, in the circumstances in which we are placed here, we know that the people who are the worst paid are generally those who have the largest families and they are the most valuable people in the country from the point of view of the survival <Col N="1412" /> of the country.  There certainly would appear to be a very good case for the introduction of family allowances in this State.  Nothing has been done in that direction.  What has been done is that this order has been introduced in a very drastic but not in a very carefully-considered manner.  As regards family allowances, it must be remembered that they have been already recognised in the income-tax code.  The income-tax law recognises, not sufficiently adequately perhaps, that the income-tax payer is entitled to certain relief in respect of his family, that he should get a certain remission in respect of members of his family under 16 years of age who are dependent upon him or over 16 years of age if they are still being educated.  Similarly unemployment assistance benefits recognise family allowances and so does the system of unemployment insurance. Therefore the principle has been recognised. It would be valuable at present to enable people to feel that, when they were being asked to stand together, at any rate they were being thought of and that steps were being taken to keep them from starving.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas on one occasion here proposed a tribunal&mdash;I do not know if the Labour Party were very enthusiastic about it&mdash;to which labour disputes might be referred.  If such a tribunal were in existence, it might be possible in this order to say that no applications for wage increases would be considered from people above a certain level, but that applications from people under that level could be made to that tribunal.  That might be feasible, but the order as it stands seems to me to be bad because of its form, because it gives a power to the Minister which I think nobody ever contemplated when the Emergency Powers Act was passed, and passed unanimously, as far as I remember.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I am mistaken in that, but it was passed by a big majority.  Certainly, when I was voting for that measure in that particular emergency I made the reservation that it would not be used for an <Col N="1413" /> action of this kind.  The power which the Minister seems to enjoy under this order is something which nobody contemplated at that time.  The order itself is very unsatisfactory in the absence of other measures which might be taken before it or concomitantly with it.  I do not share the view for a moment that the Minister is a monster, or that he is out to menace the workers.  I do not think that is so at all.  I think the Minister is making a well-meant, but not a well thought-out or very successful, effort to accomplish a particular economic state of affairs which would certainly inflict injustice on a large class of workers.  It is not only manual workers that are affected; there is a very considerable number of people, very poorly paid, who are not organised in labour unions at all, whose positions and whose wages are in a very precarious position.</P>
      <P>What I am afraid of is that the order aims at preventing something which in any event will not happen.  I do not know what kind of person in this country at present is in such a flourishing position that he could contemplate an increase in the wages of his employees. We know that in England the position is quite different, because an immense amount of money, £10,000,000 a day, is being spent on war expenditure. Here we are in a very lamentable position&mdash;this is an argument for the Minister.  Remember, during the last war we made plenty of money.  In the last war we succeeded in being on both sides and in making a good deal of money.  This time we have an organised State and we have declared our neutrality but, although we are not making anything out of the war, we have incurred a great deal of expenditure as if we were in it.  That expenditure has had to be incurred in a country which has not a corresponding rise in production.  The resulting hardship presses very severely upon people who have very low wages.  It seems to me that the most important consideration at the moment is how to keep them in their employment at present wages.  There is little hope of being able to get them more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Actually Senator Lynch did not suggest <Col N="1414" /> how their situation could be materially improved except by direct State subsidy, because, if it could not be improved in normal conditions&mdash;in times of peace&mdash;it is very difficult to see how it could be improved under present conditions.  There should be, I think, some advertence to the position of the lowest paid workers, those people who have been referred to as the defenceless members of our community, the people who are not organised and are not particularly vocal. Whether they are vocal or not, they are citizens of this State, and if they are oppressed by an order which they feel throttles them it will have a bad effect.  The order, I suggest, is bad and will not effect its object unless other steps are taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I think every member of the Oireachtas, every member of this Seanad, is slow to hamper the Government in any steps they think proper to deal with the present difficult situation.  Certainly it is with considerable hesitation that I criticise the order now before us because we are slow to do anything which might make matters more difficult for the Government. When we passed the emergency legislation we gave the Government very effective and far-reaching powers but it is our duty to keep a close scrutiny on the orders issued by Ministers which are subject to annulment by this House.  It is specially our duty when the Government has been given these powers, as Senator Hayes reminded us, by a large majority in both this and the other House.  I think we ought to contemplate&mdash;that we ought to ask ourselves and the Government&mdash; whether such an order as this really falls within the ambit of the powers which we gave them some months ago. I cannot see myself that, in any way, this order justifies itself under the powers given by that Act.  The Minister has given reasons why he does not think it wise to deal with the matter set out in this order by means of the Bill.  I do not think any member of the House was convinced by the claims he made.  He said that there was an obvious advantage in having an order, because all the matters contained in it <Col N="1415" /> could be covered by one debate and he would not be hampered in having to deal with the matter clause by clause.  I do not agree.</P>
      <P>It would be better if we were able to deal with this clause by clause, and able to move amendments as to a Bill. Amendments have an influence on the mind of a reasonable Minister, and he might see points in amendments that he could not see in a general debate like this.  I think a measure such as this is eminently one which should be considered in the form of a Bill, and not as an order.  Actually the order is in operation before this House could consider whether it should be annulled or not.  I have heard no reason whatever that if this policy of legislation by order is to be adopted in a case like this it should not be adopted generally in both Houses.  Where you have legislation by a Bill you have amendments and the matter is subject to reconsideration by the Minister. Justifying this procedure the Minister said that it was more elastic in the form of an order than in a Bill.  On that argument he could justify suspending practically all legislation while the Emergency Powers Act is in force, and having the whole law of the country for the time being established by order.</P>
      <P>Certainly the particular policy embodied in this order seems to me to deserve greater consideration than can be given to it by a debate of this kind. It definitely establishes a new principle of direct interference by the Minister in existing contracts between different groups of citizens in the country; between the employers and the employed.  In one clause it definitely authorises the employer to break a contract. That is the extraordinary clause in the order, which gives permission to the employer to break a bargain he has made to pay income-tax or portion of it.  This clause 6 (4) says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an employer, in accordance with a contract of employment or established practice pays the income-tax chargeable on the remuneration of an employee and the standard rate of income-tax for any income-tax <Col N="1416" /> year ending on or after the 5th day of April, 1942 exceeds the standard rate for the income-tax year ended 5th day of April, 1941, then, notwithstanding such contract or practice the said employer shall not pay for the said employee in respect of income-tax chargeable for any future year on the remuneration of the said employee any greater sum than the sum he would have paid if the standard rate of income-tax for such future year had been that in force for the year 1940-41.</P>
    <P>Under that clause the Minister takes the right to himself to interfere with existing contracts between groups of citizens.  Even in a Bill powers of that kind would require great consideration, but here it is enforced in an order before either House has had an opportunity of considering it at all.</P>
    <P>We all sympathise with what the Minister states is his main object or the main object of the Government. That is the intention to keep down prices.  We all admit that if wages soar prices are likely to soar too, and that a vicious circle, or the vicious spiral to use a phrase heard on several occasions here, begins.  But there are two sides to this question.  The Minister proposes to act very radically with regard to keeping down wages, but one is entitled to ask if anything effective has been done to control prices.  So far as we know the machinery in operation to control prices here is very ineffective, and gives little security to the ordinary purchaser so far as the price of any of the commodities necessary for maintaining himself and his family is concerned. There is little control over the price of those commodities necessary to give what the Taoiseach has called frugal comfort.  Until the Government are able to put forward some scheme by which we can hope effective control of prices will be established, I do not think they should put forward this order to control wages.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred several times to the general principles of the order. The only time he stated a general principle was at the beginning when he suggested that the principle of the order, or the main intention of the <Col N="1417" /> order,&rdquo; was that &ldquo;remuneration would stand at its present level.&rdquo;  He was challenged on that and it was pointed out that while the order prevents a rise in wages there was nothing in it to preserve wages at their present level. Therefore the statement that that was the intention of the order has not been supported by the text of the order itself.  I cannot believe that those who drafted the order got instructions to produce an order which would keep remuneration standing at its present level and did not embody that in the text of the order.  The order before us seems to be directed to ensuring that wages would not rise above their present level. When the Minister was challenged&mdash; by Senator Foran, I think&mdash;about the order keeping wages at their present level he avoided repeating the phrase, and I hope has abandoned a phrase that was quoted so glibly in that way, just as the term &ldquo;standstill order&rdquo; had been loosely used.</P>
    <P>It is not a standstill order; it is a no-progress order, which is a very different thing.  It does not prevent recession from the present position, but it does prevent progress.  In my opinion, this matter is not one which should come before the House in the shape of an order.  It should not be dependent on the activity of any member of the House or any Party in the House to have attention drawn to points in the order.</P>
    <P>That leads me to make one further remark with reference not only to this order but to the many other orders which are placed on the Table of the House.  It would be a great help to the House if some machinery were adopted as a regular part of its procedure for considering the several orders made by Ministers and placed on the Table of the House. At present, it depends on the industry and activity of some members whether or not the attention of the House is called to an order which is something more than a mere bit of administrative machinery.  Some members of the House will remember that, a few years ago, when a Government commission sat for a few months to consider the formation of a Seanad, at a time when <Col N="1418" /> there was no Seanad in existence, and the duties which that Seanad should perform, several members of the commission were anxious that the Seanad should undertake this special duty of watching Ministerial orders and drawing the attention of the House to anything they thought worthy of special discussion.  I cannot remember at the moment whether a recommendation to that effect was made in any of the reports of that commission.  At any rate, some members thought that the Seanad should make that an addition to its ordinary working machinery.  I am not convinced that this measure deserves the acquiescence of the Seanad and, therefore, I support the resolution proposed by Senator Foran.</P>

      <P>One of the main reasons why the last proposal made by Senator Rowlette has never met with very much support is because you can only talk about the orders and cannot amend them.  So far as a minority is concerned, they cannot defeat them. Therefore, the enthusiasm for talking on something which cannot be cured is diminished.  Even if the Minister were persuaded, he would have to withdraw the order and introduce a new one.</P>
      <P>It would take a great deal to persuade him to do that, though I agree that it might sometimes happen.  That is one of the reasons why a matter such as that included in this order should not be done by means of Ministerial Order.  The strange thing is that the Act which gave the Minister power to do this is a temporary Act.  It remains in force only for the period of the emergency.  Although the Minister can do this under the Act, he says that he would find it quite impossible and impracticable to introduce this as a temporary Act for the same length as the Act which enables him to do it by order.  I suggest that that is absurd and that it should be perfectly practicable to introduce a step of this kind by means of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So long as we are working under our present system&mdash;that is to say a system under which the Minister, with a certain number of civil servants and no consultative council to advise him, acts&mdash;I think it is most unsatisfactory <Col N="1419" /> to deal with controversial and difficult matters by means of orders which cannot be amended.  If you had a properly-constituted economic council, a good deal might be said for dealing with a matter of this kind by order, because it could be examined and amended before it was actually issued.  Then, Parliament might only deal with the principle.  In this case, all the guidance the Minister can get is from civil servants.  Estimable and hard-working as most of them are, only one or two of them will have had practical experience of working a business.  Consequently, with the best will in the world, they cannot see the snags which are very often found in Bills when discussed in the Dáil or in this House.  That is one reason why I do not like this order.  That is one reason why I shall be personally compelled to support this motion, although there are certain things in the order I like.  There are, of course, certain things I dislike, too.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Minister was merely guessing when he made a certain remark here about these orders. I looked up the matter since then.  The Minister cannot himself make an order under the Emergency Powers Act.  It must be made by the whole Government and it must be signed by the Taoiseach.  This order purports to give the Minister power to amend it.  He can amend it by taking out certain industries or adding to them or in a number of other ways.  There is no provision in the order or in the Emergency Powers Act whereby it would be open to Senator Foran to propose to annul the further order made by the Minister under this order.</P>
    <P>Orders made under the Emergency Powers Act have the same effect as Acts of Parliament.  They are not simple administrative orders.  They are the law of the country and many of them are drawn up, as this is, in the form of an Act of Parliament.  They are interpreted in the courts as Acts of Parliament.  It is no use for Senator Hayes, though I agree with him, saying that we never visualised legislation of this kind being enacted under the <Col N="1420" /> Emergency Powers Act.  I am sure what he says is true, but the fact is we were all in a hurry.  We were facing what looked like a very grave emergency, with the possibility of war, no matter what steps we took.  It seems to me that we did not take adequate steps to secure that only matters necessary for the safeguarding of the country in the emergency were to be given effect to in this way.  We gave almost <i>carte blanche</i> to the Government and we may as well face that fact.  We must either vote for the rejection of this order or vote for it.  I cannot vote for a measure of this kind, dealing with industry and labour, which gives the Minister <i>carte blanche.</i>  A provision should have been introduced in the order that any subsequent orders made by the Minister would be laid on the Table of the House and that they could be annulled within 21 days.  There is no provision for their being laid on the Table and there is no provision for their being annulled.</P>
    <P>The debate to a large extent has seemed to be unreal.  Circumstances have forced me to spend a very large portion of my time in the last two or three months, not only in the business in which I am occupied but in industries with which I have no personal connection, trying to arrange co-operation for the purpose of getting supplies.  There may be a few exceptions, but the problem will not be the danger of increased wages but of how to carry on at all and pay anything approaching a respectable wage. Here we are at this stage introducing what seems to be a standstill order.  I agree with Senator Rowlette's criticism that, strictly speaking, it is not a standstill order at all.  The real problem is how to keep employment going on.  For all practical purposes, this is only a pious Resolution.  It is far too late to be effective as regards the cost of living.  The very fact that it is far too late explains the fact that it will be of necessity unjust.</P>
    <P>I cannot see&mdash;and I have never been able to see&mdash;that you can take a man with a family and a wage of 50/- a week and tell him that he cannot have any increase, that he must stay where he is no <Col N="1421" /> matter how the cost of living changes. It is perfectly possible to say that when a man gets £6, £7 or £10 a week or £1,000 a year.  He has something which he can cut without danger to the community.  When you come to the minimum level, you cannot cut without danger to the State and to the people as a whole.  Right from the beginning, when meeting employers and others, I have maintained that while we must resist in the general public interest any increases in wages or in dividends, there is a point where you cannot afford to do it, and where there is to be an increase on the basis of the cost of living there must be a limit, and the increases must be restricted to those below a certain wage.</P>
    <P>I am trying to look at this matter, not from the labour or the employers' point of view but from a wider point of view.  There have been increases in a number of cases and where these have occurred the Minister is allowing it to continue.  As long as this order stands and the emergency continues, it will be impossible for those on a low wage &mdash;one which cannot be cut without reaching starvation level&mdash;to receive any increase and no one will be able to find a remedy, even with the best will in the world.  Some trade unions and some industries were too ready to give general increases all round.  It is a pity that, if the Minister intended to take steps on those lines, he did not take them a year ago.</P>
    <P>It is no use producing an order simply as a foot rule that applies to everything.  This places in exactly the same position the person working on an absolute minimum and the person in receipt of a good wage.  It provides that an industry paying a very high standard of dividends can go on paying them if it is able to do it&mdash; though I think that the Minister's successor in the Department of Finance has probably taken steps to make that almost impossible.  An industry or trade paying a very low dividend&mdash;say 2½ or 3 per cent.&mdash;will be allowed to pay up to six.  But the person with a wage on a low standard will not be allowed to get an increase.  When <Col N="1422" /> this is found out, it will not help us on the employers' side or those on the workers' side.  It seems to me that it is foolish to set down the same standard for all.  If you put your capital in a well-established company, which has been in existence for a considerable time and which has big reserves, and you get 5 per cent. on it, probably you are doing extremely well. If you put your money into a mine&mdash;as an industrialist put it to me a few days ago&mdash;which is a gamble, probably you get nothing for several years and 6 per cent. would not be reasonable even then.  The capital has been risked and it might have been lost.  By this order the Government is trying to apply the one rule all round, and I do not believe it will be satisfactory from the point of view of the employer or of labour.</P>
    <P>Most industries will find it hard enough to carry on and, from that point of view, I do not think any of them care very much what is in this order. As Senator Rowlette, I think, pointed out, this is not a standstill order.  There will be reductions, of course.  Does anyone imagine that all the directors' fees payable last year will be possible this year?  Of course not.  The Minister could not have provided a standstill order that should apply both ways: that would not have been possible.  This is a bad way of trying to deal with directors' fees.  It would have been perfectly reasonable if the Minister said that no company should pay a larger sum in directors' fees than it paid in the previous period.  Let us take a case in point.  Supposing a managing director dies and one of the other directors who may be paid £100 per annum is proposed to take his place, that would not be possible under this order unless he is willing to work for £100 per year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is a case where there is a practice of a standard increase per annum, that is definitely provided for.  If a managing director has an agreement by which he is to get a percentage of profit, that agreement would stand.  As far as I can understand the order, no agreements are interfered with except those in two classes&mdash;one which provides for an increase based on the standard of living, which may vary, and the other where there is an agreement for the payment of salary less income-tax. Both those are now cancelled.  As far as these are concerned, I do not wish to be taken as disagreeing with them.</P>
      <P>I would like to make it clear that I am not opposed to reasonable and proper steps taken to prevent increased wages at the present time, except for those people who are on a very low standard, one which cannot go on without danger.  I am in favour of a limitation of dividends.  I think it is almost criminal that any industry, at the present moment and in the light of present dangers, should pay more than a reasonable amount in dividends. As much as possible should be kept in reserve and made available to try to maintain the industry.  I am not at all satisfied that the same rule should apply to all industries alike.  Equally, I am not satisfied that the same rule should be applied in the case of all workers.</P>
      <P>I notice paragraph (3) of Article 5 provides that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A person who is a director of a company, whether he is or is not employed by that company in any other capacity, shall be deemed for the purposes of this article not to be employed by that company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is that paragraph which makes me believe that a managing director who gives all his time is not an employee of the company.  If he is not an employee he is presumably only a director. Therefore, he is governed solely by the sections that apply to directors.  However, I do not think that point is of much importance, for the simple reason that managing directors will have to cease to be managing directors and be called managers.  I think that is bad, because the larger proportion of them <Col N="1424" /> should be directors.  The old system under which large boards of persons took small part in the business is not really a good one.</P>
    <P>I may be asked what solution I have for these problems.  I put forward, after a very considerable amount of thought, a detailed scheme in this House, which would not have prevented discussions between employers and trade unions or employers and employed, but which would have set up a tribunal empowered to arbitrate and to refuse a settlement if it was satisfied that it would increase the cost of living to an extent which the country could not stand.  In other words, I wanted an independent tribunal which would represent the interest of the consumer.  I believe that after some experience, after giving it a chance to work, by that means you would get a far wiser and better check, while allowing the ordinary relationships to go on, with the restrictions which I advocated with regard to the operation of strikes and lockouts. I do not want to go back over the speech I then made. That was a very considerable time ago. It was treated sympathetically by the Minister and, as far as the House was concerned, with silence by the Labour Party, although, individually, responsible people in the Labour Party&mdash;I do not mean members of this House&mdash;told me there was a great deal in it with which they would agree, although there were other things they would criticise.</P>
    <P>In this order there is a tribunal. The tribunal is to be set up under complete control of the Minister. Every person in this tribunal can be removed by the Minister at will at any time and immediately.  What is the tribunal to do?  A few, what I may call, tuppenny-ha'penny things.  I cannot find any provision that this tribunal can deal with the question of wages.  I find no provision that if there are certain people whose standard is too low they can go to the tribunal and ask for an increase.  But you can go to ask that the directors' fees should be increased.  Or, if a company has not a pre-war percentage standard then it cannot pay any directors' fees and presumably cannot pay <Col N="1425" /> a managing director either unless the tribunal agrees.  It is rather vague.  A managing director is not an employee; he is a director.  You cannot pay him without going to the tribunal.  That means that if a company which has not a pre-war standard is not satisfied with its present managing director or happens to be in the position of a new company looking for one, it cannot make a contract with him.  It may have to correspond with him in another country, or wherever they are going to get him.  We get many experts from outside.  The company cannot fix with him until it has gone to the tribunal.</P>

      <P>I am quite satisfied that in many industries people could be found and not very long ago people were found and did come here.  I can privately tell the Minister, if he likes, one or two cases.  They did not come from very far away, I admit.  What I am stating is that when you enter into negotiations with a person whom you are proposing to appoint, all the good of your tribunal is that you have to say to him: &ldquo;We will not be able to tell you what we can pay you until we have arranged with you and put it to the tribunal.&rdquo;  That is a small point of not much importance, but I think it is a silly way of dealing with it.  That is all the tribunal we have got, instead of a tribunal to deal with a larger question of real importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see a limitation of dividends.  I believe that you cannot apply it by just one rule, but I see no reason why dividends should be substantially larger or, where sufficiently high at present, should be any larger at all during this emergency.  I completely and absolutely disagree with the kind of line drawn by Senator Lynch, who sets off a person who enjoys dividends <Col N="1426" /> against a person who receives a wage, quite forgetting that in many cases persons who receive dividends have not as much even as a wage-earner and that most pensions and pension schemes are actually paid out of investments which have to pay dividends.  As we are working on the present system, a great deal for the benefit of all classes, poor and rich, depends on the payment of moderate dividends.  This is not to say they have got to be increased during an emergency such as this.  It is not practical politics even if it were desirable, but at any rate it is not desirable.  In the same way, I am in general agreement with the Minister's outlook towards attempts to get unfair increases in wages during this time.</P>
    <P>What I really object to is, first of all, the method; secondly, the fact that the Minister is taking powers over and above Parliament to make changes, which I do not think he ought to have done; thirdly, I think he is ignoring the fact that, if and when possible, the people who are on a lower standard ought to be allowed a little increase, at any rate, to make up for the cost of living; and, fourthly, I believe the details of this could be much better worked out if it were referred to a Committee of this House or a Committee of the Dáil, or even, possibly, to a body like the Employers' Federation, with representatives from the trades unions.  I could draw attention to several other details, but I think I have said enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very chary of intervening in a debate on a subject that is concerned with economics.  Being myself neither what could be described as a wage-earner nor a drawer of dividends, I may be, perhaps, regarded as rather outside this whole controversy; but as I propose to vote for this motion, I do not like to do so without saying something as to my reasons.  One point, which I think is of great importance, has emerged from this whole debate, and it is that, apparently, the Minister has taken powers under this order to do various things without there being any possibility of these things being reconsidered, after they have been done, by <Col N="1427" /> the Oireachtas.  If that is so, I do not think it is right that these powers should be given.  There should be, at least, some opportunity for Parliament to discuss these matters, even after action has been taken, and to secure that if a Minister, no matter how good he may be, does things which it considers inadvisable, he should be checked in his actions.  It is a most dangerous thing, to my mind, for Parliament to hand away all its powers in that respect, and, Heaven knows, we have given powers enough to the present Government without abdicating completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senator Douglas, and like most of the speakers in this debate, I have a great deal of sympathy with the endeavours of the Government to prevent any spectacular rise in wages or dividends or anything in the nature of that spiral to which there has been so much reference.  But there are two points I would like to make on the subject: one is that there seems to be extremely little danger, as the situation is developing, that any such spiral movement will take place.  On the contrary, instead of being faced with anything like a vast expansion of wage-earning or dividend-earning possibilities, we are far more likely to be faced with a contraction in all these things.  While we are faced with that position, industries closing down or in danger of closing down, business generally inclined to dry up, we proceed, on the one hand, to impose heavy taxation and, on the other, to introduce one-sided restrictions of this kind without having any full, clear-cut or imaginative policy to deal with the whole situation.  That is one point of moment.  I am greatly afraid, though I am by no means an economist, and am looking purely from the commonsense point of view, that the whole notion that we are passing through an inflationary period is an illusion; that we are much more likely to be faced with a period of restriction and that the Government should be trying to expand our business as far as possible in the circumstances, trying to find substitutes for our industries, trying to put life and vigour into trade.  It is, of <Col N="1428" /> course, perfectly true that this is not an easy task.</P>
    <P>It is simple for a speaker to get up and say the Government ought to do this and the Government ought to do that, but what puzzles me and rather disheartens me and I think disheartens quite a number of impartial people throughout the country is that there seems to be very little sign on the part of the Government of any attempt to attend to the positive side of this problem.  What we have got is for one thing, heavy taxation, taxation which even 20 or 15 years ago would have been looked upon as being out of all proportion to the resources of the country. On the other hand, we are getting this sort of restrictive legislation and what effect can it have except further to dry up business and trade and enterprise, upon the expansion of which, in this critical period, the lives of many of our citizens may depend.  It is because I see so much attention being paid to the negative side of the problem and very little attention being paid to the much more difficult, positive side that I do not like the notion of the Government taking this step at this particular time.  I know, of course, it is easy again to say that there should be a positive step and something to counterbalance this clamping down of wages, and it is easy to say, &ldquo;control prices,&rdquo; but the actual work of controlling prices, as anybody who has paid any attention to the matter knows, is a difficult proposition.  That is true.  On the other hand, there is very little evidence that anything at all is being done, especially in the case of the people who can least afford to pay anything extra.</P>
    <P>Take two cases; take the price of turf to the poor here in the City of Dublin.  We have all been told that the poor are being charged one penny a sod for turf in Dublin.  And again we all know the fantastic prices which are charged for vegetables in the City of Dublin.  We all know that the benefit of these prices is not going to the primary producer.  We all know that there are certain organisations, certain people in the city who are able to draw out of the difficult circumstances advantage to themselves.  There always will <Col N="1429" /> be organisations and machinery of that kind, but I refuse to believe, as one impartial citizen, that it is entirely impossible to deal with this matter, that something could not be done for the poor, and that there could not be some counterbalancing of this very drastic order curtailing all rises in wages.  There has been a great deal said on the advisability of proceeding in the fashion in which the Minister has proceeded in this matter, and on that I am afraid I cannot sympathise with the criticisms that have been levelled at the Minister. To my mind a procedure by order like this is the proper procedure.  You cannot legislate about matters of this sort in a time of crisis which, as the Minister has pointed out, may only last for a few months.  You cannot deal with it by the cumbrous process of legislation, and I would not insist that the Minister should adopt that method. On the other hand I do feel that when we are resorting to measures of this kind they should be resorted to if at all possible by some sort of non-Party agreement.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken several times in this House on the necessity for some kind of non-Party Government, and I think this is a matter on which, especially before drastic regulations are issued, some steps should be taken to see whether we could have a Government that would be representative of all sides in both Houses.  In order to do that sort of work I suggest not merely should we have non-Party Government, but it should be done on the very best economic advice that the Government can get.  If we could have a non-Party Government and, side by <Col N="1430" /> side with it, some sort of council or committee of economic advisers who would take a complete view of the whole situation and would relate action in one field to action in another, I would have a great deal more confidence that the matter was being properly attended to.  What I am afraid of is that we have here a narrow Party Government proceeding in this terrible crisis in the traditional Civil Service fashion.  The great defect of the Civil Service in a crisis like this is that, while it is extremely efficient and capable and honest, its efficiency lies in a negative direction.  The great capacity of the Civil Service is to prevent anything out of the ordinary being done, and I can see behind all these regulations, and behind the recently introduced Budget, the same Civil Service outlook.</P>
    <P>To my mind in a situation like the situation in which we find ourselves, we may need all our resources, intellectual, physical and moral, and we need more than that outlook.  I do not think we will get through it anything like as successfully, by means of this Civil Service outlook and this negative procedure, as we would if we could see our way to set up a non-Party Government, and take into counsel people who are able to extend their views over the whole economic field.  It is because I feel that, although I sympathise very strongly with the Minister, that I cannot see my way to support the order.</P>
