      <P>Before we enter upon the Orders of the day, might I ask the Minister for Finance, who is also the Tánaiste, the Vice-President of the Government, what programme the Government desires to complete before we rise?  I do not quite know what we would be rising for&mdash;certainly not the Summer Recess.</P>

      <P>Of course, the Finance Bill will be necessary.  The Bills that are now in the Dáil, I understand, will be required to be passed before there is any adjournment for whatever period, whether you call it the Summer Adjournment or not.  The Local Government Bill, 1940, the Local Officers and Servants (Dublin) Bill, 1941, the Neutrality (War Damage to Property) Bill, 1941, the Trade Union Bill, and the Emergency Powers (Continuance) Bill, 1941&mdash;all these will be required before the adjournment.  Consideration of some of them is almost completed, I think, in the Dáil.  It might not be necessary to have the Neutrality (War Damage to Property) Bill through all its stages.  The Appropriation Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Is there really any urgency about the Local Government Bill, which has waited for nine years, since the Government came into office, or the Trade Union Bill, which has waited for a considerably longer period?</P>

      <P>I might say that I am in entire agreement with the views expressed by Senator Hayes that at this stage and in this weather, may I add, it is certainly not very pleasant to be presented with a menu card of that kind to be gone through in the month of July, but I was told yesterday by several Ministers whom I consulted that they would require these Bills.  I went through the list with a number of the Ministers concerned and they all indicated to me that these Bills would be necessary. I can raise the matter with them again and I will gladly do that and point out the views expressed by Senator Hayes which, I take it, represent the views of members in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give the Minister an additional argument.  The traditional attitude of Ministers is that every Bill is urgent.  Every Minister thinks his own particular goose is a swan.  Whether Fianna Fáil or otherwise their attitude is the same&mdash;all their Bills are urgent.  I had a long experience of them, and I must say that I am convinced there are very few urgent Bills.  Nothing would happen in this State detrimental to the interests of any citizen if a good many of these Bills were not passed until next December or next December 12 months, for that matter.  I can understand the necessity for financial business, or for the continuance of the Emergency Powers Act.  Whatever one thinks about it, the Government must have it and must try to get it.  If they want the Damage to Property Bill that might well be urgent, but why the Local Government Bill and the Trade Union Bill should be asked for in August, never mind July, baffles me.</P>

    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <P>(3) The several statutory and other <Col N="1672" /> provisions which were in force on the 5th day of April, 1941, in relation to income-tax and surtax shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, have effect in relation to the income-tax and surtax to be charged as aforesaid for the said year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1941.</P>

      <P>There are two recommendations to Section 1 in the name of Senator Hayes, and I presume they will be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendations Nos. 1 and 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), line 24, after the word &ldquo;provisions&rdquo;, that the words &ldquo;as amended by this section&rdquo; be inserted.</P>
      <P>At the end of the section, that a new sub-section (4) be added as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4) Section 3 of the Finance Act, 1935 (No. 28 of '35) shall not apply to or have effect in relation to tenements and hereditaments in the occupation of the owner and the rateable value of which does not exceed twenty pounds (£20).</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this recommendation, Sir, is to remedy what I have always regarded as an injustice done by the Finance Act of 1935 to property owners, and more particularly to persons living in houses which they themselves own.  For income-tax purposes the valuation of a house is now calculated on five-fourths instead of on the previous rate of five-sixths. Before 1935 a person living in a house with a valuation of, say, £30 paid income-tax on £25 only, and he paid it at a much lower rate than the present one.  By the Act of 1935 the then Minister for Finance raised the valuation for income-tax purposes by adding one-fourth.  I want to put it, Sir, that that particular provision <Col N="1673" /> weighs very heavily on a very important and a very meritorious section of the community, namely, people who have bought their houses, particularly the smaller class of houses with valuations up to £20.  It was considered after 1922 by the Government, and the same considerations have weighed with that Government's successor&mdash;with the present Minister himself, notably&mdash;that house purchase should be encouraged.  It was considered good public policy for people to arrange with a bank or a building society to buy their houses, and I think it would be correct to say that very little could have been done to solve the housing problem but for the efforts of people to purchase their houses.</P>
      <P>The possession of property of that kind, of course, is a good thing; it was encouraged by the State, and is encouraged by the Church, and it is good citizenship from every angle.  A great many citizens of a very desirable type&mdash;I put it that way&mdash;have purchased their houses.  The vast majority purchased them through banks or building societies and incurred considerable debts&mdash;responsibility which they were barely able to shoulder at the particular moment of purchase.  Most of them borrowed more than half the money or undertook by weekly payments to pay off interest, rates, and some small portion of the capital. Their position in the intervening time since 1932, or even since 1935, has worsened very considerably.  The rates have gone up.  Within the last 10 or 11 years the rates have gone up, roughly speaking, from 14/- in the £ to a little over 20/-; the rate of income-tax has gone up from 3/6 to 7/6, and the valuation for the purpose of collecting income-tax on property has been put up artificially by the Act of 1935 which we are now asking the Seanad to amend.  Generally, the repayment, apart from these circumstances, of the purchase money of houses has become more and more difficult.  There is no allowance for repairs or decoration, although everyone knows that the cost of repairs and decoration has gone up very considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without going into minute calculations, <Col N="1674" /> the position, roughly speaking, is that a person with a valuation of £20 has had it increased for income-tax purposes from £16 to £24.  Valuation for income-tax purposes has been increased by just 50 per cent.  Taking account of the rise in the standard rate of tax, for every £ paid ten years ago, the owner of a house is called upon to pay £1 16s. 8d. to-day.  That is a very grievous burden, and one which makes it extremely difficult for people who are struggling to do not only what is good for themselves but what is good for the State generally, that is to say, to purchase and become the owners of small houses.  A fair case could be made for relief for a valuation over £20, but the shoe pinches more particularly on people who live in houses valued under £20.  I submit that to relieve the burden on these people the rateable valuation for income-tax purposes should be permitted to remain at the ordinary rateable valuation, instead of increasing it by one-fourth.  I put it to the Minister that it is good public policy to help persons who have made very considerable efforts to help themselves.  They are people who, in the main, get no assistance from local funds or public funds.  They are not the people who occupy housing schemes where an economic rent is not being charged.  They are people who are struggling and who are particularly hit at this moment by the incidence of the difficulties following on the war. Although this would not be a very great measure; it would in some way tend to ease the burden upon them.  A great many find themselves in very considerable difficulty in paying off the instalments on their houses, and the least that might be done would be to restore them to the position in which they were before this unfair burden was imposed in the Act of 1935.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this recommendation.  The House will recollect that I always have been hammering away at this question, without satisfaction.  I look at this from the point of view of the demesne owner&mdash; an economic prisoner who, when he wants a few pounds, has to kill a wolf. Dealing with the more immediate <Col N="1675" /> point, I think what Senator Hayes is asking is eminently reasonable, and I am quite prepared to accept the limitation of £20, though I would like to see the whole thing swept away.  This is a most deserving class of the community&mdash;people who invest money in house property&mdash;and they are badly treated.  I wonder if the Minister realised the gradual effect on these people.  The combined effect of adding this one-fourth to the valuation, together with the abolition of repairs allowances, has been to increase the schedule value by 50 per cent.  That is the basis, and it is most unreasonable and presses very hard on the struggling class of the community.  The Minister probably will say that he cannot do anything, but I hope he will ponder this in his mind and give some relief in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to support this recommendation.  We have a very extreme case in my town.  About ten years ago the town was revalued, not in the regular way but in a piecemeal way over two or three years, and it did not have the advantage given to other revalued towns such as Waterford, which was revalued by special order. In that way, our valuation was increased by about 60 per cent. over a couple of years' valuation of the town. Between the increased valuation and the increased property income-tax, this has hit the people very hard.  The income-tax demands on property have been increased about five-fold.  I know one case&mdash;my own property: when I bought the place I paid 37/6 property tax, and the property tax on the same premises now is about £15 15s.  That is general all over the town, especially by reason of the increased valuation and this increased income-tax.  If any relief is given generally, it certainly would be a great relief to the town from which I come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Two amendments in legislation were brought in in the last few years&mdash;one was the Finance Act of 1935 in relation to this, and there was also another Bill brought in for revaluation in the country.  There were <Col N="1676" /> two arguments used in relation to these two cases.  I wish to point out at the beginning that, where Senator Hayes bases this on what I may call social good&mdash;that it is eminently desirable that the State should be just to each individual&mdash;the argument for revaluation was that a great many places were overvalued in some parts and undervalued in other parts.  That was the case put up by the then Minister for Finance.  The implication in his argument in regard to the amendment referred to in the Finance Act of 1935 was that, whereas the nominal valuation of a place was about £20, £30 or £50, the actual rent drawn from it was something enormously in excess of that.  That may be the case in a great number of instances but, as far as the State is concerned, when it amends legislation it should assure itself that it will not result in injustice in any individual case.</P>
      <P>I have no personal interest in this matter, but will give one instance I know of&mdash;that of let houses.  If you have a house with a valuation of £20 or £30 a year, I understand it is very easy to let that house at a rent which will pay your outgoings, plus some fruits of the original capital.  When you come to a larger house&mdash;I mention one I know of&mdash;you can let up to £120 a year quite easily.  If a rent is required to cover outgoings and give a reasonable, or not too reasonable, return on the capital involved, once it goes to a higher sum, it is very difficult Take the case of a house in a Dublin suburb, the valuation of which is £83 a year, and the ground rent £17 a year. Consider the initial outgoings which have to be met by the owner by reason of his ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the rates on the £84 valuation work out at something like £87.  On top of that there is another £17 ground rent.  That makes £104 which he has to pay out of his own pocket every year right away.  Apart from that, in the ordinary course the owner of the lease of that house has to pay for all external repairs, which can mount up, as the Minister probably knows, quite easily to £50 or £70 a year.  If you put it at £50&mdash;and I do not think that is excessive in a house which was built <Col N="1677" /> more than 20 years ago&mdash;that means he has to calculate on an outgoing every year of £154 on that house, before he gets a penny interest on the money he invested in it.  The Minister comes along and estimates the income that man derives as four-fifths&mdash;if I remember rightly&mdash;of £84; that is to say, he assumes that he will get a rent of about £254 a year on that house.  Of course, I am not calculating this exactly or working out elaborate sums.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, whether he knows anything about this or not, what he thinks is the prospect of letting a substantially large house in a Dublin suburb at £254 a year.  Would there be any chance of doing it?  In the case that I am referring to, the Minister actually is charging a person on an income which the person does not receive and has not any chance whatever of receiving.  There are houses, to my knowledge, in which the original outlay on the house might have been £4,000 or £5,000 or more.  They paid that out and now they are drawing no net income on the property that they bought with that money, and the Minister came along and arbitrarily in 1935 assumed, for the convenience of taxation, that the valuation put on that house of £84 a year was less than the real value.  That was the argument put forward for this particular change.  In putting that argument forward, there was the implication that the argument was universally true.  In relation to a whole type of property in this city&mdash;I do not know about other parts of the country&mdash;that is completely untrue.  In the amendment of the Finance Act, 1935, it worked out&mdash;I am not saying in a proportionately great number of cases, but in a great number of actual cases&mdash;as an unjust act performed by the Government against individual persons.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Where an inspector of taxes or such other officer as the Revenue Commissioners may appoint in that behalf is of opinion that the annual value with reference to which an assessment of tax is made on any tenement or rateable hereditament in pursuance of sub-section (1) of this section exceeds the annual rent at which such tenement or rateable hereditament is worth to be let from year to year, he may, notwithstanding that there has been no appeal under Section 5 of the Finance Act, 1929 (No. 32 of 1929), against such assessment and notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (6) of the said Section 5, at any time before the end of the year of assessment grant relief by reducing such assessment and charging the tax on the amount on which it would, in his opinion, have been charged if it had been assessed with reference to the said annual rent instead of the said annual value, and the said assessment as so reduced shall be final and conclusive for all purposes.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the instructions to the Revenue Commissioners? When you go to deal with them they bring out all sorts of documentation files, with mimeographed strips stuck into them.  Take the house to which I am referring.  I suggest that the taxation imposed is excessive and against natural justice, unless the annual rent charged to the tenant is something like £254 per year.  That is the rent that would be required to produce the net income which would be appropriate to the amount of taxation <Col N="1679" /> charged.  What I want to get at is the net rent&mdash;the rent which has deducted from it the rates paid, the ground rent paid and a fair allowance for the repairs requiring to be done from time to time.  The Minister tells me that the Revenue Commissioners, to use that old cliché of which Government Departments are so fond, &ldquo;consider sympathetically&rdquo; any case which is put forward.  The rent of such a house, on paper, might be £230 a year if the owner were lucky enough to get a tenant.  But if you say the rent is £250 and that he is only paying £84, multiplied by 5 over 4, it has no relation to the facts.  If the Minister says that the Revenue Commissioners, acting on instructions from the head of the Finance Department, take into account all these modifying factors which should be taken into account, I shall be glad to inform interested parties that they should take the earliest opportunity of making themselves a nuisance to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that hardly a month in the year passes in which the Revenue authorities, either local or at headquarters, are not presented with cases of that kind. They try to reach a reasonable figure, in discussion with owners of property of the type mentioned by Senator Fitzgerald, as representing the rent which that person would receive.  It is open to the proporietor of such a piece of property to go to the Commissioner of Valuation and ask him to reduce the valuation.  I have, personally, known that to be done.  The Commissioner has from time to time reduced the valuation of property which, in his opinion and in the opinion of the owner, would not command the rent which it was possible to get formerly. There is an appeal from the Commissioner of Valuation to the courts.  In addition, there is in these cases an appeal directly to the Revenue authorities.  There is frequent reference to the Revenue authorities in cases such as the Senator has mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Hayes in the <Col N="1680" /> sociological arguments which he advanced. What my views were as Minister for Local Government with regard to housing are well known.  I made an effort to get housing improved in the country and I made a special effort to get as many persons as possible to purchase their dwellings.  I have not changed my views on that aspect of the housing question but I have to deal with the matter now as Minister for Finance and that means that I must look at a variety of things from a different angle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Not to any extent, so far as my experience has gone up to the present.  Senator Fitzgerald referred to natural justice.  Having heard the arguments on both sides of this question since this amendment was first brought in to the Finance Act of 1935, I think natural justice is on the other side.  We want to be just to everybody, and why should the owner of property, whether he lives in his house or whether he rents it, have an advantage in income-tax over the person who, instead of buying his house or investing in house property, puts his money into some other security?  The person who invests in stocks or shares, or in some industry, pays full tax on the yield of the money he invests.  The man who invests in Ireland in house property is not, even with the five-fourths arrangement, paying anything like the same amount in income-tax as the person to whom I have referred, though the annual value of the house of that individual is properly treated as part of his income.  If the money were invested in any other way, it would be liable to full income-tax.  In Ireland, our system of valuation was designed for poor law purposes.  The valuation of house property to-day has no relation to the real value.</P>

      <P>I have argued that the other way.  I gave the Minister a <Col N="1681" /> specific case, and I maintained that, with regard to that type of house, there is no relationship between the valuation and the rent.  In this case, the man is not drawing the income which is implied by the valuation.  The Minister's implication is that a house valued at £20 may command a rent of £50, £60 or £70.  On the other hand, there are cases in which the valuation is £90, and the net rent may be nothing.</P>

      <P>The valuation of house property to-day is based on the Griffith Valuation of the last century, which was fixed for poor law purposes. It has no relation to real value.  If the house to which the Senator has referred had been valued at its proper letting value at the time, the valuation might have been £150 instead of £84. With the exception of a couple of towns, valuations in this country are completely out of date.  Many houses in the country, and some in Dublin, have not been valued for a great many years. There are, of course, revaluations going on all over the country, Dublin included, but the basis on which the commissioner and his staff work is still the old basis, and it is entirely out of date.  If and when a new basis of valuation is introduced, the valuers will take into consideration the profit value to the individual concerned.  That will mean, presumably, a reduction in the valuation of premises of the type Senator Fitzgerald has in mind, but, generally speaking, it will probably mean an increase in the valuation of all classes of property.  The present basis is antiquated.  It has no relation to the facts, and the owner of property&mdash;particularly the person who lives in his own house&mdash;gets an advantage over every other class of the community who pays income-tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, they do not pay income-tax if they are purchasing their houses.  Take, as an example, a house of the type the Senator has in <Col N="1682" /> mind, costing £650.  I think that person would have to put down £150.  He would borrow £500 from the bank.  The value of the house would be £20 plus one-fourth, that is, £25 in all.  He would have to pay bank interest and an allowance would be made to him in respect of that bank interest.  Then the ground rent of the house, whether £5 or £6 or possibly £8, is taken into consideration.  When these allowances are totted up, he does not pay any income-tax on the house if the value is about that figure.  There is no direct tax on that house if the value is only about £20.  I am sorry that I cannot accept the Senator's recommendation. I should like, from the sociological point of view, to do anything I could to give a concession in the case of dwelling-houses, but there is a strong case to be made against giving an individual who owns his own house or who lives in his own house an advantage that does not accrue to every other class of the community paying income-tax. In addition to that I understand that if the recommendation were accepted it would cost me this year very close on £100,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much surprised to hear from the Minister that if a man who bought or built his house had instead invested the money in Irish industry he would pay the full income-tax.  He seems to have entirely forgotten that it was the policy of his Government to give a special concession to certain investments in Irish industry and that a lower rate of income-tax was fixed.  That concession was not given to the person who invested his money in a house.  Instead of that, the valuation was increased by one-fourth for the purposes of income-tax. Now we are told by the Minister that there was a special advantage for the person who put his money into housing. I do not think myself he has made a case to show that there is a special advantage.  I do not claim for a moment that a man who has bought a house, and who lives in it, should pay no income-tax, but I think it is unfair that he should pay income-tax on more than a reasonable percentage of the money he has invested in the house if he has all the time resided in <Col N="1683" /> it.  I could give the Minister quite a number of cases which would illustrate the hardship inflicted on such persons since five-fourths of the valuation was taken as the basis for income-tax.  If a house is bought in the open market for, say, £2,000, and if there is no allowance for repairs, it seems to me that £80 would not be too low a figure on which to expect such a man to pay income-tax.  I could give the Minister plenty of cases where houses have been bought in or around £2,000, where the owner has to meet all outlay on upkeep, repairs and decorations and where, in addition, he has to pay income-tax on a considerably higher sum&mdash;£l00 or £120.  He cannot take advantage of the section read by the Minister because that only applies to cases where the house is rented to another person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from the Minister that if I could find a house which cost £2,000, and on which income-tax is charged on £100, there would be any possibility at all of getting the concession because I do not think there is any hope at all from such information as I have obtained?  I have known people who endeavoured to obtain it and they got no comfort whatever. They were told that the house could be rented and that if they had chosen to go into the market, they probably could have got a much higher rent for it.  I am taking the Minister's own argument.  I am accepting the Minister's point of view that a man who puts £2,000 into a house should not be better off than a person who puts money in any other investment, but I do not accept the contention that he is better off.  It may be that he could only get 3 or 4 per cent. on that amount in a safe investment.  Of course, he might get a higher return if he took a chance with an industrial investment where the dividends might fluctuate from one year to another.  I am pretty well certain that the incidence of the tax on the five-fourths of the valuation does not work out as the Minister states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1684" /> The recommendation, however, deals with a particular class of case to which Senator Hayes drew attention.  That is the type of small man who was induced, rather than rent a house, to build or to buy a small house costing £500, £800, or a maximum of £1,000.  In most cases he had to find 25 per cent. or 33? per cent. of the cash himself.  I believe that some companies did not insist on more than 25 per cent., but then the man had to take out a life insurance policy.  After he has been paying for ten or 12 years, he will have reduced the amount of the loan to ? or ½ so I think it is a mistake to assume that he does not pay income-tax on a considerable portion.  The real point, however, is that we want to get a far larger number of houses suitable for housing small families.  It is highly desirable in the national interest that people should be encouraged in every reasonable way to buy houses or to undertake the building of them.  In 1931, income-tax was 3/6, the valuation was normal and the rates were considerably lower.  Ever since then, the position has become harder and harder and it is more difficult than formerly for a person who wants to buy a house. I suggest to the Minister that, apart from the injustice to individuals, it would be better policy for the State to have kept the charges on that type of house lower.  That is the reason I hope the Seanad will pass this recommendation, even though it may not be finally accepted by the Minister, as indication of the fact that we think that something should be done for the owner of that type of house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Douglas has made a very important point.  People who live in these houses, the owner-occupiers of these houses under £20 valuation, were induced to buy.  The Minister agrees that an inducement was held out to them to buy and that they were doing something in accordance with public policy. About that there was no disagreement between Parties in the State. Actually, subsidies were given for houses with a certain superficial area so as to ensure that the valuation would not be more than £20.  These people by taking the plunge and taking <Col N="1685" /> the responsibility of going into these houses did relieve the burden upon the local authorities and upon the Government to provide houses for certain other people.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with one point that was mentioned by the Minister.  He said that this concession would cost him £100,000.  Just before he said that it would cost him £100,000 he explained very genially, as is his custom, that these people were not paying income-tax. If it is going to cost the Minister £100,000 to remit one-fifth of their tax they must be paying a certain amount of income-tax.  There may be some people who are not paying income-tax because their total income does not reach the level necessary to be assessed for income-tax, but the people who are in these houses now find themselves in a position of great difficulty, and they are in that position because they were induced to go into these houses in accordance with public policy.  I said before that income-tax is a fair tax, and I do think it is a fair tax, but a man should not be taxed on income he has not got.  I think that these people are made to pay tax on income that does not really exist at all.  The analogy with people with money invested fails on two grounds, tor if it is an Irish investment a certain amount of tax would be remitted, whereas when money is in an Irish house the tax is increased.  A house is surely as good an investment from the national point of view as any other. That is one point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is that the person who pays income-tax on an investment only pays on the dividend he actually gets, whereas in this case a man who is struggling with rates and repairs and is made to pay back interest on the capital that he has borrowed is deemed to be able to make a profit rent of one-fourth more than the valuation.  I think that is a fictitious figure, so that he is made to pay tax on income which in fact he has not got.  It was put that if some of the £100,000 were left to him so that he could keep the house in proper condition the money paid out in wages and materials would do very much more good, from the national point of view, than the £100,000 given to the Minister.  I think that even the <Col N="1686" /> Minister knows that himself, but he is in the position that he has to make a case for finance.  Great injustice is being done to these people.  The position is being made very difficult, and if they were left with the money it could be put to much better national use and employment than when the Minister collects it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>My object in speaking is to ask the Minister to keep an open mind on this matter.  The Minister is a fair man.  He is certainly an intelligent man, if I may say so with all humility, because he seems to understand very well the official side of this question much more so than his predecessor, whom I could never get to understand the question at all.  He simply repeated what I felt had been told to him by officials.  As the Minister well knows, there has been a certain amount of mitigation of this in respect to small properties, but even there there is no set-off given for management.  Where there is the cost of management surely the Minister must admit that the management of the houses and the collecting of rents and the rates and the repairs is in no way comparable with the collection of dividends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that point I think the Minister cannot sustain a comparison so as to make a similarity between income derived from investments and the tax in Schedule A on the owner of property.  I am sorry to be so persistent on this matter, but I think the Government has given a raw deal to the public in this whole matter.  Take the question of repairs.  Senator Hayes and Senator Douglas both emphasised that the owner is being taxed on money that he does not in fact get.  In the case of dividends from securities he gets the money.  There may be a great deal taken off, and probably he is only left with a small amount, but he actually gets the cash. The whole question of repairs is submerged in the statement that valuation includes an item for repairs.  Under the old system the allowance for repairs was settled.  It was one-sixth, and if you could show that you spent more than one-sixth you were allowed the additional amount.  That was an <Col N="1687" /> attempt to place property income on the same basis as investments, but what is done now?  There is an unstated amount hidden away in the valuation.  I wonder has that point of view been adverted to by the Minister. Quite likely it has not, because in this case I am afraid his advisers are following the line of simplicity.  I do not blame them.</P>
    <P>The revenue authorities do not want to have to deal with these claims, and I feel certain that the Minister is being told that this is going to make things very complicated if you take into consideration the question of repairs, and it is only natural that you should.  I do hope the Minister is going to look at the question <i>de novo</i>, and if he does I am sure he will be convinced that great injustice is being done not only to those who hold or occupy property, but a still greater injustice to those who let property and who have very heavy expenses for repairs and who are being taxed on money they never receive.  If the Minister will say it is unfair to tax people on money they never receive he cannot possibly stand over this tax under Schedule A.</P>

      <P>I only want to get a little elucidation.  The Minister gave an example of a house that cost £650. You borrowed £500 and provided £150.  In order to get relief from the tax you had to have a certificate of interest for £25 from the bank.  Suppose as well as providing £150 the builder of this house also provided the £500 he can produce no banker's certificate for interest.  How was he to get relief then?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is generally agreed that the idea of increasing the valuation to five-fourths was to make up for the low valuation of property which existed for so long.  I would like to know from the Minister whether new houses are being valued strictly in accordance with the Griffith valuation system, because in many parts of the country there is a feeling that new houses are being valued on a newer basis. If it is true that they are being fully valued then, obviously, a certain section of the community is <Col N="1688" /> being made to bear an undue burden. In Galway, particularly, where the rates are as high as 30/- in the £, that tax, added to this one-fifth increase in valuation for income-tax purposes, presses very heavily on the owners of houses, especially of new houses, that is, of course, provided the houses are fully valued, as so many believe they are.  I would like to have the Minister's view on that&mdash;whether they are being valued on the Griffith system or whether they are being valued on a newer basis.</P>
      <P>There are two classes of people concerned in this recommendation of Senator Hayes.  One class is of people who have bought their houses and who have completed purchase.  The other class is of people who have bought their houses but who have not completed payment for them.  We all accept the principle of income-tax. Therefore the first group is automatically ruled out of any particular sympathy. The second group, in my opinion, do not suffer unduly.  Why I say that is that I happen to have experience of it, because I built a house myself, and built it, as most people build, by getting money from an outside source.  On each occasion that I complained to the income-tax people about this increase in valuation I was told that it made no difference ultimately&mdash;that the interest charges would cover it.  I found out that that was true.  When the receipt for the interest was brought in, it covered the increase for income-tax purposes, and I was left just where I started.  So that really, in regard to that second group, there is no injustice at all.  I think the Minister is correct when he says that even if this recommendation were accepted no relief would accrue to the people who have bought their houses and who have not completed payment for them&mdash;which I believe is the section of the community which Senator Hayes mainly has in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, when Dublin was revalued in 1913; but I understand there were allowances given by the then valuer that did not at the time bring the valuation up to the 1913 standard, as was originally intended. What the allowances were I do not know.  I could find out if the Senator is particularly interested, but there were special allowances given all over Dublin.  There was a certain arbitrary figure struck off the valuation of the property that had been arrived at by the valuer.  That figure &mdash;whether it was 5 per cent., 10 per cent., or 20 per cent&mdash;was struck off, and they simply took an arbitrary valuation.  That has been in existence and that basis has been worked on since 1913.  In Waterford there is a newer basis, a more up-to-date basis, of the profit rent, or what was regarded by the valuers of the day as the profit rent.  There is to a certain extent an injustice being done to property owners in Dublin and Waterford cities because they are bearing a higher rate of tax and higher expenses than other parts of the country that have not yet been revalued.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;than the one arrived at in Dublin in 1913.  There is to that extent a certain injustice being done in these cases and that was one of the reasons that induced <Col N="1690" /> the Government to bring in the Valuation Bill that is on the Order Paper of the Dáil for a long time.  I have two typical cases&mdash;actual cases&mdash; that were given to me by my staff on this question of house valuation and the five-fourths.  It is a matter of interest, perhaps, for the Seanad: A.B. is tenant of a house.  Poor rate valuation is £20.  He pays rent of £70 to C.D. and is responsible for rates.  If C.D.'s expenditure for repairs is taken at 20 per cent., he will receive a net income of £70 minus £14, that is £56. C.D. although receiving a net annual income from the property of £56 is only assessed to income-tax, Schedule A, on the sum of £25, that is, £20 plus the one-fourth.  If one asks A.B., who has £800 invested at 4 per cent., and is assessed on the income-tax thereon, £32, whether C.D. is being fairly dealt with as regards the assessment to income-tax on his house, the answer will presumably be: A man who pays income-tax only on £25 when the income is £56, is very lucky. If A.B., considering it to be disadvantageous to continue paying rent, decides to purchase the house and in fact purchases the house in question from C.D. for £800, what is now the position of A.B. as owner-occupier? A.B. is now the landlord, but he has a better tenant, <i>vis-a-vis</i> his position as landlord than C.D. had.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The normal salaried man whom the Senator pictures would buy such a house for £650, of which sum a building society would advance £500, repayable over 20 years at the rate of £44 per annum, the rate of interest being 6 per cent. per annum.  The poor rate valuation of such a house would be about £18, and the ground rent would be about £6.  In the first year, the purchaser's income-tax liability in respect of the house would work out as follows:&mdash;Poor rate valuation, £18, multiplied by five-fourths, £22 10s. 0d.; deduct ground rent, £6, and building society interest, £16 10s. 0d., £22 10s. 0d.  The tax charged on the house, therefore, is nil.  Now, the interest for the first year being £500, at 6 per cent., or £30, and since only £16 10s. 0d. of this interest has been allowed in the schedule Assessment, the balance, £13 10s. 0d. will be deducted from the assessment on the man's salary.&rdquo;</P>

At least, however, at this latter point of time it will not be too much to assume the purchaser will have three children, for each of whom he can claim the allowance of £60, under the present income-tax law.  If he had paid off his loan at this point of time, his earning would require to exceed £479 10s. 0d. before he is personally liable to income-tax.  To pay at the 7/6 rate, his earnings would require to exceed £604 10s. 0d.  An individual with £604 10s. 0d. from his employment, who at the same time owns his house of poor law valuation of £20, is not regarded as a fit subject for special consideration in regard to income-tax.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 1, in the name of Senator M. Hayes, agreed to, consequentially.</P>
    <P>The following recommendation appeared on the Order Paper:&mdash;</P>
    <P>At the end of the section, that a new sub-section be added as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(4) Income-tax shall be payable on the allowances payable to members of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Recommendation No. 3, in the name of Senator Sir John Keane, appears to me to be out of order, for the reason that it is irrelevant to the Bill.  The recommendation is, in effect, an amendment of sub-section (4) of Section 3 of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act, 1938. The recommendation may not, therefore, be moved to this Bill.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 1, with recommendations, stand part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether, since he became Minister for Finance, he has ever had occasion to examine the general rules applying to income-tax, which I think are mainly based on the rules and cases set out in the Act of 1918.  I would suggest to him that it would be very profitable and interesting if he were to study all the methods by which assessments were made and the allowances which were permissible and those which are not, and see whether a case could not be made for quite a number <Col N="1695" /> of adjustments, having regard to present-day circumstances.  I will give one instance where an improvement might be made.  If a limited company finds it desirable&mdash;as a great number have found it desirable in the last two or three years&mdash;acting on the advice of the Government to obtain substantial overdrafts in order to lay in stocks, in many cases the banks very properly have asked for a debenture.  Although that debenture brings in a certain tax to the State the Revenue Commissioners do not allow it, and they treat it as capital expenditure, even though the loan may be temporary and only for the purpose of covering a floating overdraft, which for a considerable part of the year may be nil.  I think that is a great mistake.  If new capital is added to the business, it is only reasonable that it should be treated as capital expenditure, but in the case of a debenture to be given to a bank the old rule has held for a long time.</P>
      <P>In regard to subscriptions: At the present time appeals are being made for substantial subscriptions, not only to the Red Cross Society but also to the Local Security Force, and in some cases I believe that appeals also have been made in connection with the A.R.P. services and other State or semi-State services.  It seems to me that a certain type of subscription from business, where it exceeds £l, should be allowed as an expense.</P>
      <P>At the present time it is allowed if it is definitely for the purpose of the business or if it can be shown that it is definitely for the benefit of employees. I suggest that the facilities given by the Local Security Force, Air Raid Precautions and Red Cross Society are for the benefit of business generally.  This is a case where the public might be induced to give considerably higher sums if a reasonable amount were allowed for the purposes of income tax.  If that firm gives £100 to the Red Cross and if, by any chance, they had an excess profit, the State will charge them £75 tax on the £100 they gave to the Red Cross.</P>

      <P>I have not gone into the rules and regulations to which the Senator has referred.  It would be <Col N="1696" /> a very big undertaking, requiring a great deal of time, and that time is hardly likely to be available to me under present circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the proposal, a firm exploiting the people and making excess profits could convert their action into a virtue by handing over portion of these excess profits to the Red Cross or a similar organisation. That is an aspect of the matter which I hope the Minister will bear in mind.  We had an example of this type from a philanthropist&mdash;a member of the Oireachtas&mdash;who wanted to avoid income-tax and get credit for being charitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not promise that I shall make the examination Senator Douglas suggests.  I find it hard to keep abreast of my work at present.  An examination of the kind suggested, if it were to be made in a thorough-going fashion, would take more time than I can possibly give to it at present.  The cost of raising a debenture seems to me to be a capital charge which is justly subject to income-tax.  As regards subscriptions, they are an entirely voluntary matter. There is no obligation to subscribe except the moral obligation we all have to assist the projects in which we believe and which we think are good for the people and the country.  I do not see why any individual or company should seek special consideration because of subscriptions of that nature to public objects.</P>

    <P>(1) Where an individual has paid under the Income Tax Acts by deduction or otherwise, or is liable under those Acts to pay, income-tax, or income-tax and surtax, for any year of assessment in respect of any part of his income arising in a country to which this section applies and shows to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 4, that paragraph (b) be deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My object in putting down this recommendation was not so much to get it accepted in the form in which it is down as to bring to the Minister's notice the hardship caused&mdash;a hardship which has existed for a long time&mdash;by the refusal of the Eire Government to allow Dominion income-tax relief.  If the Minister would go into the history of the matter, I think he would find that it rather slipped through in the Adaptation of Enactments Act and it has remained so ever since.  It does seem, on its face, unjust that, while you have got relief against British tax, you do not get relief against Dominion tax.  I do not want this debate to <Col N="1698" /> widen into a discussion of whether we are, or are not a Dominion, but it is somewhat hard on people who have been in the service of the Dominions and who, for reasons sentimental or otherwise, have investments there that they have not in the past been allowed any relief on account of Dominion income-tax, while in Great Britain there is relief.  The Minister will, of course, tell us that this whole section is devised to meet special circumstances arising out of the war.  I really do not ask that this Dominion income-tax relief should apply to the wider extension of the word &ldquo;Dominion&rdquo;, arising out of the war, in the form of the United States, but I do wish the Minister would, in the slack season&mdash;if the Minister for Finance ever has a slack season&mdash;give sympathetic consideration to the injustice caused to these people who have held investments for years in the Dominions, by their not being allowed any relief in respect of income-tax paid there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The double income-tax relief arrangement with Great Britain is reciprocal, and I think we get some benefit from it.  I do not think that there could be an arrangement with any of the British Dominions on a residence basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>We should gain but, in all probability, none of the Dominions would gain by such an arrangement.  It is unlikely that any Minister for Finance would bring in such an amendment within a reasonable time unless it were the result of a reciprocal arrangement.  That is not likely.  The change in the regulations introduced in this section does not necessarily arise out of the war.  It was considered years ago by my predecessor and, I think, by his predecessor. It was introduced to meet the case of people who spent the greater part of their lives in the service of industry outside the country or in the service of some Government abroad and who wished to come back and live here on their pensions or on their income. I thought it was desirable to <Col N="1699" /> get these people back to the country, and, therefore, I introduced this amendment of the law.  A number of cases were brought to my notice by members of both Houses.  Some of the persons concerned were already living here, even though it was very expensive for them to do so in the circumstances. I thought it was desirable to attract as many persons of that type back to the country as possible, so that we should have the benefit of their incomes and their earnings.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to explore with the Dominions the possibility of a reciprocal arrangement such as exists in the case of Great Britain?  It is hard that those who, for reasons of association, have invested money in the Dominions&mdash;very often in the form of mortgages, which are not easy to realise&mdash;should have to pay double income-tax.  The matter has become rather pressing only of late.  Some of these countries had only very small income-tax until the outbreak of war. Now, they have an increasing tax and it is imposing a burden upon these people.  There is a tendency to make revenue primary to equity in the whole of the tax code.  Believing the Minister to be a fair man who would not like to have injustice done, I think he might consider the examination of this whole question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Minister does not like being asked to supply information without notice but I presume he must have given consideration to this section and I would be glad if he could tell us why persons who are in professions and, as stated in the section, require no capital in order to carry on their professions, are to be allowed to make excess profits whereas no other section of the community is allowed to do so.  Wages must not be increased, directors' fees must not be increased, a business, whether a partnership or a limited company, must pay excess profits or excess surtax but under this section it is quite clear that a person carrying on a profession &ldquo;in which either no capital expenditure or only capital expenditure of a comparatively small amount is required,&rdquo; is to be exempted.  I think it extremely unlikely that, during the present emergency, professional people will be able to increase their incomes just as I think that at the present moment it is extremely unlikely that the majority of traders will be able to increase their incomes.  If it is unlikely that they will increase their incomes, it seems all the more reason why you should include them within the provisions of this part of the Act so that you can catch any odd one who does happen to make excess profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system of taxation imposed by this Bill, taken in conjunction with the Emergency Order No. 83, in effect means that there are to be no increased incomes without excess profit taxation except in the case of professional men.  There seems to be an idea that it is only a professional man who has to depend on his qualifications or his brains in order to make money.  I think that applies to a very large extent also to people at the head of a business.  Again, a man in business has to put up a large amount of capital, and that capital enables him to employ a considerable number of persons.  The professional man does not require to put up capital.  It is true that he has spent a certain amount on his education, but he rarely gives employment to many people, and if he does happen to make substantial <Col N="1701" /> excess profits, I do not see for the life of me why he should not have to pay tax on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle underlying the relief that is given to professional men is that it is unlikely first of all that professional men would earn excess profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>If so, could they not be included amongst those who have to pay tax on excess profits without any hardship?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a principle adopted in the excess profits code generally that professional men who earn their incomes by their own skill, by the exercise of mental and intellectual ability, should not be subjected to this excess profits tax.  If they do earn somewhat higher income at any period, they do so by the exercise of their talent.  The harder the work, the greater the exercise of their talent.  That is why these professions were given special consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very considerable section of the community &mdash;by no means people of strict puritanical views&mdash;who feel very strongly about the whole question of raising revenue from what I might call the vices of the people.  Looking at the thing realistically, I do think we ought to differentiate between the man who has a ticket in a sweep or the person who goes to a racecourse, who goes out in the open air to see horses running, and those who frequent these betting shops.  I hope I am not unparliamentary in saying that these <Col N="1702" /> betting shops are the very devil.  Has the Minister ever thought of them in this way?  Has he ever thought of the moral responsibility of the Government in getting revenue out of these betting shops?</P>
      <P>Surely he knows the temptations of these people who are in need of money to embezzle their employer's money or to take money that should go into their homes and to hang around these betting shops waiting for the result of the next race.  Really, the moral damage done by betting shops is incalculable, Every social worker will tell you the same thing.  They are far worse than public houses.  If you take a drink, it may do a certain amount of good provided you take the right kind of drink, but this betting is a temptation to try and make easy money.  The very fact of having a successful bet makes it all the worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid the historian looking at this whole question will form a very sorry opinion of the way we have availed of our political freedom.  We have certainly got a fair record to show in the matter of the housing of the people, though I am afraid in time to come many of the new houses will degenerate into slums and many of them will convey a very poor idea of our traditions of architecture as compared with the beautiful Georgian traditions we have inherited.  On this matter of betting, the question again arises whether considerations of money should override considerations of social justice.  Here we have a country where the people are so meticulous in regard to certain forms of immorality, where the people regard certain forms of immorality as deadly sins, in this matter of the betting tax condoning a form of immorality which is just as bad as these forms we reprehend so strongly.  I do feel whatever the revenue that may be derived the Government has a serious responsibility in this matter.  I think that if they go to the churches they will get only one answer.  I believe that the Government have a very serious responsibility in this matter from the moral standpoint. I trust, even now, the Government will stand back from the picture and look at it in the light of social justice and the real essential and <Col N="1703" /> enduring good of the community.  There is a distinction between the legitimate form of betting and this form of betting in shops, hanging around the shops where the lorry men on their rounds neglect their employers' work, and drop in for a bet, where the &ldquo;down-and-outs&rdquo; are risking the money that should be given to their families, and where money badly needed in the home, which is given as outdoor relief, finds its way into these betting shops. I do hope the Government will even now face up to the moral obloquy of this question.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Sir John Keane I can speak with authority on this question.  I am sure the Senator has a good deal of experience of these offices, but unlike him I do not agree that relieving these people of taxation is going in any way to hinder the carrying on of these betting shops or offices. Now, I have seen big business people and even stockbrokers resorting to these places.  It is not only the lorry-men and draymen that pay money into these shops.  I have read of responsible people deploring the fact that money is being spent in these betting shops.  But to relieve these people of taxation is certainly not going to reduce the number of people going into these shops.  I think the Minister has been very light on these people if he has increased the taxation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to endorse everything that has been said by the previous speakers.  For many years I have watched the position of these betting shops, and I have seen particular examples of the horrible effects on the poorer and weaker citizens of our great city.  We ought to <Col N="1704" /> do something to protect them.  The Minister for Finance ought not to batten on the weakness of our weaker citizens, because that is what we are doing.  This evil has gone a long way, and it is increasing.  I think it is about time that the Minister should do something about it.  We point the finger of scorn when we see municipalities and financiers in other countries drawing money from other forms of vice.  We are doing what is just as bad, and the results will reach us in the next generation, and we will rue it.</P>

      <P>There is a difference from the point of view of the Minister for Finance, of course, but in principle a bet is a bet wherever made, and I do not think any question of morality arises in principle on the question of bets.  I am nothing of a theologian, and I have not any experience of betting shops and very little in the way of experience of betting on the race-course. But I do not think I would be guilty of any greater sin, if it is a sin at all, by betting in the shop rather than on the race-course.  I agree that the multiplication of these shops and the temptation they offer has done a considerable amount of harm.  I believe that is so, that there is a temptation that would not exist if betting were confined to the race-course.  But when this was argued in the Dáil I was told in discussing the question of a tax on betting that we were taxing one of the only amusements or sports that the poor man could indulge in.  Well, we have to get money somewhere&mdash;everywhere we can.  I am not satisfied that, morally speaking, there is any argument against betting as betting.  There is an argument, and I think a strong argument, against the temptation that is offered to people that cannot afford to do so to bet.  And <Col N="1705" /> that has led to the downfall of many individuals.  I know when I was in the Local Government Department the number of officers that had to be dismissed&mdash;some on account of drink, of course, but mostly on account of betting&mdash;was certainly distressing.  I do not know if we are going to base our objection to betting on moral grounds, that we can avoid making betting illegal on the courses as well as in the shops.  It is like anything else.  It is when it is indulged in to excess that the difficulties and the dangers come in.</P>
      <P>The betting shops are used by all classes, as Senator Foran properly said. But I think there are numbers of betting shops in the poorer parts of the city that are frequented not only by men, but, indulging in their right of equality in this matter, by women, mothers of families, and it has often been represented to me that the families suffer very seriously by the temptation that is offered in that way.  But the Oireachtas has adopted and accepted it in principle, and once the principle is there, and the betting idea accepted, I do not think there is anything immoral in restricting it to a certain extent by taxation.  I am told the tax will have the effect of reducing the amount of money that goes into these shops, and to that extent Senator Sir John Keane ought to be satisfied.</P>

      <P>The Minister has really made my case stronger.  Here is the Government supplying an opportunity for betting.  Betting to excess on the race-course in practice cannot take place, and it is certainly in these betting shops that betting to excess takes place.  I think the Government should consult social workers and the Churches in these matters, as they would find that they would be unanimous in asking that it should be stopped.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (4), line 35, page 20, that the words &ldquo;one thousand&rdquo; be deleted and the words &ldquo;one thousand five hundred&rdquo; be substituted therefor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My object in putting this recommendation down is to point to what seems to me a certain amount of inequity between persons who may operate a trade or business as a partnership and as a private limited company.  The class of company to which this particular sub-section (4) applies is a company which the directors own and control.  For all practical purposes that means a private limited company. There may be a few exceptions but, as a general rule, all the companies of that kind are private limited companies. I take it that that is the type of company that this is meant to deal with.  There may be, as I say, one or two exceptions which would make no fundamental difference.  In order to illustrate the reasons why it seems to me that the figure of £1,000 is unfair as compared with £1,500, which is the exemption for surtax.  I am not referring now to excess surtax or excess corporation profits tax; I am confining my remarks entirely to the comparison between ordinary surtax and corporation profits tax as proposed in this Bill.  Let us take three persons who are partners and who make a profit of <Col N="1707" /> £6,000 which, for the sake of argument, I will assume is divided equally between them.  The three of them will pay income-tax only on £4,500, that is, ordinary income-tax at 7/6 less, of course, the ordinary income tax allowances, and they will pay an extra 6d. on £500 each.  The individual on his £2,000 will pay 7/6 in the £ income-tax on £1,500 and will pay an extra 6d. in the £ on the £500.</P>
    <P>Supposing there is a private limited company controlled by the same three individuals and that they make £6,000, of which they pay out in directors' fees to each other the same rate, £2,000 each, the way in which their tax will be assessed is: they will be assessed as individuals for ordinary income tax to £2,000 and they will pay on that exactly the same, that is, ordinary income-tax, on £1,500, and they will pay 6d. surtax on the £500.  The profits of the company are £6,000, but under this only £l,000 each will be allowed for the purpose of calculation of corporation profits tax.  That will leave £3,000 on which corporation profits tax will be chargeable on the amount in excess of £2,500, namely, on £500.  That means because they happen to be a private limited com pany they will pay £50 additional tax. I cannot see any reason why that should be so.  In fact, speaking generally, as a matter of general practice, it is more desirable to have a limited company than that they should work as a partnership.  There is better control over them.  It is more convenient and much more easy to control from the point of view of income-tax and the revenue generally. A tax is paid to the State on the formation of the company and I cannot see any reason why that additional charge should be made.  I am confining this entirely to this particular amendment.  I am not, for the moment, dealing with the question of excess tax at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated that a partnership of three persons, each earning £2,000, making £6,000, that being divided equally between them, each of them would be assessed for income-tax only on £l,500, with an additional 6d. surtax on £500.  In the case of a limited company I took a profit of £6,000 which was all paid out to the three directors who control and own it, namely £2,000 each.  On that £2,000 paid to them they would pay exactly the same tax as the partners, namely 7/6 on £2,000 and an additional 6d. on the £500 portion of it.  But when as a company the profits came to be assessed as to whether they were liable or not for corporation profits tax, the £6,000 would be taken and <Col N="1709" /> the amount allowed for directors' fees would only be £3,000&mdash;£1,000 each, through actually £6,000 had been paid out.  They would, therefore, be liable for corporation profits tax assessment at £3,000.  From that would be deducted the minimum of £2,500, leaving £500.  On that £500 they would have to pay 10 per cent., namely £50.  I have taken exactly comparable figures.</P>

If there is an advantage accruing to partners, I think in fairness that they are entitled to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not exactly deal with my particular point.  I am not at all satisfied that it is so, but I would like to hear it argued.  What I am dealing with is a private company for which I have assumed a profit of £6,000 paid out to directors. I have taken the amount paid to directors in order to compare it with the position of a partnership. I understood from the Minister, in his reply on the Second Stage of this Bill, that the £1,000, in his opinion, worked out equitably as between the two.  He did not base it at all on the argument that he was specially endeavouring to provide an additional tax for persons who earned an income from a limited company.  I would not be at all prepared to concede that in every case what Senator O Buachalla says is correct.  I would like to take the circumstances of the <Col N="1710" /> case and there are certain types of partnerships where I would not at all agree.  I think there are other cases where the partnership involves very considerable capital liability, and there might be something to be said for them, but my answer is that those types of partnerships should become limited companies. There is a type of partnership, of course, requiring limited capital, such as that of a firm of accountants, which is in a different position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Over £5,000 profit. That is so.  But, at any rate, it has been accepted as a generally acceptable figure, up to the present anyway. We have not had any cases where people protested against it.  They regarded it as a fair allowance in the circumstances.  Undoubtedly a change from £5,000 down to £2,500 will perhaps bring more notice to the particular allowance now, and it is possible that from now on we will hear more, but, so far, it has generally been accepted as a fair and reasonable allowance and we are satisfied that if we departed from it that there would probably be wholesale evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>With very great respect to the Minister, I do not think I made my point clear.  In the first place, how there can be evasion in a limit of £1,500, any more than in a limit of £1,000, is beyond me, and I have absolute confidence in the ability and efficiency of the Revenue Commissioners to detect evasions.  At any rate, I would not like to take on the job of getting away with it.  But, apart from the question of evasion, my point is this: this corporation profits tax was devised by the British Government in the last war.  There was a <Col N="1711" /> great deal of complaint with regard to its want of equity, and it was one of the taxes abolished in England after the war.  It was continued here over £10,000, and I was told then by a very responsible authority that the only reason it was retained was because of one or two very substantial concerns, whose tax we could not very well afford to lose and which could well afford to pay the tax.  Until this Government came in, it was continued at £10,000. Then it was reduced to £5,000, and even at that figure it did not catch any substantial number of private limited companies more than it had caught at £10,000.  The number of companies making £5,000 and controlled by the directors which is the kind of company to which this applies is not very great. But, as soon as you come down to £2,500, you bring in a considerable number of companies controlled by their directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you come further on in the Bill to deal with excess profits, then the Minister applies a principle which is based to some extent on justice.  When there is no object in evasion and when the salaries or directors' fees are <i>bona fide</i> ones he takes the average paid in previous years.  But this is a case you you are applying to a very large number of businesses, a new tax, a tax they have never paid before.  The adoption of it brings the £5,000 limit down to £2,500, catching a very considerable number and bringing in the type of company I have indicated.  I suggest that it is very unfair to turn now to individuals, of whom there is a good number, who have been earning £1,500 to £2,000 a year as managing directors of companies in which they have put their money and to say we would not charge you extra as partners, but we are going to bring you in and make you pay 10 per cent. on the amount of that in excess of £1,000 and although for years you have been paid salaries of £1,500 or £2,000.  To my mind, it is unfair taxation placed on the individual.  Most of us will remember a reference in a case recently in the courts where one barrister remarked that a new liability company <Col N="1712" /> would probably be formed and the reply was that they did not know, that it would probably be a partnership. Do I take it that if a private limited company winds up and becomes a partnership they can avoid this additional tax?</P>
    <P>I am convinced that if the Minister would look into it carefully he would see that individuals who have been earning a sum considerably more than £1,000, when there was no question of evasion, are now being caught under this scheme and will be charged an extra 10 per cent. in addition to increased income-tax which, I am convinced is a great hardship to certain individuals.  I raise it in all sincerity and I am not trying to make a debating point.  I am convinced that there are <i>bona fide</i> cases where hardships will occur.  I am not directly affected myself and my own business is not directly affected, but my attention has been called to a number of cases which would be affected, and I honestly believe that the proposal is not fair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly satisfied that the Senator is quite sincere in feeling that hardship would be done in this case, but, as the Senator himself admitted in the case of a partnership, partners are not allowed to reduce their profits by taking salaries, and in the type of case the Senator has in mind it is really a partnership although formed into a limited company.  They are, of course, allowed by the rules of the limited companies to draw&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

      <P>It is a considerable concession.  In 1920 or 1921&mdash;I am not quite sure which year it was&mdash;when the limit instead of being £2,500 was £500, that concession, as we are entitled to call it, still remained at £1,000.  It has not been changed and we think that it is a reasonable and equitable sum.  However, I am quite prepared to examine it again in the light of specific cases.  I am sure the Revenue Commissioners will be able to get them.  The Senator seems to think there are a good many cases that will be hit by this.  I will ask the Revenue Commissioners to go into it for me and I will discuss it with them when they have had time to make an examination of specific cases.  As the Senator seems to think strongly that grave hardship is being done, I certainly will examine this sympathetically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know if it is the intention of the Minister to charge an extra tax on an individual who has been receiving £1,500 to £2,000 for the last two or three years?  Is it his intention to charge an extra 10 per cent. on the excess over £1,000, if it happens to have been obtained from a limited company?  If they engage an employee who did not put his own money into the business, of course, it is all right, you can pay him an unlimited amount and it all can be charged in any way you see fit to pay him.  I fully appreciate the need for a limit.  I quite see that if there is a corporation profits tax at all they should not be allowed to increase salaries over the amount paid previously. It would simply provide a method of evasion.  There are two ways of remedying it.  One is as it is provided later on, in the case of excess, that there cannot be an increase, above a certain average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the intention that the Minister has, to carry on the excess <Col N="1714" /> profits tax indefinitely, what I am urging is that the limit to be equitable should be the sum in surtax.  The normal corporation profits tax can be argued as comparable to surtax which the company does not pay.  The individual pays surtax&mdash;the company pays no surtax.  I do not think it is quite equal to a 10 per cent. tax, but it is comparable to surtax.  It is not equitable, if you make a limit of £1,000 in one case and £1,500 in another.  I put to the Minister the specific point that, if a person has been director of a company not liable for corporation profits tax, a company where two or three are being paid £1,500 or £2,000, the situation really is that not only is income-tax raised to 7/6, but there is an additional 2/- put on the higher part of his income, making a total of 9/6.  If the Minister looks into it he will find that I am correct and I certainly think that, if my recommendations to change to £1,500 is not passed, he should alternatively provide that for a certain number of years a provision that the amount allowed in previous years must not be exceeded.  If he would adopt some principle to exempt a man who <i>bona fide</i> is getting it and who is paid without any question of evasion, it should not be objected to.  As it is at the moment you are simply charging 9/6 on certain salaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator mentioned that it would be a hardship on a number of smaller companies, but in the case of a company they need to have a profit exceeding £5,500 before becoming liable for corporation profits tax, with three directors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>

It is not uncommon: the Revenue Commissioners will bear that out.  In that case, it would not be £5,500 at all, but £3,000.  I am only concerned that one does not put the extra 2/- on people who are not getting an excess.</P>

Something should be done, and I do not think that, under the Standing Orders, the Minister would be able to introduce it otherwise.  If the House would allow some such recommendation to go through, the Minister can change it in an form he likes in the Dáil.  I am speaking of the practical side of the matter.  There is one recommendation going to the Dáil, at any rate.  I would seriously ask the House to agree to this.  I could withdraw the other recommendations referring to £1,500, if the Minister so desires, as they would be consequential.

      <P>In sub-section (4), line 41, page 20, that the word &ldquo;five&rdquo; be deleted and the word &ldquo;twenty-five&rdquo; be substituted therefor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is another point of a somewhat different character.  In this section it is provided that, if the particular director owns 5 per cent. of the shares there will be a limit of £1,000. If he owns 4 per cent. he can be paid any amount which the other directors think fit to pay him.  My <Col N="1717" /> object in suggesting that this should be 25 per cent. is quite different from my object in moving the previous amendment.  There has been an increasing tendency in the case of private companies&mdash;which I consider is a highly desirable one&mdash;to encourage managing directors who have been brought in from outside to put their savings into the company and gradually acquire an interest.  This has the effect of preventing those businesses from remaining simply family businesses.</P>
    <P>It is extremely hard on a man from outside who has not got control and who is not likely ever to get control but who has put his savings into the business to find that, just because he has put savings to the extent of 5 per cent. of the capital into the business, the business is to be penalised.  If you made the figure 25 per cent., it would be perfectly safe, as the individual would not be a person with control. Five per cent is far too narrow a figure.  I know cases of people who have no connection with the owner-family and who have put their savings into the company in this way.  It may be that they can avoid the tax in this case by selling their shares to one of the other directors but I think that it is not a good thing to discourage managers who have been made directors from putting their own money into the business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the Senator's recommendation, if adopted, would also lead to evasion. This provision has reference to a company controlled by directors and, if one director gives practically his whole time to the management of the company, he is entitled to special consideration. The figure of 5 per cent. is the safest figure we have been able to arrive at.</P>

      <P>We ourselves examined it very carefully.  Other figures were suggested but it was felt that, if we went any higher, there would be a temptation to evade tax by <Col N="1718" /> paying larger sums.  Such methods of evasion have been common at all times and it is very difficult to guard against them.  We believe that 5 per cent. will not bring about any great hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Evasion will be much easier with 5 per cent. than it would be with 25 per cent.  If a man has only 5 per cent. invested in the company, it will be easy for him to sell his interest to the other directors, who will be precluded in any event.  If you make the figure 25 per cent., it would be possible for managers to put money into the business to a reasonable amount, and it would not be as easy to get other directors to buy 25 per cent. as it would be to get them to buy 5 per cent., nor would it be as easy to get a managing director to sell his interest.  The capital of a private company is not, as a rule, a huge sum.  It is rarely over £10,000, and 5 per cent. of that is not a very big figure.  Very often, the capital is only £2,000.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), at the end of the sub-section, in page 23, that a new paragraph (d) be added as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(d) such sum as may have been placed to reserve not exceeding one-tenth of the aggregate of the sums calculated under paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 39 deals with excess corporation profits tax and sets out the method by which the substituted standard applicable to a company is to be calculated. If I understand it correctly, the substituted standard will really be used in two general cases: (1) where the company is a new company and has no other standard to go by, and (2) where the profits for that period are lower than the substituted standard&mdash; in other words, where the company has made a loss or has not been making a reasonable profit.  It is desirable that we should set out what would be proper provision for profit which a company should calculate in providing its capital and in starting out to carry on business.  It is quite clear that it must provide for the fixed dividends on any preference shares it has.  That is accepted and set out in the Bill.  It must also provide for payment of a dividend, at some percentage, on its ordinary shares within a reasonable time.  That is set out as 6 per cent., which is similar to the provision in Emergency Order No. 83.  It must, of course, provide for interest on debentures or debenture stock.  Interest on bank overdraft need not be <Col N="1720" /> provided for because that will be allowed for the purpose of income-tax and, therefore, will be provided in any case.  Is it sufficient for that new company to provide only for these things? I say it is not.  It is absolutely essential that the company should provide for a moderate reserve and, out of that moderate reserve, will have to be paid charges which the Minister for Finance admits are necessary, such as provision for bank overdraft and charge on debentures which are regarded as capital and, therefore, not allowed as a charge for income tax.  Anybody with business experience knows that all kinds of small charges, regarded by the income-tax authorities as capital charges are absolutely essential to keeping the business going.</P>
    <P>You may have to make some addition to your machinery to bring it up to date for no matter how you plan in the beginning there are always certain charges to be met.  You cannot go to the public for a few hundred pounds additional capital.  You must provide it out of your profits and it is essential that there should be some reserve for this purpose.  I have put down an amendment to provide for a very moderate reserve, in other words a reserve not exceeding 10 per cent. of the other charges.  I am pleading for the company&mdash;I am not interested in such a company myself&mdash;which has had a bad time and which has made lower profits than those provided for in the substituted standard.  I think that the State should recognise that there should be provision for a reserve for various purposes.  Not only is a reserve necessary to keep the capital at near par value but, as I have pointed out, the company will have to meet quite a number of charges, necessary charges, which are not allowed for income-tax purposes and the money for which will have to be found somewhere.  If you take 75 per cent. of the profits, without making any allowance in respect of these charges, it is clear that you are leaving them in an extremely bad position.  I am pleading that in the case of a new company or in the case of a company that has not been making a fair profit in years past there should be some provision <Col N="1721" /> for reserve.  If I were making such provision myself I would say that it should be about 20 per cent. but I have made the amount in the recommendation low in the hope that the Minister will accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister taken into account the case of a new company where it has not been possible to pay any dividend in the first year? In all justice, the shareholders should be entitled to something in the nature of a cumulative dividend where nothing has been paid in the first year.  It would be only fair to allow a higher rate of dividend in succeeding years than that provided for in this section. I think that 10 per cent. would be legitimate.  Has the Minister considered the case of cumulative profits at all in respect of this section?  How would cumulative preference dividends fare under this section?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would concede the point I would suggest 20 per cent. reserve, but I did not think that he would agree to such recommendation.  If the Minister will look at the balance sheets of any company, he will find that it is not at all necessary to specify the particular purpose for which a reserve is made. There is generally a general reserve which can be used for any purpose, and it is quite immaterial what the reserve is called in the circumstances. A company has often to incur necessary expenditure which will not be allowed for income-tax purposes, but the State in this case is going to take 75 per cent, not of the actual profit, but 75 per cent. based on the income-tax assessment. The public think very often that when <Col N="1722" /> you have got a company assessed with a profit of £6,000 for income-tax that the company has made in cash or even in stock £6,000 for the year.  Very often, however, that company may have made only £5,000 or considerably less, because it has had to expend certain moneys on machinery or other purposes, which moneys it could not get by an appeal to the public.  I know it is. the view of business men to whom I have spoken, a view which is also strongly held by the Federation of Irish Manufacturers, that there should be some provision for reserve.  As the tax is now amended, I am only pleading for a very small number of companies. The majority of companies will have an assessable pre-war standard.  I am proposing no change in the tax; I am simply trying to establish a more equitable standard as regards the companies for which this section is intended to provide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister be more illuminating than in his laconic reply that there is no provision for arrears?  I should like some justification of that attitude.  It seems unfair that if, as I say, a company does run into a better year, there should not be some provision for an average dividend of 6 per cent. without actually confining that dividend to the year in question.  On that basis this is a very unfair standard.</P>

We shall have to be very wary in regard to making provisions for payment of arrears of dividends or cumulative dividends.  Probably it would involve us in a considerable loss of money.  I see that a case can be made for the point made by Senator Douglas. We have had this point in mind but I have not had time to make an examination as thorough as we should like and I do not see how in the next few weeks we would be able to complete that examination.

Many individuals connected with companies, especially with companies that have been formed during the last five or six years, and have not had time to build up a reserve have made representations to us and I am having the question examined.  I do not see any possibility of the change being made, or of my examination being completed in time to make the change in this Bill, but I do feel there is a case, and in next year's Finance Bill which will give us time for the change to be examined, I might introduce some amendment if I am satisfied amendment is necessary, and as far as I can see, make it apply to all the types of companies that would be likely to be affected.</P>

Apparently taxes are being imposed on the basis that they have not been examined, and when they have been worked for a year somebody may find a remedy.  I am not <Col N="1724" /> an expert at business, but I have met some business men, and I cannot conceive how a reserve even of one-tenth of these sums mentioned in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) could be too great.  I can easily see how it could be too little, but how it could be too great baffles me.  It is clearly too little.  A third of the preference stock, 6 per cent. of the ordinary stock and interest on the debentures&mdash;is it not a tenth of these three sums?  How that sum can be too great a reserve baffles me.  Surely, every company wants a reserve, now particularly.  If the Minister accepts this recommendation surely he will not be sinning against himself by taking too great a reserve?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>If I understand the section correctly, it endeavours to make provision for assessing excess corporation profits tax for a company which has additional capital and which additional capital <Col N="1726" /> was put in after 1939.  For some reason that is completely and absolutely beyond me, the Minister applies that only to a public company.  If an individual, who is a shareholder in a private company, doubles the capital or obtains an additional director with money, no account whatever is taken for the fact that additional capital has been brought in and that it ought to earn a reasonable amount. The effect of my amendment is to make it apply to all companies where the capital had <i>bona fide</i> increased.  In neither case should it be allowed, or is it allowed, by simple writing up of capital, but this is a case where additional cash is brought in and it should apply equally to a private company. The private company cannot, as the Minister no doubt knows, issue an invitation to the public because if it did, it would cease to be a private company. That means that at present if any individual wants to invest additional money in an Irish private company knows that it would not be allowed to make any additional profits except such balance as may be left after the full tax charges, which, the Minister pointed out, come to 75 per cent.  The only course left for him is to invest in some other company, or to put his money in an English concern, or in Government securities, or something of that kind. At a time like this, it may become absolutely necessary for additional money to be obtained for private companies without their becoming public companies.</P>
    <P>We see by the last vote that the Fianna Fáil Party has no sympathy with the provision of a reserve, but are they prepared to take the stand that they are against the position of putting money into capital in a company formed by Irish enterprise, or that if it is put in, it must not receive any additional provision but must pay excess profits tax to the full amount? That point is met so far as public companies are concerned, but my objection is that the exclusion of private companies is inequitable.</P>

      <P>We are satisfied that if what is agreed as the proper-procedure <Col N="1727" /> with regard to public companies were adopted in relation to private companies, it would lead to abuses, and I have a number of examples of actual cases which I should like to read to the House to show the kind of things that have happened.  We would be inviting people to indulge in these things if we made the same provision for private companies as we propose to do in the case of public companies.  This is not an actual case. Private company A has a profits standard of £10,000.  It writes up its premises and goodwill by a fictitious amount of £50,000, which it credits to a reserve account.  It then capitalises this reserve by the issue of 50,000 ordinary shares of £l each issued to its shareholders.  By so doing, under the terms of the section, if it were amended on the lines of the recommendation of Senator Douglas, it would obtain a deduction from chargeable profits of £50,000 at 6 per cent., or £3,000.</P>

      <P>I will read these examples.  Example 2 is an actual case. Company B was registered six years ago, and has a nominal capital of £5,000.  Its original issued capital was £3,000 held by its three directors, members of one family.  Profits for six years were £35,000 after payment of directors' fees, £15,000; profit standard, £5,000 and reserves (part), £3,000.  The company's nominal capital is now increased to £20,000, reserves are capitalised to the extent of £3,000, and bonuses issued to directors are £2,000. New capital issued to directors in lieu is £5,000.  If the recommendation were accepted, a deduction of £300 in respect of an artificial transaction would be given.  The capitalisation of the £3,000 reserve involved a loss of surtax on this sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third example is also an actual case.  Private Company C was registered four years ago with a nominal capital of £5,000 and issued capital of £5,000.  Profits for six years were <Col N="1728" /> £75,000 after payment of directors' fees which were substantial but not exceptional and the profits standard was £13,500.  The last balance sheet disclosed reserves of £45,000.  If the nominal capital were increased and reserves capitalised and issued to the shareholders, a deduction of £45,000 at 6 per cent. could be claimed in a chargeable accounting period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>These are four cases typical of a number of these private companies and typical of the way they could treat their reserves by capitalising them and escaping the tax. Private Company D, another actual case, was registered six years ago with a nominal capital of £10,000 and an issued capital of £10,000.  Profits for five years available were £60,000 after payment of directors' fees, which were substantial, but unexceptional, and the profits standard was £12,500 approximately. For the last of the five years the dividend distribution was 180 per cent., amounting to £18,000.  If this amount were then put back into the company through the increasing of the company's capital and the issue of £18,000 shares, a deduction of £1,080 from chargeable profits could be claimed on the basis of the Senator's recommendation, if it were adopted. Therefore, Senators will see what has happened in a number of these cases where they have capitalised their reserves.  They have been able to escape very heavy liability to tax and we would be inviting many similar cases if we were to adopt Senator Douglas's recommendation.</P>

      <P>I feel that all this is very technical.  It should be further examined.  In these cases which the <Col N="1729" /> Minister has mentioned, there seem to have been fantastic earnings by the companies.  Surely if those earnings are there, that money is earning dividends and the mere fact of converting it into capital would not, I think, affect the case at all.  Would the Minister consider the point?  Would the fact of turning these reserves, already in the business and earning, affect the basis of the excess profits calculation at all? I am not clear at all about it.  The Minister has not answered this point, if it was raised: what is to prevent a public company doing the same thing as the private company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to point out to the Minister that what purports to be an argument is not an argument at all.  If a man were brought before the courts on the grounds that he was in a crowd and hit out at seven blue-eyed men in the crowd and injured them, no doubt he could bring witnesses to say that because blue-eyed men had often attacked other men, it was necessary for him to take this action before they hit him.  To bring up these four cases and say that these things could happen if the law were otherwise is not an argument.  If a private company, a family company, is not doing well and it is necessary to keep the company going, this means that people must put money into it.  The Minister, without any regard to what I consider is ordinary justice, contends that they should suffer the loss of the capital they have brought in, lest some other company under the same law should take an opportunity of swindling the Government.  The Government's business is to make just laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When they have made the laws, they see that human ingenuity sets out to try to evade the purposes of those laws.  If the Government turns around now and says: &ldquo;we must make laws which it would be impossible for anyone to get around,&rdquo; that is the Government's business.  But, in order that some ingenious and ill-disposed persons should not be cleverer than the Government, the Government not knowing how to legislate properly, the Government <Col N="1730" /> is going to condemn people either to stand by and see their businesses probably wound up and going to ruin for lack of extra capital, or say that people who put their money in must suffer the loss so that the Government will reap everything in the form of taxation.  Now, in regard to every law on the Statute Book, there are people who set out to evade it.  They would set out to evade the Ten Commandments. The Minister says that, lest that should happen, he must make a law without any regard to the rights of the citizens, and although they may suffer injustice, so that it would be impossible for anyone with human ingenuity to get round the law.</P>
    <P>The Minister cites four cases where he knows exactly what was done.  He can now legislate in a way to make it specifically impossible for these identical things to happen.  Instead of doing that, he makes a law which does not aim at giving justice to all the citizens in this State.  He reads these four cases, where people have sought a loophole in the law as it stands, to benefit themselves.  The Government's business is to prevent that, but not to do it by creating a greater evil and, lest four people should swindle the Government, to enable the Government to swindle 400 people.  The Minister's reading of these four cases is a complete waste of our time, as it is completely irrelevant to the matter under discussion.  If the Minister can say that it is nationally necessary or naturally just that the law should be as it is, he could get up and explain it; but it is completely irrelevant to say that, as the law was some time ago, people were able to work a clever deal.  One could justify anything on those grounds.  You could justify murdering a man where you could point out that, if the man had been murdered first he would not be able to murder another man.  That sort of argument is too cheap&mdash;it is not an argument at all.</P>
    <P>We have listened to a case where the Minister admitted that a recommendation proposed was in itself desirable. He accepted it in principle, but then went on to say that he intended to legislate against the proposition which <Col N="1731" /> he accepted as right in principle.  He was able to get all the members of his own Party to support him, though he himself admitted that the recommendation was right in principle.  It makes all legislation perfectly absurd.  The Minister can get a regimented party to support him in an enactment which he himself admits is wrong.  He says he is legislating without any regard to the total concerned, but only for the purpose of covering these four people. It is an insult to this institution, when one party will support the Minister in this matter, although he admits it is wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot quite agree with Senator Fitzgerald that some of the fantastic cases read by the Minister are not relevant.  I think they are quite relevant and I agree that he has found a technical flaw in the wording of my recommendation, which it would not be necessary to read such cases in order to find.  If the Minister's only object in having the section as it now stands is to prevent evasion, and if he has no objection to providing for the <i>bona fide</i> addition of cash which was not in the business before, in the case of private companies, then the matter can be met in a different way.  If his intention is, as I take it to be from the Bill, to prevent additional cash being put into private companies, then I could not agree.  If it is because he could not think of any way, I suggest that a different type of recommendation would be desirable.  It is definitely desirable that this particular wording, &ldquo;consequent on an invitation to the public to subscribe therefor&rdquo; should be cut out, and in its place there should be &ldquo;provided that the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that actual cash not previously in the business has been subscribed.&rdquo; That should apply in both public and private companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a public company wrote up its reserves and then issued its shares partly paid to the public, it would be just as objectionable from the point of view of evasion.  I ask to be allowed to carry this recommendation <Col N="1732" /> to the Report Stage, so that I can bring in an additional recommendation to meet the particular point made by the Minister.  I do not want evasion, and quite recognise that, if you simply allowed an increase of capital&mdash;which may be only on paper&mdash;you would be completely evading the position.  I do not want that, and I have referred to it previously.  In the case of money that is in cash and that may be available, I want a company to be able to get it and to pay a reasonable amount on it.  I find it impossible to believe that the Minister would not wish that. I do not at all agree that he has done it in Section 41 except in some doubtful way in the case of a public company.  I propose to leave this recommendation over and to change its form for the Report Stage.</P>

I hope the recommendations will be accepted&mdash;even if the Dáil does not pass them&mdash;and so afford us a constitutional opportunity to improve Finance Bills in the only way open to us.</P>

      <P>May I add a comment on what Senator Hayes said on the last section about this being &ldquo;experimental legislation?&rdquo;  It is largely experimental.  We have had nothing of the kind in our legislation before. I adopt this attitude with regard to it: I do not want to be oppressive on any public company doing good work, employing people and earning profits.  I know that the taxes are heavy.  Some regard them as very oppressive.  I quite agree with Senator Hayes&mdash; though he did not mean it as a compliment&mdash;that this taxation is experimental. I do not see any reason to be ashamed of saying that these taxes are new.  We have not had experience of this type of taxation before.  I do not want to injure any public company.  If after a year's working, I find that this taxation is oppressive, or has hurt existing industries or businesses, public or private, which are doing good work, giving good employment, earning good profit and revenue for the taxpayer, I am prepared to reconsider it and <Col N="1734" /> amend it, bearing in mind the necessity to get revenue.</P>

In so far as evasion of taxes is concerned, I happen to belong to a class who cannot evade paying taxes on what they earn, and never could.  I am whole-heartedly and entirely with the Minister in any efforts he makes, or any experiments he carries out, or any amendment he brings in to prevent people from evading the payment of taxes that are lawfully and properly imposed upon them by the Oireachtas.  If, in addition to experimenting in this way&mdash;I am using the word in its complimentary sense&mdash; he cares to indulge in any new experimetal methods for getting after the tax dodger, I am with him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad is of opinion that the Government should take immediate steps to complete the purchase and transfer to co-operative ownership of all existing proprietary creameries, including those managed by the Dairy Disposal Company, Ltd., with a view to the more effective regulation and control of the dairying industry.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to discuss this motion at any great length, and I do not propose to delay the House for any considerable period in what I have got to say.  There can, however, be no discussion of this motion at all without taking into consideration the wider implications of the co-operative movement as a whole.  I should like to say at the outset in moving the motion, that I am fortunate in dealing with a Minister who, throughout his association with the Ministry of Agriculture or the industry of agriculture, has given definite proof of his sympathy for the co-operative movement, and has shown a recognition of the work it has done, the value of it, and the necessity for it amongst the farming community.  In suggesting that the Government should take immediate steps to complete the purchase and transfer of the creameries that are still in the possession of proprietary companies as well as those managed by the Dairy Disposal Company, I appreciate the fact that I am raising a number of problems that cannot be solved, right away, and that many questions can be put to me which I am not at the moment competent to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion&mdash;in fact I never had any other point of <Col N="1737" /> view&mdash;that the co-operative movement in this country despite its many critics, taking into account the difficulties through which it has passed and the obstacles in its path at the time of its establishment, has grown into a wonderful institution and I often wonder what agricultural Ireland would be like to-day but for its existence.  I think that all who have had association with it should be very proud of its achievement.  It can be truthfully said that it has built up as fine a business institution as can be found inside the country or outside it, despite the many obstacles it has had to face and overcome.  I think that it is also true to say that we have reached a stage now when we must make up our minds in regard to the future, whether the co-operative movement is to be kept on and, so to speak, to cultivate new fields or whether we are to accept the point of view that it has grown to its full stature and that nothing more is possible by way of new achievement for it.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the latter point of view at all.  I believe that the fuller development of the co-operative movement is essential to progressive agriculture in Ireland.  I believe that a great many of our most progressive farmers are children of the co-operative movement.  They have grown to manhood in an atmosphere in which they were nurtured in co-operative ideals and the great bulk of the most successful farmers we have got in the country are men who have been brought up in the co-operative school of thought.  I think that the success and progress of the farming community in future are dependent to a very great extent on the continued growth and expansion of the co-operative movement, on a fuller and more complete development than we have yet seen.</P>
    <P>I believe that we have reached a stage now when we must take stock of what we have accomplished so far to see what we are going to do with regard to the future.  Now, the co-operative movement has critics I know. There are critics of it in the co-operative <Col N="1738" /> movement itself and there are a great many outside it.  There were a great many in the country who were very fearful of it and the consequence when the movement was initiated away back in the 90's, but the fruits that have been reaped from the activities of the early co-operators must be applauded by all, even by the critics of those days.  And if we accept that dairy farming in this country could never have survived without the bringing into existence of and the progress of the co-operative movement it obviously follows that the measure of success we achieve in the future is to a great extent contingent on the continued development of that movement.</P>
    <P>We have to admit that for a number of years we cannot point out with truth that there has been that development of co-operation which most of us would like to have seen. Back in 1927, in the days of the predecessor of the present Minister for Agriculture, it was found necessary to introduce an Act we might say, to rationalise the dairying industry.  Now it would be rather interesting to go back to the atmosphere of those days and look at the point of view expressed by the Minister who found it necessary in 1927 to introduce a Co-operative Act or Creamery Act as we call it.  He told the Dáil that amongst the reasons that urged him to introduce it was that intense competition between proprietaries and co-operatives for milk supply was making the position of the creamery industry as a whole impossible.</P>
    <P>The Minister of that day said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The extreme case is where a co-operative and a proprietary central are situate in the same district practically alongside each other, and where each has anything from three to ten auxiliaries existing side by side with those of its competitor, all competing for the same milk supplies. This is not uncommon; while in other districts there are co-operative and proprietary groups touching and competing with each other at various points.  This is always the position where there is a proprietorial and co-operative competition. When a proprietary creamery is <Col N="1739" /> operating without co-operative competition, the temptation to give what will be regarded by farmers as poor prices for milk is overwhelming, and rightly or wrongly, farmers spurred on by the example of co-operative creameries in other dis tricts will always insist on erecting creameries themselves, so as to provide an alternative outlet for their milk supplies.  In this way, as long as there are both proprietary and co-operative creameries in the same province, there always will be redundancy. Redundancy means increased overhead expenses, and the exact position at the moment in the districts where proprietary and co-operative competition is going on is that the farmers of these districts are paying always twice, and often three times the overhead expenses that are required for efficient production.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on to indicate what the position was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In every agricultural country in Europe and America farmers' organisations were provided with suitable credits, and from a very early stage their developments were guided by co-operative legislation.  Here they were left without either.  It used to be the fashion here to talk loosely about the inefficiency of farmers and farmers' organisation.  Everybody heard of a few co-operative creameries that failed, and sweeping deductions were drawn from these comparatively few failures, very much to the discredit of the industry as a whole.  The fact is that the existence, in spite of all the disadvantages, of 400 co-operative creameries out of a total of 580 is an extraordinary tesimony to the pioneer work of the I.A.O.S., and to the capacity and loyalty of the Irish farmers.  In no other country had farmers' organisation to grapple unaided with the same difficulties, and they are entitled to ask from the State now the facilities which have been refused them for so long.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Following the introduction of the Act there was to be another Act called the <Col N="1740" /> Co-operative Act in which he was to have the co-operative creameries affiliated to one central body and in addition there was to be introduced another Act that would enable them to find credit.  Other things happened in 1927 and here we are now in 1941.  In 1927 out of 580, there were 400 co-operative creameries.  To-day the position is that we have approximately 450 co-operatives, 21 proprietary concerns, and in the hands of the Dairy Disposal Company we have 18 centrals and 106 branches approximately, so that the position after almost 14 years is that we have a co-operative movement with about 50 added to the number.  We have outside the co-operative movement this other large group in the hands of the Dairy Disposal Company and 21 creameries in the hands of proprietaries.  Now if it is asked why more progress has not been made by the co-operative movement&mdash; the people who put that question are frequently blind to the progress that was made up to the year 1921 or 1922 and blind to some of the progress that was made up to the year 1932 or 1933 &mdash;I think the true answer is that the co-operative movement is in an impossible position.</P>
    <P>Dairying is the foundation of Irish agriculture and side by side with our co-operative creameries all over we have creameries in the hands of proprietaries and these other concerns in the hands of the Dairy Disposal Company. The net result is that we have never been able to get that strength collected under the banner of co-operation which is essential to the progress of the co-operative movement and the bettering of conditions for Irish farming.  The number, undoubtedly, is smaller, but the conditions are just as they were then. There is a co-operative creamery, perhaps, on one side of the road and a proprietary concern on the other, both plying in the same area for a supply of milk which is just adequate to keep one creamery working efficiently.  The overhead expenses, obviously, on the farmers are much greater than they ought to be; the price of milk to the farmer is correspondingly low.  The co-operative movement is suffering <Col N="1741" /> from the depression of intense competition which it should not have to face.  The co-operative spirit, generally, cannot prosper and grow strong and go on to further development under such crippling conditions.  That is the fact with regard to the undoubtedly limited number of proprietary concerns. I think it is true to say that a number of the co-operative creameries in these areas have for long been prepared to purchase these concerns but somehow it has not been possible for the co-operatives to get possession of them.  If the milk which at present is supplied to the proprietary concerns were passed over to the co-operative creameries, the net result would be a better price for milk, lower working expenses and a cheerier tone in farming circles in these areas generally.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Dairy Disposal Company, that, I know, is a much more difficult proposition, but there are, I think, reasons why this problem has to be faced up to and tackled in a way which, up to the present, anyhow, we have not given evidence that we were prepared to try in order to solve the situation.  Until the problem is solved satisfactorily it is going to leave the co-operative movement a very unfinished project in this country.  It is interesting to refer to the point of view of the late Minister for Agriculture in reference to the policy of the transference of the creameries from the old Newmarket Dairy Company, which was then to be a holding body, and which has since grown into this Dairy Disposals Board and Dairy Disposal Company. To-day, as we all see it, it is very largely a Government concern, run by men&mdash;competent and able, no doubt; I am not questioning that at all&mdash;but whom we regard as civil servants.  I think from the point of view of the State, that policy was thoroughly unsound and very dangerous.  This is what the late Minister for Agriculture said with regard to what his intention was:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I hope that nobody will make the mistake of regarding this transaction as the beginnings of a policy under which the Government proposes to <Col N="1742" /> run the creameries of the country. The exact contrary is the fact.  The purchase of these creameries has no justification other than it is a necessary preliminary to the efficient working of the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the Co-operative Act.  The Co-operative Act will regulate and define the conditions under which existing societies may operate, and new societies be established.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the point of view expressed by the then Minister for Agriculture. I was a member of the Oireachtas at the time that measure was going through.  All of us believed, when that statement was made by the late Mr. Hogan, that five years, at the outside limit, would be a sufficient period to enable the transfer from these creameries to co-operative ownership to take place.  I think it is true to say that no progress whatever has been made in that direction nor is there any evidence of any possible progress in the near future towards that end.  Those of us who pin our faith to a wider development of the co-operative movement see no possibility whatever of that wider development until the organisation under the aegis and control of the Dairy Disposal Company and those other organisations in the hands of proprietors are transferred from these authorities to the ownership and control of farmers in the co-operative movement.</P>
    <P>I realise, of course, the difficulties and the complexities that face the Ministry of Agriculture in attempting this but I suggest to the Minister that the first step in this country towards putting the dairying industry on a sound basis is the introduction and passing of a Co-operative Act, making it obligatory on every co-operative concern in the country to be affiliated to one central organisation, putting the responsibility then on all these co-operators to do, if the necessity arises, what the Dairy Disposal Company have had to do in certain districts in the country.  The unfortunate position that a number of our co-operative creameries is confronted with in certain areas is that, in their relations with the Dairy Disposal Company they <Col N="1743" /> are in an exactly similar position to that which they formerly occupied in relation to the old Newmarket Dairy Company, or Cleeve's.  It is true to say that while under the Creamery Act and regulations made under that Act, all our creameries are prevented from doing certain things, the Dairy Disposal Company, that ought to be bound by these regulations like any co-operative creamery, is in fact in certain districts going outside the regulations, breaking the regulations, and doing what a co-operative creamery cannot do.  One of the regulations is that a creamery cannot take from another creamery a supplier who passed over to that creamery from one of the redundant creameries because in fact the redundant creamery was bought and paid for by these co-operatives and there was an obligation on that farmer to put up a certain amount of share capital.  A long loan, no doubt, was the means by which this was done, but while the co-operative movement and the co-operative creameries are prevented, and have been prosecuted in some instances for breaking these regulations, there are instances where the Dairy Disposal Company are actually accepting milk from suppliers of transferred creameries which they are not under the law entitled to do.</P>
    <P>It is suggested, too, that in certain other districts the Dairy Disposal Company, where they are in competition with co-operative creameries&mdash;and they are in competition with co-operative creameries in certain districts in the country&mdash;are in fact paying higher prices in those districts than they are paying in other districts in the country where they are not in competition with co-operative creameries.  I think all that is very tragic.  In fact, from my point of view, it is disastrous for what we have all come to look upon as a semi-State organisation to be in the position of paying farmers a certain price for milk in one district and paying them a lower price for milk in another district. There is not that equity about that transaction which we would like to feel would be the dominant consideration in a semi-State organisation or in any <Col N="1744" /> commercial organisation, in its relations with those with whom it carries on trade.  But, there is something more about it.  I am not disputing the fact that you had to have the holding body, the Dairy Disposal Board, brought into existence to take over and to transfer these creameries, but I say that while it was essential as a medium to do a certain job, its existence as a trading organisation in the dairying industry to-day has the effect of paralysing the movement to a degree which is not at all being appreciated. Unless we can make up our minds that we are going to build up the co-operative movement as the biggest instrument the farmers have created, and the biggest instrument for the welfare of the farmers, we are preventing that development by the existence of this semi-State trading body which, to say the least of it, we have no reason to believe is in any way sympathetic to the interests of co-operators.</P>
    <P>We are satisfied there is criticism of the co-operative movement in the existence of the Dairy Disposal Company for so long, but there is the other consideration as well.  The law provided that our transferred milk suppliers to co-operative creameries were obliged to subscribe capital to the creamery by which they were taken over.  A loan was raised, no doubt, to enable this to be done, but there is no evidence that the same law applies as regards the creameries that are being operated under the Dairy Disposal Company or that the same obligation has to be borne by the farmer-supplier to this institution at all. Now, you cannot have one regulation for a farmer going to a co-operative creamery and another for a farmer going to a proprietary creamery or a Dairy Disposal Company's creamery, and believe at the same time that the co-operative movement can go on to further strength under these conditions. I believe we have reached the point when we have got to make up our minds whether this institution is to continue as an essential element in the dairying industry in this country or whether something else is to be done with it.  At the moment, if one might <Col N="1745" /> make any criticism, one might say that instead of the co-operative creameries getting possession of these creameries, as it was anticipated they would, a certain number of the co-operative creameries have, in fact, gone over to the Dairy Disposal Company.  I know that there were reasons for that.  I can be asked what could be done if the Disposal Company was not there, but I will put this to the Minister, that his policy in the matter ought to be the immediate introduction of a Co-operative Bill, putting the obligation on every co-operative creamery to come into a federation or organisation where they would, so to speak, be under a vocational scheme organised, controlled and managed as a branch of the industry.  If there were lame dogs inside that vocational scheme, they would have to be helped along.  Let the whole organisation help them along, let them bear the cost and responsibilities of guiding, helping, controlling and managing their business, until they have grown to manhood's estate and can manage it for themselves.</P>
    <P>If a Co-operative Bill had been introduced immediately after the passing into law of the Creameries Act, the position would be entirely different to-day. The creameries concerned would now be able to manage for themselves. The Department would have been able, as it ought to have been able, to put the responsibility on the co-operative movement to manage their business as co-operative creameries in districts where their competence and experience might justify them in believing they were able to do it efficiently for themselves.  We have proof and evidence in the co-operative movement of the business ability and capacity of our committees to look after their affairs successfully, and from what we know of them, it cannot be alleged against the movement as a whole that they are not capable of doing much more for the industry generally than has been done up to the present.  They have conquered and won in certain territories.  Some of them will have to win against intense competition, and win in development even when the competition has passed <Col N="1746" /> away.  They have given ample evidence of greater efficiency than any proprietary concern or the Dairy Disposal Company can show.  I have not the slightest doubt that, in the areas where creameries have passed out of existence and under the control of the Dairy Disposal Board, these creameries could have been managed efficiently by a co-operative federation, if that were established under and in accordance with law, where all men in the co-operative movement would have obligations and responsibilities which they could not evade or avoid.  I believe that in the bigger area being operated by the Dairy Disposal Board in Clare the same thing would apply.</P>
    <P>The time has come now when we must make up our minds as to whether the present position will be stabilised for years to come, or whether we are to do something else.  I urge on the Minister that the time is ripe.  In the days when the Creamery Act was being passed through the House there was goodwill from all sides.  The Minister got help, assistance and co-operation. He was spending a great deal of money belonging to the State, but he was doing the right thing and was saving thousands of farmers from bankruptcy and from being smashed by competition that was financed partly outside the country and partly within it.  He was saving them from the consequences of being smashed by the trading organisation and from the depression that would inevitably follow.  It was deemed wise and right in those days to spend the State's money and it would appear, to a certain extent, in our time to be almost revolutionary, but had not that been done what would be the condition in the dairying industry where these concerns operate? We went so far on the road: are we going to continue the advance or be satisfied with the present position for another ten years?  I do not think we can be satisfied.</P>
    <P>In certain creamery districts there is intense feeling, which I know is restricted, as the area is somewhat smaller than it was.  The feelings are not just what they were in the old days. Nevertheless, there were a number of creameries affected and there were <Col N="1747" /> difficulties which had to be solved.  An immediate solution is necessary.  The first consideration in my mind is in regard to the Dairy Disposal Board, and it is that it is obviously wrong to have a semi-State organisation like that in trade without that responsibility on the part of its officials which those engaged in a co-operative or an ordinary concern would have to the committee of management.  You have a certain number of unquestionably competent people, but there is the State behind it and the State's finances have been drawn on to keep it working. To what extent these finances have been drawn on I do not know, but that is something which the country would like to know.  In itself, that position is unsound.  If the Minister regarded it as essential for the whole future of the dairying industry that that institution should continue, it would be better to set up something like the Electricity Supply Board or the Agricultural Credit Corporation and make annual grants to keep it in operation, rather than continue the present conditions. The more quickly the Minister extracts himself and the State from connection with that sort of business the better, and the more sound it will be for the State as a whole.</P>
    <P>In addition, we must make up our minds that the further growth and development of the co-operative movement is positively essential to agricultural progress.  In order to get strength, every creamery and dairying organisation should be brought within the folds of the co-operative movement and whatever steps are necessary towards that end should be taken by the Minister.  I know that much of the State's money is locked up in the Dairy Disposal Board.  To have that work passed over to the farmer to do is an obligation which, perhaps, some farmers are not prepared to accept voluntarily.  However, I believe that ultimately it would be better to impose the obligation on the farmer, as the present conditions prevent a general development of farming, which we must have in order to maintain that higher standard which the farmers and the country require.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1748" /> Action must be taken with regard to finance, to enable the farmers to become the owners of the creamery organisations at present operating in the territory managed by the Dairy Disposal Board.  I do not think that creates any problem at all.  These creameries, in the hands of farmers and of men whom the farmers will put into the work of management&mdash;and probably they are many of the men managing them to-day&mdash;will be just as efficient as they are at the moment.  There will be the added advantage that, for the first time in the country's history, the dairy industry as a whole will be co-operatively owned.  Steps can be taken then to bring into operation the Co-operative Bill which has been promised for some 15 years or more.  Under that Bill, every unit of the co-operative movement will be brought into a federated organisation where all will have their obligations, responsibilities and rights.  Then you will have taken the first steps towards putting the co-operative movement in a position when it will be able to cultivate new fields. There is no doubt whatever that but for the existence of this sort of competition and but for the struggle and fight waged by a great many farmers, the constructive work done in these areas by the co-operative concerns could not have been attempted.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the time is ripe now for the Minister to tell the country not alone what he will do but that he will do it.  No doubt there would be certain objections to the changes in the present position from certain interested parties in certain areas.  Politically, it will not bring the Minister any great kudos.  I know it did not bring his predecessor any considerable support, but that did not deter him from doing what he thought right.  In a question like this, where I believe the interests of the agricultural industry as a whole are so bound up with the development of the co-operative movement, we must do the right thing, regardless of the individual interests that will be affected by it.  The Minister could be busy day after day hearing from deputations as to why farmers should not be asked to take over these responsibilities.  What <Col N="1749" /> hope is there for a country or a people not prepared to shoulder responsibility? One cannot have any great respect for a group of men who will go to a Minister, a Deputy or a Senator and say they do not want to take this on or that they are not competent.  I do not know whether some of them would urge that they are not competent. There has been evidence of incompetence and failure, but there is overwhelming evidence of competence and success, and this can be pointed out.</P>
    <P>If we are to make our people what we would like them to be, we must put responsibility on them in local districts around their own homes, and teach them to build up in their own parishes and local areas that kind of organisation and those institutions which are the factors in social and economic life that can help in economic development and social progress.  That can be a medium for educating and strengthening them economically and helping the industry on to better times.  If there are men who plead they do not want this done, and do not wish to take on the financial obligations which it entails, one answer is that, in more difficult days, in days when farmers were more poverty-stricken than they are to-day, the pioneers of the co-operative movement went out and put their money and their faith into the work of building creameries where, in many cases, there was poor land and poor prospects. They are proud of that to-day, and their sons are proud of it.  If these people are not prepared to do what others attempted in more difficult times, it is our obligation to teach them to have more confidence in themselves. If the obligation is put on them, I believe they would be astonished at what they can do; and when they have discovered their own strength and capacity to do these things and the pleasure that ownership gives and can give&mdash;whether it be ownership in full or in part&mdash;in successful commercial institutions, the seed will have been sown which will produce good fruit.  New developments will take place in those districts, which never would be attempted under the conditions which exist to-day.  While <Col N="1750" /> those conditions exist, one cannot hope for real progress in agriculture.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I realise that there are many difficulties confronting the Minister, if he is prepared to do this. One or two questions which the Minister should put to himself are: Did the late Mr. Hogan do the right thing when he introduced this first Act?  Should the work which he started be completed or not?  If it be not completed, are we to be content to leave things as they are, and what will the consequences be?  Few will disagree with the statement that the late Mr. Hogan was right, that his aim was right and that, had he not done as he did, conditions would be very different to-day in many of our dairying industries.  The Minister will have obstacles to surmount and difficulties to contend with, even from his friends.  However, he has pursued this policy and I have no reason to doubt&mdash;and I have no evidence&mdash;that his policy was not the same as his predecessors in relation to the co-operative movement.  If he is prepared to pursue this policy, he will have the backing of very many people and will win the admiration of a great many people who, perhaps, to-day are rather lukewarm towards such a proposition.</P>
    <P>He also will inculcate in districts where the standard of citizenship is not as high as it should be, a new outlook on life and a new approach to problems.  In this respect there is an obligation on him, and on everyone who can help him, to try to inculcate a better understanding of true citizenship than exists in many places at the moment.  The atmosphere and conditions in many parts of the country at the present time are favourable for such an attempt as this.  We cannot stay put, we must go on to new things and make new efforts.  In a way, this is not a new effort, but the completion of work begun by somebody else.  It should be completed by the man who succeeded Mr. Hogan in the Department of Agriculture.  If the Minister tells the House and the country that he will go on with this and put the co-operative movement into practice by completing the transfer of all these <Col N="1751" /> creameries and by the introduction and passing of a Co-operative Bill, the Minister will have left, when he passes out, a monument to his efforts that will last and an Act that will, through its operation, enable the farmers to do a great many things for themselves which they are expecting him and the Department officials to do for them at the moment. I am conscious in a way, of my incapacity to deal with this problem in the manner which I should like.  I am not as intimate with it as are a number of the southern representatives but I have heard a great deal about it over many years.  I know that it is a difficult problem but it is one of the problems which ought to be tackled and solved.  I believe that the time to do that is now and I hope the House will accept the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a strong supporter of the proposal that the farmers should get control of these co-operative creameries.  The first step to be taken should be to organise the farmers in the areas where the Dairy Disposal Company functions and where the proprietary creameries function.  If the farmers are prepared to foot the bill and are anxious that the creameries should be handed over, I think that it would be only right and just that the Government should give them every facility and hand them over.  At the same time, they should understand their responsibility.  They should educate themselves as regards the requirements and they should realise that they would have a heavy responsibility in taking over the creameries, especially at this stage.  I would suggest that the baby should be left with the Government during the war.  From my experience of the farmers, they are not in a position, unfortunately, to get cash from either the banks or the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  If they feel that they are getting a fair return for the milk supplied to the creameries of the Dairy Disposal Company and the proprietary creameries, I am sure they are quite willing to accept that <Col N="1752" /> and have no further responsibility.  At the same time, I do not agree that it is fair that any body but the farmers should own the creameries.  If the Government could see its way to hand over these creameries at a reasonable price, I am sure everybody in this House, and outside it, would encourage the farmers to take control of their own affairs.</P>

      <P>I know very little about the dairying organisation but, listening to Senator Baxter, I thought he made a very convincing case for this motion.  The only reason I rise is to put a few questions to Senator Baxter which would help me to support this motion.  I should like to know what demand there is from the farmers supplying the Dairy Disposal Company and if they are willing to scrap that company and go into a co-operative organisation.  Then, what about the independent co-operative people?  Are they satisfied to go in and work with the others?  What about the proprietary creameries?  Are they satisfied? If there is any demand from the farmers who are suppliers to these creameries, I think that the Minister should have no hesitation in accepting the motion put down by Senator Baxter.  As one who supported the late Minister for Agriculture in establishing the Dairy Disposal Board, I have been assured by many competent persons since that it is working very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter suggested that, if this could not be done, some authority such as the Electricity Supply Board should be set up.  I should like to know from Senator Baxter what objection he has to making the Dairy Disposal Company the sole authority.  They must have a great deal of experience by now, and they must have acquired a lot of knowledge from that experience.  Why not constitute them the sole authority for managing the organisation which it is proposed to set up?  I am not completely convinced that this co-operative business is the wonderful success Senator Baxter makes it out to be, except you have competent managers. Still, I think he has made a very strong case, which should be given careful <Col N="1753" /> consideration by the Minister and his Department.  I should like to hear what the Minister has to say before supporting or opposing the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColbert" hpid="Mr. Colbert Mr. Colbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colbert</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to mention a few points in supporting this motion.  As Senator Baxter pointed out, all Parties in the Dáil agreed in 1927 that complete control of the dairying industry should be placed in the hands of the farmers themselves.  The working of that Act was made pretty difficult by reason of the fact that some of the concerns refused to sell.  I know of one large co-operative concern in West Cork which, owing to the position of the proprietary concerns, were not able to issue a single share.  The competition provided by the proprietary concern put them in a certain difficulty. The suppliers were able to take their supplies over to the proprietary concern.  In fact, in this case, the proprietary concern carted the milk free of charge for the farmers and even went so far as to take the suppliers' children to school.  Last year 2,000 gallons of milk were taken by this particular concern and that is still happening.  The peculiar feature of this case is that the co-operative concern has been paying a higher price for milk than the proprietary concern.  One might ask how it is then that suppliers are not transferring their supplies to the co-operative concern?  So far as one can learn, a certain number of these suppliers are &ldquo;tied&rdquo; and, in other cases where the people are not tied, a higher price is being paid.  That sort of competition is bad for the dairying industry as a whole.  We have had too much cut-throat competition already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know cases where agents of creameries at one time took their supplies across Channel in order to undercut creameries in the market across the way.  This form of competition to-day is somewhat similar and it is very bad for the dairying industry. People may say that competition is the life of trade, but I do not think that that applies in the case of dairying. In the case of the proprietary concerns, the profits go entirely into the pockets of the owners, whereas, in the case of <Col N="1754" /> the co-operative concerns, the profits are distributed amongst the suppliers.</P>
    <P>As regards the part of the motion dealing with the transfer of the creameries under the Dairy Disposal Company, I am not sure that that is a feasible proposition at the present time.  In certain areas these creameries are necessary in order further to develop the industry and I would be more inclined to let that side of the question stand aside for a moment.</P>
    <P>We know that large sums have been expended in the purchase of private concerns such as Cleeve's and others and until the job is completed the whole aim of the 1928 Act will not have been achieved.  I would urge on the Minister if possible to complete the purchase of these creameries under the 1928 Act.  They are comparatively few in number now but where they exist they are certainly detrimental to the success of the co-operative creameries. At the present time everything possible should be done to help the dairying industry.  It is in a bad way and unless something can be done to help the creameries there is grave danger that a great number of them will go out of production altogether.  It is not perhaps generally known, but I am in possession of statistics to prove it, that in the dairying counties more employment is given per acre than in the tillage areas.  Dairying is the foundation of our agricultural economy in this country.  It is responsible for the maintenance of the balance of trade with our friends across the water&mdash; formerly the store cattle trade and now the fat cattle and dead meat trade.  If dairying goes down there will not be very many cattle in the country.  I should like to see a guaranteed minimum price for the producer of milk similar to the guaranteed prices given for crops in the tillage areas.  I would urge the Minister to give this matter his close attention and to see what can be done to bring about an improvement in the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I came into the House with a perfectly open mind on this matter, but I have been absolutely convinced by the very excellent review <Col N="1755" /> of the situation made by Senator Baxter.  I think it was in 1927 that at a meeting held in Jury's Hotel, a large and representative meeting of farmers from the Twenty-Six Counties, a remarkable speech was made by the Taoiseach.  Amongst some of the remarks which he made, there was one to the effect that when agriculture was prosperous that prosperity was reflected in every sphere of national activity and that when agriculture was depressed that depression was to be observed in every avenue of our industrial and commercial life.  It is admitted that about 60 per cent. of the people of this country get their living directly or indirectly from the land, so that the aim of the Oireachtas should be all the time to see that agriculture is made as prosperous as possible.  I was much impressed by Senator Baxter's speech, and I feel with him that the development of the co-operative movement in relation to agriculture should get all the encouragement possible in this and the other House. I come from a dairy county&mdash;one of the best in the country.  Speaking again from memory, I think we have 48 creameries with some auxiliaries.  The industry is, in the main, directed under the co-operative system with unquestionable success by the farmers themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What were the conditions prevailing before 1927?  Having been on a committee of one of the creameries I can speak with personal knowledge of my own town of Rathkeale.  There were two creameries at the end of the town, one on one side of the river and another at the other side.  A mile away in one direction there was a third creamery and two miles away in the other direction a fourth.  There you had four creameries operating practically in the one parish, carrying on a ruinous competition which could be inimical only to the development of the industry.  I knew of farmers in those days waiting with anxious eyes for the post for their cheques or sending their boys to the creamery to get the cheques.  The shopkeeper in return was depending on the farmer to pay him for goods supplied with these cheques.  The farmers took these cheques as soon as they <Col N="1756" /> received them to some of us who were in business and when the cheques were presented they were dishonoured in the bank.  Was that not an appalling state of things?  The position of the farmers running these creameries was such that they could not obtain an overdraft in the bank.  At the same time they were facing competition from countries such as Denmark and New Zealand which had been scientifically organised and they were being economically strangled.  It was then that the late Minister for Agriculture, realising, with a vision that has been amply justified by the passage of time, that this state of affairs could not continue, was compelled to intervene.  It was damn good business on his part but it was bad politics.  The Cumann nGaedeal Government however did not mind about the political effect; they went out and did the right thing. It was an unpopular thing in many areas and I remember being hunted off the platform when I went out to speak with some Deputies in certain areas because of that Act which stabilised the whole dairying industry of the country.  The courage and the initiative which inspired that Act have been amply vindicated since.</P>
    <P>We have in my own county, as I have stated, 48 creameries which are second to none in the world.  They are even able to give banking accommodation to many farmers because I know from my own experience as a member of the county council that many of the cheques that come into the county council from farmers are accommodation cheques that have been paid by the managers of these co-operative concerns to help to relieve struggling farmers when they have found themselves in financial difficulties during the last seven or eight years.  I have received many of these cheques from farmers in connection with my business as auctioneer.  I say that the co-operative system has justified itself as a unit of this State from my experience, and, if that is so, it ought to be ample and complete justification for the present Minister who has sympathy with the condition of agriculture and whose desire is to try and relieve it from the economic depression under <Col N="1757" /> which we are living.  It is very serious and that is one of the reasons why I intervened.  I remember when Cleeves' had one of these auxiliaries in close proximity to the co-operative and they gave an increased price there, but where such opposition did not exist they gave the normal price or perhaps a little below it.  Senator Baxter said that this semi-State organisation was adopting methods something like those which created the Act of 1927.  If that is so I say it is the paramount duty of the Minister to seize the opportunity to end that and to do what his predecessor did seeing that it has been since vindicated.  Somebody asked if Mr. Hogan did the right thing.  He did. It was unpopular but it has been vindicated by the wonderful achievements and by the economic stability that has been established in the counties wherein it operated.  Should it continue?  It should.  I support Senator Baxter and I appeal to the Minister to complete the work.  If he does that he will be doing good work and will leave behind an enduring monument of appreciation from the agricultural community.</P>

      <P>In the county I come from we had a good many co-operative and proprietary creameries and they had to be taken over when the Dairy Disposal Board came in.  Every man in public life had to go on committees and go to bank managers to try and get the co-operative societies out of their liabilities to banks.  The Dairy Disposal Board had to put up the balance of the money.  If these creameries are to be handed over again the farmers should know the responsibility they are taking on.  I do not know whether any of the farmers who were through the mill before would agree if they were asked to have these creameries taken over.  The Dairy Disposal Company are interested in their own work and the managers are responsible to them.  The company should know their business, and the managers are responsible for having the work done properly.  Farmers have not the training for running creameries.  Farming is an entirely different occupation to running a creamery.  Senator Baxter may smile at that, but in a good <Col N="1758" /> many of the co-operative creameries the principal members of the committee are professional men, clergymen, school-masters and others who have no personal interest in the industry.  Only people like Senator Baxter and myself are interested to see that there are supplies of milk.  Now in West Cork the dairy industry is only a very small part of the co-operative movement, I mean the co-operative stores as we call them.  In business it would be looked upon as a side-line.  This co-operative movement which has got so much praise from all the Senators should, I think, be very carefully examined.  I and everybody else would like to see dairying in a good firm position, but the handing over of the industry to &ldquo;the co-ops,&rdquo; which have an entirely different and bigger business to look after, is another matter.  Their business ranges from selling everything from a needle to an anchor.  They supply the children with sweets, the dying with habits, the dead with coffins.</P>

      <P>They are, but at the same time they are putting a few others out of business.  The whole question should be very carefully examined and I suggest to the Minister that if the co-operative societies were put in the position of looking after the dairying industry if it can be managed, and looked after by them, and if they are to go into general business let them compete on fair conditions in any business that they want to go into.  At the present time they are in a very favourable position.  They have a very fine way of collecting their debts through the milk supply.  They do not have to comply with restrictions the ordinary traders have to comply with.  They do not always have to pay the same rates of wages and the same hours of work <Col N="1759" /> do not apply.  All this places them in an altogether favoured position and I am afraid they are paying more attention to business at the present time other than the dairying industry.  I know that in the part I come from they are more interested in getting trade. We heard a lot of talk about cut-throat competition and all the rest of it but I have had representations from traders that very good customers of theirs were offered very good terms by creamery managers, and I should like the Minister to examine carefully all that goes under the name co-operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinODwyer" hpid="Mr. O'Dwyer Mr. O'Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reply to some points that have been raised by some speakers.  Senator MacCabe suggested that it would be well to organise the farmers first.  He forgets that there was a strong discouragement against farmers taking over creameries, because when they took over previously they had to take over shares, at the rate of £3 to the cow. Those who remained with creameries that the Dairy Disposal Board had to take over, had to take no shares. Naturally in hard times farmers were not in a hurry to change conditions and to go into heavy debt.  Naturally, in the hard times that existed for the last nine or ten years, farmers were not in any hurry to change the conditions and to go under heavy debt.  There was also some reference made to the difficulties in the way of obtaining money. I am quite sure that point would not arise if the question of price could be settled.  If the price was reasonable there would be no difficulty in obtaining money from banks.  These creameries are considered very safe and the burden would not be very heavy on the farmers.  £3 per cow did not rest so hard on the farmers taken over by the co-operative societies because it was paid in small instalments and the necessary funds to finance the creameries, if taken over by the farmers could be raised in the same way, by instalments spread over a great many years.  The question of finance need not deter the taking over nor need the question of organisation be allowed to stand in the way.  The <Col N="1760" /> farmers have been more or less discouraged from taking them over.</P>
      <P>Senator Colbert raised the point that it was necessary to maintain these groups of creameries in order to obtain. the necessary supplies of raw materials for the industries started in connection with them.  In Limerick and elsewhere industries in connection with those creameries were taken over by the Dairy Disposal Company and are, I believe, being managed very efficiently. The raw materials were collected from the creameries around the country. There is no reason at all why the co-operative societies, acting together could not run those industries or perhaps they could remain outside the creameries in the take-over and their supply of raw material be arranged for.</P>
      <P>Senator Corkery said that farmers have no training for running creameries.  I am afraid he has not much experience of creameries.  Perhaps the part of the country he comes from is not a good dairy county.  Undoubtedly creameries have been started in parts where they never could be successful because it is only where the supply can be kept up that a creamery can be successful.  Where creameries have been started in sparsely-populated districts, where the milk had to be brought long distances, they have not been successful.  You have not far to look to see what farmers can do.  We have the examples of Mitchelstown and of Waterford.  There are up to 300 other creameries, nearly all of which were very successful and which are developing from day to day, showing what the farmers can do.  Undoubtedly, the managers do a great deal in the development of these creameries but these managers are the sons of farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid people do not realise the necessity for completing the purchase of the dairies that took place in 1928. They fail to realise the importance of the industry.  We should remember that the dairying industry is perhaps the most important in the country.  Up to the last few years, the normal export represented a total of £3,000,000 a year and some years before represented over £5,000,000 a year, in addition <Col N="1761" /> to the amount consumed at home. The action of the late Minister for Agriculture in wiping out the proprietary creameries and giving an assured supply to the co-operative creameries was a most statesmanlike and far-seeing act, which saved the dairying industry from almost complete destruction.  It gave the creameries an assured supply which enabled them to develop and to introduce the necessary machinery to comply with all the requirements of modern hygiene in the production of milk and butter.  That, and the payment of an economic price to the farmer, would not have been possible without an assured supply of raw material.</P>
    <P>There was another aspect also of the co-operative movement which must have been very apparent to the present Minister during the period of the economic war and during the period of the emergency.  He must have realised&mdash;as I am sure his predecessor did &mdash;how much easier it is for a Government to deal with an industry when it is organised upon a co-operative basis. I am sure the Minister will admit that he had less difficulty in arranging things in the dairying industry, in providing for the payment of bounties, etc., and fixing prices than he had, perhaps, in any of the proprietary industries, because it was organised on a co-operative basis and organised in such a way that the smallest sum given as a subsidy by the central Government was distributed evenly down to the smallest farmer.  We must remember also that, not alone here, but practically all over the world, it has been the settled policy of Governments during recent years to develop and encourage the principle of co-operation in agriculture.  The great development which we have seen taking place in Danish agriculture was brought about almost entirely by the development of the co-operative movement there.  It was the same in Holland and in Belgium.  It is the same to-day, I believe, in Canada and in a great portion of the United States of America.  The British Government developed its policy of encouraging co-operation some years ago in agriculture and it has always been the settled <Col N="1762" /> policy of the Irish Government here. It is very clear that the co-operative movement and co-operative societies, not alone in dairying, but in all other branches, are the only unit by which agriculture can be developed to its fullest extent.  That being recognised, there is a clear case for not pausing in the completion of the transfer of all the existing dairies to the co-operative movement.  It was the intention of the previous Government that they should all be handed over in a short time to the co-operative movement.  It is not the fault of the last Government that difficulties arose which prevented that idea from being carried out in time but there is no reason why it should be delayed any longer.</P>
    <P>As Senator Baxter has pointed out, the existence of the two different bodies, the proprietary creameries and the co-operative creameries, in competition with each other, has a very bad effect on the whole movement, and a very bad effect on the farmers in the locality.  It prevents the efficient working of all creameries because they cannot be assured of a sufficient supply of raw materials, or, at least, of such a supply as there would be if that competition were removed and if they were all under the one organisation.  I am sure that the main difficulty is the question of price, but at the same time, that should not be allowed to stand in the way, because, as we all know, the subsidisation of the dairy industry has entailed a large amount of public money during recent years, and it would not be asking too much from the Government to make a small sacrifice to assist in the transfer of those creameries to the co-operative movement. They were bought at a time when prices were very high and money much more plentiful than it is to-day. Such prices would be prohibitive in the present circumstances owing to the scarcity of money.  I do not think that the Government should be so hard on the question of price, but that they should make all the sacrifices possible to help the transfer of those creameries to the farmers.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is very much else which requires to be pointed out, <Col N="1763" /> because Senator Baxter has already gone very deeply into the subject, but I should like to assure the Minister that there is a very strong feeling in favour of this transfer and the longer it is delayed the more difficult the situation will become, apart from the bad effect the present position is having on existing co-operative societies. Undoubtedly, there have been cases where co-operative societies have failed, but failures have occurred in every branch of industry and the creamery industry cannot be an exception. In late years, however, the overwhelming majority of the creameries are successful and developing, but there are cases where difficulties have arisen in creamery societies and in ordinary circumstancees if left to themselves, the creameries might have overcome them because where the societies are backed by their members, they cannot go down.  But, where there is a Government creamery near at hand, they do not keep up their own creamery, but ask the Government organisation to take them over.  That, as I have said, has a very bad effect on the existing co-operative societies, especially on the small ones in the neighbourhood of Government societies.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why the Government should be glad to get them off their hands.  Nobody likes to see the Government interfering in business and it is not a good thing.  I am sure that the reason the Government does not like interfering too much in business is, because, although they may be efficiently managed for a time, you cannot always depend that that will continue.  People in cities might think it a natural thing for a Minister for Agriculture to run creameries.  What would be said if the Minister for Supplies took over one of the big Dublin drapery establishments and went into competition with its rivals or if the Minister for Finance took over Guinness's brewery and started the manufacture of beer?  What an outcry there would be.  It is the same as regards the dairies.  The farmers are confident that they will be able to run those <Col N="1764" /> dairies and the dairying industry in those districts as efficiently as Mitchelstown and Waterford and other creameries are managed.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Minister, as it is the general feeling that the time has come when the transfer could take place that nothing could be gained by delaying unduly.  I would ask him, therefore, to accept the motion, and to complete the transfer of the creameries concerned as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Baxter, in introducing this motion, quoted some extracts from my predecessor, the late Mr. Hogan, when he brought a scheme before the Dáil in 1927 for the acquisition of certain creameries.  The Seanad will be familiar, therefore, with the competition that was going on at that time.  Other Senators also have spoken on that point here.  You had, at that time, fairly common through the country, the cases of proprietary concerns and co-operative creameries, built side by side and competing for the milk, and it was becoming rather an intolerable position.  Eventually, it became intolerable for a group of proprietaries too, and they came to the conclusion that they might as well sell out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Hogan took advantage of the situation to buy these proprietaries and to try to reorganise the industry.  At that time he purchased, on behalf of the State, the Toffee Company at Limerick, the Condensed Milk Company, which ran also a number of sub-condenseries, and also owned Knocklong and Tipperary.  He also purchased the Newmarket Dairy Company, which owned three principal groups, Terelton, Coachford and Newmarket.  The Disposal Board was formed to take over the proprietaries that came along and a number of proprietaries have been taken on since then.  Shortly after that time a new development occurred.  I think it was in the following year that the taking over of co-operatives which got into difficulties was begun and that has become rather a big business with the Dairy Disposal Company.  A few years after that&mdash;I think perhaps that it was not until 1931, that there was <Col N="1765" /> the first instance&mdash;the Dairy Disposals Company commenced building creameries themselves and developing new centres.  The development did not proceed to any great extent until 1935. There you had an organisation set up with the principal object of taking over proprietaries' interests and handing these creameries over to the co-operative. It developed from that after a few years into the position of taking over certain co-operatives and either handing them over to other co-operatives, or reorganising them and getting them into groups that were already held by that body.</P>
    <P>The last development was the development of the new districts I spoke of.  These companies are still there.  That is the Toffee Factory, the Condensed Milk Company, the Newmarket Dairy Company, and the Dairy Disposal Company.  They are all managed, however, by one board of directors&mdash;three directors who are civil servants&mdash;and these directors are nominated by the Minister for Agriculture. The board of directors have a good deal of freedom of action.  The day by day business is carried on without any reference to the Department or to the Minister.  They are, however, not free for any expenditure of a capital kind.  They must get the authority of the Minister for Agriculture, who must in turn get the approval of the Minister for Finance for capital expenditure, but, in their working expenses, they are free to carry on and are in fact free to raise an overdraft in the bank provided they have assets against it, such as raw materials for manufacture or manufactured materials ready for sale.  In a way, they are not very different from the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter thought that we might set up a board similar to the Electricity Supply Board but, so far as I understand it, the Electricity Supply Board has not got much more power than they have got.  That board, too, must come to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for sanction for any large capital expenditure.  It is true that the companies have been financed by the State, but it is hoped that in time they will recoup the State whatever <Col N="1766" /> money they got from it.  The moneys have been advanced in the same way by the Department of Agriculture, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, and we have to account for them to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Entirely independent. It is only capital expenditure that is subject to sanction.  In the beginning, of course, there is no doubt that the late Mr. Hogan visualised this body as an ephemeral body&mdash;only here for a short time&mdash;and anybody reading his speech on that occasion would see that he had no intention whatever of having this body continued for a long time, but everyone has to change with circumstances. I do not want, and I would certainly dislike, to misrepresent the late Mr. Hogan in any way, but I think the late Mr. Hogan did realise, before he left the Department of Agriculture, that he had changed somewhat, because he had taken over the West Clare group, which was a bigger departure than what was visualised in the beginning. The West Clare group was, after all, a co-operative society, a society that had failed, and which came to the Minister at the time to see if he could do anything to make things right in Clare.  He took over that co-operative society or, at least, the.  Dairy Disposals Board, with his approval, took it over and developed West Clare from that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the proprietaries acquired by the Dairy Disposals Board have proved disappointing, and, consequently, there was a fairly substantial loss in the ordinary trading of the board for some years.  That loss was cumulative up to a certain point.  As a matter of fact, about 12 months after I took up the position, I introduced a Supplementary Estimate for £112,000 to cover the losses.  The loss reached a peak point, and at that time it was £136,000.  From 1933 the trading loss, taking all the companies together, changed over to a profit; and now, at the end of 1940, we find that a trading <Col N="1767" /> loss of £136,000 has been wiped out completely, and we have a profit on the trading over the 14 years of £13,000.</P>
    <P>If we pause for a moment, I think that every Senator will agree that the Dairy Disposals Board did very good work.  There is no federation of co-operative societies or an industrial co-operative society which could have faced that colossal task.  They could not have faced a reorganisation that would lead them into a loss, before things turned for the better, of £136,000.  It was only an organisation of that kind with State backing that could do it, and they have, therefore, achieved to a great extent what they set out in the beginning to do, that is, to reorganise the dairy industry, and put it on a sound footing.  They may not have reached the point that certain Senators, enthusiastic on behalf of co-operation, would like to see reached, but, at least, they have covered the first important step in the way of putting the dairying industry&mdash;whether proprietary or co-operative&mdash;on a very sound footing.</P>
    <P>I have several tables supplied to me here in regard to different items, but it is impossible to convey the contents of a table with any sort of conviction or understanding in a speech.  However, I wish to give some summary of a number of tables.  Between these organisations &mdash; the Dairy Disposal Board, the Condensed Milk Company of Ireland, the Newmarket Dairy Company, and so on, they have dealt with 293 units, that is to say, they have either taken over, erected or built 309 units altogether, whether they are central creameries or auxiliaries.  They acquired 222 of those, some of them from co-operative societies and some from proprietaries; they erected 51&mdash; that makes 273&mdash;and the remainder are travelling creameries, which I will deal with in a few minutes.  Taking the total, they closed 29 centrals, 67 auxiliaries or separating stations, they transferred 18 centrals and 36 separating stations and they still have on hands 17 centrals and 106 separating stations, as well as 20 travelling creameries.</P>
    <P>It is true that the figures Senator <Col N="1768" /> Baxter gave would give the impression that these bodies had done very little in the way of transferring over to co-operative societies.  Senator Baxter gave the number of co-operative societies that were there in 1927 and the total number of creameries that were there.  He gave the number of co-operative societies at the present time and the number held by proprietors and by the Dairy Disposals Board.  On Senator Baxter's figures, admittedly there is no great change, but there is, however, a very substantial change.  For instance, a big I part of what they still hold were erected by them and erected in areas where there was no creamery industry whatever in 1927.  I remember that a few years ago I went to the Dáil with an Estimate for £40,000 to develop the areas from Cahirciveen around through Kenmare to Castletownbere.  I told the Dáil on that occasion that we would build collecting centres in those three areas and provide nine travelling creameries that would make three stops each&mdash;that would be 27 stations for that area for the collection of milk. I said I could not say at that moment whether we would lose that £40,000 or not but that it was an experiment.  I said it was a poor area and that, if we succeeded in our experiment, we would have done a lot for the farmers, but if we lost our £40,000 after all it was not a colossal sum when compared with the amount that might be spent on relief schemes of a different kind in that area or in other areas.</P>
    <P>That could not have been done by the co-operative movement.  I do not think it could have been done unless the Dairy Disposals Board were there. It would be very difficult for the Dairy Disposals Board or anybody else to do that unless they had, at the same time, at their disposal a number of other creameries.  That meant that they were able to do a great deal in the way of central purchasing of stores and they were able to supply certain machinery, and so on, and get a market for any butter they had to sell.  The reports from that area have been very good, and I am told now by the Dairy Disposals Board itself that there is not the slightest doubt about the success <Col N="1769" /> of creameries in those areas.  In fact, in the peak point which we are reaching about this time, we have a larger supply in the Cahirciveen area where there is now a central creamery, than in numbers of co-operative creameries in other parts of the country.  There is quite a sufficient supply to make the thing a success.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter said that the Dairy Disposals Board was reported&mdash;I think he said reported but I am not sure&mdash; as paying good prices in competition and not so good when there was not competition.  I have just been looking through the prices paid in 1940 and find that the highest price paid was in Cahirciveen, where there is absolutely no competition against them.  There is no creamery within miles of that but they can get the highest price for their milk there.</P>

      <P>The milk in the Cahirciveen area has, probably, a higher fat content, on the average, than milk in other areas.  Still, if the Dairy Disposal Company were doing what they were reported to Senator Baxter to be doing, surely they would have taken advantage of the position and would not have given as high a price in Cahirciveen as they gave in other places.  The second highest price was paid in Kenmare, which shows that they were working on honest lines.  Where there was a high fat content, the suppliers got a high price, and where there was a low fat content, they did not get as high a price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dairy Disposal Company has endeavoured&mdash;it is not possible to do it on every occasion&mdash; to pay the same price as the adjoining co-operatives.  That is impossible in certain cases because every Senator <Col N="1770" /> knows that they must pay the same price all through the group.  They cannot always pay the same as the surrounding creameries but they do their best.  I think that there is no foundation whatever for the allegation that the Dairy Disposal Company have paid a high price when in competition and have not paid so high a price when there was absence of competition.  The Dairy Disposal Company can prove in another way that they have always paid what the unit could afford to pay, taking into account what the surrounding co-operatives were paying.  The accusation made against the company in some cases is that they pay more than the surrounding co-operatives did, but they have avoided doing that even where they could afford to do it.  The proof that they have paid a fair price in their different units is to be found in the fact that they lost money during their first six or seven years.  They were losing money on the condensory and, to a certain extent, on the toffee factory.  They went on losing money and they did not try to cut that loss by reducing the price to the suppliers. They continued to pay a fair price to the suppliers and faced the loss on the condensory and toffee factory.  Luckily, there, again, the loss has been eliminated. Senators may think that that is due to the war, but I am glad to say it is not.  From the end of 1937, there has been no loss by the Condensed Milk Company.  They had turned the corner by then and they were beginning to make a profit.  Possibly, they are making a higher profit during the war, but I am not sure about that.  It is commonly supposed that condenseries are run between one war and another at a loss and that they make a colossal profit during a war.  We all know, however, that this war is not being run on the same lines as other wars.</P>

    <P>Senator Baxter alleged that this company were accepting transferred suppliers from other creameries.  I do not think that that is true.  If there is anything in the allegation, I should like to investigate it.  You have this sort of position in many cases: a person has been transferred to a new co-operative society and the co-operative has to pay the Dairy Disposal <Col N="1771" /> Company for the transferred milk.  The co-operative very often, in turn, ccollects what it has to pay off the supplier, at the rate of £3 per cow, as mentioned here.  Whether the co-operative collects from the supplier or not, it must pay for the transferred milk.  In some of these cases, a person is transferred who is, perhaps, five miles from the creamery to which he now must go, and, perhaps, only three miles from the creamery to which he would prefer to go.  The creamery that was closed down may have been only two miles from him.  The great bulk of the people supplying Creamery A may have been transferred to Creamery B, and a few of the outside ones might be nearer to Creamery C, and might prefer to go to Creamery C.  We have been trying in the Department of Agriculture to deal with individual cases of this kind.  In some instances, it was agreed between the creameries concerned that the person in question would be allowed to go to the nearest creamery and that the finances would be fixed up between the creameries. There may be cases where a person preferred the creamery of the Dairy Disposal Company because it was nearer to him, although he should rightly belong under the transfer to a co-operative.  I do not think that it is right to blame the company in a sweeping way if there are isolated cases of that kind which require to be made right.</P>
    <P>The Dairy Disposals Company have a number of groups.  Some of them were entirely organised by the company, such as those I mentioned in Kenmare, Cahirciveen and, practically, in Dingle.  A small creamery was taken over in Dingle and, out of that, has grown an enormous organisation in the Dingle peninsula, where a large number of auxiliaries have been erected.  I do not know whether there would be any desire in those areas on the part of the farmers to take these over.  In the older areas, which are much longer organised, like the three I mentioned in Cork belonging to the Newmarket Dairy Company, the farmers may be anxious to get the creameries into their own hands.  I <Col N="1772" /> shall, however, come to that question in a moment.</P>
    <P>I desire to say a few words about the finances of these transactions.  The finances were advanced by the State but, as I have said, it is hoped that the State will be recouped in time.  At present, roughly £750,000 is due to the State.  If, putting debtors and creditors against one another, the properties held are worth £750,000, the State will not suffer any loss.  Whether they are worth that or not, I cannot say.  That is a matter to be decided when they come to be handed over to the various creameries, which must take place some time.</P>

      <P>No.  I said I should come back to the travelling creamery. Although that matter does not arise to any extent in this debate, I shall say a few words about it.  The travelling creamery was invented in 1934 or 1935 and, for some time, many of our experts were very sceptical as to whether it would work or not.  On the whole, it has been a success.  It was particularly successful in this way: when the Department were asked to develop an area and when they referred to the Dairy Disposal Board, it was hard to decide at that time whether the area would be a success or not.  They had to go in and build auxiliaries at several places, after taking a census of the cows.  They went to very big expense before they were sure whether the project would succeed or not.  This travelling creamery enables them to test out an area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, in the Dingle peninsula we went there with a central creamery and three or four travelling creameries to test the whole area.  It was found after three or four years that there was <Col N="1773" /> quite sufficient milk in many of these centres to carry auxiliaries.  A number of these auxiliaries have been built with the result that the peninsula has now settled down to a regular system with central and auxiliary creameries and the supply is assured.  In the same way travelling creameries are now testing Cahirciveen, Kenmare and Castletown districts.  As I said already there is a big supply in Cahirciveen, close on 10,000 gallons, which is quite as good a supply as many creameries in the country have at present.  There is no doubt that it will be possible to build auxiliaries in that area and to make them a permanent institution. We had also to build an anxiliary in Valentia and one on Bere Island.  That auxiliary on Bere Island can never, in my opinion, be an economic success, but what were you going to do with the small farmers there?  You could only expect about 400 gallons of milk; still the people there must get a chance to live.  Even though we may have to come to the Dáil to provide for a permanent subsidy for this unit in Bere Island, I think the Dáil would not object to the people on the island getting something out of the common pool.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Baxter that the co-operative movement has not by any means reached the degree of development that we should like to see or that we think it should reach in the interests of agriculture.  I think&mdash;I said this before on many occasions&mdash;that the Co-operative Bill will be ready soon.</P>

      <P>I shall be disappointed if it is not introduced in the Dáil before Christmas.  Senator Baxter spoke of the competition at present existing in West Cork.  There is, it is true, some competition on a small scale there, just as there was in 1927 in many parts of the country.  I know it is important for the co-operative concern.  There are two co-operative concerns there and we have 150 in the country.  They have not <Col N="1774" /> lost as much milk as one Senator suggested here.  The total amount which they have lost, as reported to me, is about 700 gallons.  That is serious, of course, but there is no use in making it higher than 700 gallons if it is not in fact more than that.  That position will have to be dealt with.  I am hopeful that we may be able to settle it by negotiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>When?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not settled by negotiation within a very short time, in a matter of days, we must do something by law.  I hope that we shall be able to settle it by negotiation within the next few days.  The first point in Senator Baxter's motion is to acquire the remaining proprietaries.  There are arguments for and against that. Personally, I believe that it must be done some time, that they must be acquired by compulsion if we do not get them by agreement.  I had thought on numerous occasions since becoming Minister for Agriculture of preparing a Bill for the acquisition of the remaining proprietaries.  It is possible, if the war had not intervened, that a Bill of that kind would have been before the Oireachtas before this time, but when the war came on and there was a general appeal to all Departments not to attempt to do things that could be put aside for the present&mdash;things that were not absolutely necessary to deal with the emergency&mdash;that was one of the matters we decided to put aside until the emergency was over.  It may be necessary to come back to it again if we cannot deal with it in any other way.  We succeeded&mdash;when I say &ldquo;we&rdquo;, I mean the Department, whether acting under the late Mr. Hogan or myself&mdash;in acquiring practically all the proprietaries.  A big number were taken over in 1927 when the first Estimate was brought in. Since that they have been taken over in small or big numbers every year up to about two years ago.  There is only one concern of any size left now but there are a few small ones as well. Seeing that we were so successful by peaceful negotiation up to this, one is inclined to wait a little longer anyway <Col N="1775" /> to see if we can complete the job by negotiation rather than resort to a compulsory scheme.  There is, of course, the difficulty of drafting a Bill of that kind.  It is very difficult to decide on what basis they will be taken over, how the price might be fixed, and matters of that kind.  No matter how extreme anybody may be on the question of State ownership or the acquisition by the State of private property, there is a reluctance on the part of everybody to go ahead and take the final step to acquire by compulsion private property if it can be done in any other way.  There is also the point which, perhaps, in this connection should not be considered&mdash;of unemployment. In every scheme of rationalisation there will be a certain amount of unemployment created.  After all, if we thought of that, we should not have done anything in this matter at all.  In a district where you have two creameries, each of them has a manager and the manager has a couple of assistants in the broad sense.  If one of these creameries is closed, some of the staff become redundant.  In the past we tried to some extent to compensate these redundant employees, but no system of compensation is entirely satisfactory.  If you give a person three months' wages, or even a year's wages, it is not nearly as good as his job.  I say again, however, that is not a good objection, because that objection would have had as much force in the beginning as it has now.  So far as the acquisition of these creameries is concerned, my present attitude is that this competition must stop.  As I say we are trying to settle the matter peacefully.  If we do not settle it peacefully, we must settle it by legislation. With regard to the taking over of creameries, we have from time to time made advances to the owners to see if they would sell.  Sometimes they say &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; but then the price is not one that we would consider as buyers.  The matter has dragged on like that, and I do not know when we may be able to come to closer quarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point is when the creameries that we hold will be given back to the farmers.  In the first place, in 1928 <Col N="1776" /> there was a different position.  The prices of milk were much better at the time and the price of butter was much better.  Comparatively speaking these prices were very much better than at present.  Senators will remember that butter had held a good price from 1923 down to 1929 and then the crash came. The prices went down and they have never gone up, war and all, to what they were in 1927 or 1928.  The prices ruling at that time would have made it easier to hand over a number of these creameries but since then we have had the crash of prices in 1929.  If we had these prices it might have been easier to get these creameries handed over. It is all right for Senators to say that we should do the unpopular thing if it is necessary.  Now I have been accused in this House of doing the unpopular thing.  One would imagine we never did an unpopular thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing about co-operation.  Surely to goodness no Senator will claim that the creameries should be handed over unless at least half the farmers want them.  I think putting it at half is very low.  You would want more than half, and not only that but you would want them to be enthusiastic, because co-operation is a thing to which men must give their energy and time, in which they must really do more than they are paid for, more than they personally get out of it.  You must have enthusiasm and the desire to get the creameries handed over.  I do not think we could possibly force the creameries on the farmers.  If the farmers come along from any particular area and say that they want the creameries back, and if I am fairly satisfied that they are a majority, and that they are anxious to work in the interests of the farmers&mdash; which of course they would&mdash;then the only thing that remains is price.  The price again is a difficult matter.  There are various views about the price of these creameries.  We could, for instance, sell the creameries somewhat on the lines on which they were sold in 1927.  That is roughly what the Dairy Disposal Company has been inclined to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1777" /> We are asked to take into account the profits made by these creameries for the last ten years or so and to deduct these profits from the price when handing them back to farmers.  That appears to me to be entirely wrong because, if we had bought these creameries or if we erected these creameries, whether we erected them or bought them we had to deal more or less on a commercial basis.  Certainly if we built them we had to pay the same as anybody else would pay, and if we bought them we had to pay the price the owners thought they were worth, and if we are going to sell them on an ordinary commercial basis the fact that we made profits on them should make them higher and not lower.  At any rate, we have a good approach to it in this way.  I have looked at the figures from many angles.  First of all on the 1927 basis, secondly on the cost that they are in the books, that is that they were bought at so much, a certain amount was spent on new buildings, whether auxiliaries or centrals, and a certain amount was put down for depreciation and so on, and we take the value in the books.  Thirdly, I think we can look at it in this way.  If we know the price at which the farmers will be able to take them over, with the same efficient management, not more efficient than at the present time, and will be able to continue them, that is the price to be paid.  I think that price is fair enough.  As far as my calculations go and they can, of course, be checked, it would be a fair price.  We have the 1927 price and the prices as they stand in the books as an economic unit for the farmers to run efficiently.  Well, it is not possible to get agreement.</P>
    <P>The two tests I am laying down are that the majority should want them and that they should pay a fair price.  On these two conditions I see no objection to the handing over of the creameries. However, it must be remembered in the new areas, for instance, take West Clare, it was erected in 1931 and it had been run by a co-operative society and failed.  It is now a very fine group and has probably as high a supply as any other.  The peak reaches something in the neighbourhood of 30,000 gallons.  I <Col N="1778" /> do not know whether the farmers who failed to make a success of that creamery would be anxious to take it back.  It is possible that we may work out some scheme for a gradual taking over.  That has been put to me and it is a good idea.  Senator O'Dwyer mentioned one point.  He said that conditions were against co-operation in that the farmer who was transferred over to the co-operative had to pay his levy but when he was transferred to the Dairy Disposal Company he had to pay no levy.  It was even mentioned that we should levy the farmers on going over to the Dairy Disposal Company and we should put the money into a fund, and when built up it could purchase the creamery.  We would say to the farmers: &ldquo;Well, the creamery is yours because you have paid for it.&rdquo; That might be worth considering and if along with it there was some sort of scheme for having farmers associated even in an advisory capacity with the manager of the creamery, it might be possible to hand over the creameries in Clare where co-operation had failed and where they are working on entirely virgin soil.  Senator Baxter did speak of handing over the creameries and visualised a very happy state of the country when they were taken over, but Senator Baxter will have to remember that co-operatives were taken over in the last five or six years. There is no use mentioning names, but some co-operative societies did fail. Some were taken over by the Dairy Disposal Company and in one case the society was handed over direct to another society.  Well, now I think that is all I have to say on Senator Baxter's motion.  I agree in principle with Senator Baxter's motion and if the word &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; was not there I think I could agree entirely.  I would say that the remaining proprietaries should be taken over and that the creameries should be handed over to farmers, but I do not think it can be done immediately.  I think it must be done as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>On the whole I was gratified with the way the House received the motion.  The only rather antagonistic speech we had was, I <Col N="1779" /> think, from Senator Corkery, but then I can understand Senator Corkery and appreciate that his point of view of and approach to this question would be rather different from that of most of us.  I think, too, that to a certain extent he was rather contradictory in what he did say, because while he was prepared to permit the farmers to manage the co-operative movement in so far as it applied to dairying, he would not permit them to go any further. He thought they could do that. At the same time he told us the people who were managing the co-operative movement were not really farmers at all, but that professional men and others were doing the work on the committees.  I think the truth is that, whatever may be said to the contrary, the co-operative movement on the whole, in the circumstances of the times and in the difficulties which it has had to encounter, has been eminently successful.  I think, as Senator O'Dwyer says, that but for the fact that the Minister had the co-operative movement to work through and to work with in the difficulties through which dairying in this country has had to pass, since the fall in butter prices, in 1929 or 1930, no one could tell what the exact position of dairying would have been in the country.  If the position of dairying had been radically changed for the worse, I think farming on the whole would be in a deplorable condition to-day.</P>
      <P>The Minister, I think, accepted generally my view that it was essential to put the co-operative movement on a sound basis.  He says that if the word &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; were not in my motion he would be prepared to accept it.  I suggest that his statement on the whole indicates that he is actually taking immediate steps to do what I want done.  In fact, he appears to have taken the steps before this discussion opened. I realise that the Minister has been trying for a long time to get these proprietary creameries passed over to the co-operative societies and, apparently, he has reached a stage in the discussions when he is hopeful that they are, going to bear fruit.</P>

I did not say I was so hopeful about acquiring the creameries by negotiation. I said in the next few days the competition referred to by the Senator might stop, by negotiation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister would tell these people, &ldquo;Unless you can make a bargain, and can make it fairly quickly, the State is going to do what they did in 1927.&rdquo;  I am going to do what my predecessor found it necessary to do.&rdquo;  Although it is a narrow, circumscribed area in which the competition takes place, nevertheless, the competition has been as difficult and as intense and as annoying to the cooperators in that area as it was in 1927. I know how disturbed some of them are.  Some of them, in fact, are members of the Oireachtas and they have discussed this with me.  The Minister knows to whom I am referring. It is a problem that has to be solved, and solved very quickly.  I think if the Minister were to declare that if they do not solve it themselves, he is going to solve it quickly for them, it would be solved without his having to take these powers which none of us would like to have passed through the Oireachtas in so far as they apply to the taking over of private property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to one of the points which I raised in discussing the position of the Dairy Disposal Company, I must say all the information which the Minister gave us was very interesting and very illuminating, and far be it from me to say anything disparaging of the work done by the people who were entrusted with the task of taking over the Newmarket and the Condensed Milk Company and carrying on the very responsible task, in difficult days, of operating that very large concern. My information was that they in fact had paid certain prices in certain districts that were lower than the prices paid by them in districts where they were in competition with co-operative creameries.  I think, in relation to the whole business, it would be <Col N="1781" /> only a small point, but I know that at the moment and for a very considerable time correspondence has been passing between the Dairy Disposal Company and a particular Kerry creamery in regard to certain suppliers there who have actually made considerable contributions towards the payment of their share capital to the creameries to which they were transferred and who have recently left that particular creamery and have been accepted and are being continued at this particular creamery of the Dairy Disposal Company. That is not a position which, I think, ought to be permitted.  While in another creamery in the same area the Gárdaí were actually called in to eject certain suppliers who refused to take their milk away, in this particular case, these suppliers have been permitted to continue.  I am satisfied that that is the fact, because I have a pile of correspondence here and it will probably be available to the Minister also. It is a small point in relation to the problem as a whole, but the atmosphere created by such a position, when you have an institution like the Dairy Disposal Company, is unsatisfactory and leaves it open to having the whole position of the Dairy Disposal Company and their activities, perhaps, somewhat misrepresented.  I have no desire to do that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the larger problem raised as to the taking over of the Dairy Disposal Company, their creameries particularly, and passing them over to the farmers, I said before and I repeat, that you cannot have the co-operative movement in the position in which we would like to see it and in which it ought to be until these creameries are owned by the farmers. The Minister says, how can you pass them over unless the farmers want to take them?  Senator O'Dwyer pointed out that one of the obstacles and one of the difficulties in having them passed over to the farmers and why the farmer is not enthusiastic to take them over is that the farmers find it very difficult to obtain the necessary capital to run their ordinary business from day to day.  To ask the farmer to take over the management of a creamery for which the preliminary <Col N="1782" /> consideration is a payment of £3 per cow, in order to obtain a co-operative share in this concern, is, in these days of stress and difficulty for farmers, asking him to produce something which he cannot obtain.  He is permitted to continue under an organisation like the Dairy Disposal Company, where he has not to finance the concern, but where the State finances the concern. There is no encouragement for co-operative ownership so long as that anomaly is permitted to continue.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to put the farmer who wants to become a cooperator in the same position as the man who prefers to continue with the Dairy Disposal Company, it should be just as expensive from the point of view of expenditure of capital to remain under the Dairy Disposal Company as it is to become part owner of his own creamery.  You could then test and see what the farmer would do.  But, apart from what he would do, I think the Minister has a wider responsibility in this matter.  In fact there is the responsibility and the obligation on all of us &mdash;and particularly on anyone in the Minister's position, who has to give a lead and who has to try to educate the people&mdash;to encourage and organise farmers and point out to them that it is their own business and that they ought to take on the management of their own business.  Until they start to manage their own business, at its very roots, and at their own doors, the management of the country's business as a whole cannot interest them to the extent it should.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he ought to proceed in a fashion which will encourage the farmers to become the owners of these creameries.  He ought to proceed and say we are organised to take them over, and he ought to provide a position with regard to the obtaining of capital which will make it possible for them to become the owners, and if they want to remain under the Dairy Disposal Company, it ought to be an obligation on them to provide the capital to run the business, rather than that he should have to start providing it for them.  I think that if we had all our creameries co-operatively organised we would find that <Col N="1783" /> there were fields for development with regard to the production of crops, the more scientific treatment of our land generally, and the increase in yields in many ways, under a completely co-operative conception of the management of the farmer's business efforts, that you can never hope to enjoy in conditions as they exist in parts of Clare and Kerry, where the Dairy Disposal Company are operating to-day.</P>
    <P>I believe you would achieve much in West Clare and Kerry, and I applaud the efforts of those who have brought the creamery industry to a point where it is now definitely showing profits to farmers who are supplying milk and created a situation where there are creamery organisations which the Minister says can stand and live, but the Minister cannot be satisfied with that position, and then there is the next stage to which farmers in that area must pass&mdash;they must do other kinds of creative work themselves.  It is not enough for them to send milk to the creameries and to let people in Dublin manage their business for them without imposing any responsibility on those concerned.  It ought to be made part and parcel of their lives every day, and they ought to be using that business for doing things other than the production and sale of butter.</P>
    <P>These organisations have possibilities far beyond that.  They might be used, undoubtedly, for the purpose of distributing credit.  They are being so used in Limerick and elsewhere, but they might be used for getting the farmers who live around them interested in a much more scientific development of their industry as a whole, not only in relation to cows and the yield of their cows, but to the feeding of their cows and the yields of their fields, the kind of crops they can produce and so on.  That is what we should aim at.  Some of the co-operative concerns are tackling it.  They have gone in for bigger production and they have erected silos, but you cannot do that in areas where the Dairy Disposal Company is operating.  If the Minister is prepared to take the view that he has to wait until the farmers are all ready, that no other action can be taken than <Col N="1784" /> to permit the farmer to carry on and change his mind, in 50 years the Dairy Disposal Company will still be operating in those districts.  I do not think that that is good for the co-operative movement.  It will not bring it to that strength which we want.</P>
    <P>While saying that, I appreciate the Minister's approach to this whole question. On the whole there is very little between us.  The only thing I have to say is that I will go ahead and urge the Minister to do something.  The time is ripe now and the atmosphere in the country is such that the Minister will be able to do the job successfully and there is time and leisure at the moment to do it.  I think the money could be found, and that the men could be found, both in Clare and Kerry, with intelligence as high as that of their countrymen in Limerick, Cork, Cavan and Waterford, to manage co-operative concerns just as successfully, if the effort is made to find the money.  It would reflect on these counties, where there are intelligent brainy people, to say that they could not imitate what their companions elsewhere have done, and I suggest to the Minister that instead of being satisfied to sit and wait until people feel the idea, I would make them ready, I would educate, I would spend a little money and I think it would be well spent money from the point of view of the State.  The time and energy expended would, I am satisfied, bring a fruitful return and the Minister would continue what has proved to be a good policy and would gain the support of the whole country for his efforts.</P>
