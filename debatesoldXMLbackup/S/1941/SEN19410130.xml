    <Title>Extension of Allotments Schemes&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the motion standing in my name on the Order Paper, which reads:</P>
      <P>That the Seanad is of opinion that the Government should introduce legislation at once which would extend to non-urbanised towns the benefits of the provisions of the Acquisition of Land (Allotments) Acts, 1926 and 1934.</P>
      <P>I hope the Government regards this motion in the spirit in which it is submitted for discussion, that is the spirit of sincere helpfulness to avert or overcome the crisis which we are told might come upon us.  That is the spirit in which it is offered.  Ministers have definite information in regard to the matter of the supplies of human food in the country, and they have issued warnings.  These have been issued by the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Supplies, the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures and last night the Taoiseach also made a very definite statement regarding the dangers that might come upon us. Compulsory tillage has been put into operation, and, side by side with it. appeals have been made by Ministers to the patriotism and sense of civic spirit of the farmers to help to avert or overcome what may come upon us in the autumn.  Nobody can blame the Ministers for issuing that warning. They are doing their duty towards the community, and everybody hopes that their efforts will be fruitful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every person with any sense of civic responsibility and duty towards the community is prepared to help the <Col N="266" /> Government to the fullest extent.  But there is a section of the community whose position is always precarious, whose numbers are, unfortunately, likely to increase, and whose position in the coming months is likely to be more precarious.  These people have households to maintain and they are anxious to discharge their duties towards their households.  One cannot blame them if they feel that they would be much better prepared and safeguarded, and much more independent, if they could have a supply of foodstuff which they could call their own and which was brought into existence by their own efforts.  Ministers and other public men are calling out from the house-tops that something should be done in the director of securing such a supply.  One must regard these people as being up against a stone wall of circumstances. They have not land, seed, manures and, indeed, no means by which they can go into production in order to discharge their duties towards their households.  I do not think that will be denied by anybody.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Government and the members of the House are sympathetic but, whatever of sympathy, it cannot be denied that in any crisis that may arise the poor and necessitous are likely to suffer the most.  At the recent meeting of the Dáil the Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The poor are in a particularly difficult position.  They, as a rule, have few alternative foods....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Realising that, I put down this motion. We are now faced with a problem. What are we going to do to help to solve it?  I am urging the Government to do something at once.  I underline &ldquo;at once&rdquo; for obvious reasons, because if something is not done in the way of preparing the land for cultivation very soon, all our efforts to encourage increased production will not be very effective, and that is putting it very mildly.</P>
    <P>The present Government and the previous Government have encouraged the policy of plot-holding and there are two <Col N="267" /> Acts which make provision in that respect. The first is the Act of 1926 and in it the word &ldquo;allotment&rdquo; means a piece of land containing not more than one quarter of a statute acre let or intended to be let for cultivation by an individual for the production of vegetables mainly for consumption by himself and his family.  The expresion &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; in the same Act mean and includes the council of a county borough or other borough or an urban district or the commissioner of a town to which the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act, 1854, or any part of that Act applies.  The present Government introduced an amending Act and, fortunately or unfortunately, designedly, wilfully or otherwise, this paragraph occurs:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every word and expression to which a particular meaning is given by the Principal Act for the purposes of that Act has in this Act the meaning so given to it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the amending Act says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Agriculture with the sanction of the Minister for Finance may, as and when he shall think proper, make out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas a grant of such amount as he shall think proper&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>and then, in paragraph (c), the section sets out:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;to any corporate body or unincorporated association approved of by the Minister for Agriculture which provides, otherwise than under the Principal Act, allotments for unemployed persons, for the purpose of enabling such body or association to supply, free of cost, to such unemployed persons, seeds, manures, and potato spraying materials for use in such allotments and to provide agricultural implements for use by such unemployed persons free of cost for the cultivation of such allotments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No doubt, that was intended to be an improvement on the Act of 1926, and it certainly did give wide powers to the Minister for Agriculture.  It gave him an opportunity of allowing <Col N="268" /> associations to acquire land and, by giving manures, seeds, spraying materials and implements, he was in a position to help these people who were endeavouring to help themselves. Therefore, the policy of the Government has been to encourage plot-holding. Of course, Section 7 (1) (c) releases the Government from the responsibility of making up the difference in the rent between what the plot-holder pays to the local authority and what the local authority pays to the landowner.  That is my opinion, but I may be wrong.  It seems to me that it saves the Government from the responsibility of doing that.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the policy of the Government in encouraging plot-holding is justified.  Figures that are available how that in Vote 41 of the Appropriation Accounts for 1939-40 there was a grant, in connection with the Local Government Department, of £3,900.  I take it that was to pay the difference between what the allottee paid in rent to the local authority and what the local authority paid to the landowner.  The total amount spent was £3,947, so that there was a slight excess over what was voted.  The figure in the Appropriation Accounts in regard to the Vote for the Department of Agriculture in 1939-40 was £8,667.  That sum was voted and the amount spent was £7,805.  Turning to the Estimates for 1940-41, it will be noted that in Vote 30, relating to agriculture, the total amount estimated under the sub-head for plots is £20,092, as against £10,422 in 1939-40. That shows there was practically twice as much voted in 1940-41 and, therefore, one is safe in assuming that the Government considered there was a demand for the extension of these plots and they provided money in order to see that that demand was supplied.  Salaries, wages, allowances, and travelling expenses were £1,820, thus giving £18,272, for seeds, manures and the use of implements.  In the Local Government Vote, to make up the loss in rent on allotments, a sum of £7,279 was voted, as against £3,800 in the previous year.</P>
    <P>The report of the Department of <Col N="269" /> Local Government and Public Health for 1938-39 sets out, on page 67, that during the year 4,555 allotments were provided for unemployed persons in 67 districts.  There were 3,196 plots tilled by persons in receipt of unemployment assistance; 221 by persons in receipt of home assistance; 285 by persons employed on relief works, and 853 by persons in casual employment and with limited means.  The 67 districts I have referred to do not represent all the local authorities entitled to avail of the provisions of the 1926 Act.  There are between 70 and 80 authorities, urban and borough councils and town commissioners, that would be entitled to avail of the provisions of the Act. Sixty-seven of them availed of the provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>Now let us turn to what Dr. Ryan, the Minister for Agriculture, through his Department has to say.  In 1939-40 his report, making reference to the Act of 1926 and the amending Act of 1934, states that allotments were operated at 76 centres, so you see that the number was increasing progressively.  Unemployed allotment holders to the number of 4,846 as compared with 4,681 in the previous year were provided, free of cost, with seeds and manures and with the use of implements.  There was, therefore, an increase of nearly 200 in the number of allotment holders in one year.  At page 149 of the report of the Minister for Agriculture the following appears:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Allotment schemes under these Acts were operated at each of the 76 centres shown in the tabular statement hereunder during the year under review and 4,846 unemployed allotment holders, as compared with 4,681 in the previous year, were provided, free of cost, with seeds and manures and with the use of implements. The number of centres showed an increase of three on the figure for the previous year.</P>
    <P>In Cork there were 512 working, in Dublin 566, Athy 105, in Bray 147, in Carrick-on-Suir 130, in Tipperary 114, and in Tralee 134.  That list, I might say in passing, is not at all complete because I know of urban councils who <Col N="270" /> are availing of the provisions of the Act, whose names do not appear in the list.  I am not blaming the compiler of the list because, possibly, the information was not available at the time the list was compiled.  I do know that in Ennis there are 60 plot-holders. Speaking with the Chairman of the Ennis Urban Council yesterday, Senator Honan, he informed me that owing to the great increase in the number of applicants for plots the council would have to acquire more land this year.  I am merely making the argument that there is a constantly increasing demand for plots and that can only express itself where there is provision made for the allocation of these plots.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's own report, it is definitely stated that there is an ever-increasing demand for these plots. Why then does the Government stop at urban districts, at the county boroughs and at towns that have adopted the provisions of the Towns Improvements Act of 1854?  Surely the Government knows as well as I do, and has far more information at its disposal than I have to show them, that there are scores, one might say hundreds, of non-urbanised towns, towns which have not even town commissioners, which stand just as much in need of the benefits provided by these Acts as urban districts and county boroughs?  I find it very difficult in the case of non-urbanised towns to find a figure to show what is the real population of these towns. The Minister understands thoroughly that there are so many varying units that it is impossible almost to ascertain what is the population of any particular district.  You have the dispensary district, the rural district and the superintendent registrar's district, none of which is coterminous with another.  When I was endeavouring to find out what was the population in our non-urbanised districts I, therefore, found it impossible to obtain the exact figure.</P>
    <P>I did, however, get some figures in the census list although the population is a good deal in excess of that given in the census as many of these towns <Col N="271" /> have overflowed to a very large extent. I only went through the figures for some towns in the county in which I live, and I shall give the Minister the benefit of the figures I got.  Let me say that people have written to me from many of these towns asking me to impress upon the Government the necessity of doing something to provide allotments in these areas.  The populations of the various non-urbanised towns in the county are given as follows: Ennistymon, 1,202; Killaloe, 904; Miltown-Malbay, 788; Clarecastle, 580; Tulla, 544; Newmarket on Fergus, 450; Kildysart, 416; Scariff, 387; Corofin, 372; Sixmilebridge, 303; Lahinch, 261; Lisdoonvarna, 220; Liscannor, 217; Kilmihil, 215; and Kilfenora, 205.  That list does not exhaust all the towns in Clare, but it is fairly representative.  I want to impress upon the Minister, however, that these figures do not fully represent the population of these districts.</P>
    <P>Again, when I endeavoured to find out the measure of unemployment in these towns I found myself up against a great difficulty because even where there are exchanges operating, the number of unemployed is not made out in respect of the towns.  It is made out in respect of the exchange area.  You have the Limerick exchange area, the Ennis exchange area and the Kilrush exchange area.  Therefore, it is impossible for me to say with any degree of accurancy what the extent of unemployment in these towns really is. The only thing I can say is that I am quite certain it is extensive.  There is an exchange operating in Ennistymon and another in Tulla but these, I take it, are sub-branches.  In the statistics supplied by the Department of Industry and Commerce for the 30th December, 1940, the number of unemployed in Ennistymon is given as 797. I think that that number is clearly a misprint and that it should be 197.  In Tulla the number is given as 169.</P>
    <P>I pointed out earlier that the Minister for Agriculture has power under sub-section (1) (c) of Section 7 of the Amendment Act of 1934 to make grants to certain corporate bodies or unincorporated <Col N="272" /> associations who acquired land, for the purpose of enabling them to supply unemployed persons free of cost with manures, seeds and implements. Some of us throughout the country thought that if there was any work at which a parish council might suitably try its prentice hand, here was work for it.  Several people in various towns approached me in connection with this matter.  I might mention one town in particular in which representations were made by the parish priest, the chairman of the local parish council. That is the town of Clarecastle, a small parish outside Ennis, where there is a little port into which coal, meal and flour came.  There the main source of employment is carting these commodities to the town of Ennis.  Now, I put this because it is, I think, a strong point in the case I am making.  That port has been badly hit and is going to be hit most seriously in the future. Boats to that port are like angels&mdash; their visits are few and far between. The parish council made an application that the provisions of the amending Act, or of the original Act, be applied to that town, where there are 30 carters unemployed, each one of them having a horse and each one of them able to plough.  The chairman of the parish council, the local parish priest, told me definitely that land would be made available.  I got into touch with the Department of Agriculture and put the case as strongly as I could.  I quoted the relevant sections of the Act of Parliament. And what do I get?  I am not anxious to make a case against any Department or score any points whatever. I am only anxious to get the Government to act and, if the Government acts, I will be quite satisfied.  I get this letter from the Department of Agriculture:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Right">21adh Mí Na Nodlag, 1940.</P>
    <P>A Chara,</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for Agriculture to refer to your letter of 14th instant with enclosed copy of a resolution passed at a special meeting of Clarecastle Parish Council regarding the provision of seeds, manures, implements, etc., under the <Col N="273" /> allotments scheme for rural districts in County Clare, and to state that grants could not be made under the Acquisition of Land (Allotments) Acts, 1926 and 1934 towards the cost incurred in providing land for allotments in any town which has not municipal government.  In towns which, although they have not municipal government, have a considerable urban population, grants from State funds may be made under the Act of 1934 for the provision of seeds, manures, spraying materials and implements for allotments let to &ldquo;unemployed persons&rdquo; where suitable land has been made available for the allotments by local associations at their own expense and the question of making a grant in each such case has to be considered on its merits, regard being had to the number of &ldquo;unemployed persons&rdquo; in the town who have not any land of their own suitable for cultivation.  I am to add that the Act is not intended to apply to unemployed persons in small towns or villages such as Clarecastle and that arrangements for the provision of allotments in such places could not be made.</P>
    <P>The Minister regrets, therefore, that, after careful consideration the scope of the Acts cannot be extended, as suggested, to unemployed persons in rural areas.</P>
    <P>That clearly cuts out a town of the size of Clarecastlc, with 30 unemployed persons, each of them able to plough his own piece of land and that land available.  I do not know whether there has been a change of policy or not and, on looking up the report of the Minister for Agriculture I find that, on page 149, it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the centres Dunmanway, Roanmore (Waterford), Dingle, Castleisland, Castlerea, Mountrath, Bailieboro' and Dublin (Mount Street Club) the land for allotments was provided by certain associations approved by the Minister under Section 7 (1) (c) of the Acquisition of Land (Allotments) (Amendment) Act, 1934.  In each of the other centres mentioned the land for the <Col N="274" /> allotments was made available by the respective local authorities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, in each of the centres in the table, but in those towns I have mentioned &mdash; Dunmanway, Roanmore, etc.&mdash;they were provided by local associations and the Minister gave the necessary grants for the seeds and manures.</P>
    <P>I read this letter from the Minister for Agriculture in which he says that due consideration is given to the number of unemployed and that he did not think in Clarecastle the number of unemployed was sufficient.  I have looked up the table, in which is given the number of unemployed persons to whom seeds, etc., were provided, free of charge, and it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dunmanway, 13; Roanmore, 17; Castlerea, 8; Bailieboro', 25.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When I contrast that with the 30 men in Clarecastle prepared to till their plots and pay for them, I ask why it is they are withheld from these benefits. I certainly cannot reconcile the attitude of the Minister on the two occasions.</P>
    <P>The Minister probably will ask me how he is going to administer these grants, if he agrees to the provisions and agrees that there is necessity and demand for plots.  Well, it ought to be within the ability of the Government Departments to find a way by which these grants may be administered.  Of course, the county council is the statutory body, but it has subsidiary bodies. There are the county committees of agriculture and boards of health. These bodies certainly might be asked to do something in the matter.  There are the agricultural instructors employed by each committee, and the home assistance officers employed by each board of health.  Those may be asked to lend a hand.  On the representations of a few ratepayers you build a cottage value for a few hundred pounds.  In the same way, you might have a specific number of ratepayers in an area make an application and there may be somebody responsible whom the Minister could ask to administer this grant.  There <Col N="275" /> is plenty of legislation by which the land may be acquired&mdash;there is the Emergency Powers Act and the recent Act which the Minister put through here, the Relief of Unemployment Act. If parish councils, which have been boosted so much throughout the country, are to be in any way effective, here is an opportunity for them and an opportunity for the Minister to try their effectiveness and put them to do this work under their supervision.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister has disabused his mind of the idea that the times are normal.  They are not normal: the abnormal has become the normal.  I ask the Minister not to allow legal conservation or Civil Service conservatism to hold him up in dealing with this problem.  The necessity of the people is fundamental, I suggest; and I also suggest that there is a big demand for these plots and that the Minister ought to take immediate action to meet that demand.  As to its administration, I see no reason why the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Local Government could not issue an advertisement saying that the committees of agriculture would be prepared, say, on the 12th February or on any other day in February the Minister may mention, as early as possible, to consider applications for plots in the committee's area and also to consider proposals for the acquisition of land, having at the back all the time compulsory powers of acquisition and fixing, if you like, the price of land in those particular areas.  There is no reason why that cannot be done, and there is no reason why means should not be provided by which these things may be done.</P>
    <P>There is no use in trying to get away with a statement that the administrative side would be very difficult. Unless the Government throws its heart and soul into this and gives it full material and moral support, nothing will come of it.  Therefore, I am asking the Government to give it that complete moral and material support to-day.  January has gone; St. Brigid's Day is on us, and most of the land to be got will be old lea land which will <Col N="276" /> have to be looked after immediately, and those taking it will have to go out and turn it immediately and get something done.  I put it to the Minister that these people feel&mdash;and feel rightly &mdash;that if there is in July, August and September a shortage, or a danger of a shortage, they will be far more independent, if they are able to have at the back of their houses a pit of potatoes, some turnips, cabbage and other vegetables to tide them over the crisis, if it comes.  These people are anxious to help and have a right to be afforded an opportunity to help, not only in their own interests, but in the interests of the community Therefore, I ask the Minister to give this sympathetic consideration to-day and to make provision to meet the urgent demand of these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to second the motion.  In doing so, I feel convinced that the proposer has irrefutable arguments in favour of what he claims.  I do think that the Government, in framing those two Acts originally, began at the wrong end of the stick, for the reason that, although the large centres of population held the largest number of unemployed, they were for the most part not agriculturally-minded. For the greater portion of their lives the inhabitants of these centres had been engaged in other operations, such as building, road work, sewerage, and works of that kind.  I hold that the first people who should have been catered for were those who were really agriculturally-minded, and you will find these people, to the greatest extent, in the non-urbanised areas.  What is more, you will find them situated amongst some of the richest lands in Ireland, such as some of the counties in Leinster, where you have practically virgin soil. I have in mind two or three counties immediately surrounding Dublin, and the County Dublin itself.  In County Dublin you have farms of 500, 600 and 800 acres of land run by a few people, while on the borders of those lands you have, in most cases, the remnants of the people who were expelled from them in times of confiscation&mdash;people who have the real land spirit and the <Col N="277" /> land ideology.  Meath, of course, is an outstanding example.  The population of Meath has decreased by almost one-half in the last 100 years, by confiscations and by driving the people out of the lands they held and converting them into huge ranches.  To-day, you find one-third of the population of that county occupying some 4,700 cottages and owning less land, in small holdings or plots, than three of the largest holders in County Meath.  That is an extraordinary state of affairs to have in this country.</P>
      <P>Meath, possibly, would be the worst example, but there are other counties here almost as bad.  In counties such as Limerick, Tipperary and most of Cork you have huge grazing lands, and on the borders of these lands you have, barely existing, the people whose ancestors were driven from these lands within the last century.  All of that land is practically virgin soil and would require very little treatment, with the ordinary rotation of crops, for a year or two, except perhaps for the application of some artificial manures.  In those areas also you find that there is a lot of unrecorded unemployment, because many of the people in these areas did not register at the time the Act came into operation.  We know from experience that many of these people do not register, and there is often great difficulty in finding the <i>locale</i> of persons who are unemployed. You also find slums in these areas.  As a matter of fact, in some of these small towns with a population of 500 or 600 people, you will find some of the worst slums in Ireland and some of the worst cases of unemployment.  I think that, in farming the Acts, consideration should have been given to these matters.  I think it is a terrible thing that you should have such conditions existing in counties such as Kildare and Meath, and other counties, where you have the best land in Ireland.  As I have said, in Meath you have something like one-third of the population holding less land than one-twentieth of the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, as to the question of administration, I have heard complaints by the parish councils.  I know of one <Col N="278" /> town where there is a very excellent parish council, doing very excellent work.  I am referring to the town of Kildare, where you have a very active parish council, both willing and able to do the work that is required.  They did have some allotments there, but only a very small number.  They were provided with a small number at their own expense.  Now, I think that this should not have been the case.  There are many people who would willingly avail of such an opportunity, both employed and unemployed.  Of course, I hold that the unemployed should be given the first claim, and I also hold that the land should not be given indiscriminately, but there are people, earning small salaries or incomes, whose employment is precarious and who, at any moment, may be unemployed, and those people are anxious to take the land and pay for it at an economic price if the land is made available.</P>
    <P>If the present Acts do not give sufficient power at the present moment, I suggest that an emergency Act could be introduced.  After all, this is a time of great emergency, and at no time in the history of this country have you found the people so eager to make provision for themselves.  I know that in some urban areas where land was made available for the unemployed, there was a feeling at first amongst some of these people that, since they had never turned soil in their lives they would not be able to turn their hands to agriculture, and that it would be better if only a few went in for it, but that spirit has gone now and a very different spirit prevails, and they now feel and know that they are capable of tilling the land.  In one town, for instance, where there were 200 or 300 plots attached to cottages, all these plots are models of intense cultivation, and the cotters in some cases, after providing for themselves from their plots, can pay the ordinary cottier's rent of 4/- or 5/- a week.</P>
    <P>I suggest that in this time of emergency, apart from any revolutionary change, the banks should take all that into consideration and should come to the assistance of the State in this <Col N="279" /> matter.  Depositors are paid 1 per cent. for the money they deposit in the banks in this country, and that money amounts to something between £150,000,000 to £180,000,000.  On the other hand, if you want to borrow money from the banks, you are charged 5¼ and 6 per cent.  That seems to be an anomalous state of affairs, and if the banks were to place at the disposal of the Government one-twentieth of people's money&mdash;money that is being lent to rival producers at the moment&mdash; it would go a long way not alone towards meeting this matter of the provision of allotments, but towards setting agriculture in this country on its feet.  If that money were placed to the credit of the State, lent to the county councils or the bodies suggested by Senator Hogan, and given out, as it would be, to 95 per cent. credit-worthy people, I believe it would go a long way towards the resuscitation of agriculture and putting it on its feet.</P>
    <P>With reference to this question of loans or grants at the moment, I deprecate the suggestion that might be made that I am out for borrowing or getting something for nothing, but I do feel that many of the farmers will not be able to carry out the duties which the Government is asking them to carry out if something is not done in the matter of loans.  Again, I say that the banks should seriously take up this matter and that a meeting should be held between the representatives of agriculture and industry and the banks, and that some scheme of financing should be devised such as has been done in other agricultural countries like New Zealand, Denmark and so on. I do not wish it to be thought that any criticism I have offered has been offered in anything but a spirit of cooperation and in the hope and belief that a way can be and should be found out of the difficulty if the Government tackles the task with the serious intention of solving this question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the first thing we should do is to pay a tribute to those public authorities and boards of assistance throughout the country that <Col N="280" /> have availed of the facilities offered by the Acts up to the present.  They have given new life to our unemployed and shown them that they can do something for themselves.  They have given them the opportunity to produce sufficient food for themselves and their families through the winter months. The unemployed themselves appreciate that, and as far as Galway City and the unemployed there who were provided with plots last year are concerned, they are a credit to the people who interested themselves in securing the plots for them and a credit to themselves.  Senator Hogan was very reasonable in his presentation of the case.  I would be prepared to go much further, and to ask for a greater extension of facilities, as it is about time the Government took steps to impress upon the people the fact that we cannot continue as if we were living in normal times.  A proposal of this kind, to carry out national work, should not be held up by any regulations or by red-tape. Ministers have appealed to the people to grow sufficient food and have impressed upon them, that if that is not done, the country may be faced with starvation.  Should there be a food shortage nobody would suffer more than the very poor, and particularly unemployed people with large families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As these people are willing to avail of any opportunities to help themselves nothing should stand in the way, money or any other consideration. Apart from the advantage of producing food this work would have good moral effects.  Tea, I am sorry to say, has become practically an essential food with poor people, but now that is going to be rationed, there is an opportunity to replace it by more substantial food.  As regards the administration expenses, as Senator Hogan pointed out, there are parish councils in every county and that is work in which they would be prepared to help.  In rural areas compulsory powers for the acquisition of land will not be necessary.  In many places I am confident that parish councils and other organisations will be able to get land voluntarily.  That is one way of helping on this good work.  Then comes the question of securing seeds <Col N="281" /> and manures.  If seeds were provided I think implements would be available locally, and perhaps manures.  It would be a good thing, of course, if seeds or manures could be procured for those requiring them at reduced prices.  I would be prepared to extend the powers that the Government has to unemployed labourers and also to occupants of labourers' cottages.  In many places only a portion of these cottage plots are tilled, the remainder being in grass.  It may be thought that that was due to laziness.  When conditions are investigated, however, it will probably be found that the tenants are unemployed and that even if they were willing to till the plots they had not the necessary means.  In cases of that kind free seeds might be given.</P>
    <P>I know places in County Galway where work of that kind is catered for by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, but under present conditions the resources of such societies are strained owing to the great demands made upon them.  I am afraid that voluntary organisations will not be able to meet further demands of that type at present.  I would go even further than Senator Hogan, as I would be prepared, if local conferences of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or parish councils acquired land for tillage, to assist them, on the understanding that the produce would be distributed amongst the local poor. The Government might give assistance there by giving seeds and manures at reduced prices.  I do not think that would be too much to ask.  In Galway, last year, we had 148 plot-holders, and this year the number has been doubled. The corporation, with the assistance of the Catholic Young Men's Society and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, co-operated in that work.  The difficulty there was to acquire suitable land.  The Minister should intervene in cases like that and if he has not sufficient power to take land under the Land Act of 1934, he should avail of the emergency powers.  In the present tillage drive an attempt should be made to change the tastes of our people from some foods to which they have become accustomed, food that is produced <Col N="282" /> here.  In that respect greater use might be made of the schools to educate the children as to the advantages of homegrown food.</P>
    <P>In the present emergency the Government should not lose sight of the work that might be done to bring about the necessary change through the national schools, particularly by the teachers, in view of the fact that we have already people campaigning about &ldquo;black bread&rdquo;.  In the schools the children could be told of the advantages of eating pure wheaten bread.  As the tillage campaign affects the welfare of the country generally, I ask the Minister to draw the attention of the Minister for Agriculture to the need of getting the Civic Guards to inspect every holding.  The present system of inspection is too slow.  The Civic Guards should be instructed to inspect holdings to see if a real attempt is being made to get on with tillage work.</P>

      <P>I came here specially to support Senator Hogan's motion. As a matter of fact, I was disappointed that the motion was not dealt with last week, because I feel that it is one of the most important motions tabled in this House since I became a member.  I appreciate the way Senator Hogan put his case, and I hope it will have the desired effect. We listen on the wireless night after night to appeals to produce food. Now, I am going to take advantage of this opportunity to put before the Minister who is present, though he is not really the Minister responsible, the position in the area in which I reside. Our case is different from many of those put forward.  I reside in an area which has some of the best arable land in the country.  It is a sad state of affairs that in the 12 miles from Dublin to Ashbourne the only people, with the exception of three or four, who till any of this arable land are the cottage-holders with an acre of land attached to their houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I happen to be a member of the parish council which some time ago took up the matter of acquiring land <Col N="283" /> They did not want that land for nothing and they did not want free grants; they were willing to pay a fair rent. But I am sorry to say that they could not get one acre of land in that area except at a rent which they could not afford to pay.  During the last fortnight I myself have been trying to acquire land in north Dublin from the banks, which Senator Cummins mentioned. The greater portion of this land is held by the banks.  I have gone so far as to offer £6 an acre for land as I am personally prepared to till 40 acres.  I could not get one acre because the banks can get £7 and £8 an acre for it.  That land is very convenient to the city.  We heard last night about the difficulty of transport. The food required for the poor of Dublin could be carried on people's backs from this land if the food were available.  But we cannot get the land.</P>
    <P>Under the compulsory tillage scheme they are compelled to till some of this land.  The only part of the land you can get is the worst end of it.  The parish council in Finglas have been unable to acquire any land suitable for tillage and I, myself, although I am prepared to till land, was only able to get a small portion.  I hope that the Government will bring pressure to bear on the banks, as the banks are the stumbling block.  In my electoral division there are thousands of acres of land which people are ready to take at a reasonable rent.  Even when these people are compelled to have some of the land tilled they will not give it to the local people.  That is a terrible state of affairs when we remember that in the next few years there may be many people hungry in the city.  The Minister who is present is not the Minister who deals with that matter, but he ought to bring it before the Government.</P>

      <P>Even if it is a little outside the motion, it deals with the question of producing food for the people.  The banks manage to make out that the land in our area is accommodation land and the amount they are tilling is very small.  There is another matter which may not be quite relevant to the motion, but it has to do with the survival of this nation, and that is, that it is hardly fair that people who get land from the Land Commission, some of them may be cottage holders who get five or six acres, are not compelled to till portion of that land.  In County Dublin people have got land from the Land Commission the all-in cost of which would work out at about £1 per acre.  Because they can get an easy living otherwise, or because they can get £7 per acre for letting that land in grass, they do not till it.  I should like to distinguish between people who were given holdings and people who have put their life savings into the purchase of a holding.</P>

      <P>There are just one or two points which I want to make. This discussion has focussed my mind on one matter.  It may have been very illuminating to listen to professors for three or four days discussing matters that were not vital in view of the dangers which, it is indicated, we may have to face in the future as a result of this war.  I do not want to say anything about professors, but I would say of professors who have come under my observation that the writing of many of them is abominable, that their <Col N="285" /> spelling of English is erratic and that their conception of mathematics is disgraceful.  Professors took up the time of the House this week and last week discussing these matters, but the matter now before the House is of supreme, vital and fundamental importance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Senator might be placed in that category, too. Judging by his accent, he must have received some academic training.  I am afraid that we in this country expect too much from Government aid, and it may seem strange to say that we ought to do something ourselves. My county council last week received a letter from the Department indicating that we ought to visualise our responsibilities as elected representatives of the people and do something towards the greater production of food this year.  I am glad that this motion has been brought forward because there was one section of the community who were not included by my council when they agreed to certain commitments on Saturday last, subject to the sanction of the Ministry, to help other sections of the community. Visualising our responsibility as a local county parliament elected by the people, and anxious to give all the help that we could to the policy of the Government to encourage an increase of food production, we adopted a certain scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that, in the main, the farmers are badly off.  We know that because of the intensive pressure we have to bring to bear on them to pay their rates and other commitments. The report of the Registrar-General is definite and clear evidence of the condition of agriculture.  Rural conditions are such that there are no marriages in the rural districts, with the result that schools have to be closed and our race is disappearing.  If you meet a hungry man and say to him: &ldquo;Go n-eirigheadh do bhóthar leat&rdquo;, that will not fill his stomach or give him a good breakfast.  These are extraordinary times, and we have had evidence <Col N="286" /> of that from Ministers.  We read the statement which the Taoiseach broadcast last night.  I think that the Taoiseach and other prominent people have said several times that they would even prefer a revival of the Irish language to national freedom.  I think the preservation of the race is infinitely more important.</P>
    <P>The Limerick County Council have asked the sanction of the Minister for the scheme to which I have referred, under which it is proposed to disburse from £10,000 to £15,000 in sums ranging from £20 to £5 amongst farmers as well as labourers who have cottage plots.  We will be the guarantors for the money.  The Minister will give his sanction, and with that money we will be in a position to bring within the ambit of this scheme every conceivable farmer, even those with a high valuation, but not the highest, down to the cottage holder, and the extremely poor, on the production of evidence that their rates have been paid.  That will apply to all sections. We will provide them with wheat, oats, barley and potato seeds.  As guarantors that will cost the county council at least £15,000.  I regard it as a magnificent effort on the part of the county council, and am proud to be a member of a body which has such a fine sense of its responsibility, one that has risen in such a magnificent way to meet the demands of the present situation.  That effort is to be contrasted with the action of those who have been hampering the efforts of the Government.  If one is to judge by some of the attacks that have been made on the Government during this, one of the most critical periods in our history, all that one can say is that some of those who have made the attacks are only fit for Grangegorman Mental Hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that attacks had been made, but I mentioned no names. The Limerick County Council, in this scheme, are making provision to <Col N="287" /> relieve a section of the people that they are not under any statutory obligation to relieve.  The council will be able to provide them with money to purchase seeds.  Those people have no land.  I am aware, of course, that under various Acts land can be acquired compulsorily.  It is not always possible to do that, and sometimes it might be injudicious to do so. The Minister may be surprised to hear that within the last week I, in my capacity as an auctioneer, have set 47 acres of land for farmers&mdash;land that was available not far from Limerick City.  I know another 40 acres that are available.  As a board of health we have decided to set 23 acres of land that we had acquired for a site for a regional hospital.  It is a surprising thing that it was extensive farmers who, in the main, applied to the board of health for the use of that land.  It was set to them within the last week. I am in a position to tell the Minister that there are 40 or 50 acres more available.  This land is owned by farmers who are in the invidious position that they cannot till it themselves. One is a lady advanced in years.  I think she has reached the age of 80, and is just waiting for the call of the trumpet.  She has no means of tilling her land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure the Minister that if he exercises the emergency powers conferred on him by the Oireachtas he will be able to secure plenty of land in the County Limerick, much of it in the neighbourhood of the city, which it is not possible for the owners to till at the moment.  He can get all that land to accommodate the class of people referred to by Senator Hogan.  We have brought practically every other section of the rural community into our scheme, and if, as late as Saturday, I had known of, or thought of, the particular section now referred to, we could, I think, with the co-operation of the Minister, have hammered out some means whereby that section also would be brought in. If the Minister is prepared to respond to the appeal made by Senator Hogan and make provision for the class of <Col N="288" /> people that he referred to, people who are prepared to work, then I think that we as a county council would be prepared to accommodate them with seeds and money.  If we are enabled to do that we will, I think, be rendering a very useful service to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMacCabe" hpid="Mr. MacCabe Mr. MacCabe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the motion, but I am afraid its introduction was delayed too long.  It should have been introduced a month ago.  The remarks of the last speaker would seem to bear that out.  It is well known that within the last three weeks a great portion of the land of the country has been set in conacre.  Farmers knew that they had to till a certain portion of their land, and consequently they set it to people who were prepared to take it for tillage.  I am afraid there is no land available at the moment.  I do not agree with some of the remarks made about urban workers, because I have no hesitation in saying that if they had the plots they would not work them.  The position is quite the opposite with rural workers.  They have always been accustomed to work their plots, and if they could get land they would be prepared to work it now as they have always done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience is that rural workers till their little plots.  Urban workers, on the other hand, have no liking for the spade or the shovel or for any form of farm work.  I am sorry to have to say that and hope I may be wrong, and that Senator Hogan and his colleague, who seconded the motion, are right. Perhaps this emergency has brought about a change in their attitude towards farm work, and that they are now prepared to be up and doing and to help, as far as possible, in the production of food for the people.  In some counties you have not a very big number of large farms.  The small farmer, the man with ten, 12 or 14 acres of land, is prepared to take conacre from the larger farmer, and is anxious to produce as much food as possible for human and animal use.  Without any compulsion, the small farmer was always prepared to do that because he is the real worker in this country.  In his desire to do that, we all know that <Col N="289" /> he has suffered from many handicaps. I hope the statement that land was not made available for him will not be censored.  The suggestion that I would make to the Government is that where there are large farms they should exercise the compulsory powers they possess and have those farms worked by people who are willing to work them.  If the Government are not prepared to do that, then I think they are not doing their duty.  If there should be a scarcity of food, there will be nobody to blame for that but the Government, due to their failure to exercise the compulsory powers conferred on them by the Oireachtas. Consequently, I say the whole nation will blame the Government.  The small farmer, as I have said, is prepared to do his work and so also are the workers in the rural areas.  They should get plots at any cost.  They should be provided with any land that has not, so far, been set.  On the other hand, I have not the slightest hope that the urban workers will respond to any such appeal.</P>

The Dublin Municipal Council did not wait until the present emergency arose to realise their duty as far as the provision of plots is concerned.  This is a matter to which the Dublin Corporation have devoted a great deal of attention for a number of years past.  They have provided plots for quite a large number of plot-holders around the city.  In addition, they provide nice plots for their tenants in their housing schemes.  I did not quite understand the remarks of my friend Senator McCabe when he said that, in his opinion, urban workers would not till their plots. Our experience is that the people who have been taken out to the cottages in the suburbs of the city from the most squalid surroundings, from the terrible basements and slums of the city, have been willing to till the plots attached to their cottages, have been active in doing so and these plots are a credit to them.</P>

      <P>If Senator McCabe has any doubt about that statement, I will show him any day he pleases the result of the efforts of these poor people who never knew anything about agricultural work, to do their duty in respect of these plots.  I should have said at first that I am in full sympathy with the motion, which I think Senator Hogan put forward in a very reasonable and reasoned manner, and I am sure the Minister will give it due consideration. Senator Hogan asked why the legislation stopped with the municipal councils, urban councils and town commissioners, and why it had not been extended.  I am not conversant with county council work. Senator Hogan, who is a member of a county council, is, and so are a number of other Senators.  My activities are confined to the city, but would the explanation be that the agricultural labourers' cottages supply the want further out?</P>

      <P>In going through the country, one sees a number of labourers' cottages, some with land well tilled and others with land untilled. With regard to Senator McCabe's point that urban dwellers will not till their land, whereas rural dwellers will, I do not know whether the Senator goes home by the Ashbourne road, but, if he does, I advise him to look at a couple of the cottages on the righthand side of the road just beyond Ashbourne, and he will find that there is not a cabbage plant planted near them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving a definite case of cottages, not very far from Senator Tunney's home.  At least, that was the position some few years ago. <Col N="291" /> With regard to the point raised by Senator McCabe as to plots being left untilled, there was an Act passed in this House not very long ago called the Acquisition of Derelict Sites Act. I was in favour of it because, as I then said, these derelict sites gave our city a bad appearance.  In connection with any plots left untilled by cottage holders around Dublin, or in the urban districts, I suggest to the members of local authorities to take keen note of any of the people who are so neglectful as not to do their duty in the present crisis.  I think the number of people who do not properly till the plots attached to their cottage are very few. We are told that there is a black sheep in every flock, and possibly there are a few black sheep amongst these people, and it would be wise if members of local bodies, and most Senators are associated with local bodies, would take note of the tenants who do not, and will not, do their duty in the present crisis.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks, Senator Hogan said that local authorities or local associations could carry out this desirable work, and Senator Cummins said that there was a very active parish council doing excellent work in the town of Kildare.  That, I think, is an unurbanised town?</P>

The remarks I have made with regard to the parish council in Kildare might possibly apply equally to the excenent body which Senator Hawkins has in Galway.  In this city, at all events, we have done our duty and we did not wait for the emergency to come.  We have provided plots for years for the poor people, and not alone have we provided plots for  but we have provided plots in addition to the cottages, and the poor people are doing their best to till them.</P>

      <P>I should like to recommend the motion to the favourable consideration of the Minister because I believe that there is a great necessity at present for the extension as far as possible to the small towns and villages of the country of the system of allotments given in urban areas.  Unlike the position in Cavan, Senator McCabe's county, there is plenty of land available in the greater part of the country which could readily be taken over for this purpose, and if all these villages were provided with allotments under this scheme, it would give a great deal of work to the workers.  I have no doubt that, in 99.9 per cent. of the cases in our county, these plots would be well tilled.  I agree with Senator Hawkins when he says that no question of expense should hold up an extension of the scheme.  It could be worked by the parish councils, where these exist, and it could be worked very efficiently through the county councils or boards of health, without the necessity for setting up any very elaborate machinery.  It would be quite easy also to arrange for the provision of seeds to the workers.  I should like to express my agreement also with the statement of Senator Tunney, who said that it is not always possible for a parish council to secure the land.  That has been the experience in some counties and it has also been the experience in my part of the country. I should like, in addition to that, to say that the tillage regulations should be enforced as quickly as possible this <Col N="293" /> year in view of the great necessity for providing foodstuffs for the people.</P>

      <P>There may be administrative difficulties in accepting Senator Hogan's motion as it stands. The fact that it calls for legislation would imply a delay which, I think, would be fatal, but I am certain that the spirit of the motion is acceptable to this House and I trust it will be acceptable to the Minister and to the Government.  It is particularly acceptable to the women and it is on behalf of the women I should like to say a few words.</P>
      <P>In his very telling address, Senator Hogan spoke of the unemployed whose backs are up against the stone wall of circumstance.  I think that there is nobody whose back is up so much against the cold, stone wall of circumstance as that of the woman whose husband is unemployed.  It is on behalf of the women in the homes of the unemployed and in the hope of securing for them some of the help which an increased number of allotments will provided that I am speaking. Here, I may mention a matter which, perhaps, escaped the attention of the Minister.  I heard it from Senator Hawkins, who made a special study of this question of allotments.  He said that in Galway some men who had allotments as unemployed persons last year were called up to the Army and cannot this year be reckoned as unemployed. In these cases, the plots have been taken from them, although their wives were quite willing to work them and, indeed, had assisted in working them.  In Galway, one of the pleasantest sights is that of the women and children working in the evenings on their plots.  That demonstrates the great social value of the allotment system, but I do not want to stress that at the present time because it is a matter which concerns all times. Now, however, we must think of everything in terms of the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present condition of affairs was brought before us very vividly last night in the Taoiseach's broadcast. He spoke, very relevantly, of the value of potatoes in the crisis.  That is where <Col N="294" /> the question of allotments enters.  If you read Canon Peadar O Laoghaire's books, you will learn how, in old times, the period between the time when the old potatoes came to an end and the time when the new crop came in was known as &ldquo;Hungry July.&rdquo;  There need now be no &ldquo;Hungry July&rdquo; because the potatoes raised in the plots are for the most part early potatoes and they will bring us over the hungry months. The potatoes, cabbages and onions which can be raised on these plots can be of vital importance this year.  I should like to stress a point made by Senator Hawkins.  He spoke about the importance of bringing home to the people, through the medium of the schools or some other medium, the necessity for a change-over in food habits and for impressing upon them some knowledge of food values.  I should like to mention, in that connection, a matter which has often impressed me.  The food value of the potato does not consist in the potato generically.  Special kinds of potatoes have a much higher food value than others and, in one part of the country, the health of the people deteriorated because, for reasons of export, they got into the habit of growing the wrong class of potatoes from the nutritive point of view.  I hope the Ministry will give some attention to that point and that the people will be taught to use, with the most satisfactory dietetic results, the food which will be produced in these cottage gardens. That is the sort of thing which everybody will be anxious to learn. Vocational committees throughout the country have arranged a series of lectures on food values for animals. Why not provide lectures on food values for people?  This may not be germane to this issue, but it is a thing that should not be forgotten.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all approach this motion with sympathy.  I know the motive which Senator Hogan had in mind in bringing the motion forward.  It is an effort, on his part, to meet the present emergency by facilitating an increase in tillage and also to relieve the distress amongst people who may not be able <Col N="295" /> to provide themselves with the wherewithal to purchase the necessary foodstuffs. Listening to some of the speakers, one would imagine that plot-holders' legislation was only a very recent thing and that, up to 1926, when it was introduced&mdash;there was a subsequent Act in 1934&mdash;there were no powers whatever in public bodies to acquire land for plots or allotments. That is not the position.  The Labourers Acts were in operation here since about 1883 to enable public bodies to acquire tracts of land through the country.  Whether rural councils at that time or their successors down to the present have been asleep with regard to that is another matter.  I suggest they have not.  Any county council or, subsequently, the board of health, under the Labourers Acts was enabled to acquire tracts of land compulsorily for allotment amongst labourers, the price to be fixed, of course, by arbitration.  Listening to some of the Senators, one would imagine that there was no such provision. That provision has been availed of largely in recent times.  Sixteen boards of health in this country have availed of it to acquire tracts of land in their counties to provide allotments for labourers in those counties. Amongst these sixteen boards of health is Senator Hogan's board of health in County Clare.  I think it has acquired something like 24 such tracts in County Clare to provide allotments for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there may have been some misunderstanding in certain boards of health as to how land acquired under the Labourers Act could be availed of or how it might be let.  When this motion was first mooted, we proposed bringing to the notice of boards of health that they might make arrangements to extend that and that they were not compelled to charge what is known as an economic rent, that they could charge what is called an appropriate rent.  That would, to a considerable extent, have met the position of areas that do not come under the Allotments Acts.  When the Allotments Act was introduced in 1926 you had what was considered an anomalous <Col N="296" /> position, that in the counties they could provide allotments but in the towns they could not and it was not an oversight then any more than it was an oversight in 1934 that the people in the smaller villages were not catered for.  The 1926 Act provided for compulsory acquisition but it did not provide for subsidy and the 1934 Act filled what was considered a gap by enabling subsidies to be granted.</P>
    <P>In relation to areas outside the urban authorities, or town commissioners, or town boroughs, one may ask what was the purpose in providing, say, free seeds in those areas.  A very different situation exists in what are called urban districts from what would exist in smaller towns.  Conditions of living are regarded as higher, more expensive at any rate, in urban districts or districts of bigger population.  It is more difficult to get accommodation, and land around those areas is much dearer.  But the factor that had to be borne in mind, particularly at that time, was that those Allotments Acts would be very difficult to administer unless you had an organisation there to administer them because the provisions of the Allotments Acts require (1) that a person must be in receipt of unemployment benefit, or (2) that he must be in receipt of unemployment assistance, or (3) that he is in receipt of home assistance or outdoor relief, or (4) that he is a person who has not been employed continuously for more than 24 hours in any one week during the preceding 12 months, or that his total earnings through employment in that casual way do not exceed £39 in urban districts or £52 in county boroughs. Before the allotment can be granted under the Allotments Acts the authorities must be satisfied that the person getting that allotment complies with one or other of these provisions.  That is the difficulty we have in approaching this matter and extending it to the other districts that are now suggested here, that is, to extend it all over the country.</P>
    <P>We have growing up here parish councils that may take on the position that they might even perhaps in some <Col N="297" /> way be regarded as semi-local authorities, but at the time that these Acts were passed there was no such organisation that one could fall back on. Where you recoup for any loss that may be occasioned in the letting of the land&mdash;you may provide for recoupment in regard to seeds, manure and implements&mdash;then the central authority has to account for that and is always subject to the Comptroller and Auditor-General who may take up and examine any particular scheme and see that those conditions have been complied with in the allocation of any of those allotments. You have here in this State, I think, something like 283 villages with a population of over 250, which are not urbanised.  There are 88 also that are urbanised, and with regard to those 88 I think all, except six, have put allotment schemes into operation. Among those towns that are urbanised, county boroughs or towns in which there are town commissioners, there is only one town that we know of, that is Tuam, where in this year at any rate any powers of compulsory acquisition had to be resorted to.  So far as the difficulty about acquisition is concerned, I personally do not think there is going to be any difficulty in getting land at the present time because, in connection with land around all the smaller towns, for cow parks and other purposes, we know that when the occupant of that grazing land is entitled to get an allowance under the tillage regulations for the land that he lets for tillage in allotments it certainly is a great incentive to him to let if he is not inclined to till himself.  In that way I believe there will be no difficulty whatever in getting land available.</P>
    <P>What is troubling me and what is troubling the Department of Agriculture is the difficulty and the cost of administration.  It is not a want of sympathy.  There is whole-hearted sympathy with the motion itself.  You must take the position that the board of health is the only authority that can administer this and if the board of health is going to take on the responsibility of administering this scheme in small towns widely scattered over its area&mdash;and I am thinking of big counties &mdash;and if it is going to take on this job <Col N="298" /> of dealing with these small towns with the machinery that it has at its disposal at present, it will have a very difficult task.  But under the Allotments Acts the responsibility does not rest there.  The responsibility rests on the Department of Local Government and on the Department of Agriculture to see that every allotment is vouched for.  At the present time when allotments are being made in the towns throughout the country they have to come before our Department, they have to be examined and certified, which means inspection and so on.  From time to time I have heard criticisms not only in this House but in the other House about this country being overrun with inspectors.  Well, whether we like it or not, as I see it at the moment &mdash;I am only trying to see some way in which it could be avoided&mdash;if we are going to make this extension, not having sufficient local machinery to assist us, the administration is certainly going to be very expensive.</P>
    <P>I have been trying to find some means by which we could endeavour to meet this motion, and avoid that expense.  Every time a party applies for an allotment, we have to certify that he comes under one or other of the four heads I have mentioned.  I may be asked: &ldquo;Why be so strict about that?&rdquo;  Well, there have not been very many cases brought to our notice, but there have been some instances where attempts have been made to get allotments in this way by persons, in some cases sons of small farmers, who were unemployed at the particular time the allotments were given, but were employed a day or two afterwards and continued in employment.  That kind of thing has been tried from time to time, and it is the necessity for a check that has been our difficulty.  I have been looking for a method by which we might deal with this problem and avoid that inspection which is necessary and for which we are responsible when we have to deal with Comptroller and Auditor-General.  I was wondering how far an extension by the boards of health of those allotments under the Labourers Act could meet the Senator's motion.  The losses to a local body would not be considerable. <Col N="299" /> Let them charge an appropriate rent, and let us see it we can get from the Department of Agriculture some recoupment in regard to seeds and manures.  So far as the demand itself is concerned&mdash;Senator Hogan has certain cases in mind, and I am quite satisfied that they are genuine&mdash;in our Department it is very small at the present time.  I am certainly pleased and gratified to see the way in which parish councils in certain parts of the country have taken this up, and I am afraid that a move along the lines of this motion is going to stultify parish councils in what I regard as a very laudable activity indeed.  I have seen it in Mullingar, where the parish council have got together on their own initiative, asked for subscriptions in the locality, got land and allocated it among the people in need of it.  I think that is a magnificent spirit, and I hope that this resolution&mdash;although I know that the spirit and the intention behind it are laudable too&mdash;is not going to take away from parish councils the effort that some of them are putting into this matter now, that is to rely on their own resources, to try to do the best they can, and interest themselves in activities such as those to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned here that associations, incorporated or unincorported, can get grants for seeds, manures and implements from the Department of Agriculture.  That is so, and that was an aspect of their activity which I had hoped would be availed of when those parish councils had got going in areas where there was no local authority; in other words, no urban council. town commissioners or otherwise. I had hoped that they might use their association for that purpose, but, as Senator Hogan has said, it is true that it has not been the practice of the Department of Agriculture to grant those free seeds and manures in towns not exceeding a population of 1,000.  I have been asking people who are <i>au fait</i> with those matters, and I think that has really been due to the want of a demand for seeds, manures and implements in towns.</P>
    <P>As I say, of course there is also the <Col N="300" /> question of administration, which is so difficult in the smaller areas.  As some Senator has said, it is probably already almost too late, but if the blame rests on anybody it certainly does not rest on us, because there was no demand from those local bodies in respect of the powers that were already there.  The case that I thought might be made here to-day was that there were no powers to acquire land.  Senator Cummins did, to some extent, make that case, but that has not been our experience. I know the position in Kildare&mdash; there might have been some difficulty in getting land there&mdash;but I think with the compulsory tillage in and around Kildare the Senator will find no difficulty whatever in getting all the land he wants.  As I said, I thought that might be the case that would be made.  Our experience has been that we are getting letters in the Department asking us whether there is any possibility of plots being taken in their areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I was only thinking of the stud farms around Kildare.  I assure the Senator that so far as my Department and the Department of Agriculture are concerned we are anxious to meet this matter as best we can, but I am afraid that the costs of administering it and the difficulties of  it certainly make it practically impossible in the present year. I do not think there is much possibility that we can put it into operation in the present year, but when it does come to putting it into operation there must be some line drawn somewhere as to what you are going to call a village, because this is only stepping on to the point where we are going to be in the position that the small farmer in this country must be supplied with free seeds, manures and everything else.  That is what we are tending to, because when you come down to the small villages, and you are not prepared to do anything on your own but rely on the central fund for everything, <Col N="301" /> then you are gradually coming down from the small town to the small townland and so on until you come down to the individual.  There must be some suggestion made as to where the line is to be drawn in regard to the population of towns where this thing can be put into operation.</P>
      <P>There is no difficulty in getting land at a reasonable price for tillage and, with regard to trying to provide seeds and manures in necessitous cases in those towns, I think that is as far as we should be asked to go, and that is as far as one could ask the Department of Agriculture to go.  The amount involved is not going to be considerable &mdash;I refer to the cost of supplying these things.  If you are to prevent abuse you must have inspection and the maintenance of that type of check; there is no other way to avoid it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister approached this matter as if we were living in normal times.  I asked him to try to enter into the atmosphere that would surround abnormal times, but he did not.  He told us a lot about existing legislation.  Nobody knows better than the Minister how difficult it is, how slow, tedious and irritaing it is, to acquire land for plots under the legislation to which he referred.  It is a slow, tedious and almost impossible process; he knows that quite well and that legislation would not be at all suitable under prevailing conditions. The Minister said that the administration would be costly.  He said that there are over 200 villages with a certain population, outside the urbanised areas, that come under the provisions of the Towns Improvements Act of 1854.  It cost the Department of Agriculture £1,800 to administer the grant in respect of 76 areas.  I venture to say that the officers who were concerned were merely seconded from other work in the Department, and that amount only represents the time that they give to that particular work. I suggest that four or five times £1,800 would administer the allotment scheme quite easily in all the other towns in Éire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked about the difficulty <Col N="302" /> of administration, such as when certifying whether a person fulfils any of the qualifications set out and whether that person should or should not get a plot.  Surely that is not a difficult matter.  It is quite easy to get information from the home assistance officer or give some people authority to certify such as is given to priests and professional men in other connections. Administration should not be so very difficult.  The Minister said that his Department has not been bombarded with applications.  Possibly it has not been, and possibly the few applications sent to the Minister for Agriculture were so treated that they have deterred many other people from making application.  I have given instances of unemployed carters who have horses capable of ploughing.  These men would be willing to pay for the land, but the Department of Agriculture tells them: &ldquo;You are not the people we had in mind; you are unemployed, no doubt, but we cannot consider you.&rdquo;  I am sorry the Minister has taken up that attitude.  On the other hand, I am glad that there is a clear appreciation of the necessity for this in the minds of the Senators who spoke to-day.  I am glad that they see the desirability, the necessity and the possibility of what is asked for in the motion.  However, the Minister has indicated that he does not conceive how it can be done this year.  I wonder does that connote that it can be done some other year and that some greater consideration may be given to it this year and in coming years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Minister is sympathetic but, as the spear-head of his Department, he has to make the case that it cannot be done because the Department considers that it cannot. I am not putting this motion to a vote, because of the attitude taken up towards it and the promise that the Minister has given us that sympathetic consideration will be given to the subject this year and further action will be taken next year.  It has been stated <Col N="303" />&mdash;not by the Minister&mdash;that urban workers are slow and unwilling to use their plots, and it has also been stated, though not definitely, that they are too lazy to work their plots.  I have seen plots cultivated by urban workers and they would be a credit to men who have been employed in farming for 20 years or more.  I have seen plots that are a credit to the plot-holders and to the councils and I do not think that statement should be let go unchallenged.</P>

Senator MacDermot, in the course of his speech last night, said that on 4th December the feelings of the <i>Cork Examiner</i> were expressed by Senator Crosbie.  Senator MacDermot is misinformed.

      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall endeavour not to tax the patience of the House too much, although I was just thinking that I have a right to make three speeches.  I was prepared to speak on Wednesday of last week; I was prepared to speak last night, and I was prepared to speak half an hour ago, but all the arrangements broke down. Being, like Senator Madden, a Limerick man, I take broken treaties very lightly.  I will take one remark <Col N="304" /> made by the Minister as my text, and I shall proceed from that.  Last night the Minister said that Senator MacDermot wants to go to war, and that is the reason he wants to avoid censorship.  I will let Senator MacDermot explain and justify the motives that made him move this motion, but I can assure the House and the Minister that no such motives lay behind my action in seconding the motion.</P>
      <P>What I want&mdash;and I am speaking for myself and many people who think with me&mdash;is knowledge, light on the present situation.  That is a simple motive, and I shall now endeavour to give some reasons for it.  I will put before you with all sincerity the reason for my action, although I may not be able to put it before you with the amount of conviction I fain would attain.  In the debate last December I remarked that I was fully conscious of the heavy responsibilities, the terrible responsibilities, that lay on the Minister.  I pointed out that I realised clearly that the censor's task is a difficult one, and I admitted that, in times like the present, censorship is necessary, and that we have to forego to some extent the freedom of speech that the Constitution guarantees to us.  While I made these admissions, I gave it as my impression, my sincere impression, that the censorship in this country was being exercised too rigorously, and that it would be useful for both the Minister and the Department that controls the censorship, to have some precise limits, and to consider very carefully if they should not define these limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before the House is an attempt, possibly not phrased as wisely and as cleverly as some cleverer and wiser heads could phrase it, to define and to find such limits, to beat the bounds, as it were, of the regions of censorship.  Censorship, I admit, is necessary, and Ministers may perhaps rightly, under certain conditions and restrictions, hold it to be a good thing but we can have too much of a good thing.  There are poisons that, in moderation, are excellent tonics and extremely useful, but they are things of which &ldquo;a little more than a little is by much too much.&rdquo;  They have to be <Col N="305" /> circumscribed and cut down.  Particularly in the case of censorship, it is hard to find the happy mean between too much and too little publicity.  It is just one of those things in which virtue lies rather in erring towards the too much than towards the too little. Undoubtedly there is need for censorship. Nobody will deny that; but there are many, far more perhaps than the Minister realises, who think that the censorship is too rigorous, too penetrating, and that it is unwisely, because unnecessarily, exercised in some departments.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into all the examples that Senator MacDermot brought before the House.  They were attested and fully documented.  I shall just touch in outline the department that he mentioned&mdash;the censorship of newspapers.  It is obvious to my inexpert eye that there has been serious censorship at times of editorials.  The editor at times is cut off abruptly after an introductory sentence.  There is possibly a quotation, even in German, and down comes the hatchet and off goes his head. Again you read on and you find arguments that are inconsecutive, often ending in bathos or some fatuous platitude. However, I shall leave editors to look after themselves.</P>
    <P>Again I have been struck by the extraordinary manner in which censorship in regard to pictures is exercised. I am not a great visitor to the pictures but occasionally I go round the picture houses.  I have seen the news films&mdash; I think that is what they are called&mdash; here and in other places, and what struck me here was the paucity of depicted events&mdash;the absolute stupidity of some of the pictures and then the very ordinary pictures, of football matches, race meetings and gatherings of that kind which are shown.  The Minister for Supplies said, I think, on Saturday night, that there are some amongst us yet who speak and act as if the war were being fought on another planet instead of in the immediate vicinity of our shores. Surely it is pictures like these, and the suppression of news such as I have indicated that give rise to such a view of the present circumstances.  People <Col N="306" /> think that the world is absolutely at peace, trotting on in its old jog-trot way, that there is nothing to trouble about other than who won such a football match or whose was the champion dog at a particular show.  The censorship I think is responsible to some considerable degree for this false impression which I admit is current and to which the Minister for Supplies drew our attention.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of censorship to which I think Senator MacDermot did not animadvert.  That is the censorship of private correspondence.  I have heard a number of protests in regard to that matter and I have been asked to bring the Minister's attention to it. It has aroused more indignation and more resentment than any other feature of censorship&mdash;indignation and resentment that in my opinion are justified because of this intrusion into what, very often, is merely a family colloquy. I could give instances.  You have letters between father and son, between mother and daughter or between brother and brother in which the news that is being censored is, as far as I can see, of no military importance. It is certainly not inciting sedition or aimed at upsetting our Government.  I think there has been too much of that type of censorship. It is certainly resented and bitterly resented.  It reminds me of what I have read of the early days of history, of the spies and informers that used to go round after the people in the street, in the bad old days in Greece when the people were governed by tyrants. Senator Tierney could tell us all about that.  These spies and informers were the tyrants' eyes and ears&mdash;trying to catch whispers at the corners, trying to discover the enemies of the autocrat in every place.  It is like what happens in savage countries where the king of some Zulu tribe employs his witch doctors to go and smell out treason. That is going too far.</P>
    <P>A person has a right to express his private opinion provided it does not lead to lawlessness, the upsetting of the Government or the betrayal of the nation.  He has a right to express his opinion in a letter to a relative or to an intimate friend.  A man has a right to his conscience.  That form of censorship <Col N="307" /> really is&mdash;and is regarded as&mdash; intolerable.  The consequence of this indiscriminate censorship&mdash;in so much as it is unnecessary&mdash;is unpleasant. Politically and socially it is bad.  It is certainly undemocratic.  Again, perhaps the Minister for Supplies could have made a better speech here on this subject than I.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Professor Alton Professor Alton">
      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will quote the first paragraph&mdash;or more if the House desires&mdash;of the speech of the Minister for Supplies in Dublin on Saturday last: &ldquo;A good Press and a free Press is essential to the conduct of a democracy. Other forms of government might be possible without it, but a democracy is not.  For the functioning of a democratic State it is essential that there should exist some medium for the dissemination of information&mdash; reliable information&mdash;concerning public affairs and for the ventilation of opinions.&rdquo;  He made the restriction, of course, that in war time you must not betray your country by the betrayal of military secrets whether they be your own or another's.  He says that &ldquo;in times of peace it has to be restricted, too, by the law relating to treason, libel and the like, but, normally speaking, it is the function of the Press to give the people the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think he has stated that democratic principle clearly and concisely and better, perhaps, than I could state it; but he is not the only person who has discovered it.  Since the beginning of democracy, since the democratic state was first on the earth, that opinion has been known and recognised. &ldquo;No greater disaster can happen to free men than to be deprived of free speech.&rdquo;  That was Demosthenes and, therefore, supported by Demosthenes and by the Minister for Supplies, I do protest and state that this excessive censorship is really undemocratic. It is undermining the democratic state.  Socially, psychologically, it is bad.  As I have said <Col N="308" /> before, it creates an atmosphere of suspense and suspicion.  A nervous fear is created that things are really worse because we do not see them as they are enveloped in the darkness. One thinks that what is hidden from us is certainly more alarming than the little glimpses we get at the truth.  For those half truths that are current there are many more lies and wild rumours that could be killed and should be killed.</P>
    <P>When the truth is revealed suddenly&mdash;as sometimes it is&mdash;it gives a terrific shock.  The Minister for Supplies revealed it in that way when he told us that nine Irish ships had been sunk when conveying necessary stores to this country.  People were wondering whether many other things of that sort had taken place.  There is a grave psychological effect in the suppression of news.  It is even worse than the actual economic loss of our larder and other stores.  These driblets of fact, these glimmers of light, make the darkness in which we are living more evident.  It would have been wiser, I suggest, for the Government to take the people more into their confidence.  Confidence begets confidence.  We have got a people behind us who are utterly and fundamentally Irish and they are not going to betray one another and it will pay to put the facts before them.  We are suffering from this war of nerves&mdash; this <i>nervenkrieg</i>&mdash;in this unhealthy atmosphere of rumour and half truths. Half truths are the worst kind of lies.</P>
    <P>I realise that there is a great temptation to indulge in wholesale censorship.  I will admit that if I were Minister I probably would yield to it.  Of course, one assumes that one would be a beneficent tyrant if one occupied the position oneself. I cannot look at it in that personal way, however.  There is the temptation: there is no doubt it saves the Department and the Government from trouble, from interference within the State and from remonstrance from without, and it produces a nice quietude in which they can work.  They need quietude during these days when the strain of this world war <Col N="309" /> affects even this neutral State of ours, but I think that quietude is unhealthy and unreal.  The silence that is produced by force is undesirable. It is not synonymous with acquiescence when a lot of people are afraid to speak and are forbidden to speak and there is always the undercurrent of resentment, a ferment of disapprobation and suspicion.  Resentment and hostility show the folly and the failure of such methods of suppression of public opinion and private opinion.</P>
    <P>It has been tried again and again. Look at the history of Greece, of France or of this country.  It leads to trouble.  I do not think we are on the way to such trouble here.  I do not want to exaggerate in any way, but I say that it is an unhealthy policy.  We are not going to blaze out into revolution as happened in other countries.  But the path of repression is an undesirable one and when you start walking along it you are inclined to go further and further.  I would call for a slowing down in that journey. Perhaps I am speaking too much in metaphor.  I am trying to put general truths as strongly and as vigorously as I can before you.  It seems to me that this excessive censorship is a form of propaganda.  Is it not the distortion of truth?  It is.  We get a mental blackout; we cannot see where we are or whither we are going.  Naturally, it is against moral judgement when you are not allowed to say or to think what is right or what is wrong.  We are not allowed to condemn, certainly not openly, certain actions which we know are sins against the spirit.</P>
    <P>Senator MacDermot talked of the people being led in blinkers, but at times it seems to me that that metaphor is too mild; we are blindfold. Restriction of the freedom of speech is recognised by the Constitution when it is in the interest of morality, but the present restrictions, I maintain, are sometimes rather in the direction of undermining morality and sapping moral judgment by preventing its exercise. Most of all.  I should like to say again, this interference with private correspondence is very bad&mdash;it is really <Col N="310" /> a conversation between two people, written in black and white.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, I think, for us here to diminish this censorship.  It is necessary for us to know a little more than we are let know, for the sake of soothing our nerves, in order that we may have confidence in ourselves and have even more confidence in our Government. I have confidence, personally, but I want to be able to give reasons for the faith that is in me.  Most of all, I think it is necessary for our young people&mdash;and I have something to do with them&mdash;to have knowledge, to know what is happening, and to have a right to think about and discuss what is being done and what should be done. They, even more than we older people, require free speech and plain speech, &ldquo;plain speech with plain folk and plain words for false things.&rdquo;  The old order is gone.  There is no doubt about that. Perhaps I may quote from another address of Cardinal Hinsley, to which I think no word of reference was made in any of our papers.  It is a splendid address, magnificent in language, and, apart from propaganda dealing with the English side, it is a fine, elevating, moral address.  He remarks:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is a general agreement that the Europe of to-morrow will be, and ought to be, different from the Europe of yesterday.  Something new, better, more advanced organically, more sound, freer and stronger, must take the place of what existed in the past.  There must be a new order.  The old order has not brought happiness and peace, and men are right in demanding order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And so he leads up to his point, and his hope and prayer, that a bond of peace may be discovered by the coming generation, a bond of peace that will mean a re-founding&mdash;if I may express it thus; I am not a theologian&mdash; of Christianity.  This world is going to be, and is, a broken-down and shattered world and it will have to be rebuilt, and it has to be rebuilt by the generation that is rising now.  Let us hope that they will succeed in doing it and that they will be able to face the problems that we have been unable to solve, that they will be able to get rid of the evils that we have been content <Col N="311" /> to palliate&mdash;these evils, social and political&mdash;so that we may get a real society of free men.</P>
    <P>We have tried all sorts of alternatives in looking for light.  We have seen doctrines&mdash;of enlightened self-interest, the League of Nations, collective security, and all the rest of it&mdash;put before the heterogeneous mass of humanity, and found by them unsatisfactory, inacceptable.  We have to have almost a re-creation of civilisation and, just as in the original creation the first act was light&mdash;we want light.  The younger people want to know what is happening, and to know what they have to do&mdash;they want light, and that is where I think the censorship is sinning. It is darkening our knowledge. Let us give the coming generation this light that they need.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to seem pedantic, but at the risk of seeming so I would point out that the problems we have to face to-day existed also in days of old, and that the man who was reputed the wisest man in ancient Greece made a plea for freedom of speech and knowledge for younger people.  He said that to take freedom of speech from the young was, as it were, to take the sun out of the sky.  Well, the young people of to-day do want, even more than the old people, knowledge and unfettered speech.  They will, I hope, be able to correct the mistakes we made&mdash;our many mistakes, blunders and failures. So, let them have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, even with the limitations that, as I say, we have tried, perhaps ineffectively, to specify in the motion.</P>
    <P>As for ourselves and our position in this war, I really do not want to speak now, because I do not know enough.  I know that we are, perhaps, too weak, and that at present we are trying to assert certain rights, such as the right of neutrality, and so on.  Again, I suggest that the Minister for Supplies should have made this speech, and I am falling back upon him again.  In the course of the speech from which I quoted, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We in this country have a right to be neutral in this conflict if we so decide.  We have a right to expect that the belligerents will take care to <Col N="312" /> ensure that, of the thousands of bombs falling from the skies around us, none will fall upon our territory. We have a right to expect that neutral ships, carrying cargoes to our ports, will not be interfered with on the high seas.  We have thousands of rights, but rights alone are poor protection for small States when great Empires go to war.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>And in a little while my lips are dumb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any rate, neutrality is forced upon us but, if I may say it again, I think neutrality is a poor ship to be embarked upon.  I think that if any of those people want to attack us, our neutrality would keep the bombs off us just about as effectively as an umbrella.  We have to take that attitude.  One cannot assert that it is a heroic attitude.  To some, it may seem an ignominious one, but the present time is not the time to pass judgement upon it.  History will do so. Years ago, at a time when there was a lot of political trouble and the world was darkening for the great world war &mdash;I think it was in 1912&mdash;I remember reading a very striking article entitled: &ldquo;What will posterity say of us?&rdquo;  The writer was throwing himself mentally into the future and taking a long view, trying to look at things through a historical perspective, if I might quote his words, <i>sub specie æternitatis.</i>  He was passing judgement on his contemporaries for their failure to see what were the most exigent and urgent social problems of the day and their failure to find solutions.  I thought of that article the other night.  The title question stands: &ldquo;What will posterity say of us?&rdquo;  I wonder what will posterity say of us, and of what we have done?  Will they understand, will they sympathise, will they approve?  Will they say we have done well?  God grant that they will not say that we have sacrificed the <Col N="313" /> right for the expedient.  That certainly would not be in keeping with the history of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to know precisely what to say about this motion, or whether to say anything at all about it.  It has given rise to considerable discussion on history and on our neutrality.  I do not propose to discuss our neutrality at all.  The motion itself is one about which if there was a division it would be difficult to make up one's mind.  It offers in paragraphs (1) and (2) statements about fundamental constitutional rights, and certain other rights, with which I think we would be all, including the Minister, in fair agreement.  It goes on to state that the Press Censorship ought not to exclude matter from publication except upon four named grounds.  On the last occasion this matter was debated here I asked if the Minister could give us an indication of the principles upon which the censorship was administered, to tell us what were the relations between the various functionaries who dealt with the matter and the Minister, to his credit, did endeavour to answer that question.</P>
      <P>Speaking from the practical point of view I fail to see how we could avoid a censorship in our present situation, and without going into general principles as to what is good for the young or the old, that seems to me to be something which is inescapable.  In our present circumstances a form of censorship is necessary.  What form should it take?  The Minister seemed to imply yesterday evening that because the Dáil and the Seanad had given powers of censorship there was no option but to approve of the Minister's administration of the censorship. That, I think, is a view which, on reflection, he would abandon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said that censorship should be subject to review by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister has abandoned that position. Should we express ourselves this evening as being in favour of censorship, agreeing on certain grounds that expression of opinion would be really of <Col N="314" /> no value unless we could insert these conditions into an Act of Parliament? If I were Minister I would not accept that particular scheme.  That being so, I do not see how I can support it now. If the grounds for censorship be set forth under four heads then these would become the only grounds upon which the censor could proceed.  They would be exclusive.  That is a well-known principle which governs legislation and the interpretation of it.  The censor and the Minister would be precluded from censoring under any heads other than those mentioned in the statute.  That would result, particularly in a country of alert intelligent people like ourselves, in the censorship being unworkable, and you might possibly have much litigation.  The present Government has passed a great deal of legislation for the removal of doubts, and I am afraid if they gave reasons why they censored things in an Act they would put in so many reasons that it would not be possible to say or to write anything at all.  Therefore, as a practical person, accepting that we must have censorship, this particular motion is not one which I could support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What, therefore, should one require in censorship?  There must be vigilance on the part of both Houses of Parliament, and courage on the part of the people who feel they are aggrieved with the censorship itself.  That censorship should be enlightened and be run by persons of calm and equable temperament, with deep knowledge, with many contacts, with common sense and above all, with a sense of humour.  I would not demand that a Minister in charge of censorship should be impartial.  I do not think he could be.  That is simply to demand a quality which you are not likely to find in a Minister particularly a Minister in a Party Government.  I do not use the word &ldquo;Party&rdquo; in any but a descriptive sense as applied to the present Government.  That is the kind of censorship we ought to have if it is to be satisfactory and if people are to put up with the manifest inconveniences of the censorship.  I feel that that is precisely what we have not got.  The Minister yesterday evening showed that he is everything but a person with a calm <Col N="315" /> and equable temper.  I think he is narrow.  I think he is biassed and I think among colleagues who are not mealy-mouthed he is a person who uses the strongest language and the most thoughtless words on occasions. I think it is very unsuitable that a Minister with these particular qualities should be in charge of censorship.  For example, it is quite obvious that when the Minister sees Senator MacDermot&mdash; I do not find the Senator very soothing myself at all times&mdash;he sees him in British uniform and immediately finds himself back in 1921.  When he sees Senator Sir John Keane he sees generations of landlords.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">

      <P>If he was in a uniform he would not look half so bad no matter what uniform it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks be to God the Fianna Fáil Party has not appointed Senator McEllin as censor.  We are bad enough as we are.  At any rate I think the Minister is entirely biassed and is entirely foolish in his outlook about certain people.  For example, I do not know that I would speak at all but for a particular incident.  Senator MacDermot quoted a leading article in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, dealing with the censorship, which was suppressed. It was, as I heard it, rather mild, but was entirely suppressed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was making a reply to that, almost the first thing he said was that the <i>Irish Independent</i> had published another leading article in 1916.  Therefore, as I pointed out to him at once, it would appear that he is punishing the <i>Irish Independent</i> in 1941 for something which the <i>Irish Independent</i> did in 1916, of which he did not approve, and of which, being closer to the facts myself, I did not approve either.  Surely that is an outlook on a matter such as the censorship which shows that he is entirely unfitted for the post, and that his attitude is entirely wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that yesterday evening, we look at this morning's newspapers and we find that that particular statement <Col N="316" /> of the Minister's is not reported at all.  Was it censored?  I am perfectly certain it was.  In other words, the Minister can make an obvious blunder, showing himself in his real colours in this House, and the reports of this House, as published in the newspapers, can then be censored so as to cover up the Minister's blunder. That is a pretty shameless abuse of the power of censorship in a matter which does not concern our neutrality, our national prestige, or any of the matters which we all ought to have at heart, and about which we ought all to be concerned at this very difficult moment.</P>
    <P>Similarly, his first reaction to Senator MacDermot's motion was that Senator MacDermot once told the Dáil &mdash;I forget the incident myself&mdash;that the Dáil ought not to allow themselves to behave as gutter-snipes.  I heard the Minister over and over again in the Dáil, and I think a great many gutter-snipes, the great majority of them, would be ashamed of the language which I heard the Minister using.  Yet, he is the person who is to judge what language is to be used.  That is an absurd situation.  Surely, when he says that the Dáil passed a law giving power of censorship to the Government, they did not approve in advance of everything that would be done, and there certainly is necessity for review.  Perhaps I am right in interpreting the Minister as being rather in favour of some kind of Parliamentary committee. I forget the exact words he used yesterday evening, but I think he said he was prepared to show to one Senator, or five or six Senators if they wished, exactly what happened in particular cases.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion when I raised a particular case with him, he told us that his policy was to keep down the temperature.  What happened in that particular instance was that at a meeting the speakers gave utterance to a very common and peculiarly false piece of Fianna Fáil propaganda, namely, that Partition was the result of the Treaty in 1921.  A letter was written refuting that lie by the statement that the Treaty was made in December, 1921, after Partition had become an Act and a fact.  That was <Col N="317" /> not allowed to be published.  So that, apparently, a particular thing can be said, but the answer will not be allowed.</P>
    <P>That is not the way in which the Minister treats papers which support himself.  Reference was made by Senator Fitzgerald yesterday to a paper called <i>The Nationalist and Leinster Times</i>, published, I think, in Carlow.  Senator Fitzgerald quoted from a particular issue of that paper, the issue of December 28th, in which, subsequent to a broadcast by the Taoiseach, in which he stated very clearly that no demand had been made upon him for the Ports, was printed a letter stating that such a demand had been made.  Now, the Minister told Senator Fitzgerald by way of intervention yesterday that that matter was being got after.  I should like to point out that, from the 7th December up to the 4th January, matter which by no means could be considered calm, neutral comment on the war was allowed week after week in this newspaper, which is a frantic supporter of the Government.  For example, in the issue of 7th December we have the statement:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And we, here in Ireland, have heard of the harrowing cries of the unfortunate people of Coventry, Bristol, Liverpool, London, Southampton, and the many other important British cities which, if they are not completely destroyed, have suffered havoc a thousandfold more serious than the Press of Great Britain or its news agencies would have us know.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That kind of thing is allowed.  But comments from a member of the Irish Hierarchy upon the &ldquo;accursed bombers&rdquo; who came and bombed us at Terenure and the South Circular Road are not allowed.  So that you keep the temperature down when dealing with a member of the Hierarchy, but when dealing with a Fianna Fáil scribe in Carlow you do not keep the temperature down.  I have here issues of that paper from the 7th December to 4th January, and each of them is worse than the other; each one is certainly tending to give a particular view and <Col N="318" /> a very biased view of situations to our people.</P>
    <P>As I am on this point of unsuitability, the Minister admitted on the last occasion that he had compelled the <i>Irish Times</i> to take the lion and the unicorn out of a photograph.  Did anybody ever hear such an extraordinary example of what I can call nothing else but an inferiority complex?  The lion and the unicorn on the Bank of Ireland are a symbol of a victory that the Irish people won when they made the Treaty&mdash;the first political victory the native Irish ever won, it might be said, and which some people had not got the sense to see.  If the Taoiseach, the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures, the Minister for Defence, the leader of the Fine Gael Party, and the leader of the Labour Party sit on a platform in College Green with Irish soldiers behind them, Irish police and an Irish crowd before them, and the Irish flag over them, in the presence of the lion and the unicorn, that is not anything to which we ought to object, but is something about which we ought to be proud.  If the Minister is so buried in obscurantism and futility of that kind that he feels we ought to have the lion and the unicorn taken out, all I can say is that he must make a very hopeless censor indeed, because nothing but an inferiority complex would make him object.</P>
    <P>As I am on this matter of leading articles, might I give a further example?  The Minister for Supplies spoke on Saturday night at great length.  I am subject to correction on this, but I have the feeling that if the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures had got his own way he would have censored the Minister for Supplies very considerably, but apparently he did not.  The Minister stated that we ought to have a free Press.  The <i>Irish Independent</i>, having got that report, on Monday wrote a leading article headed &ldquo;A Minister on Censorship.&rdquo;  It is very brief and I will take the opportunity to read the whole of it.  It is mainly a quotation from the Minister.  The leading article said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Everybody engaged in the production <Col N="319" /> of newspapers will read with extraordinary interest the following observations by Mr. Lemass, Minister for Supplies, at the dinner of the Institute of Journalists on Saturday night.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then follows a quotation from the speech of the Minister for Supplies:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That function (the function of the Press) had to be restricted ... in times of war by restrictions upon the publication of information of military importance without authority, or, by confining the brick-throwing activities of journalists to their own Government because other Governments might not like it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A free Press and a good Press was essential to the conduct of a democracy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is said without comment and that was not allowed to be published.  It is a matter of great importance, I think.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any objection to the Minister being put in the position that he must argue his case in the Press.  It is the essence of the kind of Government that we have, or the essence of the kind of Government that we hope to have.  The Minister should have answered the questions and should have argued his case.  I think it is a very foolish and narrow-minded attitude for him to prevent anything of this kind appearing in the newspapers. There is no comment at all, but simply the Minister exercising power and getting the best of everything.</P>
      <P>Now, may I make one other point with regard to the Irish language?  It is to the Minister's credit that he has learned quite a good deal of it.  When Bardia fell&mdash;I referred to this before&mdash; the heading the <i>Irish Press</i> gave was &ldquo;Bardia i seilbh na nGall&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Gall&rdquo; is a word which, in Irish, means &ldquo;foreigner&rdquo;, once applied to the Norsemen, and, generally, applied to what my friend Senator MacFhionnlaoich would call &ldquo;clann na bplanndóirí&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the planters' breed&rdquo;.  It might be freely translated, perhaps, &ldquo;Bardia now in the hands of the base, brutal and bloody Saxon&rdquo;.  Similarly, an <i>Irish Press</i> placard appeared in the following terms in the Gaeltacht&mdash;so I have been told by a friend of mine who lives in the Gaeltacht&mdash;&ldquo;Long eile le Gallaibh ag tón puill&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Another British ship lost, thanks be to God&rdquo;. I do not know whether that arises from ignorance or from what Senator Fitzgerald would call tendentiousness, but in any event there it is.</P>

      <P>I do not think so.  I do not think the Minister is simple.  I have said that he was narrow-minded and had an inferiority complex, but I do not think he is simple.  In fact, I am perfectly sure he is not simple, although he did fall rather badly, and showed his hand about the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  Of course he has the whip hand of the whole matter, and can keep it from being published.  I do not think that our neutrality comes into this debate at all, except that Ministers, when they choose to speak or use the radio, are allowed to say what they please, and it is not possible, very often, to put the other side.</P>
      <P>They have the habit of talking always about two belligerents, and one wonders whether they are always putting the case quite fairly.  I very much doubt it.  But, whatever our military preparedness for war may be, and whatever our economic position may be, there can be very little doubt that if you pursue a particular line of censorship and prevent certain types of intelligent and rational discussion, then you are going to make our mental equipment for meeting invasion, if it does come, very bad indeed.  I put that quite seriously to the Minister.  I am not putting that as a theory, nor as a matter of abstract justice, that the people ought to be allowed to hear these views.  I disagree entirely with Senator Alton that we must have the whole truth, because I do not think the whole truth is ascertainable, except a certain amount, and from sources about which Senator Alton and I would probably not be in agreement.  What I do think is that this motion is not workable. We must have censorship.  I do not think it is practicable to put into an Act of Parliament all the grounds upon which censorship should be exercised, and only these grounds.  Therefore, the only remedy that I see is to have an enlightened censorship, and that, it would appear to me from the declarations of the Minister and from the conduct of the Minister so far in the matter, we have not got.  The remedy for that is obvious, but perhaps, like the motion, it is not practicable at the moment.</P>

      <P>This matter of censorship is not an easy one.  It is a modern innovation.  From what I can see, not only in this country but in other countries, censorship has been spewed upon by the Press, using all the powers they possess in their own interests.</P>
      <P>I am not referring to Ireland only, but to what has happened in England and in other countries.  The Press, in those countries, have talked about the audacity of anybody setting up any authority to question what they ought to do.  The thing got into such a hopeless mess in the neighbouring country that the censorship administration led to all sorts of changes.  The whole paraphernalia of censorship was changed from top to bottom.  Even Ministers were changed.  I think that happened at least half a dozen times. A lot of hubbub has been created here about the abuse of the censorship.  I wonder who is interested in this censorship? What percentage of our people are interested in what is, or what is not, published at the present time, and especially since the emergency arose? It is not so long since many people in the country only saw a daily newspaper once a month.  Even to-day, in many of our country villages, the people only get the weekly newspaper on a Sunday. I suppose it is true to say of the daily papers published in this country that their biggest sales would be in the cities of Dublin and Cork.  That being so, why all this talk and anxiety about censorship?  It does not affect the general body of the people in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a fair idea as to why we are having a repetition of debates on the question of censorship here.  We had a debate on censorship a couple of weeks ago.  We have a repetition of it these days as if it were something that vitally affected the people.  I think I <Col N="323" /> have a fair idea as to why we are having all this discussion: that it is due to a savage greed for sensationalism in the public Press on the part of Senator MacDermot: that he had the ingenious idea that this was something the Press would jump at and would use him in their own personal interest.  In the newspapers this morning we had big black headlines as to what was said here yesterday about the censorship of the Press.  Was it the censorship of the Press that the Senator was interested in, or was he simply using this censorship business to put across some of the vilest points of view to insult the most intimate national sentiments of the people?</P>
    <P>He talked about rifles and neutrality, and about everything under the sun except the real genuine difficulties that affect correspondents and editors under existing conditions.  We all know perfectly well that editors have a deuce of a time to contend with in trying to get out papers.  We are perfectly well aware of that.  I should say that they are carrying on particularly well in the circumstances, but they know themselves, they are human beings and they have their families to consider, that what is being done is in the best national interests, and for the security of the people of the country.  If the Irish censorship is compared with that of other countries, I am not too sure but that the hard work, sense of fair play and honesty and the co-operation to which effect is sought to be given there would show a far higher standard than would be found amongst any of these so-called efficiency experts in the censorship offices of other countries.  These people must get a little fair play, too. This continual attacking to satisfy the desire for sensationalism of one particular individual and a few of his colleagues is not fair.</P>
    <P>I happen to be a constant reader of the <i>Irish Times</i>, and I remember reading, shortly after the outbreak of the war, an article in it which impressed me very much.  It spoke of the fine spirit in which we were facing our position generally, and, in that article, after the censorship system had been <Col N="324" /> put into operation, the writer pointed out that, in a small country like this, it was only right and proper that we should be more careful and cautious in respect of our press censorship than bigger countries.  That is perfectly true and it is a perfectly human viewpoint. It showed the right spirit at the right time, but I hope that we Irish people are not again showing that typical characteristic, for which we have been noted in the past, of being full of enthusiasm for the time being, but, as things jog along, of beginning to forget our good resolutions made earlier.  That must not be, because we have a duty and a responsibility.  We have taken certain decisions in full realisation of all the circumstances affecting this little country of ours, and, although the censorship may not be everything that newspaper editors would like it to be, it is too bad that a minority should make use of them and of Parliament in addition, in order to bolster up their own views with regard to our relationships with other countries.

      <P>The fact remains that a great part of the Senator's argument was, with all due respect, much ado about nothing.  There was nothing in anything the Senator, or any of the other Senators, raised that fundamentally affected the people in their workaday lives.  There is not at present any aspect of life, either in public <Col N="325" /> or by the firesides of the people, which is not affected in some way or other. We are all thrown out of our stride in the carrying out of our duties to-day. That position will be worse, but we will try to meet it and get over the difficulties as best we can.  There is no reason why the newspaper editors or Press proprietors should represent the be-all and end-all of everything, or why they should have the power to voice grievances while we all have grievances which we cannot voice. That is an injustice to the public and it represents the other side of the picture. There has to be give and take in this matter in the unfortunate world in which we find ourselves to-day, and if we get hard knocks or jolts from time to time we shall have to take them in the spirit that they might be a lot worse.  If we are not prepared to do that, there is no future for this country, and the sooner we make up our minds as to how we will take these jolts and how to season and harden ourselves to receive them, the better it will be for us, because if we do not do so, we will not be able to take the hard knocks when they come.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator MacDermot's speech yesterday, I do not think that any Parliament in any country of our size in Europe had to face such a mentality as that which was behind that speech.  The speech flouted the wishes of 99 per cent. of the people, and it consisted of nagging and irritating points of view, brought up deliberately to irritate the public mind, if he succeeded in getting them published.</P>

      <P>I will give an example of what we are up against.  Senator MacDermot is a sort of correspondent. He will not leave it to the man who wants the job of correspondent for a livelihood.  He has it as a pastime, and he would like to get a lot of jobs to get the other fellow out.  In December, 1940, the Senator wrote a nice, short little squib and sent it over there.  Whether the censorship was in operation or not, he was free enough to write this sort of story: &ldquo;A few individual members of the Seanad have urged participation in the war, but such faint prospect as they might have had of influencing public opinion has long since been extinguished by the Press censorship.&rdquo;  Just imagine the audacity of that!  The fellow thinks he has such persuasive powers he would be able to influence the people, if it were not for these horrible fellows with horns in the Censorship Office, so that they would participate in the war.  The merits of the man's case have been made on the basis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept the ruling of the Chair, although it is hard to accept it because we have to get at the underlying principle of all the irritating things said here.  Out of respect for the Chair, however, I desist.  There should be a certain amount of pathos for the unfortunate position, if you like, in which this little island finds itself.  We are a small island, rather sparsely populated, and our participation in such a conflagration as is now proceeding could not possibly affect matters one way or the other.  We have not enjoyed self-government for long in this old country.  Our institutions are new and any machinery of that sort is always brittle in spots, because of its newness, and can be very vulnerable.  People may be inclined to abuse these institutions and this machinery, but we must be careful to do our best to preserve them.  We <Col N="328" /> want nothing from anybody except the right to determine our own way of life. Above all, we want inside the country to try to get some fundamental principle on which to work for the betterment and preservation of this old country.  Irritating speeches such as we had to listen to yesterday are not going to improve the situation.  They may create a lot of misunderstanding.</P>
      <P>We are ready for any emergency with which we may be faced.  These institutions mean everything to us.  With the unanimity we have to-day, we are going to be in a stronger position to work in the future.  The people have made up their minds, no matter what outsiders may think about us, that, on this question, fight they will and surrender they will not.  We have known in the past what a foreign Power can do to a race.  That knowledge is intimate to the present generation.  It is recent history and, with personal experience on the part of the people, resistance would be far greater here than it would in any country of equal size. These motions merely afford an opportunity for surface talk by a lot of people who want to keep in the news. They are far removed from the fundamental principles on which the people are working and thinking to-day.  We are bound to survive because the mentality behind the speech made by Senator MacDermot is not representative of 1 per cent. of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>When I finish, I hope I shall not be accused of any intention to annoy, because the last speaker, who is rather sensitive, thinks that, when people speak contrary to his rather extreme point of view, their intention is only to annoy.  I can assure him that some of us feel conscientiously about this matter and do not speak for notoriety.  There is one rather limited and definite aspect of this matter with which I should like the Minister to deal.  I understand that individuals are not allowed, in correspondence, freely to express their opinions to one another, however discreet they may be.  I refer, of course, to overseas correspondence and not to internal correspondence, on which there is no censorship.  Presumably, I <Col N="329" /> can say what I like to my correspondent at home but, where the correspondence comes within the purview of the censor, expressions of individual opinion are forbidden.  I know of a certain individual whose letters were caught in the censorship and who was brought before the censor and warned that he was liable to very severe penalties for writing as he did.  I take it the Minister is exercising the power with good reason but I should like to know the reason why individual expressions of opinion are forbidden.  As far as I know, they are not written to people of any influence.  They are just written to personal friends.</P>
      <P>Then I would like to know on what principle correspondence is held because my friend who was hailed before the censor was shown three or four letters that had been held up in correspondence. I would like to ask the Minister on what principle that is worked.  If letters are held up is there any period for which they are held or is any intimation given to the writers that they are being held up?  There may be an indiscreet sentence in a letter which would cause it to be held up but that letter might be of personal or family importance and it might be very serious for the letter not to arrive. I do think in all reason that when letters are stopped the writer should be informed as soon as possible that the letter has been stopped so that he may not be upset by the non-delivery of a letter that might be of great family importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this motion is to get guidance, and I would like to ask the Minister for guidance on a wider point of principle.  I take it we have still got the rights of free men, that Parliamentary institutions are still functioning, and that anybody in Parliament has the right to advocate any change of policy.  We know at present this policy of neutrality is accepted by all Parties.  To what extent does the censorship interfere with citizens advocating a change in that policy?  I take it that in this House I can get up, or any other Senator can get up, to ask for that policy to be changed.  I take it the leading Parties in the State can get up and ask for that policy to be <Col N="330" /> changed.  To what extent is that demand denied publicity?  That is what I would like the Minister definitely to say, because as long as we are functioning as free men, we have the right, I suggest, to get our point of view laid before our fellow-citizens, and that can only be done to any practical measure through the Press.  I quite agree that obscure individuals cannot be allowed perpetually to question the accepted policy of neutrality, but I take it that responsible people and Parliamentary Parties are allowed to do so, and are entitled to publicity in their attempts to do so.  I hope the Minister will deal with that, which, I submit, is a quite clear and specific point.</P>
    <P>Then, in order that the citizens of the country may make up their minds as to the desirability of any change of policy, which they are quite entitled to advocate, surely it is necessary that they should be allowed news.  I give the case, say, of pictures of the damage done in London and England by bombing. I may be wrong in suggesting that they are prohibited, but I understand that the censor does not allow such pictures to be published.  Surely that is acting in excess of commonsense, for how can any one of us form our conclusions and form logical opinions about a change of policy unless we know facts?  All I am asking for is that facts may be published.  I am quite clear that there are reasons for preventing publication of expressions of opinion.  I am speaking merely from the point of view of news, and I suggest it is exceeding the powers of censorship to suppress it.</P>
    <P>Those are the only two points I wish to make.  First of all, in regard to limitations of private correspondence, and secondly, have we, who are free men, a right to publicity in advocating a change of a policy which is for the moment accepted?</P>

      <P>When this motion was first circulated, Senators will remember, it came to us in a rather different form from that in which it now appears on the Clár.  It is interesting to consider the reasons that <Col N="331" /> influenced the framers of the motion in making this change.  I think it is quite plain that they wanted to give the motion a spurious&mdash;no, that is an ugly word; I will not use the word &ldquo;spurious&rdquo;&mdash;a specious, syllogistic appearance, but if you come to examine it &mdash;it is a long time since I learned any logic except the hard logic of facts&mdash; anyone with the slightest knowledge of logic will see that it is full of fallacies.  The proposers of the motion wanted to try to get us to accept the major and minor premises and what they alleged to be the consequences, but if you submit them to careful examination I do not think any democratic assembly could accept the major premise that we have here before us. Let us read it: &ldquo;Fundamental constitutional rights ought not to be abrogated more than is necessary for national safety even during war or the threat of war.&rdquo;  My objection is to the use of the word &ldquo;abrogated&rdquo;.  I hold that fundamental national rights can never be abrogated, and I am confirmed in the view by looking up the word &ldquo;abrogate&rdquo; in the Oxford Dictionary, 1933 edition, in the Library. I find that &ldquo;abrogate&rdquo; means to repeal (a law or established usage), to annul, abolish authoritatively, or formally, to cancel; (2) to do away with, put an end to.  I hold&mdash;and I am sure this House, when it considers it, will hold&mdash;that fundamental national rights can never be abrogated and that we should not, even by implication, seem to hold otherwise.  But even though fundamental rights can never be abrogated, the exercise of them may by the choice of a free people be suspended.  I hold that on the 2nd and 3rd September we, the people of three-quarters of Ireland, that portion of the Irish people that is able to exercise the rights of a free people, deliberately endowed the Government with emergency powers, including the power to establish censorship.  We were not deprived of free speech.  We deprived ourselves of the exercise of it for a time, because the emergency powers are only for a stated period. We deprived ourselves of its exercise deliberately, in what we thought the <Col N="332" /> best interests of the country.  We deliberately suspended our rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>And when we established the censorship it was as a bulwark of fundamental national rights. On that same night we declared our neutrality, and the censorship was a very important instrument in defending that neutrality.  That is why the two questions are related.  Neutrality has received universal approval of the Irish people, and it has so far kept us safe from the worst horrors of war.  But it has done more than that; it has been regarded by everyone, by all other nations, as the greatest proof we can give of our independence.  Those are two great things that neutrality has meant, and the censorship that protects neutrality also protects those two great things.  But there is another thing, and I do not think Senator MacDermot should forget this; we gave our word that we would be neutral.  We, a free people, exercising the rights of freedom, gave our word that we would be neutral.  That pledge was reciprocated by one of the belligerents, as far as I remember, and tacitly acknowledged by the other.  Are we going to allow ourselves, by any indiscretions, to jeopardise that neutrality?  I think it would be not only a disastrous policy but a dishonourable policy, and I protest in the strongest way against any consideration of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess that I cannot follow the somewhat tortuous reasoning of the last speaker, and I will make no attempt to do so.  But this motion does raise certain important questions.  It raises questions of <Col N="333" /> what is the fundamental nature of a free democracy like ours.  It raises the question as to whether the censorship in our free democracy is being exercised in such a way as to preserve the essentials of that free democracy, and in the exercise of the freedom of criticism which we still preserve, I propose in the course of those remarks to draw attention to certain general principles that should govern our actions in this present national emergency.</P>
      <P>In doing so I accept the fact that we have adopted a policy of legal neutrality, and I accept most of all the fact that we still are a constitutional sovereign democracy which claims to have derived all its powers from God in a part of the Constitution that has not yet been censored, although it would be censored if Cardinal Hinsley or any other such person attempted to express such sentiments in a broadcast speech. I am quite aware that any Senator speaking on the present subject at the present time should be careful not only as to what he says but as to the form of words which he uses in saying it, so in order to avoid dangerous language or the danger of saying anything which might be nationally harmful I have taken the somewhat unusual precaution of committing to writing most of what I propose to say.  Although I observe that I am now addressing mainly empty benches, nevertheless, I think what I have to say is sufficiently important to be worth placing on the records of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I am grateful to those Senators who have returned to the House and have made up the necessary quorum.  One of the problems which the censorship has to face is what should be the attitude of the censorship to the very vigorous <Col N="334" /> propaganda that is maintained by all sorts of people in connection with the present European emergency.  For my part, I am in favour of the utmost possible freedom of propaganda, propaganda in favour of the ideas of the totalitarian States as well as propaganda in favour of the ideas and principles of democracy.  It is part of the philosophy of totalitarian States that an ascendancy class should claim the right to exploit and confiscate the wealth of subject races in virtue of moral and racial superiority.  We had an ascendancy regime of that kind in Ireland for more than two hundred years, and I personally would welcome a serious effort of propaganda to show that such an ascendancy regime would be beneficial to Ireland in future whatever we may have thought about it in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, it is legitimate in a democracy to recommend ascendancy principles of government, or any other method or philosophy of government, as an abstract conception to be freely accepted or rejected by one's fellow citizens.  For example, if I should make myself the leader of the so-called ex-Unionist minority in the twenty-six counties, and, by sheer persuasiveness, successfully persuade the majority of my fellow citizens to disfranchise themselves and entrust me and my party with a monopoly of political power, and absolute control of their lives, property, thoughts and actions, the result, of course, would not be democracy, but the method of achieving that result would be perfectly democratic, so long as the surrender of democratic rights was freely made as a result of my persuasion.  On the other hand, if I organised a gang of toughs, or rough necks as they call them in other countries, armed with any suitable weapons, and terrorized my fellow citizens into voting my programme, and terrorized the Government to such an extent that they failed to put the forces of law in motion against me, that would be a violation of democratic procedure by me and a betraval of democratic principles by the Government which failed to suppress me.  It is, I think, quite clear that propaganda of this kind ought to <Col N="335" /> be sternly suppressed by any democratic government.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, my first essay in public life was a pamphlet denouncing the idea of an appeal to force by my fellow-countrymen 27 years ago in resistance to the constitutional processes of democracy which sought to confer self-government on Ireland.  I feared then that the appeal to lawless violence would breed more violence, and it did, in Ireland and in Europe.  On the other hand, while democracy must restrain propaganda inciting to lawless violence, it cannot, without treason to its own cause, restrain propaganda which is explanatory of the nature of democracy itself, it cannot restrain propaganda which seeks to create in the minds of citizens a lively sense of the conditions and the convictions which must exist if democracy is to be preserved.  To do so would be the same as if a Christian church were to forbid propaganda on the principles of Christianity.  Democrats, least of all, can afford to live in an unreal world. They must know the dangers that threaten democracy within and without. A censorship which refuses to allow our public Press to underline the one reference to Ireland contained in President Roosevelt's fireside talk, is depriving our people of expert guidance and conspiring to make us live in a fool's paradise.</P>
    <P>Many of the people for whom I may claim to speak are by no means anxious for us to abandon neutrality.  But at any moment our neutrality may disappear through no action of ours. Whatever action we take in such an event should be the action of a united and disciplined nation, having full confidence in its Government.  But will our morale be better or worse in such a dreadful contingency if we have been kept in ignorance of the moral issues which are at stake and of the ideologies which are in conflict in the present strife and if intelligent discussion of these issues is forbidden by our censorship? Our neutrality as such is nothing to be ashamed of.  It must not be taboo for discussion.  It is, in fact, an honourable condition forced on us by <Col N="336" /> circumstances for which we may disclaim all responsibility.</P>
    <P>When the League of Nations was established the States which joined in it undertook, by Article 10 of the Covenant, to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all the members of the League.  An attack on any one member was to be deemed to be an act of war against all members, and all States members of the League were bound in honour to go, with all their forces and resources, to the help of the victim of aggression.  This was the famous principle of collective security, and it abolished neutrality for all States members of the League.  In such a world order, if such a world order still existed, a State could not be neutral in the face of aggression on a fellow-member without dishonouring its signature. Unfortunately, Britain and France&mdash;or, I should say, certain disreputable statesmen who happened to be in power in Britain and France in these years&mdash;spent much misplaced ingenuity in wriggling out of their obligations under Article 10.  China was betrayed in 1931; Abyssinia in 1935; Spain in 1936, and Austria and Czechoslovakia in 1938.</P>

      <P>The point I am trying to make here is that if democracy has been destroyed in many countries in Europe it is in a very real sense far more the result of the betrayal of democratic principles by democratic governments in the years of uneasy peace, far more that result in a strictly moral sense than it is in a material sense the result of the actions and ambitions of neighbouring undemocratic States.  Professor Keith, who is a very distinguished English publicist, in a book on the causes of the war, pillories the numerous occasions on which democratic States violated democratic principles and departed from international good faith.  In fact, he says that the number of treaties deliberately broken by the democratic States makes quite as respectable a total as the number of those broken by the totalitarian States.</P>

      <Col N="338" /> Quoting a statement of the late Mr. Chamberlain, made on 6th October, 1938, with reference to Czechoslovakia, where Mr. Chamberlain said we had no treaty obligations and no legal obligations to Czechoslovakia, Professor Keith, on page 359 of the book, writes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This deliberate denial of all binding force of the League Covenant, Articles 10, 16, and 20, is a classical repudiation by Britain of the binding nature of the most solemn treaty ever concluded by her.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to add: &ldquo;It is idle to pile up lists of Treaty violations by other Powers on the assumption that Britain has not been guilty of equal violence of law and morality.&rdquo;  Now, I might attempt to defend what I might call the respectability of our neutrality against the kind of propaganda we read of in British and pro-British newspapers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>This raises a general question.  I do not want to be taken as expressing any anti-British sentiments of my own in doing so, because I think the House knows quite well where my sympathies lie in the present crisis.  I do not want to emphasise that aspect of the matter too much.  I am dealing with it merely from an academic point of view.  It is, I think, a matter of historic truth that Britain and France could have made the new world order established in 1920 a reality if they had set an example of international good faith in their dealings under the terms of the covenant of the League of Nations. They elected to follow a course which made the emergence of international anarchy inevitable.  The smaller nations, including our own, would have gladly followed a strong moral lead if it had been given in these after-war years, and they would have taken the risks incidental to their obligations as members of the League of Nations; <Col N="339" /> but once it had been made clear that collective security was regarded as midsummer madness by a British Premier, then once more neutrality became an honourable condition which a small nation would be wise to maintain in certain events.  Thus the honour of our neutrality stands rooted in the dishonour of the nations which founded the League of Nations and then betrayed it.  It is sometimes said that it is dishonourable to be neutral when one of the belligerents is defending causes which are vital to us.  To that we can only reply: &ldquo;We are doing exactly the same as you did in 1931 when China began to fight your cause as well as in her own, and as you did in 1935 when Abyssinia fought in your cause as well as in her own and when you remained neutral all along.&rdquo;  In a state of world anarchy, considerations of expediency must be paramount, but if a new world order based on law and international good faith is ever created, we, I hope, will do our best to sustain such a world order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now a nation like ourselves, which I hope is truly Christian, must also be truly catholic, not in the technical but in the etymological sense of that term, in the sense in which every Christian is a Catholic and, as such, we must recognise that the claims of moral and religious obligations are universal and that they transcend all loyalties to nation or State.  If a new world order is to be created, national individualities and national loyalties must be fitted into the general scheme of things and there must be a voluntary abandonment, by great nations as well as small, of so much of national sovereignty and national egoism as is incompatible with that world order. Will the censor allow us to think on those things and to discuss the conditions which must exist if national freedom and democracy in the various States of Europe are to be preserved and harmonised in a new world order of that kind, in which law and justice are prevalent, and in which Christian ethics are the dominating principle? It is, I think, essential, even under present conditions, that we should have an adequate appreciation of the <Col N="340" /> various moral issues which are in conflict, that we should have an adequate knowledge of the facts of the world situation and of the national situation without which we cannot form a true moral judgment.  I think it was entirely regrettable that Cardinal Hinsley's address was suppressed the other day by the censor, because I, personally, listened to that address with the greatest interest, and I thought what an admirable expression it was of the views which any Christian should hold about the relations between Church and State.  I think the censor's office in suppressing that address acted more in the spirit of the Peter who thrice denied his Lord than in the spirit of the St. Peter who founded the Church at Rome.  To be logical and complete, he ought to censor the preamble to the Constitution which expresses sentiments exactly similar to those which Cardinal Hinsley expressed on that occasion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that the censor will not allow that address to be printed in the Irish Press.  Finally I would summarise the <Col N="341" /> three kinds of behaviour by the Governments of democratic countries which can destroy and undermine democracy without any foreign intervention.  In the first place, there is the kind of conduct of which the Government of the United Kingdom was guilty in 1912 and 1913 when they allowed their policy to be altered in consequence of an appeal to violence or a threat of violence in the part of this country known as Ulster.  That, I think, was a disastrous concession to lawless force and a serious invasion of one of the first principles of democratic government.  In the second place I think the various statesmen&mdash;the Hoares, the Lavals, the Chamberlains and others&mdash;in charge of French and British political Parties during these critical years and who failed to give effect to international obligations under the League of Nations, did a serious disservice to democracy.  If democracy has failed in these later days, I think we may thank the British Governments and the French Governments of former days.</P>
      <P>Our own Government can be completely exonerated from all blame on the first or second count but I think we are in danger of doing a serious disservice to democracy if we do not allow the public mind to be enlightened on the very important moral issues which are now at stake in Europe and in the world.  Apparently the leaders of Britain and France failed to give their own people the facts about what was happening, for example, in Spain in 1936 and 1937.  They failed to educate their own public opinion in the facts in regard to the world situation generally in the critical years from 1935 to 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One result of that was that war became inevitable, and another result was that democracy in one of the principal countries was not adequately prepared morally for the encounter with the other side and consequently, collapsed after a remarkably weak resistance. I hope that we ourselves never will have to defend our democracy and freedom by force of arms but, if that misfortune should come to us, it is absolutely essential that public morale should be sound.  It cannot be sound unless we have been thoroughly <Col N="342" /> enlightened upon all the principles and issues that are at stake.  We are for the moment&mdash;and I hope will be for a long time&mdash;a free people and citizens in a democracy, and while that situation exists we should behave as citizens of a free country.  I am aware, of course, that there are powerful nations locked in a deadly struggle not far from our shores, and I am aware that one of those belligerents has acted the part of a bully in Irish history during some centuries past and that it is not impossible that one or other of those belligerents may act the part of a bully in future in relation to our Irish freedom.  Bullies are not nice people: in fact some people regard them as rather objectionable, but there is one kind of person more objectionable still, that is, a today.  I hope we never shall descend to todaying to either of the belligerents but that we will continue to behave as free people so long as our freedom lasts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>In this very interesting debate one of the most remarkable things has been that, if we except Senator Mrs. Concannon's speech, no one has thought it necessary to draw attention to the terms of the resolution. Even the proposer of the resolution did not draw attention to its set terms.  It seems to me that the order of the resolution is important and, while it might be difficult for the House to accept the whole resolution as it stands, some of the clauses in it appear to demand, or even to command, universal support.  It is quite true that Senator Mrs. Concannon drew attention to what I take to be a verbal slip&mdash;using &ldquo;abrogated&rdquo; where, I think, &ldquo;suspended&rdquo; would be more accurate, in the first line.  Apart from that, it would seem to me that No. 1 clause of the resolution is the one that we could not only assent to but join in very cordially and that we should be glad to emphasise it.  It is necessary to emphasise it, on account of the great danger that occurs, with any emergency legislation, of its being carried on long when the emergency has ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had instances of that in a neighbouring country, of emergency <Col N="343" /> legislation dealing with such small matters as the time at which one could purchase cigarettes or a drink, being carried on for some 20 years after the emergency had passed.  We have an example on the Paper we have before us to-night, in the amendment to this resolution, where a clause is suggested for the approval of the Seanad which has nothing whatever to do with the emergency and has to do with a condition which might be permanent in Irish life or might go on for many years after this present national emergency has passed.  I think we have to keep our minds open to the danger of emergency legislation, in that it is so easy to carry it on in time far beyond what was intended at first.  We have had many instances shown to us to-night which are evidence of the danger of emergency legislation being carried out in a way which was never intended when the legislation was passed.  That is a claim which I think was made frankly by the Minister in the debate yesterday evening, but I will come to that later.</P>
    <P>In this first resolution we find suggested a principle with which we can all agree, having made the amendment that Senator Mrs. Concannon has suggested. In the second clause, the resolution goes on further to bring that down to more particular questions as to the right of expressing opinions by citizens.  Whether that clause is happily worded or not&mdash;I do not care altogether for the wording&mdash;the principle of it is quite sound.  Then we come to clause 3, which deals with particular matters which should be open to prohibition by the censor.  I doubt if either the proposer or the seconder of this resolution was so innocent or so simple&mdash;although they are innocent and simple men&mdash;as to expect that the Minister would accept these definitions as limiting his duties in regard to censorship. No doubt they are good, but I scarcely think they are exhaustive.  I doubt if it is possible to express in words any set terms which would be binding and be a limitation which could properly bind the Minister in the discharge of this kind of duty.</P>
    <P>Someone with more experience suggested <Col N="344" /> last night&mdash;I think it was Senator Fitzgerald&mdash;that there must be consideration of all the conditions at a particular moment, that censors must bring to their duty a considerable amount of common sense, and that there must be a judgment which can scarcely be merely an interpretation of the set terms set down in a resolution or a regulation.  I am quite sure that neither the mover nor the seconder expected the Minister to accept the suggestion in Clause 3 as binding.  To my mind, those who brought this resolution forward had in mind to induce the Minister to tell us a little more than he has told us up to the begining of the debate, or even up to the present moment, of the principles that guide him in the application of censorship.</P>
    <P>We had a previous debate dealing with censorship, and an innocent Senator, logically-minded, might have thought that the Minister would have taken the opportunity to take the House&mdash;and through the House, the public&mdash;into his confidence as to the guiding principles which govern the actions of his censoring officials.  No such statement of principles has been made by the Minister up to the present, but I hope it is not too late to induce him in this debate to make such a statement of principles.  It is true that, in the debate on this matter last December, he gave a very attractive statement of the sentiment in which he approached this duty.  &ldquo;By and large,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we operate this censorship, as I think somebody said here to-night, to keep temperature down internally, and prevent it from rising between ourselves and other countries.&rdquo;  Everybody will agree that that is excellent as a general guiding sentiment, as to the atmosphere in which the censors should work.</P>
    <P>While accepting that, we are bound to inquire whether it has always governed the actions of the Minister and of his officials.  He remarked with a degree of self-satisfaction: &ldquo;Of course, I have better judgment than most people in this regard.&rdquo;  The public and the members of the Seanad must exercise their judgment on that matter, but they are not to be allowed to express it in the Press.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> We must have no criticism of censorship in the Press.  That was stated bluntly last night, and, I think, to the amazement of the House, it was stated that that was with the will of the Oireachtas. We are told that the Oireachtas has established a censorship and that, since the Minister in charge has decided that there should be no newspaper articles criticising the censorship, therefore that is the will of the Dáil.  Could anything, in three or four sentences, be a greater breach of every rule of logic than that?  The Dáil passes a law, a Minister is appointed to administer it, and when the Minister comes to a decision that is the will of the Dáil!  Under the Constitution certain departments are set up here, and if the Minister concerned makes a decision, that decision cannot be questioned.  That is exactly the same argument as was advanced here last night.  That sort of argument, thrown out in what was intended to be a serious debate and what, with few exceptions, was a serious debate, certainly does not keep the temperature down.  I speak with subjective knowledge in that respect, and while I am very willing to give every possible weight to the Minister's argument&mdash; and to a great deal of what he said last night I gave great weight&mdash;I cannot think that he was carrying out his own policy of trying to keep the temperature down when he said that.</P>
    <P>Certain other rather provocative statements have been made, but I do not want to go back upon them now. One Senator to-day rather criticised the Minister in that he had censored himself. That was Senator Hayes.  Well, I differ entirely from Senator Hayes. I wish the Minister would censor himself oftener.  In view of the sedative remarks about keeping down the temperature, I wish that some of the statements made by the Minister in the Dáil during the last 13 months had been censored before they reached a wider public than that of the Dáil.  I think it would have been much better for the temperature.  I regret that it has not been thought fit, within the last 24 hours, to censor the statement of even a higher authority.  I think that the temperature would be a good deal <Col N="346" /> cooler if the address made by the Taoiseach last night had not contained some of the remarks he made.  That is my own opinion, of course, but I certainly was struck by one highly misleading and tendentious statement made by the Taoiseach last night.</P>
    <P>As I say, however, we have not yet had from the Minister in this House any indication as to what principles guide him or what principles guide his active officials in the carrying out of these duties.  We had the general sentiment, which I valued highly and which, I believe, generally does control the action of those who are working under the Minister, but we had, both last night and in the previous debate in December, certain sidelights on the Minister's attitude towards these questions.  They are not principles, but they were informative and illuminative. Before coming to them, however, I should like again to draw attention to some of the remarks made by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Supplies, in the speech he made last Saturday.  No doubt, the speech was given in a more congenial atmosphere than that of the Dáil, but it certainly was an admirable speech, and there is one part of it which, although it does not precisely lay down principles, with regard to censorship, comes very near to doing so.  I think the remarks have been read out already by other Senators, but even if they have I shall read them again, because I think they cannot be read too often.  Having drawn attention to the duties of the Press to ventilate opinions and the privilege of the Press to express its opinions through its columns, Mr. Lemass went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That function had to be restricted in times of peace by laws relating to treason and libel and the like, and in times of war by restrictions on the publication of information of military importance without authority, or by confining the brick-throwing activities of journalists to their own Government, because other Governments might not like it.  Subject to these restrictions, it was the function of the Press to give the <Col N="347" /> people the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister, does he accept his colleague's definition of the function of the Press, or does he not?  His speeches here have not respected the axioms quoted, and I am quite willing to accept the view that many of the statements made in regard to censorship have been made by oversight or through misunderstanding. The Minister made a very good answer to some of these statements from that point of view, but if he is willing to say that the working of the censorship is governed by that clause of his colleague's, then I think there will be very little need for further criticism.</P>
    <P>According to that speech of Mr. Lemass it was the function of the Press to give the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, but now it would seem that the Minister will not accept Mr. Lemass's statement. Mr. Lemass says that the brick-throwing activities of journalists should be confined to their own Government, because other Governments might not like it.  Apart from what other Governments may like, I do not think our own Government likes it, and according to what the Minister said last night no paper will be allowed to throw bricks at him or to criticise the censorship. Mr. Lemass, evidently, is willing to accept his chance of being hit by a verbal brick, but the Minister will not permit the throwing of a brick in the form of criticism.</P>
    <P>I said that the Minister, in his speech, had thrown some sidelights on what is his attitude towards his duties as head of the censoring system. There was a very remarkable instance in the debate last December.  To me it seemed to be one of the most remarkable and illuminating points of the debate.  Senator MacDermot had drawn the attention of the Seanad to the fact that some months ago, as he said, the censorship closed down on references to the desirability of a national Government in this country. What Senator MacDermot said was this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I remember some months ago the <Col N="348" /> censorship closing down on references to the desirability of a national Government in this country.  Why should that be?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister replied that he had forgotten that particular instance, but suggested that there might be some other idea associated with it.  Now, this seems to me to be of very great importance.  The Minister then said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Anyway I do not think it has any particular popular appeal with any Party.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Are we to understand, from the Minister's reply to Senator MacDermot on that occasion, that unless an idea has a popular appeal with some Party it is not to be allowed publication in our Press?  That is the essential, logical result of the Minister's statement. Are we to accept that?  Again, the Minister used the same argument against Senator MacDermot last night. Senator MacDermot had raised a certain point, which has been laboured, perhaps, unnecessarily, in later speeches, to the effect that there is a certain most important public question in this country on which, perhaps, a large majority take one point of view and on which others, perhaps, a small minority, take another view.  We had the same kind of argument to-night, that Senator MacDermot should not put forward any views he holds on that topic because there are not many people who would agree with him on it.</P>
    <P>Surely to goodness the greatest excuse for freedom of talk is that it is not listened to, and if the Minister or anyone else will not listen it cannot do any harm.  If Senator MacDermot produces an unpopular argument he is not likely to do much harm.  In the other instance whoever put forward the view that there should be a national Government, if that had no popular appeal with any Party, then it was a very harmless topic and I do not see why any censor should interfere.  Only those things which are popular with the majority are to be permitted peeps out from the view of the Minister.  That is a danger.  When the Minister looks at the past and at the history of our own country or of any other country, <Col N="349" /> did he ever know of any great reform being brought about except by a small party?  Did it ever begin except with an individual?  Is that individual not to be allowed to speak in this country while the Minister is in control?  That is the essential conclusion to be drawn from his remarks on the two occasions that this question was discussed.</P>
    <P>This has been an interesting debate but I regret that in many respects it has been degraded by personal attacks, and by implications of personal motives.  They are lowering to the dignity of this House.  It is possible to suspect a particular Senator of personal motives, but it lowers the dignity of the House to impute that he put forward certain views because of his personal motives.  That has been done and, I am sorry to say was done by the example of the Minister, who suggested that because Senator MacDermot thought it to be his duty to preach a particular doctrine, and was not permitted by the censor, therefore he put down the motion we are now discussing.  I do not know what the intention of the proposer of the motion is.  I do not suppose that he expects it is going to be accepted, nor is he simple enough to believe, even if it were accepted by the Seanad, that it will be accepted by the Minister while he is in control of censorship.  But I cannot but think that, even the amount of publicity that this debate will be allowed in the public Press, will have done some good in educating the uninformed mind of the country; that there are people, though they may be a small minority, who think it important that they should not be kept in blinkers, even though they only get a newspaper once a week or, as one Senator mentioned to-night, that they do not care a jot.  That is not the ideal before the Minister and his officials, and I regret that it should be put forward this time.</P>

      <P>It is with some reluctance that I intervene in this debate. When a motion of a similar kind was discussed last December, I ventured, probably ineffectively, to give expression to my views.  In any event, two or three days afterwards I received a <Col N="350" /> message from the editor of one of the metropolitan newspapers, and he told me I was very much worse than Mr. Aiken himself.  It is in order to make my position clear in respect of the whole question of the freedom of the Press that I wish to say a few words now.  I am a greater advocate of the freedom of the Press and of the right to free expression than Senator MacDermot can ever hope to be.  I am particularly interested in the Press, having been associated with it for 37 years, representing, as I do, a body of very eminent craftsmen engaged in the technical output of newspapers. Having listened to the debate to-day, and also on a previous occasion, I have definitely come to the conclusion that Senator MacDermot is more concerned about dragging this country in on one side of the present conflict than in the maintenance of the freedom of the Press, the liberty of the Press, or freedom of expression.  I am firmly convinced of that.  I do not make that charge against those who support him.  I respect the views put forward by Senator Alton and by Senator Rowlette.  I know their outlook on affairs.  I know where their spiritual ideals lie, and I appreciate them, while I could never subscribe to them.  I want to make my position clear.  We have certain restrictions on the Press at present.  They may be irritating.  The national need demands that there should be some sort of censorship of the Press.  I am convinced that Senator MacDermot is concerned, not with that liberty, but to drag this country into one side of the present conflict.  I leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Senator Johnston was speaking, he said that he could not follow Senator Mrs. Concannon's somewhat tortuous reasoning.  I confess that I was lost in Senator Johnston's tortuosity, and I could not make out what he was driving at.  As he was turning the corners of his tortuous path, I remember one sentence in which he referred to the denial of the right of the people to discuss the moral issues involved in the war.  We heard a lot about the moral issues involved in the last war, and we know the arguments that were used on behalf <Col N="351" /> of one belligerent in that war, the moral rights that that nation stood for, and its concern about the rights of small nations.  However, we found how these expressions of opinion were put into operation when that war ended. While it was in progress there were great professions of concern about freedom and about the rights of small nations.  We know how the small nations were treated when the war in Europe terminated.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point. During this debate we heard great champions of the liberty of the Press. At the time that this country was going through a period of torture, there was published here what a British general described as the &ldquo;Mosquito Press&rdquo;. That Press started with one paper which was suppressed, and it was succeeded by another paper that was also suppressed.  Finally the late Arthur Griffith published a paper which was known as <i>Scissors and Paste</i>, comprising cuttings from British newspapers in connection with the war.  That paper was also suppressed.  The point I want to make is this, that while there are people to speak in this House and to express concern about the liberty of the Press at present, we did not hear their views on that subject when this country was suffering greater torture than any country suffered.  There was no expression of regret or concern then about the liberty of the Press.  We know what happened.  Newspapers were suppressed, printing offices were smashed up, and the means of producing newspapers were denied to the Irish people.  We also heard about the atrocities that were committed by certain nations during the great war. These people who want liberty now are saying the things that were said in those days.  In my opinion that is the underlying motive at the back of this motion.  I remember the late Arthur Griffith pillorying those who were concerning themselves about the moral rights of other nations.  In one issue the following doggerel rhyme appeared:</P>
    <P>I met a man who saw a man,</P>
    <P>Who told an awful tale of</P>
    <P>How those wicked Germans,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> One day in half France,</P>
    <P>Cut off the tails of twenty cats</P>
    <P>And fried them on a lance!</P>
    <P>That was Arthur Griffith's way of deriding the efforts made by a certain section to hold one of the belligerents up to the world as torturers.</P>
    <P>When speaking about this matter of censorship, there is one aspect which has not been stressed by anybody, and that is the freedom that the Press itself has to censor other people.  We all know how newspapers, being in the main political organs, will&mdash;I will not say distort&mdash;take words out of their context and give a wrong interpretation to what a person may say.  I have no complaint to make on that score personally, nor do I intend to make a complaint in any general way against the Press, but they have the facilities and the means to do that, and it is very effectively done.</P>
    <P>If the House will bear with me for a few minutes, I will tell a very interesting story.  It was brought to my mind by the references made by Senator Hayes and others, or the allegation that the Minister was induced to cut something out of an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> or to censor some part of it because of a leading article published by the <i>Irish Independent</i> in 1916.  I can give the reverse side of that picture.  Five or six years ago I was engaged in trade union negotiations which involved the closing down of the <i>Irish Press</i> in a hurry one night. The negotiations took place at the offices of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Having threshed the matter out, we said very definitely that we would not allow the <i>Irish Press</i> to injure either the <i>Irish Times</i> or the <i>Irish Independent</i> by a closing down that night.  The suggestion was that the <i>Irish Press</i> should close down and that the other offices should close down in sympathy.  I ventured to say, although I was not a friend of the <i>Irish Independent's</i> and never could be on account of the one cardinal crime it committed by publishing a certain leading article in 1916, that I would not permit that injustice to be done to it.</P>
    <P>There was an interesting sequel to that.  An order was issued in the <Col N="353" /><i>Independent</i> office that my name was never to be mentioned in any connection in the paper.  I could not believe that.  Some weeks afterwards, however, I happened to attend a funeral, and a member of my own organisation, who set up the report of that funeral, brought me back the proof of the first setting of that report.  The instructions were that everything in which my name appeared was to be submitted to the editor.  The editor got a proof of that report and struck my name out of the list of those attending the funeral. That was incredible to me; I could hardly believe it, except that the man who gave me the proof was a member of our organisation and had brought it out of the office.  Even then, for five or six years I could hardly credit it. Last year, however, a certain organisation appeared before the Commission on Vocational Organisation and the question of the right of the Press to interfere with the interests of the community by withholding information, or in any other way, came up.  By a strange chance, the man who did that was one of the witnesses at the commission, and he turned to me and said: &ldquo;You put me in a very awkward position.&rdquo;  The Bishop of Galway, who was presiding, said: &ldquo;Surely that is not possible,&rdquo; and, very reluctantly, this witness, who had retired from the editorship, admitted that he had instructions to keep my name out.  That persisted for some years.  I have no complaint against the <i>Irish Independent</i> any more than I have against the <i>Irish Press</i> or the <i>Irish Times.</i>  I only mention that to show that this is an aspect of the matter which has been lost sight of.  What can be done in connection with a little matter like that can be done in a more intensified and extensive way.</P>
    <P>The House has given a great deal of its time to the consideration of this whole question of censorship.  Some of us have sat here on two or three occasions listening to the speeches.  I sat through the December debate and the present debate, and I think it is the sheerest waste of time in this hour of the nation's crisis to be challenging the right of the people in whose hands lies the definite responsibility of guiding the nation through these dangerous <Col N="354" /> times.  Senator Hogan brought forward a motion to-day and certain people were in a desperate hurry to get rid of it, as if it were of no concern to the people of the country.  So far as I know the minds of the people of the country, they are concerned with one thing and one thing only, and that is, what their position will be in six months' time.  We have had every indication from the Ministers responsible for defence, supplies and other matters of the dangerous situation that confronts this nation, and that is the predominant fear in the heart of every citizen to-day.  The people are not concerned about these petty censorship regulations.  This country is too independent, too conservative and too individualistic to tolerate perpetual censorship of the Press.  Some people profess to believe that this is just the beginning of dictatorship. In their hearts I do not think that they believe it.  In my opinion, what is at the back of this motion is a desire to drag this country in on the side of one belligerent, and the people of the country will not stand for that.  Let there be no mistake about that.  If, by any mischance, harm is done in that way, the Irish people will hold these people responsible for dragging them into that position and will deal with them accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that some Senators think my first words will be an attack on Senator MacDermot.  I am not going to say one unkind word of him.  I have great sympathy and pity for Senator MacDermot, who poses as an Irishman while he is out of touch with the feelings of the Irish people.  I would more or less repeat the statement made by Senator Campbell on the last occasion when we were discussing this matter.  I go amongst the people who really count in this country, namely, the farmers, the farm labourers and the other workers, the people on whose work this nation has to depend if it is to survive, people who count for far more than professors and others, learned and educated as they may be, but who do not work as hard as those other people.  The people I speak of are not concerned about the censorship.  As a matter of fact <Col N="355" /> the farmer, the farm labourer, the worker and the unemployed are solidly behind the Government in their effort to keep us out of this war.</P>
      <P>I am certain, if there were no censorship and if all Senator MacDermot's statement yesterday did get out to the public, that if we were not involved in an outside war, there would be a little one at home and it would be very much one-sided.  I should like Senator MacDermot to remember that.  As I said, I have the greatest pity for him. I think it is terrible to see an educated man, residing in this country and posing as an Irishman, so much out of touch with the Irish people in every way.  He stated that at the beginning of this war the people may have been in favour of neutrality but that they have the right to change.  I am afraid Senator MacDermot will never change. As a matter of fact, he is going from bad to worse.  I repeat that the plain people of the country, the people who count, are solidly behind the Government. They look upon the censorship as a weapon of defence, and, so far as that weapon of defence is concerned in keeping this country out of the war, there will be no change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I supported the decision of this country to maintain what I regard as non-belligerency.  I am not in any way ashamed of the fact that they did so, nor have I changed my mind.  But I very much resent the attitude of those who believe that persons who consider that censorship might be run on somewhat different lines, or who are anxious to guard it and see that the least possible harm is done by it, are necessarily persons who believe that this country ought to walk straight into the war.  I do not think any good service is done to any cause by assuming that anything of the kind is true.  Further, while I have great sympathy with Senators like Senator McEllin, whose skin is so thin that they are irritated by having to listen to opinions that they disagree with, I nevertheless believe that it is a good thing to have to listen to views which you disagree with as long as you are not ashamed of your own views and <Col N="356" /> not afraid to state them when you disagree.</P>
      <P>Now, as far as this motion is concerned, I am satisfied that, whether we like it or not, we are bound to have a censorship.  I believe that censorship of itself, particularly a Press censorship, is a bad thing, and for my part I would be prepared to accept the general attitude stated by the Minister for Supplies as the general principles which should be adopted.  I think it should not be used to prevent internal discussion of matters relating to our own affairs.  I think it should not be used to censor criticism of the Government, except when of a nature which would give away information, or which would be liable to embroil us with belligerents in the war.  If it be true that portions of the Minister's speech here yesterday were censored, I consider that is an abuse of censorship, because I do not believe that any speech made in public by a Minister, that is by a member of the Government who has full information as to what the position is, ought to be censored.  If the speech is one that should be censored, then I think it should not be made in public.  It is not quite the same with those of us who are not Ministers but who may be in public positions and may inadvertently make statements which we might not make if we had full knowledge, but I certainly think that is the position with regard to Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, there is an impression abroad, and I think it is only honest that we should face it, that, whether deliberately or unintentionally, there is a censorship of the expression of opinion. There is free speech but not free reporting of that speech.  Though we may criticise, and I think criticism is good, I think we ought to recognise that there is still a very considerable amount of freedom.  I am glad to say, for instance, that there is no censoring of books simply because they are propagandist. It is possible for anyone who wants to obtain most of the propaganda on either side, in so far as it is available, to do so, and it is possible to form a fair opinion.  I think the main fault at the moment is due, not solely to censorship, but to the <Col N="357" /> fact that our Press, whatever be the reason, does not give enough general information of what is really happening in the world.</P>
    <P>To my mind, the world is in what may prove to be a crisis in its history. I do not believe a small nation such as ours, suddenly taking steps which would end its position of non-belligerency, is going to help.  If I really believed that it would, and that it would bring about right as against wrong in the world, I think I would be prepared to take the risk; but at the same time I am not satisfied&mdash;I know that I am in this matter in a minority, and I think it is only right to say it out&mdash;that it is a good thing for this country that there can be no reporting of discussions on the question of non-belligerency.  I believe that the majority of the people here could, quite definitely, face that discussion, and that they would be of the same opinion still, but with more information and with perhaps a better-considered reason behind it than at the present time.  Now, I may be quite wrong.  It is a matter which I would not like to press too far, but I am convinced that we cannot avoid some censorship.  The object should be not to censor except where it is necessary. This is not a time in which the censorship can be properly or usefully used to improve the general standard of our discussions here, to censor indiscretions or various things said at the present time, unless they are in some way or other related to the countries which are engaged in this war, or where they might cause offence or misunderstanding of our position.</P>
    <P>I consider that the statement made the other night by the Minister for Supplies was, taken as a general statement, a very good statement of what should be the guiding principles as long as we have to have censorship.  If that is accepted, in letter and spirit, it is inevitable that there will be errors, and that at some time there will be unfairness from one side or another. I do not believe that any country can produce an infallible censorship.  I believe the very nature of it means that there will be things that ought to be criticised.  I, personally, believe that <Col N="358" /> the principal difficulty in censorship, as regards certain matters, is the fact that it is not done by a National Government.  I believe if it was done by a National Government, instead of by a Party Government, there would be very much less criticism than there is at present, because there would be, not in public probably, discussions between different types of minds with a compromise between them to arrive at a fair balance.</P>
    <P>My principal reason for rising to speak at this late hour is to deal with one suggestion that was made in the course of the debate.  The Minister seemed to indicate that he might not be totally against it, though he might not like it in too formal a manner. I am satisfied there was no venom behind any of the criticism made here. I believe that, as far as the vast majority of Senators are concerned, the criticism made was simply an effort to give expression to things which they had heard outside and which they believe are of some importance.  With regard to the suggestion I have referred to, I think it would be an excellent thing if a small representative committe, meeting about once a month, were set up which would make suggestions to the Minister.  That committee would pass on information in a general friendly way, and would try to assist the censorship.  If you had a committee of a representative character, composed of six or seven members at the outside, of both Houses, I think you would find there would be very little desire to have further debates such as we have had dealing with details rather than principles.</P>
    <P>Now as far as the motion is concerned, I am rather in a similar position to that of Senator Hayes.  I completely agree with paragraphs (1) and (2) of the motion, but I am very doubtful indeed about paragraph (3) because I am afraid it would be almost impossible to set out general principles.  If the motion were amended and set down under four headings, instead of in its present form, with the proviso that it ought not to exclude matter unless under these four headings, I would be inclined to give it general support.  As far as the giving up of fundamental <Col N="359" /> constitutional rights and of liberty is concerned, I think that should only be done where it is inevitable and where it cannot be avoided.  In matters, however, relating to criticism of the Government or to the discussion of matters inside this country, I would prefer to see the censorship erring on the side of letting too much out than in preventing the publication of too much.  I have not dealt with individual cases although I know of several I could refer to.  I am inclined to think that in some cases the existence of the censorship meant referring to the censor things which editors ought to have dealt with themselves.  Cases relating to the publication of letters have been reported to me which I do not think should have been censored.  If I were an editor I myself would have stopped the publication of some of them, not on the grounds that their publication would do any harm, but because they were not up to a standard which would justify publication.  I think there is that tendency to pass matters on to the censor that ought to be dealt with by editors themselves.</P>
    <P>My attitude towards censorship is not one of hostility but rather one which I would prefer should be helpful. If we could have some representative committee set up by consent, I think the Minister would find that you could get enough members on both sides to meet entirely for the purpose of passing on suggested improvements and of general criticism in a friendly way.  I am not suggesting that they should interfere with his final judgment.  The committee, however, could make suggestions, and I think that, on the whole, the setting up of such a body would add to the general confidence.</P>

      <P>My reply will not be altogether answers to questions.  I should like to say that I am delighted with the way this debate has, generally, gone.  It was good to find general acceptance by this House of the policy of neutrality.  Accepting that, I am quite prepared to admit that there is plenty of scope for criticism as to how that policy is being worked.  A number of Senators admitted, in principle, the necessity for censorship but said that, in their view, censorship was being badly run.  That is, of course, a matter of opinion.  My opinion is that no matter who was in charge of censorship for the past 18 months or so, he would, by now, have convinced a large number of people that he was not the man to run it.  In a neighbouring country, in 18 months, a number of Ministers gave up charge of that department for one reason or another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>They do some of the other, too.  I have been asked on what principles we are working censorship. I endeavoured to outline those in the Dáil at the beginning of the war and I have done it on several occasions since. On the 27th September, 1939, in the Dáil, I said that the censorship instructions, generally, covered four or five points&mdash;(1) that newspapers shall not <Col N="361" /> publish information which would, or might, endanger the security of the State, such as information relating to the movement or equipment of our defence forces or matters calculated to cause disaffection, either amongst our defence forces or amongst the people or matters which might prejudice recruiting; (2) matters which are likely to prejudice the neutrality of the country; (3) matters which would, or might, prejudice our economic or financial security.  While those are the general principles, they have to be applied&mdash;and applied to a couple of hundred thousand words submitted every night, by a staff who have to be exercise, in large measure, their own judgment in the interpretation of these instructions.  Judging the censorship staff by the work they have done and under the circumstances in which they did it, I think they have done a magnificent job and that, by and large, there have been no legitimate grounds of complaint left to the newspapers.</P>
      <P>Newspapers will object to censorship. They will always do that.  It is of their nature to object to it.  The newspaper editors have been acting as censors all their lives.  Senator Campbell gave an instance of that to-night.  I could give many other instances from my own knowledge.  There has been a lot of talk here about the censorship of his Eminence Cardinal Hinsley.  One Dublin newspaper censored the Dean of St. Paul's recently and we might have been blamed for it.  The Dean of St. Paul's said that he believed that, when Britain had won the war, she would be compelled to hold Europe for a considerable time by force of arms and would be compelled to enlarge the British Empire.  One newspaper&mdash;the <i>Independent</i>&mdash;censored that.  That was an exercise of the editor's judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard censorship very much as Senator Mrs. Concannon regards it&mdash;as a very important instrument in the defence of our neutrality and of the security of the State generally.  We are trying to operate it as an effective instrument for that purpose.  I would regard any legitimate criticism that could be levelled against the censorship, a charge that could be sustained, <Col N="362" /> as blunting the effectiveness of the censorship as an instrument for the maintenance of neutrality.  I, personally, am convinced, as the vast majority of the people are, that neutrality is essential for the best interests of this nation, and I would consider that we were doing a very bad job if, through operating the censorship inefficiently, we, in any way, rendered the defence of neutrality less effective.  I believe in the freedom of the Press in normal times.  As the Minister for Supplies said when addressing the journalists last Saturday night, I believe in a free Press and a good Press.  But practically every speaker in this debate has admitted that in time of emergency limits have to be put to the freedom of the Press. Senator MacDermot himself admitted that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to ascertain at what point we reach disagreement. We all agree that limits should be put to the freedom of the Press, and the question is where the line should be drawn.  There is not a Senator who would agree with any other Senator as regards a lot of the material that goes through.  Each would have his point of view.  I admit that I have my point of view.  I have to be guided by my own judgment when matters are submitted to me.  I exercise that judgment if the censorship staff do not feel competent or at liberty to exercise their own judgment in a major matter. I was asked by Senator Hayes why a leading article of the <i>Independent</i>, quoting Mr. Lemass, was cut out, and my answer to that is the same as the answer to Senator MacDermot in relation to the first leading article which was censored, that is, that we do not allow, and do not propose to allow, the newspapers to criticise the censorship department from day to day.</P>

      <P>We would not allow that precedent to be established, even though there was nothing very much <Col N="364" /> wrong in that particular leading article.  If we were to allow the newspapers to undermine the censorship by daily criticism, objecting to this, that and the other thing being censored, we might as well have no censorship at all.  As somebody pointed out here, the essential element of censorship is secrecy, and the only way you can have secret and effective censorship is that, when a thing is censored, it will stay censored.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes made a point against me, arising out of a reference to a certain newspaper article of bygone days to which reference was made here, and he said that my speech had been censored because it contained that reference. That was not the case.  It was a logical consequence of the instruction that was given, that Senator MacDermot's speech quoting the censored <i>Independent</i> article should not be allowed to appear.  It had been censored, and it was not allowed to appear, and we were not going to allow it to appear in the form of a report of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I try my best&mdash;I am only a human being&mdash;to behave on all occasions in a reasonable manner, and sometimes it is very difficult when one is faced with unreasonable argument and unreasonable attack, but that is portion of the game, and we have to put up with it as best we can.  On this occasion, I am not following Senator Hayes, because I believe that this debate should be kept on a reasonable level.  The subject is a very important one for the future of this country. Senator Hayes raised the question of articles in a certain Leinster newspaper which were allowed to appear over several weeks, and I think he is under the impression that every line printed in any newspaper is submitted to the censorship beforehand.  That is not the case.  The editors submit only matter which they think worth submitting, something about which they have a doubt, and the newspaper editors down the country submit only very occasional articles.  We have had one trouble with provincial newspapers, and one only, that is, that a large number of them are one-man shows, and when the editor goes off, somebody is left behind who creates trouble both for himself and the censorship before very long.  During this particular <Col N="366" /> series of weeks, I understand that the editor of that newspaper was ill.  When the matter was called to the censor's attention, he wrote a very vigorous letter to the editor, who, in his reply, gave that reason for the appearance of these articles to which Senator Hayes objected.</P>

      <P>It appears not, in this particular instance.  The question of the postal censorship was raised by Senator Alton and Senator Keane. Postal censorship is done under an Emergency Powers Order, 1939.  It is one of a long list of orders which were prepared before the war, and which were put into operation immediately. It stated in Section 17, Part IV:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister may by order make provision for securing that postal packets of any such description as may be specified in such order shall be detained by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and produced for censorship to such authority as may be named in the order.</P>
      <P>We have been operating that in relation to the censorship of post going out of the country.  We have not operated it in regard to internal post. It is important that we should control the outgoing and incoming mails as far as we can do it, and we have been able to stop a number of stories going out of a scare-mongering type which would indeed have done great damage to the people of the country.  We do not care what private people's opinions are.  No one beyond the censorship staff sees any of these letters except where there is a case of sedition or treason or near-treason discovered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There are so many of these letters that no particular <Col N="367" /> operator in the censorship department could take any personal interest in them.  There is a huge volume of letters going through.  If I have placed correctly the case to which Senator Sir John Keane referred, where an individual was taken into the censorship department and told off, I think practically every Senator here, would agree, if he saw the correspondence, that it should have been stopped, that it was in fact seditious, and that we did the right thing in taking the writer in and telling him it was seditious and that it must stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Professor Alton Professor Alton">
      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I make no complaint against the stopping of seditious or traitorous items going out of the country but I think we must take an exception to interfering with private opinions on purely domestic points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If private opinions and information do not impinge on national security nobody is going to bother with them; nobody can be bothered with them, but if opinions are expressed that are seditious or treasonable they are stopped.  In the case of Senator Sir John Keane's friend, if I have identified it correctly, a number of letters were stopped with a view to a prosecution and it was thought that it was better simply to take him in and say: &ldquo;Remember where you are living and stop this sort of thing.&rdquo;  The man undertook to stop it and that was an end to the matter.  I would wish that people writing out from this country to other countries would bear in mind that in this particular crisis they are bearing their little share of the responsibility for the national security, and even if it means the sacrifice of refraining from saying some of the smart things they say about this country and about our state of preparedness and about what is happening, they should make that sacrifice when the national security is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A letter going from here to England or from here to the Continent, or from here to America, is looked upon as being of more than ordinary importance <Col N="368" /> in these times, and the people should be very careful as to what they say, and particularly in regard to anything which would be harmful to this country if used by an enemy of this country and an enemy of our attitude in this emergency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestHAlton" hpid="Professor Alton Professor Alton">
      <NameTxt>Professor Alton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are referring to different classes of letters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only saying if I placed Senator Sir John Keane's friend correctly.  He said three letters were stopped; that was the number.  He says he was brought into the censorship department: there was a man brought into the censorship department and I think I have identified the particular individual.  While I am generally responsible, I cannot be personally acquainted with every fiddle-faddle, and if any Senator has any grievance about a letter that has been censored, if he brings it to my attention I promise I will look into it. That is all I can do.</P>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane said that pictures of bomb damage in England were completely cut out and that the people did not know there was a war on.  Anybody can take up any of the newspapers any day in the week and see pictures of the bomb damage.  I think the Senator has some particular type of bomb damage in mind, but, generally speaking, the people of this country know from the newspaper illustrations here that there is a war on and a very disastrous and destructive war.</P>
      <P>I must say that, although I disagree with some of Senator Alton's criticism of myself and censorship, I agree with a lot of the last part of his speech, to the effect that the present generation wants light.  Anyway, we are not trying to stop the light, we are only trying to stop some of the smoke that clouds the light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to newsreels, I am not directly responsible for newsreels, but I can say this, that it has been agreed that newsreels showing war pictures will be stopped for the <Col N="369" /> duration of the war.  The reason is that we do not want any trouble in picture-houses.  If a newsreel is shown in which one belligerent or the other is prominent, somebody may start to &ldquo;booh&rdquo; and somebody may start to cheer, and we do not want that sort of competition to start.  We allow war pictures to appear in the newspapers simply because they are in cold print, and if a man gets a newspaper in the morning he will not start either cheering or boohing the paper.</P>
    <P>Senator MacDermot generally wants us to open our papers to opinion of one kind or another, opinion for one belligerent or another, propaganda for one belligerent or another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I want, if I may, to say one or two sentences in regard to this. The Senator said that there was no indication that there was any foreign gold coming in here with which to buy newspaper space or to buy people here to write in a belligerent way in favour of one of the belligerents.  With that I totally agree, and I think that Senator MacDermot and any other Senator who spoke here to-night spoke from his own conviction, but if we allowed our newspapers to carry belligerent propaganda we should remember the history of the last war.  We here are all pretty young men yet, but we remember what went on, and we have since read with great interest what occurred.  We know that in neutral countries belligerents vied with each other in buying up the newspapers of those countries.  Our newspapers here may be above that&mdash;I believe they are&mdash;but they certainly would send in paid agents to write their propaganda and get it into the papers.</P>

      <P>The best way to stop a lot of things is to stop them before they start.  We are trying to stop any row in this country among ourselves about issues that the people do not want raised.  We want to stop a row with other countries by preventing it from starting if we can help it.  I think I have answered pretty well all the questions that have been raised; I have done my best to do it anyway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>An American visitor broadcasting from this country a few days ago said that in Ireland one looked down upon the war from a mountain top.  At the time I did not think that image was altogether a happy one, and I am more than ever convinced of it after listening to this debate.  It would have been much more appropriate to have said that we here were in a deep valley, that mountains surrounded us, and that we had no outlook over the mountain-tops.</P>
      <P>I am simply appalled by the attitude that has been taken by many of the Senators who have spoken on this motion.  There are two very important things that they seemed to me to take no notice of at all.  One is that national security is not the same thing as neutrality, and that it is not the same thing as a strict censorship. They have paid no attention to the example which I cited of Holland, where the censorship was as strict as it could possibly be, or to the fact that, nevertheless, Holland was overrun. The second thing that most Senators who spoke on this motion seemed to have paid no attention to is that there may be actual danger&mdash;not merely over-caution but actual danger&mdash;in a strict censorship.  Senator Campbell, for example, gets up and talks of this whole subject as a trifle that the people did not feel any interest in and should not feel any interest in.  I quite agree that the mass of agriculturists who have no contact with the censorship and do not even realise what it is doing &mdash;a large number of other people in this country are in the same position&mdash; may care very little about it, and may not at all realise its importance, but its importance nevertheless is great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="371" /> I happen to believe that this country is in terrible danger, and the answer to some observations that Senator McEllin made this evening, and has made on previous occasions and will probably make on future occasions, is simply this, that in bringing forward this motion.  I regard myself as taking a step not for promoting the danger but for promoting the safety of this country.  To be perfectly frank, as I was frank yesterday, I believe that the real danger facing this country is the possibility, almost amounting to a probability, of a German attempt at invasion in the course of a few months. I am not satisfied that the censorship is so operating as to make a defence against that attempt efficient.</P>
    <P>I believe that the country is being kept in the dark about the situation, and I believe that this business of holding the balance so evenly as to suppress all moral considerations, and sedulously to cut out of our minds and out of our newspapers all references to the fate of Holland and of Belgium and of Norway and of Denmark, and the fate that was attempted to be imposed upon Greece, is absolute madness, just as I think it is madness to cut out of our newspapers the other facts that I mentioned yesterday with regard to the extent to which the British have stood by us in the matter of supplies, including arms.  Now it may be&mdash;I am sure it is&mdash;in the opinion of Senator Tunney totally unIrish to make a statement of that kind, and the man who makes such a statement deserves the pity of every true Irishman, but I cannot help it if people do think that when I consider that it is my duty to say it, and that it is important to the Irish people to realise it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has professed satisfaction with the general tone of this debate. I am afraid that, apart altogether from the points which I have already mentioned, I fail to share that satisfaction.  Practically every speaker against the motion followed the illustrious example set by the Minister, and made a personal attack on me and on my motives one of the main features <Col N="372" /> of his speech.  Well, after all that, my head, in the words of the poet, &ldquo;is bloody but unbowed.&rdquo;  Let me amend what I have just said by saying &ldquo;practically every opponent of this motion in the Minister's Party.&rdquo;  It has been my lot to plough a fairly solitary furrow for a good many years.  Some malignant fairy who was not invited to my christening seems to have decreed that it should be my lot in life to advocate unpopular causes, causes that may be popular in some places, but it has been my lot to advocate them in places where they are unpopular.</P>
    <P>The Minister has talked of me as having &ldquo;blown in&rdquo; from some obscure place in the world, and as having committed an error of taste and judgment in venturing to project myself, as he described it, into certain of the higher spheres of Irish life, prominent among which is, of course, his own administration. Now, I do not want to labour personal issues, but there is a certain importance in this because of the extraordinary revelation of the Minister's totalitarianism.  He considers, in the first place, that once he has been elected to the Government, and once certain powers have devolved upon him, thereafter the natural and democratic thing for the people to do is to fold their hands and leave it all to him, and never to venture a word in the way of criticism or suggestion or guidance.  That is totalitarianism&mdash;if that is democracy, then the régime that is in force in Germany at the present time is democracy&mdash;and it seems to me that the whole of the Minister's philosophy of government is consistent with the totalitarian régime and is inconsistent with a democratic régime properly understood.</P>
    <P>I am unfortunately a good deal older than the Minister, and even though I was absent from this country when he was so distinguishing himself in the period to which he referred last night, I can claim that I was advocating Irish self-government on platforms both in this country and in England at a time when the Minister was still in the nursery.  If we are to talk, as Senator <Col N="373" /> McGinley did, of planters and natives, I have a notion that I have, at any rate, as good a right as the Minister to be considered as a native. And I am not so ignorant as the Minister supposes of the years to which he refers.</P>
    <P>There have been very short periods in my life when I have not followed, with close attention, events in Ireland, and there are not many books of any worth at all written about that period that I have not read.  And that is not the whole of Irish history.  I cannot admit that any primacy can be claimed for that particular period of Irish history.  As I have told the Minister, I should be very happy to sit as a competitor with him in any examination on Irish history in general.</P>
    <P>I much resent the kind of approach he has made to this matter.  He has accused me of having a sort of superiority complex and has tried to justify that by saying that I had no sooner gone to the Dáil than I accused people of being gutter-snipes.  I am rather grateful to the Minister for having alluded to that particular speech, because it has considerable relevance to the situation we are in to-day and the very discussion we are now conducting. The speech in question&mdash;it was not my first, but my third&mdash;was made on the subject of the Bill to abolish the Oath of Allegiance, and the line I took was not that we had not a right to do so, not that we would be gutter-snipes to separate ourselves from the Commonwealth, but that we should do one thing or the other; that if we were going to abolish the Oath of Allegiance and begin the process which ended at the time of the constitutional crisis when Edward VIII abdicated, we might as well walk out of the Commonwealth at once with our heads up and not go on astutely enjoying all the material advantages that we could get out of the Commonwealth, while at the same time keeping up a spirit of hostility towards it.</P>
    <P>It was in connection with that argument that I said: &ldquo;We are an ancient <Col N="374" /> race with noble and moving traditions, with tragic and glorious memories.  Do not let us behave like gutter-snipes.&rdquo; I am not ashamed of having said that, and I think the whole course of our history since 1932 proves I am right.  I think that at this moment we would have escaped from the reproaches levelled at us, and, in my judgment, levelled at us with considerable justification by other parts of the Commonwealth&mdash;that, having gone on getting all the advantages we could get out of it in times of peace, we desert them in the hour of their greatest need.</P>
    <P>Several Senators said that we have a right to be neutral.  Of course we have. I have never denied it for a minute. We have the right to be neutral, but certainly our credit in regard to that position of neutrality would stand much higher than it does if we had not followed this ambiguous policy of trying to make the best of both worlds.  I make no excuse for having tried to prevent that, and having brought forward motions that we should go out of the British Commonwealth, motions that were always attacked by members of the Minister's Party on the ground that they were insincere, in spite of my assurances that they were perfectly sincere.  That is more than enough about that.</P>
    <P>The outlook of the Minister, when he wishes to exclude from the discussion of important affairs people whom he considers are a small minority, is a totalitarian outlook.  When I was elected for County Roscommon, my constituents did not ask me to abstain from projecting myself upon certain spheres of Irish life.  When I was reelected with an increase of 3,000 first preference votes, again no such condition was made, nor would I have consented to enter Parliament upon any such condition.  When the Minister's own Prime Minister was good enough to nominate me for this House, he did not make any such condition, nor did I anticipate that anybody in his Party would ever be so narrow-minded as to suggest that I should keep my mouth shut because I represented only a minority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="375" /> Am I really so very unrepresentative? Is it certain, if there was an election to the Seanad to-morrow by a nationwide constituency, that I would not have as good a chance of a seat here as a great many of those who constantly abuse me for being unrepresentative?</P>
    <P>I resent the fact the people have been ascribing all sorts of motives to me for bringing forward this motion. My action should be judged on its own merits.  My motives are not very important anyway.  I have asserted, with all the force and sincerity of which I am capable, that my motive is to assist the welfare and security of this country and not to destroy them. I believe from my heart that the more rational exercise of the censorship could do a great deal in that direction. Many Senators have spoken as if we were proposing to abolish the censorship. We are not proposing to abolish it, but to rationalise it, and we have not done so in any arrogant manner. We have suggested certain principles and we would have been willing to consider suggestions for their improvement if such were put forward by the Government, but they have not been put forward.</P>
    <P>Senator Campbell says that he has been subjected to criticism because of his speech on the last occasion when the censorship was discussed here.  I hardly think that criticism will be at all assuaged by the speech he made here to-night.  I have rarely read a speech that showed more complete indifference to democratic principles in regard to freedom of speech and freedom of the Press than the speech he made here on December 4th.  He described people who were interested in such things as fine theorists who come here and indulge in high falutin' talk about freedom when what they mean is not freedom but licence.  He said he represented 250,000 people; he heard no great outcry against the censorship, and consequently the whole thing was trivial.  He said there was a little coterie in this country who affected to <Col N="376" /> be devotees at the shrine of liberal thought, and who did not like censorship of books, nor our divorce laws, nor many other things which people of this country favour.  He dragged in the divorce laws by the tail, although they have nothing to do with the subject.</P>
    <P>The general idea of the speech was to blacken the plaintiff's attorney by suggestions of that description.  The vast majority of the people, he said, favour censorship&mdash;not alone the censorship we are discussing at the present time, but censorship in other matters.  I am not at all surprised that some of his friendly critics told him that he was worse than the Minister for the Coordination of Defensive Measures in his outlook on the censorship.  There is nothing he said to-day that is at all likely to remove that impression, not even his attribution of all sorts of sinister motives to me.</P>

      <P>I quite agree that the working of the censorship is a difficult matter and it may be that, as Senator Hayes says, there is no entirely satisfactory solution except to get the very wisest and most tactful and most broadminded man you can find in the whole country to be censor.  Senator Hayes finds me the reverse of soothing, on occasions, but at any rate we are at one in thinking that the Minister does not quite come up to specification in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes said that more courage is required on the part of those who have complaints to make. The trouble is, if I am correctly informed, that there are some complaints they cannot make because of the conditions of secrecy that are imposed on them.  I know, at any rate, that much of the information I got in connection with cases that I cited in this debate came to me in envelopes from people who did not sign their names because they felt, apparently, that they would get into trouble if I should quote their <Col N="377" /> names.  Naturally I did not use any information that I was not able to authenticate, and I am glad that, of about 13 cases I quoted in my speech yesterday, there was not a single one that turned out to be unauthentic.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some attempt to deal with some of them.  I do not think, personally, that he justified what was done by the censorship in most of those he dealt with.  In fact I am not sure that he did so in any of those he dealt with.  There were also some left with which he did not deal at all.  There was the suppression of the writer who wished to quote from the Bishop of Waterford in <i>The Standard.</i>  There was the suppression in the cinema news reel, the suppression of the fact that the bombs which had been dropped in Dublin had been identified as German.  There was the suppression of part of the speech of his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, made some time ago, and there was the suppression of the facts in regard to the flying of Mrs. Clarke's flag.  With none of these things did the Minister deal at all, and they still seem to me to remain as sins upon his head.</P>
    <P>Senator McGinley, in reply to my remarks about democratic usage, objected to my taking any examples from England.  I gathered he did so upon patriotic grounds, but after all England is one of the oldest democracies in the world and democratic usage is well established there.</P>

      <P>In that case, if the British are undemocratic, we ought easily to excel them by our democratic practices, whereas the sad fact is that we fall behind them in this particular matter of free speech.  The Senator instances the suppression of the <i>Daily Worker</i> as an example of non-democratic methods but, as a matter of fact, <Col N="378" /> it is an example of quite the contrary. The <i>Daily Worker</i> was allowed to go on for months publishing things that were extremely hostile to Government policy and it was in the end suppressed because Ministers, including Labour Ministers, and practically the whole of the British Parliament, became convinced that it was deliberately promoting sabotage and the breaking-down of the war effort in Britain.  It is even now perfectly legal to speak or write in favour of peace in Great Britain, so I think that the Senator has been misinformed when he says that the British are undemocratic.</P>

      <P>I do not say this in any hostile sense but the Senator himself, if I am correctly informed, affords a very striking example of their tolerance and their democratic feeling. I said last night, and he nodded assent, that throughout his life he had been an ardent propagandist for the Irish language and that it was far from being in any way to his discredit. Was he interfered with by the British during the British régime?</P>

      <P>I do not wish to enlarge upon that except to suggest that one who has had such a long experience of Government service under the British régime here, and has nevertheless been able to carry on propaganda which he regarded as highly unpalatable to them, should not be the first to accuse them of not practising the principles of tolerance and democracy. I say that without any hostility to the Senator, but because I think it is a fair point to make.</P>
      <P>I should like, in conclusion, to direct attention to the actual terms of this motion.  Senator Rowlette complained that not enough has been said about those terms, so perhaps I might quote them at this stage.  The motion reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, in the opinion of the Seanad:</P>
      <P>(1) Fundamental constitutional rights ought not to be abrogated more than is necessary for national safety even during war or the threat of war.</P>
      <P>Senator Mrs. Concannon and Senator Rowlette took exception to the word &ldquo;abrogated&rdquo; and suggested that the word &ldquo;suspended&rdquo; would be more suitable.  Possibly, but I do not think that the word &ldquo;abrogated&rdquo; implies any sort of permanence or finality.  I think it merely means &ldquo;cancelled&rdquo;.  A thing could be cancelled for the time being as distinct from being cancelled for ever and a day.  I do not think that that point need be taken very seriously.</P>
      <P>The motion goes on:</P>
      <P>In particular, the right to express opinion on Government policy and to persuade one's fellow-citizens ought not to be so abrogated as to give excuse for unconstitutional action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="380" /> Now, nothing has been said about that point in this debate, but I did say something about it on the last occasion when the Seanad discussed the censorship. I do not think we ought to lose sight of it altogether.  You do give an excuse for unconstitutional action if you deny the right of people to express their opinions and to persuade their fellow-citizens.  There are subversive elements in this State who might take advantage of that excuse.  If there are people who believe that we ought to go to war on the side of Germany, I personally think that they should be free to say so and to try to persuade their fellow-citizens.</P>
    <P>It so happens that the element who would wish that we should enter the war on the side of Britain are not a type who would be likely to take subversive action, but the same argument applies to them, too, and if there were amongst them people of subversive inclinations, the censorship does give them that excuse.  That is a thing we ought to bear in mind.</P>
    <P>While we are on that point, I cannot agree with the suggestion of Senator McGinley that the bulk of those who sympathise with Britain and the British Commonwealth in this country are planters or the descendants of planters.  That has not been my experience. I know a considerable number of people who are actually in the British Army.  I have several near relations who are actually in the British Army.  By far the majority of Irishmen that I know who are in the British Army at the present time are of Gaelic descent, and are not the sons of planters.  As regards the Irish in other countries, the Senator has said that some Gaels from England told him that they were against Great Britain in this war.  That may be, but I will say that the vast majority of Irishmen in every country in the Commonwealth and a considerable majority in America are decidedly on the side of Great Britain and her allies.</P>

      <P>I lived for six years in America, and spent two weeks there this summer, and I was absolutely astounded by the change I found in the attitude towards the British.  I met a number of Irish people who had subscribed heavily for years to the Irish cause in the old days.  There was not a single one amongst those Irish who were not ardent for the cause of Great Britain in the war; nor did that apply only to rich people capable of giving big subscriptions.  One of the first people I spoke to was a man from Clonmel, a porter in the hotel, and his feelings were the same.  I found that everywhere, and learned the same thing from others I spoke to who had moved about among the Irish people, while I was in America.  The Senator is very misinformed if he does not realise that there has been a profound change in the sentiment towards Great Britain of the majority of the Irish people in the United States, because of the issues they see at stake in this struggle.  The motion goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Consequently, the Press censorship ought not to exclude matter from publication except upon one or more of the following grounds:</P>
      <P>(a)  disclosure of military secrets;</P>
      <P>(b)  treason, sedition, or incitement to disobey the law;</P>
      <P>(c)  violence and intemperance of language tending to excite civil commotion or provoke external attack;</P>
      <P>(d)  dissemination of unfounded rumours, likely to produce disaffection or panic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible that these categories could be usefully supplemented, but the Minister has not sought to supplement them.  At any rate, they are wider, and they cover a good deal more, and give the Minister a good deal more latitude and discretion, than the general principles he quoted here to-night in referring to a speech which he had made in the Dáil.  After all, they are not so <Col N="382" /> bad, and I do not think they deserve the imputations which have been made against them of being utterly reckless and tying the Minister's hand to an intolerable degree.  They do represent an honest effort to suggest something which might be workable.</P>
    <P>Apart from what I regard as the negligible and unmeaning suggestions of Senator Mac Fhionnlaoich, no attempt has been made to improve upon those categories.  Therefore, I propose to stand by them, always bearing in mind, at the same time, that I am in favour of a committee being set up to whom complaints could be brought&mdash;such a committee as Senator Douglas has again supported this evening&mdash;to whom complaints could be brought and with whom the Minister could, in a friendly manner, discuss outstanding problems and difficulties raised by the newspapers.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this motion deserves support, even from those who believe that these categories are in themselves insufficient, as the most important part of the motion is perhaps contained in the first two paragraphs, and I am not so confident as some are that these paragraphs are accepted at heart by the members of the Minister's Party. I would like to be sure that they were. If the general spirit of the motion has the assent of Senators who are inclined to think that the categories are insufficient as they stand or are even inclined to think that it would be better to dispense with categories and to have a committee whom the Minister could occasionally consult, I suggest that, on general principles, it would be wise for them to support this motion rather than give the Minister a clean sheet and enable him to go away saying that the Seanad had decided that all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds, so far as censorship is concerned.</P>
