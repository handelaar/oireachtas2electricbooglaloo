      <P>As will be seen from the Order Paper there are two reasoned amendments tabled for the Second Stage of this Bill.  I propose to follow the usual practice in cases where that has previously occurred.</P>
      <P>When the Minister has concluded his opening statement on the Bill, I will call upon Senator Hayes to move amendment No. 1, and after that has been seconded, I will call upon Senator Foran to move amendment No. 2.</P>
      <P>The debate on the motion and the amendments will then proceed and when it has been concluded I will put the question in the customary form, namely: &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted, stand.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the question is decided in the affirmative the fate of the two amendments will thereby have been decided; if in the negative, I will then put questions on the amendments, taking first Senator Hayes's amendment.  That is the usual practice in such cases.</P>

      <P>As members of the House possibly know, a great number of bodies of divergent characteristics fall within the classification, &ldquo;trade union&rdquo;.  Some of these, notwithstanding their name, have very little to do with the fixing of wages or conditions of employment.  Some of them, in fact, concern themselves merely with regulating the conditions under which their members may trade.  This <Col N="2258" /> Bill deals with that particular type of trade union which is concerned with the fixing of wages and the settlement of conditions of employment.  It applies to these trade unions irrespective of whether their membership is confined to the employing class or whether it consists of those who are engaged as employees.</P>
      <P>I think it is desirable that that point should be stressed, so that we shall not be told that this measure is a class measure or be alleged that it discriminates as between one class of those who are engaged in industry and another.  The Bill is really a very simple measure.  It deals in a straightforward way with a very tangled situation.  I suppose it is not necessary for me to remind the Seanad of the very powerful and, I might almost say, dominating place which the trade union movement has come to occupy in our industrial life. If not to-day, at least yesterday, it could be said that a trade union could do what no Government would dare to do, and that is to paralyse one of the essential services of the State.  We have, in fact, in our own day seen the transport system of the country brought to a standstill by the action of a trade union, acting, presumably, in defence of the interests of its members, but, in defending the interests of its members, undoubtedly inflicting hardship and inconvenience upon the general body of the community.  I am not, because I do remind the House that a trade union has been so powerful and has felt called upon to exercise its power to that extent, to be taken as passing judgment upon the wisdom or the justice of that action.  I am merely citing it to demonstrate the powerful place which the trade union movement does occupy in the life of our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, it has happened that on occasions there has been a dislocation of industry&mdash;not, perhaps, so widespread as that to which I have referred&mdash;which has been received, not because such dislocation was necessary in order to improve the position of those who were employed in a certain industry, but because there was a certain difference of opinion among the <Col N="2259" /> employees in that industry as to what trade union had the right to organise workers therein.  In fact, these disputes have persisted for a long time, have occasionally been fought out with the utmost bitterness, and have been much more numerous than the general body of the public might be inclined to believe.  It is likewise an undoubted fact that the existence of these disputes has been deplored by all responsible trade unionists.  For a considerable number of years&mdash;for more than 20 years, as I shall submit evidence to prove&mdash;responsible leaders of the trade union movement have been trying to find means to obviate these inter-union differences which, as I have said, have manifested themselves on occasions in a general dislocation of our industry.  They have not succeeded in that endeavour but I think I would be justified in saying this: that they are agreed that one of the prime causes of this inter-union bitterness and this internecine strife within the trade union movement is the facility with which trade unions may be formed.</P>
    <P>Under our law, any seven individuals who comply with certain simple conditions, who draw up suitable rules, have a registered office and purport to follow statutory objects, can register as a trade union and, once being registered and desirous of organising workers in a certain industry, can at once go out to compete for members and, if the competition becomes keen enough, can, as I have said, wreak havoc on the industrial economy of the country.  This position, in my opinion, has engendered great abuses in the trade union movement.  That, I think, is a fact that cannot be denied.  As I have already mentioned, it has been openly admitted by responsible leaders of the movement, not merely to-day or yesterday, but more than 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>Now, the present Bill has been the subject of some heated controversy recently, and the whole question of trade union amalgamation and rationalisation, which the Bill seeks to achieve, was discussed at the Trade Union Congress at Drogheda, a few weeks ago, in a temper which was far <Col N="2260" /> from rational and with an approach to this problem which was far from deliberative.  We had, indeed, perfervid heresy-hunting at that congress, and it seemed to me that it was used as an opportunity to vindicate old personal spleens and to secure petty personal gains in a manner which, if I might say so&mdash;as a person who, though outside the movement, is very much concerned for its welfare&mdash;has brought no credit to labour organisations in this country.  But what really struck me about that congress was that it was merely a repetition of the proceedings which took place at the 25th Annual Meeting of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress as it then was, which was held in Drogheda in August of 1919, more than 22 years ago.  At that meeting, this question of the rationalisation of our trade union movement was the main question on the agenda.  At that meeting there was considered a memorandum respecting amalgamation, which opened with these words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are something like 700,000 adult wage earners in Ireland&mdash; potential trade unionists.  At present, from 250,000 to 300,000 are organised, and about 220,000 are associated, through their unions, with the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress.  They are members of about 70 different societies, many of these catering for the same craft or occupation.  Several of these societies are small local bodies, weak in bargaining power or compelling force, and there is no good reason for their continued existence as separate organisations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At that congress a motion was adopted by, I think, 131 votes to 50, asking the National Executive of the Irish Trade Union Congress to consider this question of the reorganisation of the Irish trade union movement, as something which was long overdue, in the interests of the Irish workers. I shall show that, in the 22 years which have passed since then, many attempts have been made by the trade union movement of itself to deal with this problem and they have all failed, as I believe every other attempt made by <Col N="2261" /> that movement is bound to fail for reasons to which I shall refer later.</P>
    <P>It is interesting, in view of the discussion which has taken place on this Bill, to read what was said then in support of the motion.  The mover of the motion, the late Mr. O'Lehane of the Irish Drapers' Assistants' Association, said this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In dealing with this problem of reorganisation they (that is to say the trade union movement as a whole) would be up against old-standing institutions, machinery and vested interests.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here am I trying to deal with that problem and I can only think of Mr. O'Lehane as an inspired prophet because the great obstacle in the way of this endeavour to secure the rationalisation of the Irish trade union movement is to be found in these old-standing institutions, machinery and vested interests.</P>
    <P>Then we had Mr. Johnson, a former member of this House, a former Leader of the Labour Party in the Dáil and, at that time, Treasurer of the Irish Trade Union Congress.  He stated that,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;he did not disagree with Mr. O'Lehane's resolution but they had before them a concrete suggestion of a line of policy, and this would enable them to discuss their aspiration with something tangible in their minds.  He thought it desirable that, in any scheme of amalgamation or federation, they should think, not merely of the moment,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;not of these old-standing institutions, machinery and vested interests, which were blocking the way then as they are to-day&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;or of strengthening the trade union movement for aggressive or defensive action in the immediate future; but they should have in mind a line of development which would prepare the working-class movement in Ireland for the possibilities of the more distant future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he went on to say in the course of his speech:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2262" />&ldquo;Now, the suggestion in this scheme of amalgamation was that those unions directly associated with the building trades, with the engineering trades, and with the distributing trades should be brought together and federated nationally and locally, and that these unions should appoint an executive or council which should take charge of the wider and bigger movements connected with that industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I might say that I anticipate that, if this Bill is passed by the Oireachtas and becomes law, one of the results flowing from it will be the federation within each industry of these smaller organisations which are now competing with one another for membership of the industry and which now fight bitterly amongst themselves for the allocation of employment within the industry amongst their members.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House reacts also in some degree upon these trade union organisations which, though long established in this country, are not in any way registered under our law or which, I think I may say, do not come within the ambit of the laws of this country. In regard to these particular unions Mr. Johnson had to say this much 22 years ago:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They knew that the financial control of some unions was across the water and of other unions in this country, and if they were going to wait until they got one single financial control, they would have to wait too long before they got far on the road to these ideals.  The Miners' Federation of Great Britain was not yet the power that it would be in the future.  It was not yet the one big union of the mining industry, but it had considerable power and tremendous weight in the mining industry, and this scheme, if adopted, will deal with the various industries in Ireland as the Miners' Federation is doing for the mining industry of Great Britain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He gave illustrations, but said that &ldquo;there was not much need for him to go into detail because the scheme he had in mind was outlined as succinctly as he could do it in the memorandum <Col N="2263" /> that was before them.  But he wanted to say that it was only on these lines, in his opinion, they could prepare the organisation of labour in Ireland to undertake the duties that would be incumbent on the organised workers in future if their hopes were at any time to be realised&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Mr. J.J. Hughes followed Mr. Johnson and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The average Irish worker must recognise that his interests lay in close co-operation with his fellow Irish workers and the desired end could only be achieved by amalgamation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Mr. Duffy of Cork declared:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The danger he saw at present was that the fight of the trade union movement might be diverted from a fight against employers to a fight amongst the unions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There have been occasions in this country when the apprehensions of Mr. Duffy of Cork at Drogheda 22 years ago have been well on the way towards realisation, when, in fact, we have almost had in the trade union movement of this country what might be described as civil war.  Mr. Duffy went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Johnson had mentioned that one of the difficulties in the way of the one big union was the officials of the unions.  He (Mr. Duffy) suggested that if this was the only difficulty they should superannuate the officials.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then we had Mr. Cathal O'Shannon, a one-time Labour representative in the Dáil, a very important, and I am glad to say, an influential leader in the Labour movement to-day.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They had been talking of amalgamation for years.  He agreed that amalgamation must come through the action of the rank and file rather than through Congress and the National Executive, to encourage the movement towards amalgamation. He did not want to see two unions affiliated fighting each other as in County Meath.  He wanted to see them all in one organisation but he <Col N="2264" /> thought they must proceed by stages.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then we had Mr. Comber, of the Irish National Painters, who said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There was a great deal of talk about moral and financial support but the majority of the unions were not able to give moral or financial support when they were wanted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Comber might have said that, because they are so small it is impossible for the unions in question to maintain an efficient organisation or to build up finances which would enable them to discharge their duties to their members effectively.  But, perhaps, Mr. Comber had other grounds upon which he based his view that the majority of the unions were not able to give moral or financial support when they were wanted because he went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Because the morals and the finances were in the hands of cross-Channel executives.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Comber even then knew that these cross-Channel executives, as I showed in the discussion on this Bill elsewhere, can, when it suits them, send over their big guns to destroy any attempt on the part of the Irish trade union movement to reorganise itself.  He, perhaps, put the issue more succinctly and tersely than I did.  Then we had Mr. Foran.  He stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He would content himself by pointing out the failure of the present system of organisation, leaving it to delegates and unions in general to consider how long they would tolerate the present methods and the present machinery in the trade union movement.  The previous day they had a very perfect illustration of the inadequacy of the present methods in Limerick.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then we had the late Mr. MacPartlin, well known, I think, to many of us, and whose early demise was a great loss to the Irish trade union movement, who said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He protested against the reflections cast upon the cross-Channel unions.  Somebody had referred to the tin-gods of the small unions. These little gods, they met in the <Col N="2265" /> front rooms of the publichouses. They were no use to the trade union movement&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Following him we had Mr. Redmond of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers who said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While they were talking on the question of amalgamation, the engineering unions had been working. Within the next few months those trades would be embraced in one big union which would not be called the Amalgamated Society of Engineers.  The name would be The Engineering Trades Union&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Then came the then national secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen in Ireland, Mr. Bermingham, who stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the course of a very short time they would have an executive council in Ireland on behalf of the railwaymen of this country.  His advice was for them to put their heads together to amalgamate themselves into one powerful union, whatever they might call that union.  There was greater trouble with the officials of small unions on this question than with the rank and file.  But as long as members had the right of control &mdash;as they had&mdash;their organisations must not be controlled by officials.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this Bill which in any way detracts from the control of the ordinary rank and file of an Irish trade union over the affairs of the union or over the officers of the union. Mr. Bermingham was followed by another railwayman, Mr. Luke Larkin, who stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the south of Ireland there were unhappily to-day too many small organisations.  In some small towns and cities they would find two or three organisations catering for clerical workers.  As to the question of officials, he agreed with some of the delegates who had spoken that officialdom greatly barred the way as far as the rank and file were concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Next was Mr. Harte, then of the National Union of Dockers, now, I think, of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union, who stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2266" />&ldquo;Labour must not be allowed to become disorganised.  He mentioned a number of unions in the south of Ireland catering for the same class of work and called it a most ridiculous state of affairs.  Irish labour must take up the question and his union was prepared to allow its members to decide their future policy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are some extracts, as I have pointed out, from the speeches which were delivered at the 25th Annual Meeting of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress, held in Drogheda in August, 1919, 22 years ago, in support of this resolution asking the National Executive of the Irish Trade Union Congress to consider this question of amalgamation and trade union rationalisation.  I could go on, if I did not think it would be unfair to try so hardly the patience of the House, to quote from the proceedings of subsequent congresses which have taken place since then.  The congress, for instance, of 1921, because of the fact that the National Executive of the Trade Union Congress had not found a way of dealing with this question of inter-union rivalry and inter-union competition for members, was concerned very largely with a dispute between a big Irish union and a big English union catering for the general workers.  As it is perhaps indicative of the bitterness which then characterised, and I am afraid still characterises, disputes of this kind, I ought to read an extract from a speech which was delivered at that congress:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I confess I have taken some men into a certain union.  If men come along driving motor vehicles in our district they must belong to some union.  Our friend has been telling us of some intolerance in Galway. I visited some of the workers in Galway.  I was in the town ten days. Our friend was in the town at the same time.  I was visited by the Crown Forces, hauled out of bed and asked my name.  I gave it and said I was the secretary of my union. I was taken out of the house and brought to the canal side, and only I had an English accent and that the man in charge was English, I would <Col N="2267" /> have been shot.  The sergeant of police said publicly to several men that the attack on me was due to jealousy between two unions.  He went further and said that men had gone to the barracks and reported I was in the town.  I don't know whether that was an instance of a certain union hitting back&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I just quoted that passage because it is indicative, as I have said, of the bitterness which has been bred inside the trade union movement by this inter-union competition and jealousy. And the bitterness which existed then has not been diminished by the passage of time, the only thing being that the protagonists in 1921 seem to have changed their ground a little, and now it is an Irish union which is being accused by other unions of being responsible for a measure which is regarded as detrimental to the interests of those associated with these other unions.  I should like, since I have mentioned that point, to make it quite clear that there is nobody directly responsible for this measure except the Minister and the Government; that this measure is not the result of any collusion or of any negotiations between any section of trade unionists in this country.  It is a measure which has been introduced by the Government because it is believed to be in the interests of the Irish people as a whole.</P>
    <P>In 1935 this question of inter-union rivalry had become so acute that the Trade Union Congress set up a special commission to deal with the matter and in referring to its action in setting up that commission the Trade Union Congress in its 42nd Annual Report stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the report of the national executive last year mention was made of the necessity for co-ordinating the various activities of the unions as far as possible.  As the year developed, inter-union disputes and rivalries reached a climax when several unions' differences became acute and strikes over lines of demarcation developed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mark that, strikes not to improve the condition of the workers in general, not to secure higher wages for them, not <Col N="2268" /> to secure better conditions of employment, but strikes precipitated because one section of workers stated that another section of workers &ldquo;will not be permitted to do that job and, if they are permitted to do that job, we shall walk out and close down the whole industry.&rdquo; I think Senators will agree with me that, in the times which this country is facing, we cannot allow that sort of thing to take place any longer if there is anything we can do which will remove the causes of these demarcation disputes.  I believe that they can be very largely removed if we can bring about an amalgamation of the unions within one industry, because then those disputes about demarcation will have to be settled at the council table of the amalgamated union, and they will not have to be fought out, and will not be permitted to be fought out, in the workshop.  The report went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;So numerous were these union feuds becoming, and calculated as they were to gravely prejudice the whole trade union position, that the National Executive considered it advisable to call into conference all the unions and to lay the position before them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The conference had before it a resolution which was passed unanimously. As we were reminded recently, we are great for resoluting.  The resolution reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That this conference directs the National Executive to forthwith set up a commission to inquire and report on the terms of reference submitted to the unions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The terms of reference <i>inter alia</i> were:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  the amalgamation or grouping of unions analogous to or associated with one another within specific industries or occupations....</P>
    <P>... (2) (b) to set up machinery of a permanent arbitral character to decide on industrial demarcation and other inter-union disputes.</P>
    <P>The Commission set up to act upon these terms of reference was unquestionably representative of the Irish trade union movement as a whole.  It included Senator Seán Campbell, Mr. Samuel Kyle, Mr. J.T. O'Farrell, Mr. <Col N="2269" /> William O'Brien, of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, Mr. William Norton, T.D., Post Office Workers, Mr. Cullen, of the Irish Bakers' Union and a number of other representatives of the trade unions.  It was set up on the 25th April, 1936, and on November 11th, 1938.  An interim report was submitted by it to the Trade Union Congress of 1939.  That report was considered by a Special Conference held I think in February, 1939&mdash;I speak subject to correction. The report consisted of three memoranda.  Memorandum No. 1 had the support, I think, of all the members&mdash;perhaps only in their individual capacity&mdash;who might be described as belonging to Irish unions, and in the course of that memorandum which, for convenience of reference, I shall describe as the Irish memorandum we have this preparatory statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At the outset it must be realised that the complete implementation of item (1) of the terms of reference means largely recasting the whole trade union movement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The term of reference thus referred to was to consider the question of amalgamation.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...That some recasting is desirable cannot be doubted.  A more modern and more compact trade union movement is necessary all will agree.  To attain that necessary and desirable end there is a large number of technical difficulties to be surmounted, which could be done with time and good will....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Something more, however, than time and good-will was wanted.  There was some impelling cause wanted&mdash;something which would compel the movement to direct itself to a solution of this problem.  It is my belief that unless you have that impelling cause the Irish trade union movement will never be able to attempt that re-casting which all admit to be necessary.  We are, by means of this Bill, providing that cause, and we are not going any further than that.</P>
    <P>Memorandum No. 1 went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Craft or trade union pride and rivalries tend to keep alive animosities, <Col N="2270" /> which militate against comradeship and association.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We heard the same thing at Drogheda 22 years ago.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...Trade union pride and rivalries tend to keep alive trade animosities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I have shown they were very much alive at the Mansion House in Dublin in 1921.  The same rivalries exist to-day. The memorandum went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The difficulties which arise under these several heads are fairly numerous.  If they are to be surmounted it will require, firstly, an expression of intention by all concerned to have a more up-to-date movement.  Some sacrifice from the various unions all round will be necessary to achieve success....</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Furthermore, it must be remembered that the internecine quarrelling of the trade unions weakens them, not alone physically but it also vitiates them morally.  This great evil can never be eradicated while the organic existence of the trade unions is confined to and dictated by the accidental divisions of trade, commerce, or occupation.  Neither can legislative interference to end these inter-union differences be ignored.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The position of the organised trade union movement, as represented by the Irish Trade Union Congress, cannot be considered satisfactory, either from the point of view of the numbers organised or the manner in which the whole trade union movement is split up into some very small and often opposing unions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise here that these are statements which were accepted and endorsed by responsible members of the trade union movement.  They are not being made by the Minister charged with the duty of putting this Bill through this House. They are the considered judgment upon the Irish trade union movement of those who have risen by their personal capacity, talents and ability to responsible positions inside that movement. It is the Irish trade union movement <Col N="2271" /> judging itself.  The memorandum finally concludes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...The elimination of inter-union disputes, if nothing else were secured, will bring relief to all concerned. Such disputes do a tremendous disservice to trade unionism and militate against that progress which should now be manifesting itself in the movement.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is also claimed the saving in financial resources, where over-lapping and duplication have been abolished, will be considerable, which would enable the unions to embark on social, political and literary activities.  To-day, such activities can only be talked about and not fulfilled because of competition and decentralisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This memorandum was not accepted by all the members of the commission. A second memorandum was put in by another group who said they put it in on behalf of their unions.  These were all unions which are not registered inside this country but are registered under the laws of Great Britain.  They say that in their opinion the proposals in memorandum No. 1, signed by five of their colleagues, were much too far-reaching, but they also went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the other hand, there are many small unions&mdash;as pointed out in memorandum No. 1&mdash;where it is stated that no fewer than 18 unions affiliated to congress have a membership of less than 500....  We are of opinion that an effort should be made to draw up practical schemes for the merging or amalgamating of these small unions into larger units. The experience gained in this way might prove invaluable in the future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, mark what is contained in this memorandum No. 2.  There is there a frank acceptance of the principle of amalgamation in so far as the smaller unions are concerned; so that, on this question of amalgamation, there was no difference of principle as between memorandum No. 1 and memorandum No. 2.  There was merely a difference as to the degree to which that principle <Col N="2272" /> should operate.  Then we had a third memorandum&mdash;one submitted by Deputy Norton, who said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While I ardently support the principle of trade union amalgamation and recognise its efficiency as a weapon of protection to the organised workers, I regret I am unable to subscribe to the recommendations contained in memorandum No. 1....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, we have definite acceptance of the principle of amalgamation and reorganisation. Deputy Norton went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would welcome a reorganisation of the unions with a view to avoiding the wasteful overlapping and baneful jealousy and rivalry which exist to-day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">

      <P>Would the Minister complete the sentence there?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  He continued:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;But I fear only disaster if an effort is made to attempt a large-scale grouping of unions before the necessary psychological atmosphere has been created.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We are creating the psychological atmosphere in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a bit of a failure in the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if it has been a failure anywhere, it is only because of these vested interests, these overlapping jealousies, these personal rivalries which, according to memorandum No. 1, militate against comradeship and association in the trade union movement.  We cannot be deterred, however, by these personal considerations, from doing what we firmly believe to be essential in the national interest.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton continued:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I would prefer to see the question approached from the standpoint of examining the possibility of effecting grouping of unions in industries <Col N="2273" /> where, owing to the multiplicity of unions and the consequent weakness of organisation due to inter-union strife, the advantages of amalgamation are clearly demonstrable and the necessity for it more readily appreciated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, that is the history of this problem since 1919.  I should say that there is evidence in this report of the Trade Union Congress of 1919 that the gravity of this problem had been recognised many years previously.  The conclusion that we have come to, having carefully examined this problem in all its aspects and in all its developments, is that for 20 long years&mdash;and, indeed, for 20 years before that&mdash;this problem of trade union rivalry has plagued Irish industrial life; and in the changed circumstances which our people must face as the inevitable result of the present war, it cannot be permitted to plague it any longer.  If for no other reason than that, the Irish trade union movement must be rationalised and must be impelled to put its house in order.  I also believe that this must be done with the minimum of interference from the Government and the Legislature.</P>
    <P>It was characteristic of the reports which the Trade Union Congress has had before it from time to time&mdash; though perhaps they were worked out in greater detail in memorandum No. 1 &mdash;that detailed proposals for amalgamation and reorganisation were submitted to the trade union movement.  Memorandum No. 1 proposed, for instance, to merge all the unions into ten industrial groups.  There was to be a building group, an engineering group, a shipbuilding and vehicle-building group, a seamen and dockers' group, a railway and road transport group, a printing group, a bakery workers' group, a distributive, clerical and supervisory group, a teachers' group, a Civil Service group&mdash;to which, perhaps, the Minister for Finance might have objected&mdash;and a general workers' group.  As we have been told by memorandum No. 2 and, indeed, by memorandum No. 3, these proposals were thought by, apparently, the majority of the trade union movement or by a majority of the officials <Col N="2274" /> of the trade union movement, to be much too far-reaching.</P>
    <P>As to whether they were too far-reaching or not, I am not going to decide. I am not a member of the trade union movement.  That is a matter for the trade unionists themselves to decide, but what I think is proven by the three memoranda is that some reorganisation must be undertaken and that there is not an effective cause in existing circumstances to impel the trade union movement to undertake that reorganisation.  We are proposing to do that, and that is all the Bill does. It does not in any way compel the trade union movement to fit itself into a straight waistcoat.  The various unions which will be affected by the proposals in this Bill can come together and discuss amongst themselves the arrangements likely to serve their interests best and the arrangements essential if they are to survive, either as members of a federation or as separate entities inside the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>We think that, in the light of present-day conditions as they exist in this country and as they will exist throughout Europe after this war, we must place some restrictions upon the facility with which trade unions hitherto have been able to organise themselves.  We cannot leave this important question of the organisation of the workers to the whims and fancies of, in some cases, irresponsible persons and, in other cases, of persons who will not submit themselves even to the discipline of the unions.  We cannot, because of the fact that seven men of such a type can get together and launch a trade union, allow the whole industry of this country to be placed in jeopardy by reason of that facility.  Accordingly, what we are now proposing to do is to say that, inside this wide category of unions&mdash;some of whom, as I have shown, do not concern themselves with the fixing of wages or the regulation of conditions of employment&mdash;those who do concern themselves with this very important question will be subject to the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have said that we think the trade union movement must be impelled to <Col N="2275" /> reorganise itself.  We feel also, however that this is a task which should be undertaken with the minimum of governmental interference.  This Bill seeks to ensure that that work will be done by prescribing certain simple conditions which must be fulfilled before a body can become an authorised trade union, that is a trade union authorised to negotiate for the fixing of wages or the regulation of conditions of employment, and entitled, by reason of the fact that it is an authorised trade union, to the special protection of Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Trades Disputes Act, 1906.</P>
    <P>Now, what are those simple conditions? First of all, that the body must be registered as a trade union in this country, or, if not registered as a trade union in this country, that it must be registered as a trade union under the laws of another country.  That provision is made to meet the case of trade unions functioning in this country, and numbering many thousands of Irishmen among their members, which are registered as trade unions under the laws of Great Britain.  Secondly, the body so registered must deposit a sum of money, or the equivalent in approved securities, with the High Court.  That money is not paid as a fee.  It is merely lodged as a deposit.  It can continue to earn interest; if the deposit is made in the form of securities, those securities can naturally continue to earn interest, and the income accruing from them will be paid over to the trade union which makes the deposit. Thirdly, the trade union must make appropriate rules, regulating the entry into membership and the cesser of membership of the union, and maintain here an office and a register of its members.  In the case of the trade unions which are registered outside this country, there are certain further provisions.  They must nominate a person who will sue and can be sued on their behalf.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any person looking at those proposals in an impartial way can for a moment contend that <Col N="2276" /> they are too onerous.  It is no injustice to ask a trade union which has a general fund of perhaps £150,000 or £160,000, and a membership running into 30,000 or 40,000, to deposit £10,000 with our High Courts.  It is no hardship to ask a trade union which may have a general fund of £50,000 or £60,000, with a membership perhaps much less, to make a deposit of £2,000 or £4,000 as the case may be.  For those unions whose membership may be considerable, but which for one reason or another are very poorly off financially, I think it is no hardship either, because, looking back on the history of the Irish trade union movement, looking back on those big organisations which, in many cases, have been built up from small beginnings, and which from the workers' point of view have been no less effective than the more aggressive and bellicose organisations, I cannot help but feel that one of the reasons why certain unions are financially strong is that they have been managed with much more capacity and much more prudence than those unions which are not in that fortunate position. I think that, if it becomes an essential condition for the survival of a union that this deposit shall be maintained in the High Courts, the members of each union will scrutinise much more carefully and more meticulously the general management of this union, and that, as a secondary consequence of this proposal, we shall have a general improvement in the administration of the various organisations which make up the Irish trade union movement.</P>
    <P>There is one thing which I think undeniably this requirement of a deposit will do, and that is it will stop the formation of breakaway unions.  At the present time, as I have indicated, and under the law as it exists at the present day, if an official becomes disgruntled, or if a body of members become disgruntled because, say, the union does not decide to call a strike simply because one or two members have acted unjustifiably in regard to their employer or in regard to their fellow workers, those disgruntled members, if they wish, can break away <Col N="2277" /> from the union, and, if they are able to influence enough of their colleagues to follow them, form a new union.  The moment they form a new union they have got to show that they are going to be the fighting force in the Irish trade union movement, and they have got to go out and look for trouble and make trouble if they cannot find it in order that they may vindicate their action in breaking away from the union.  That has been, as we know, one of the most fruitful causes of the disputes which have disturbed Irish industry over the years past.  Or again, if disciplinary action is taken against an official of the union, he can get his group around him and go off in the same way and form his independent and fighting union.  He has to justify his secession; he has to show that he is a fighting force; he has to attract to his organisation all the soreheads and all the unruly and undisciplined members he can find in the permanent organisation; he has always to vindicate himself and his own personal spleen as against the officials of the union which took disciplinary action against him.</P>
    <P>As I have said, one of the consequences of this condition which prescribes that a deposit must be made with the High Courts before a union can become an authorised trade union will be to prevent the formation of those breakaway unions.  I am aware, of course, that this provision may occasion inconvenience to existing unions, craft unions and the like, which have been perhaps long established, which are very small and which have not had occasion to build up a large fighting fund because they have very seldom been embroiled in a trades dispute. In relation to those, the Minister for Industry and Commerce will have power under sub-section (6) of Section 6 to except such trade unions from this general condition, and I in that capacity shall be prepared to consider applications for exceptions in special cases from long established unions.  But I should like to say this, that the privileges reserved under Section 11 to authorised trade unions will be jealously reserved to such trade unions, and I shall not permit those provisions to be used for <Col N="2278" /> the encouragement of house or group unions, because what we want is peace under reasonable conditions in Irish industry, and I do not think that the formation of house or group unions would conduce to that peace.  I think, on the contrary, that their formation would be very bitterly resented by the regular trade unions.  Accordingly, in order to ensure that no cause for this resentment will be given, I want to make it quite clear that the special protection of Section 11 will be reserved to authorised trade unions.</P>
    <P>I should like to say also that the power of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to grant exceptions under sub-section (6) of Section 6 will not be readily resorted to and that these exceptions will not be readily granted, nor will they be granted in perpetuity. They will be given in the majority of cases to afford time to the unions concerned to adapt themselves to the new situation.  We are determined to ensure that the Irish trade union movement will address itself seriously to this problem of rationalisation.  So that Irish industry shall no longer be made the battlefield for these inter-union wars, we want in this country a trade union movement that is not only jealous of its rights but zealous of its duties to its members and to our common country.  We cannot believe that these conditions will be brought about so long as the present causes of dissension and bitterness in competition exist.</P>
    <P>Another thing which the Bill will do will be to end the anomalous position in which the Irish trade union movement is at present.  At the present moment certain of these trade unions, Irish trade unions, are registered here. Certain others, I understand, which are Irish trade unions also, are not registered here.  Then we have other unions, British in this case, which are recorded here and which have been recorded in this country since before 1922.  Other trade unions, British unions likewise, are neither registered here nor recorded.  Though unknown to, and outside our laws, these unions could, with the adherence of their Irish members, paralyse, as I have <Col N="2279" /> already pointed out, perhaps one of our principal industries and occasion inconvenience and grave injury to a large section of our people.  I think everyone of us, irrespective of whether we are immediately engaged in the Irish trade union movement or not, irrespective of whether we are members of an English trade union organisation or not, will agree with me that that is a position which is a complete anomaly in the circumstances in the Twenty-Six Counties, at any rate, as they exist to-day.  It is an anomaly that we should have large bodies of individuals formed in organisations which are, some of them, completely outside the ambit of our laws and which are not amenable to our laws in any way, but which, because I think the members of even these organisations are fully protected by the Trades Disputes Act of 1906, could, as I have pointed out, paralyse our transport system or some other of our essential industries.  Yet as the law stands at present, they are not recognised by our law at all except, in a doubtful and dubious way, such of them as happen to have been recorded here prior to 1922.  We feel that it is time to end that position.  It will be ended by Section 13 of the Bill which compels these unions to set up an office  to furnish us with their rules and to maintain a register of their members here.</P>

There was a suggestion at one time that some of these amalgamated unions regarded Ireland as very much in the position of the dog upon which to try a doubtful expedient and that when, say, a railway strike <Col N="2280" /> was contemplated, thought it as well to try it out in Ireland first and see what might be the consequences.  In any event, the position is that we cannot afford to have large bodies of Irishmen organised in an organisation which has its headquarters outside this country and which gives no recognition to our laws.</P>

      <P>I do not think I overstate it.  Part III of this Bill concerns itself with the establishment of what is known as a trade union tribunal which we hope, at any rate, will do something to assuage and to remove the causes of this inter-union rivalry by permitting a trade union and only a trade union to go to the tribunal and to secure from the tribunal, if the tribunal thinks it wise in the public interest to give it, a determination which will ensure that the organisation of workers in a particular field will be reserved to that particular trade union.  Unlike the proposal to bring about the amalgamation of the existing trade unions, this is a proposal made, originally in memorandum No. 1, which secured the unanimous support of the whole commission of inquiry appointed by the Irish Trade Union Congress.  It is true that the tribunal which was suggested in memorandum No. 1 went very much further and concerned itself with many other matters than our tribunal proposes to do because this trade union tribunal was in fact, I think, to regulate the exercise of the right to strike and, accordingly, to impose limitations upon the exercise of that right by the component organisations within the trade union movement.</P>
      <P>However, the only function of the tribunal with which this Bill is concerned is function (i).  Having recommended that the national executive of the trade union organisation should set up an industrial court, it goes on to recommend that the court may decide that on and from a given date particular groups of workers in concerns where competition between unions exists shall be recruited (as far as new members are concerned) only by a particular union or unions, always having regard to the ability of the selected union or unions to cater effectively for the workers involved.  This proposal to set up a tribunal with this as one of its functions was endorsed by those who signed memorandum No. 2, where they say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;With the proposals contained in memorandum No. 1 covering items (2), (3) and (4) we are largely in agreement, but we are concerned about the suggestion contained in <Col N="2282" /> memorandum No. 1 as to the implementation of item (5) in the terms of reference&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This Bill has nothing to do with item (5), but it is very much concerned with item (2) to the extent that it does propose to set up a trade union tribunal which will reserve, on application and, when it thinks it wise in the public interest to do so, the right to one or more unions to organise persons engaged in a particular line of industry. Deputy Norton, in memorandum No. 3, was perhaps even more emphatic in regard to this proposal to set up an industrial court to deal with inter-union disputes.  He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With the recommendations on the subject of the establishment of machinery for the settlement of inter-union disputes I am in general agreement.  These disputes, where they result in strikes in which wages and working conditions are not at issue, do serious damage to the trade union movement....&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton, having said that these disputes, where they result in strikes in which wages and working conditions are not at issue, do serious damage to the trade union movement, went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... and tend to create an atmosphere for the regulation and regimentation of trade unions which appears to be the object of the present Government.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not accepting Deputy Norton's suggestion that it has been the object of the present Government to regulate or regiment the trade union movement, but, when it sees within the trade union movement evils which are universally admitted to exist, and when <Col N="2283" /> it is clear that the movement has shown itself signally unable to remedy these evils, then I think it is the duty of the Government, in the general interests of the community, to step in and provide the machinery which will, I hope, at any rate, obviate many of these evils.</P>
    <P>That is what we seek to do by this trade union tribunal.  The constitution of the tribunal is outlined in Sections 20 to 26 of the Bill.  I think it is as suitable a tribunal as could be devised for the purpose.  It is, in fact, very largely an adaptation of an amendment put down by the representatives of labour in the Dáil.  Unfortunately, it was not moved there, but I, having recast it, inserted it in the Bill on the Report Stage.  The tribunal is to consist of five members, the chairman being a lawyer of ten years' standing.  With him are associated four ordinary members, two of them to be appointed by the Minister from a panel of persons nominated by those authorised trade unions which represent the workers and by the organisation or organisations which might be taken as representing the general body of such authorised trade unions.  The remaining two are to be nominated by authorised trade unions which represent employers or by organisations which represent industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>Authorised trade unions which feel that it would be in the public interest that the organisation of persons engaged in a particular industry should be reserved solely to them, or to them and one other or more named trade unions, can apply to this tribunal for a determination giving them that right. Applications will only be considered from workers' trade unions in relation to the organisation of workers in a particular industry and from trade unions representing employers in relation to the organisation of employers in a particular industry.  If the application is made by a workers' trade union for the right to organise workers in an industry, then the tribunal, in session, will consist of the chairman and the two members appointed by the Minister from the panel nominated by <Col N="2284" /> the authorised trade unions representing the workers.  If, on the other hand, the application is from an employers' trade union to organise the employers in an industry, the two ordinary members in that case will consist, not of the two members appointed from the workers' panel, but of the two members appointed from the employers' panel.</P>
    <P>In dealing with these applications, the tribunal must consider all the circumstances of the case and shall then, as they consider proper in the public interest, either grant or refuse to grant the determination or determine that two or more specified trade unions alone shall have the right to organise workmen of that particular class.  It is further provided that the tribunal shall not grant a determination under this section that a trade union registered under the law of another country and having its headquarters controlled in that country, or that two or more such trade unions, shall have the right to organise workmen of any particular class.  Furthermore, before granting a determination that a particular trade union shall have the right to organise workmen of a particular class, the tribunal may, if it thinks proper, require the trade union to satisfy them that the granting of such a determination will not affect adversely any rights or claims to benefits enjoyed for the time being by such workmen as members of a trade union.  There is a further provision safeguarding the rights of officers of a trade union who may lose their employment in consequence of such determination.  I should mention here, with regard to Section 25, that I propose to ask the House to accept an amendment which will impose the same restrictions upon the tribunal in relation to an organisation of masters as it imposes in case of workers in case an application is made by a trade union having its headquarters control outside this country.</P>
    <P>I notice that there are two amendments on the Order Paper with regard to the motion to give this Bill a Second Reading and in relation to them I should like to say a word or two, if I am not wearying the House unduly. <Col N="2285" /> The first of these amendments asks the Seanad to decline to give a Second Reading to the Bill until provision has been made for a permanent court with power to make compulsory investigation into industrial disputes and to promulgate advisory judgments.  I do not know whether Senator Hayes, who proposes to move that amendment, is aware of the provisions of the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, because Part II of that Act provides for the establishment of courts of inquiry, and, in many cases, such courts have been set up here.  These courts are, of course, set up only&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;<i>ad hoc.</i>  Part I of the 1919 Act does provide for a permanent industrial court, but with this limitation, that such a court can only function when the parties to a trade dispute are agreed that it should so function and, accordingly, as there has sometimes been difficulty in getting agreement to refer a dispute to a court of this kind, it has been felt that there would not be any useful purpose served in establishing it as a permanent organisation here.  As against this, there have been occasions when the matter having been of sufficient importance, an industrial court has been set up <i>ad hoc</i>, with power to summon witnesses, to take evidence on oath and to make advisory findings.  Hitherto this machinery has been as effective, I think, as any permanent machinery of the kind is likely to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have never had insuperable difficulties in getting a suitable personnel for the court, but it is one thing to set up a court of this sort <i>ad hoc</i>, where everybody realises that a peaceful solution of a dispute should be found and is prepared to submit that dispute to the arbitration of a third party, and quite another to go further and to insist that all disputes will be investigated by a court of that sort and that that court will issue advisory findings in relation to all these disputes. It is quite obvious, in my view, at least, that it would leave the organs of the State and the laws of the land open to ridicule if we were to set up a <Col N="2286" /> body to investigate every trade dispute and to issue findings which in some cases might not be accepted by one or other of the parties to the dispute on the ground that the dispute was referred to this tribunal without their consent.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if that were to become the general rule&mdash;and we have no assurance that it might not become the general rule, if we were to set up a tribunal of this sort before there was a general demand for it on the part of all those interests engaged in industry&mdash;then I think that so far from there being any improvement in the present condition of affairs we should only find ourselves in a worse case.  If we were to set up this body before it was acceptable to all the interests concerned and if, in consequence of the fact that these were compelled to go before a tribunal of this sort, the advisory judgments, as they are called, but which, because they would be supposed to reflect public opinion would be, if not binding upon the parties involved, coercive upon them, were to be disregarded frequently, and perhaps even generally, then I think that the Ministers administering the laws of the State would be put in a ridiculous position, and one in which they could not afford to remain.  Obviously, the motion as it stands does not propose to provide any sanctions against those who would disregard these advisory judgments, so that the Government would have to sit idly by while public opinion was being outraged and while the law and, as I feel, the Administration were being brought into general disrepute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, it endeavours to get the parties together around the council board and to get agreement there by conciliation.  If the dispute is a sufficiently grave matter, it may appoint an industrial court <i>ad hoc</i>, which is in exactly the same position as the permanent body which <Col N="2287" /> Senator Hayes proposes, but which at least has this advantage, that the Minister, before he sets up that court, has, as a rule, some reason to believe &mdash;he may not have a positive assurance but he has an opportunity of forming an opinion as to the frame of mind and the probable approach of the parties engaged in the dispute to a tribunal of this sort&mdash;that such a court would be acceptable.  He is consequently in a position to form what would be a reasonably sound opinion as to the attitude of the parties to the establishment of an industrial court. But he is deprived of that if you are going to have this industrial court set up as a permanency to which, presumably, every dispute would have to be referred.  If you are only going to refer to it the odd dispute which may be sufficiently grave to warrant it, what is the need for setting it up as a permanency, and what advantage has it over a court set up <i>ad hoc</i>?</P>

      <P>As I was saying, I cannot see that it would have any advantage.  I can see that it might bring about a situation which might inevitably lead to compulsory arbitration. I know there are a lot of people who believe that compulsory arbitration is a very desirable thing: that it has solved all the labour problems in <Col N="2288" /> those countries where it has been introduced, but that, in my view, is a wholly mistaken belief.  So far as I have been able to ascertain, in those countries in which compulsory arbitration has been introduced, which really is what would be the inevitable outcome of the line of policy which Senator Hayes suggests to the Seanad now, it has not resulted in the avoidance or the prevention of strikes and trade disputes&mdash;and of bitter strikes and bitter trade disputes&mdash;with one possible exception which I will deal with later.  I have here extracts from the <i>Labour Gazette</i> of April, 1938, dealing with compulsory arbitration in Australia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it fair, before an amendment which does not deal with compulsory arbitration is moved, to burden the House with extracts from Australian papers about compulsory arbitration?  Surely the Minister should hear the argument first and discuss it afterwards.  It is fantastic to be going to Australia on a matter which is irrelevant to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that the Senator realises as well as I do what would be, as I have said, the inevitable consequences of the line of policy which he has suggested to the Seanad and recommends to the country.  I only want to let him see how that policy has worked out elsewhere. I have already pointed out that where we are dealing with serious issues and where we have agreement between the parties we can set up an arbitration court to consider a trade dispute and to make an advisory judgment. There we have agreement which, in my view, and I think in the view of most, if not all, honourable men including the members of the rank and file of the trade union movement would bind the parties to accept the findings. But if we were to have the machinery which the Senator suggests, there would be no such agreement and, therefore, no binding factor in the situation, good, bad or indifferent. Unless you have a judgment which will be accepted as binding by those to whom it applies, I do not see how the <Col N="2289" /> Senator's amendment is going to work out except this: that, having tried this proposal and it having failed, the next step is to have compulsory arbitration. Now, how has compulsory arbitration worked out elsewhere?  This <i>Labour Gazette</i> of April, 1938, dealing with compulsory arbitration in Australia says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Although a great number of cases reached a peaceful settlement through the arbitration machinery&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>which can be said, by the way, of our existing conciliation machinery</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;the number of strikes and lock-outs that took place in the same period&mdash;1916-1935&mdash;was also great.  The opinion is expressed that the major weaknesses of the Australian arbitration method, which has yet to be satisfactorily corrected, are its tendency to encourage litigation and advocacy which prolongs cases and congests the courts.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That, I think, could be said of this proposal to establish a permanent court to investigate and issue advisory judgments. Then we get this from <i>Conciliation and Arbitration in Industrial Disputes</i>, a review published by the International Labour Office in 1933, dealing with Australia.  The extract is from page 635:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The multiplicity of systems and the kaleidoscopic changes that have taken place year after year make the machinery of conciliation and arbitration in Australia particularly hard to follow.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On page 636 it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The present status of compulsory arbitration in Australia is more or less anomalous.  Very little but criticism is heard of the system actually in force....  Whether on the whole the system has made for a reduction in industrial disputes is a doubtful question.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then, again, take the case of New Zealand.</P>

      <P>But not until I have heard the Senator.  New Zealand is unique in regard to arbitration because, again, according to this publication of the International Labour Office we find that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The attitude of employers and workers towards conciliation and arbitration in New Zealand has varied considerably during the 30 odd years that the system has been in operation.  The adoption of the original Act in 1894 was accompanied by some public feeling....  When in 1896 the Act actually came into force the apathy on the part of the workers and employers disappeared.  The workers supported the Act enthusiastically, while the employers resolutely opposed it, refusing in large part to recognise the Act, neglecting to organise and failing to nominate employer members to the Arbitration Board.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then the attitude of the principals reversed, the workers refused to recognise the arbitration system, but the employers supported it enthusiastically. But, perhaps, what we are concerned about is not the atmosphere in which compulsory arbitration was received in New Zealand, but the results of it.  This is from page 646 of the International Labour Office publication. It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The tables on page 647 show the number of stoppages of work occurring in New Zealand during the last ten years....  From the figures given in the second of these tables it would appear at first sight as if the machinery of conciliation and arbitration was a decided failure.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have told the House that, according to this publication of the International Labour Office, the attitude of employers and workers towards conciliation and arbitration in Australia has varied considerably.  At first, the workers were enthusiastically for it while the employers were against it but then the position changed, because the workers were against it and the employers <Col N="2291" /> were for it.  We have this further development, that, in order to make this compulsory arbitration work in New Zealand it was necessary, in fact, to reserve the right to work to trade unionists and to introduce compulsory trade unionism as well.  This compulsory trade unionism has not operated satisfactorily in New Zealand and, according to the monthly labour review of the United States Department of Labour, it was necessary in July, 1939, to amend the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act of New Zealand in order to ensure the better enforcement of its terms.  Additional penalties were imposed on unions, employers or workers participating in stoppages in contravention of the provisions of the law relating to compulsory arbitration in industrial disputes.  We may gather from this that compulsory arbitration did not stop strikes or trade disputes in New Zealand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the adoption of the 1939 amendment, fines were to be imposed on unions or individuals for taking part in strikes or lock-outs. Administration was hampered, however, owing to the difficulty of collection from large bodies of workers.  In submitting his amendment of the law, the New Zealand Minister of Labour&mdash; a member of the Labour Government in that country&mdash;said that registered unions accepted the principle of compulsory arbitration and could not expect to benefit from the law unless they fulfilled their obligation not to participate in strikes when bound by the terms of the arbitration awards. He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In particular, the workers' unions could not expect to enjoy the advantages of the compulsory arbitration system, including compulsory unionism, unless they respected their obligation not to resort to strikes when bound by the awards of the arbitration courts.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final effect of this beautiful system of compulsory arbitration, which is supposed to prevent strikes and trade disputes, <Col N="2292" /> and its full fruit and flower is to be found in the fact that on October, 1940, the Labour Government found it necessary to forbid all strikes and lock-outs under the terms of an emergency regulation.</P>
    <P>I think I have given enough evidence to show that the proposal adumbrated in amendment No. 1 would not provide that cure for the present situation which, I am sure, Senator Hayes is anxious to secure.  In fact, so far from compulsory arbitration having succeeded in eliminating trade disputes or preventing strikes or lock-outs in Australia or New Zealand, where it has, I think, been longest in force, it has finally resulted in complete deprivation of the right to strike in New Zealand, that deprivation having been effected by a Labour Government in New Zealand.</P>
    <P>There is one country in Europe in which a system such as Senator Hayes proposes has had some success.  That is Sweden.  In Sweden, according to the review of the International Labour Office, which I have already quoted, the system has worked rather better than it has worked in Australia or New Zealand.  It has worked better for this reason&mdash;that the system of conciliation and arbitration in Sweden is based upon the effective organisation of both employers and workers, who have built up a highly developed system of collective agreements.  Mark what has been the fundamental condition&mdash;that there should be effective organisation of both employers and workers.  That was necessary in order to secure industrial peace even to the extent to which it has been secured in Sweden. What is the striking feature of the position in Sweden?  It is that, in fact, employers and workers have come together largely for the purpose of ensuring that disputes will not go to the labour court at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely, but they have been able to do that only because there has been effective organisation on both sides.  The fact that they have decided that they will do anything rather than go to court is, in my view, an indication that they think <Col N="2293" /> that, when they go to the court, their last position is worse than their first and that they are as far from industrial peace as the employers and workers in Australia and New Zealand find themselves when they go to their arbitration courts.  In fact, such industrial peace as there is in Sweden is founded upon the fact not that there is an industrial court but that there is on both sides effective organisation of workers and employers, such effective organisation as this Bill seeks to bring about here. With these organisations, there is not only a feeling of power but there is a sense of responsibility not merely to the members but to the community as a whole.</P>
      <P>The second amendment&mdash;I am sorry to detain the House so long&mdash;asks the House to refuse to give a Second Reading to the Bill</P>
      <P>&ldquo;pending consultations between the Government and the trade unions with a view to the enactment of agreed proposals for the purpose of improving the structure and increasing the effectiveness of the trade union organisation&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can anybody in the light of the history of this problem, as I have put it before the Seanad, see any hope of progress along these lines?  Is it not quite clear that, unless the Government did impose some condition which would compel the trade union movement, as a whole, to address itself to this problem, these negotiations and discussions would end only in futility?  Unless we do impose the monetary qualification prescribed in this Bill, what is there to prevent seven men again going out and forming a trade union?  Even if, as a result of our discussions and negotiations, we were to get the amalgamation of certain weak elements in Irish trade unions, the abolition of redundant trade unions, the prescription of allotted zones of organisational activity and the reservation of trade unions to particular industries, even if we got all this, what assurance would we have that within a short period we would not be faced with the same evils as those with which we are now faced, <Col N="2294" /> unless we can impose some condition which will prevent any seven men going out and forming a trade union?</P>
    <P>How are we, by voluntary agreements and arrangements, going to prevent divisions, dissensions, splits and breakaways in trade unions if it is open to the disgruntled people to go out and start their own organisation afresh? Even if this industrial court, which has been suggested in memorandum No. 1, had been set up, and even if it did reserve to a particular union or particular unions the right to organise any particular industry, if other unions went into that field and competed with those unions, which the industrial court had determined should have the sole right to operate in that industry, how was the trade union movement going to prevent that sort of thing taking place?  They could not impose any fines.  If the interloping or encroaching union was powerful enough, it could snap its fingers at the Trade Union Congress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand the Minister to say that this second amendment provides that there is to be no legislation?  If so, that would alter my attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point that we come back to the same thing in the end.  Without these sanctions, what domestic sanction could the Irish trade union movement enforce against a body which would defy the finding of the trade union court?  We may presume that the encroaching organisation would be a powerful one, that it would have the loyal support of its members, so that if it went in to organise a particular group of industrial workers the membership would stand behind it in doing it, and what remendy then would the trade union congress or the other trade unions affected have?  It could not collect a fine.  It has no legal power to levy a fine upon the offending union and has no power to collect it.  Would it not all come down to this in the end: that, just as at the present time, the dispute would be fought out, not in the trade union congress at all, but in the workshops <Col N="2295" /> and works of the industry in which these rival trade unions were competing? The only way in which, in fact, you can ensure that there will not be this overlapping, this inter-union rivalry, and this defiance of the finding of a court in regard to the right to organise a particular section of industry, is when you set up your court by statute and when that statute provides the necessary sanctions for a violation of the findings of the court&mdash; just as we are doing in this case&mdash;and when you make the trade unions which defy the findings of the court, and the members of these unions, responsible for that defiance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, again, to go back to the point which I made before, if you had your amalgamations by voluntary agreements, how are you going to ensure that they will be permanent, or perhaps I should say how are you going to ensure that they will be at least stable and that you would not have, as I have indicated, a breakaway arising out of personal jealousy or some dissatisfaction with the administration or the action or the policy of those who control the organisation, or of the organisation as a whole?  Once again, when the seceding and dissatisfied parties would break away, how could the dispute between these parties be settled once you allowed the seceders the right to set up a union and go into any industry and proceed to organise the workers there?  How is that issue going to be determined?  What penalties or sanctions could the trade union movement, as a whole, impose upon the seceding organisations?  If these are going to act in defiance of your domestic legislation you cannot do anything; you are powerless to prevent them so acting except in one way, and that is by taking, of yourselves, industrial action against their members by saying that their members will not be permitted to work in an industry which the other unions have organised.  Again, the consequence of that is going to be that the disputes, instead of being settled in the way we think that they can be settled, once you get more or less stable amalgamations, are going to <Col N="2296" /> be fought out in the industrial field to the general loss of the nation and the inconvenience of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>No matter how you approach this problem, I think that there must be three conditions to be fulfilled.  First, you must make it more difficult than it has been heretofore for trade unions, purporting to fix wages and regulate conditions of employment, to be established. Secondly, you must provide machinery which will remedy the existing position and try to remove the main cause of rivalry between the trade unions, which is the competition which exists between them for the recruitment of workers in particular industries or particular concerns. Thirdly, you must make all the trade unions operating in this country recognise the law of this country and conform to the law of this country in the simple way which we provide: that is to say, furnish copies of the rules governing the entry into and cesser of membership, keep a register of membership, have a registered office, and be a law-abiding organisation and not a source of trouble in the State.  That is what is proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that I have detained the House at such length, but unfortunately the tenor of the discussions elsewhere did not permit me to make what, I think, is an unchallengeable case in favour of this Bill, and there has been a great deal of prejudice worked up against it.  I feel that, so far from damaging the trade union movement in this country, the Bill is going to lay the foundations for a highly developed, progressive and responsible trade union movement&mdash; one which, like the trade union movement in Sweden, co-operating with correspondingly strong employers' organisations, will meet and settle by negotiation and conciliation those disputes which, so often, have plagued our industry and have been such a source of loss to the nation as a whole and of inconvenience to our citizens.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Seanad Eireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Trade Union Bill, 1941, until provision has been made for a permanent court with power to make compulsory investigation into industrial disputes and to promulgate advisory judgments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister opened the effective part of his speech&mdash;that is to say, the first half hour&mdash;by saying that this Bill was the subject of heated criticism in the Dáil.  I could not understand, as a member of the public, reading the Dáil debates, why there should have been heat in the Dáil but having listened to the Minister for over two hours now, I am beginning to have a little enlightenment as to why there was heat in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister must have generated most of it.  Apparently because there was heat in the Dáil, he thinks fit to treat us to a long speech, a great part of which has nothing whatever to do either with the Bill or with the amendments on the paper.  He adopted what was the very remarkable procedure of telling us about the amendments before the amendments have been proposed.  The Minister will have the right to reply and, if he had not the right to reply, this House has never at any time in its career since 1922 refused a Minister coming to it the right to intervene twice or even three times if it seemed to be suitable to the debate.  What the Minister has done was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not learn it there, but I could teach a few things to Senator Hogan.  This Bill need not generate any heat at all.  The Minister, himself, in dealing with it, said that the object of the Bill was the creation of peace in industry.  If the object of this Bill is the creation of peace in industry, I want to submit that the Bill is not likely to prove effective.  I do not share the view expressed by a member of the other House and read out by the Minister on my insistence, that the Minister had sinister designs on the trade union movement.  When we were discussing Order No. 83, which restricted increases in wages, I took occasion to say that, although I was against the order, I did not think the Minister was a monster who was trying to grind the face of the poor, but that I thought the order revealed ill-judgment and that it was not going to accomplish what the Minister intended.  I think the same remarks apply to this Bill.  This Bill, without certain accompaniments, does not seem to make for peace in industry or even to make for peace in the State, if what we have heard from certain quarters is to be taken as sincere. The object of the Bill surely is to compel trade unions to do certain things which they have declared they do not want to do.  The Minister made great play, when he was discussing my amendment, before I had myself explained it, with the necessity for having agreement, but this whole Bill is not based on any agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the second amendment, which the Minister mentioned, surely the amendment in the name of Senator Foran does not mean that the trade unions or those who speak for them want to avoid legislation at any cost or at any time.  It surely means, if it means anything, that proposals should first be agreed upon and then embodied in legislation.  We shall have to have some better approach to the problem than the making of mere debating points.  I accept the Minister's statement this evening that the main purpose of the Bill is to establish <Col N="2299" /> industrial peace.  I want to put it to the House that the Bill will not establish industrial peace, that it may, in fact, have the contrary effect and that before this kind of Bill is put into operation, there are certain other things that should be done and certain other experiences that should be gained by the State.  The main point we are concerned with is not how trade unions are going to be organised.  The main point we are concerned with is whether you can establish industrial peace. There is no objection to a multiplicity of trade unions.  If there were any objection, we have a commission sitting at present which is dealing with the whole question of vocational organisation.  I agree entirely with the Minister that if and in so far as a multiplicity of trade unions causes a multiplicity of trade disputes, the loss of a great number of working days and consequent disturbance above all to the workers themselves, then a multiplicity of trade unions is bad.  But what you want to remedy is the evil of strikes and disputes of all kinds from whatever cause.  That is the root of the problem and we ought to tackle it.</P>
    <P>Disputes take two forms, either lightning strikes or lightning lock-outs, or strikes and lock-outs after due notice.  The loss occasioned by a stoppage of that kind is a loss to the community. It is a loss to the employers and above all&mdash;and I happen to know quite well and intimately what I am speaking about&mdash;it is a loss to the workers.  A strike or lock-out settles a dispute after it has gone on for some time, but not on the merits or on the principles of equity or justice.  It settles itself by a process of attrition, by a process of war, where the stronger side wins irrespective altogether of what the justice or the merits of the case may be.  Like war in the international sphere, settlements which are obtained in that particular manner have in themselves the seeds of future wars.</P>
    <P>This Bill sets up very elaborate machinery.  It was really almost laughable to hear the Minister say that the setting up of a permanent industrial <Col N="2300" /> court was of no value except for the officials it would employ.  I think it would employ nobody but a judge and a registrar and the salaries of the judge and the registrar would be very easily saved by the settling of one transport dispute per annum without going into anything else.  Just imagine the Minister who has sponsored this Bill, with its officials, its proceedings, its appeal board, its returns, its fees and all the multiplicity of documents that will result from it, just imagine his criticising any proposal on the ground that it was going to set up more officials.  Does this Bill as it stands make for more negotiation and less action?  I do not think so.  I do not think its sponsors would say so.  I think as a matter of fact it can be argued that this Bill will strengthen the combatants on both sides and will lead to more prolonged and more intensive action.  If you have a strengthening of unions on the one hand and a strengthening of employers, compulsorily, on the other hand, without any machinery for a settlement of disputes, surely your last case is worse than your first?  I hold that this Bill will not give us any more frequent settlement of strikes by negotiation than we have had up to the present.</P>
    <P>The Bill will eliminate small craft unions.  The Minister has power to mitigate that to a certain extent but, in a country which has not very many traditions, I think we should do our utmost to handle as tenderly as we can such traditions as we have.  The Bill may lead to the realisation of the dreams of some trade union leaders of one big union or two big unions.  But when you have reached the one big union or the two or three big unions, as far as my experience of the city goes&mdash;and I know a fair amount about this matter&mdash;I wonder are we nearer industrial peace?  I certainly think we are not and I think this Bill leaves the most important question unanswered.</P>
    <P>What does the amendment in my name suggest?  It suggests that before we proceed to a reorganisation of the trade union movement, whether by <Col N="2301" /> agreement or by legislation, or by legislation after agreement, we should endeavour to get certain experience of a permanent industrial court with power to carry on compulsory investigation and power to make advisory judgments.  The amendment in my name does not mean compulsory arbitration and does not necessarily lead to compulsory arbitration at all.  Anything that the Minister may have to say about the effects of compulsory arbitration in Australia or New Zealand need not necessarily have any relevance to the problem here in Ireland. One of the things we have learned is that we have our own problems to solve and must proceed to solve them in our own way; that it does not necessarily follow that what happened elsewhere will happen in our case.</P>
    <P>The amendment resembles a motion in the name of Senator Douglas and myself which was discussed here on the 14th March last.  If this Bill were to contain a preamble setting out its objects, its objects would surely be to encourage negotiations and discourage what is called direct action.  There is, as the Minister said, the Industrial Courts Act, 1919, under which courts may be set up.  But the Minister forgot to mention that these courts can only be set up after the dispute has taken place and generally have been so set up.  The machinery that exists in the Minister's Department has been very competently worked and has been instrumental in doing a great deal of good in settling a number of disputes, but it hardly ever gets going until the position has got bad, and very often it is not got going until the men are either out on strike or locked out.  We want something better than that, which can intervene by law before the dispute has actually taken place and men are rendered idle.</P>
    <P>I want to say quite flat-footedly that, so far as the lightning strike or the lightning lock-out is concerned, I would be in favour of legislation to make it illegal.  I would make it illegal for either employers or workers to close down a business in furtherance of a trade dispute, and I think every trade union official and trade union <Col N="2302" /> leader in this country is also in favour, whether they say it or not, of stopping the lightning strike.  With regard to the other strikes, my proposal is not a proposal to supplant and push aside all the present methods of negotiation, conciliation, joint boards, or anything of that kind.  I would allow all these to work&mdash;the ordinary machinery which works every day, where trade union officials meet representatives of the employers, where there are conciliation boards, as, for example, in the boot and shoe industry and in the railway industry.  I think a similar body was set up after the strike in the building trade, which I myself was instrumental in settling. It is only after all these things have been resorted to that strike action may take place in a great many industries. My proposal is not that all those methods of conciliation and settlement should be superseded.</P>
    <P>My proposal is that, when all these methods have been tried and have failed, a strike or a lock-out should be illegal until there has been a compulsory investigation of the whole matter before a person permanently appointed for that work and until that court has made a report&mdash;an investigation, I presume, with all the ordinary powers of a court to call witnesses, to administer oaths, and to order the production of documents, etc.  Provision could be made to see that that would be done reasonably quickly, so that workers would not be deprived of the right to take action at the particular moment which they thought most suitable to them.  If such a compulsory investigation took place before direct action had been taken either by the employer or the employees and the court issued a public advisory judgment, the chances are that that judgment would be accepted in nearly every case.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to cases where an industrial court was set up.  I think I remember several under the Minister's predecessor in the present Government and under the previous Government in transport cases, which are the ones that occur to me.  I think Judge Davitt was used on three or four occasions for that purpose by different <Col N="2303" /> Ministers.  I think on every occasion a decision was arrived at which was accepted, and I think on every occasion the men in question would have been glad to submit the matter to that particular judge, or some such person in the very beginning.</P>
    <P>The picture the Minister paints for us of a court compulsorily investigating every possible cause of dispute so as to bring the law into ridicule is a ridiculous one.  The court would not be called upon to investigate until the ordinary machinery had broken down, and the ordinary machinery does not break down except in the minority of cases.  If compulsory investigation and a public judgment were in the offing, I suggest it would break down in still fewer cases.  Therefore, my suggestion in this amendment is quite different from what the Minister represents it to be.  The alternative worth while trying is that we should set up this kind of court.  There is no reason why we should not submit disputes to a court and allow it to investigate them.  This Government and the preceding Government, the Conservative Government in England, and Labour Governments everywhere interfere, allegedly for the public good, more and more with private persons.  There is no reason why this particular interference should not be resorted to as well.</P>
    <P>I am not proposing compulsory arbitration, because the conditions precedent for compulsory arbitration do not exist in this country and because one must take the steps which are open to one and not go direct against the prejudices and opinions of the people.  I would prefer if this could be done by agreement.  When the motion was moved last March the Minister took up the attitude that he would consider it and the Labour representatives in this House gave it what I might call a mild, a rather faint and halting benediction. Perhaps faced by this Bill they will be more reasonable now.  I do not think that any sense of grievance on the part of workers or any discontented class in the community will be an advantage to us.  Hence I propose something which seems to me <Col N="2304" /> to be quite reasonable and which preserves to the workers the right to strike.  But, so far as I am personally concerned, I would support a measure to take away the lightning strike or lock-out from either workers or employers.</P>
    <P>The proposal would simply mean compulsory investigation, but not compulsory arbitration.  It would lead, I think, in the course of time to a code of law dealing with labour questions. It would lead to interpretations of Acts like the Conditions of Employment Act, which, by the way, imposed compulsion on a certain class of the community right away, and which was supported by the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I believe in the prohibition of the lightning strike or lock-out.  You may have to go to the extent of making special provisions for certain essential services; but the proposal here, I think, would have to be in operation for a time before you could see how it would work, and then, when it had been in operation for a time, you could come to the question of the organisation of these trade unions.  I think that if a court of this kind were in operation it would give a breathing space in which the proposal made in the Labour amendment to the Second Reading motion could be brought into operation.  The Minister could meet representatives of the trade union movement and perhaps come to an agreement.</P>
    <P>With regard to the expense of my proposal which the Minister touched upon, the expense would be very slight. The salary of a High Court Judge is £2,500.  Everybody knows that there are very few disputes, even the smallest, that do not cost the community £2,500.  The settlement of one dispute would pay all the expenses of the court.  I do not know why Labour Deputies, Labour Senators, and Labour representatives generally, who are most vocal in advocating international peace and measures to outlaw war, both in the national councils and in international organisations, do not take every step open to them to bring us peace in industry, to outlaw the <i>blitz-krieg</i> in industry as well as in international matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2305" /> My amendment does not propose to supersede negotiation, bargaining, voluntary effort, conciliation, joint boards or any such machinery as now exists.  It does not propose to take away from the workers the right to strike.  It does not propose that when judgment is given it should be compulsory, but it does propose that the right to strike should be postponed until certain investigation has taken place.  The Bill may do real harm by setting up in the industrial arena more powerful combatants, both of workers and employers, and thus may give us longer and more bitter conflicts than we have at present.  If the suggestion contained in my amendment were adopted you would get a calmer atmosphere, and this is the moment for it.  I think the Minister in justice to the trade unions and their leaders should have adverted to the fact that since the outbreak of war we have had very few disputes. Under the provisions of the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order, which is now law, I do not know how you could have a dispute.  What could a dispute be about except hours of work?  There could not be a dispute about wages, unless in the case of people with less than £2 10/- weekly in the Borough of Dublin.  By a side wind the Minister has effectively done away with the right to strike.</P>
    <P>The attitude of trade unionists in this time of national emergency leaves very little, if anything, to be desired. In that atmosphere, if this particular machinery was working you could easily get an agreed measure.  The Minister was very anxious to appear to oppose compulsory investigation, and he stressed the necessity for agreement, but he has moved a measure of the most far-reaching character, on which he failed to get agreement, and upon which his methods do not seem to me to be going to get agreement. The suggestion I am making is that we should make up our mind that what we want is not a reorganisation of trade unions, but industrial peace.  The way to get industrial peace, and ultimately an agreed reorganisation of trade unions, and better conditions, is by setting up a court which will have machinery to prevent strikes until investigation <Col N="2306" /> has taken place and judgment has been delivered.  I suggest that that is something which would be for the good of the community, and would have a better effect nationally than a Bill which appears to be opposed by the people it purports to reorganise.  If the Minister were wise he would set up the machinery suggested in the amendment, and after he had experience of its working he would endeavour to proceed with a Trade Union Bill in a form which would certainly be better than the present one.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; in order to add the words:&mdash;&ldquo;this House refuses to give a Second Reading to the Trade Union Bill, 1941, pending consultations between the Government and the trade unions with a view to the enactment of agreed proposals for the purpose of improving the structure and increasing the effectiveness of the trade union organisation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill has been introduced in a very serious atmosphere, and it is being looked at with grave apprehension by the working classes organised in trade unions.  The forerunner of this Bill was the infamous No. 83 Order or, as it is called, the Standstill Order.  In view of that atmosphere, and the suspicion created generally in the trade union movement, the Bill is not likely to get the serious consideration that a Bill of this kind ought to have by the trade union movement.  A great deal has been said about peace in industry.  That is very desirable.  That is a thing that all trade unionists subscribe to, so long as it is a fair and a just peace; so long as employers are not in a position to impose their will on workers and to exploit them for miserable wages and inhuman conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trade unions were created to combat that mentality and outlook on the part of the employing class in this country. Trade unionism here is not very old. I suppose it is about 50 years since progressive trade unionism was introduced <Col N="2307" /> to Ireland.  There are many trade unions here with old and treasured traditions, some of them going back for a century.  They are very proud of these traditions, and very conservative towards any changes. The Minister stressed the fact that on occasions many industries had been brought to a standstill.  I want to tell the Minister that if these industries were brought to a standstill on certain occasions it should be remembered that when there were one, two or three day strikes trade unionists were considered to be heroes.  Later on when a foreign Government tried to impose conscription here the trade unions did their part to combat that danger.  These were some of the lightning strikes that have been condemned here.</P>
    <P>When people talk about lightning strikes they should remember that the workers have only the strike weapon at their disposal, and that they must use it at the most favourable opportunity that presents itself.  Senators should visualise the position of a number of casual dockers in Cork, Dublin, Waterford or any other port, working on a foreign ship, where conditions are going to be worsened or some of their comrades penalised.  If they had to wait for the machinery that Senator Hayes talks about being put into operation, the ship might be in America, China or Japan before their grievances could be looked into. Consequently the right to have a lightning strike must always be there as long as the present system of society operates.  Trade unionists are not all devils or angels; they are just like ordinary members of the community. They are members of a family, either pugnacious, docile, delicate or strong.  We try to blend them in any way we can, to ensure that the working classes will have a decent standard of living and decent conditions. Modern industry does not permit of that.</P>
    <P>We had a class of employers springing up some little time ago that set up industries in back streets and employed little flapper girls to carry them on.  These people could not wait until a favourable opportunity presented <Col N="2308" /> itself and get all the machinery Senator Hayes has elaborated for us. I am in favour of arbitration.  I do not like strikes, and during 30 years' experience of trade unionism I never advocated them, if we could get what we were looking for without them.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the foreign unions in this country.  I believe that they served a very useful purpose at one time, and did great work on behalf of the workers.  I give them credit for the share they took against conscription and in the national struggle here, when the railwaymen had their lightning strikes and refused to carry the Black and Tans and ammunition.  These were members of the N.U.R.&mdash;a foreign union&mdash;and were not dictated to on those occasions by the executive of their union, which was outside the country.  I believe things have changed here, and they should realise that, and make some adjustments which are more or less advocated in this Bill&mdash;some alterations or regulations to meet the new situation existing in this country.  I agree that there are too many unions here.  I have always been an advocate of the one big union.  I believe that will come about some time, and that it will come about from within the trade union movement. It will not be dictated from outside. Consequently, I believe that this Bill will not lessen the amount of strikes in the country.  There is nothing in the Bill to prevent them, nor will it improve the trade union machinery already existing.</P>
    <P>Trade unions exist to ensure that the workers will get a reasonable return for their labour.  Otherwise they would have very little right to function at all.  They are privileged by having certain advantages, and they are very jealous of them; and any encroachment on those privileges certainly will meet with very vigorous opposition.  This occasion should not be allowed to pass without some benefit accruing from the efforts of the people that the Minister quoted at Drogheda.  Remember, Drogheda has a peculiar history: it was about there on the Boyne that William and James had a &ldquo;scrap&rdquo;, and this country is suffering as a result <Col N="2309" /> of it, and history repeated itself quite recently at the Trade Union Congress.  Certainly, it did not reflect any glory on the movement itself, but that is a matter entirely for the movement: it is their own affair and it is for them to deal with it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister showed a little more consideration, and was prepared to have consultations with the Trade Union Congress, he would get a much better atmosphere for the Bill and might go a long way towards accomplishing what he has set out to do. If the Bill goes through in its present form and in the atmosphere now prevailing, it will do much more harm than good.  After all, there is not so much justification for the Bill.  We have become rather peaceable people in the trade union movement.  The number of strikes that have occurred since the emergency arose here would indicate that trade unionists are a thinking people&mdash;believe it or not&mdash;and they have not tried to assert their power or to exploit the emergency for their own benefit&mdash;and, mind you, they could do that&mdash;compared with the trade unionists across the water, in a country struggling for its very existence, where we read about strikes every other day in vital industries.  The Minister and the Government should take due notice of that and give them due credit.  Before the Bill comes to the Committee Stage the Minister should take an opportunity to consider the matter with the Trade Union Congress, which is representative of all trade unions in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are other bodies outside exploiting this position, misrepresenting the position.  A great deal of good could be accomplished by Seanad amendments if, prior to the introduction of this Bill, there had been a conference with the executive of the trade union movement here.  One would imagine that, in introducing a Bill of this kind, the Minister would have brought into consultation those who really represent the trade union movement here, in order to get good-will and this peace we hear so much about. We in the trade union movement believe that peace could be bought at <Col N="2310" /> too big a price.  The workers have only the right to strike, and that right comes through the trade union movement from the Trade Union Act.  They fear &mdash;rightly or wrongly&mdash;that the Government are encroaching on those rights and heading towards a very serious position for the trade unions of this country.  I sincerely hope that the Minister, even at this late hour, will get into consultation with the trade union movement generally before the Committee Stage of this Bill.  I do not want to say any more on the Bill at this stage; there will be other opportunities for dealing with it, but I sincerely hope that the Minister will have the consultation which I have suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCampbell" hpid="Mr. Campbell Mr. Campbell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to second this amendment standing in Senator Foran's name and my own.  I think even at this late hour, as Senator Foran suggests, the amendment presents an opportunity which the Minister should avail of.  His own common sense ought to have led him to take the steps set forth here before he introduced the measure into this House.  He has been very eloquent in quoting recommendations of a similar nature for the remedying of certain evils alleged to have existed, or, perhaps, I should say evils which undoubtedly do exist in the trade union organisation of this country.  He went back to a congress held in Drogheda in 1919, and quoted extensively from statements made there, and from memoranda submitted with regard to amalgamation.  I think the proposal made in those memoranda was a proposal for the establishment of one big union for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who spoke on that proposal in Drogheda in 1919, and the people who expressed their views at the more recent commission set up by the Trade Union Congress itself, were at least consistent.  In going back to 1919, the Minister probably embarked on a course which would not redound to his own credit, because the Seán MacEntee we knew in 1919 is very different from the one we know now, and some of the statements which he made then might be used against him now, but at least the people who have advocated those measures have been consistent <Col N="2311" /> right through.  I think the Minister made a great mistake when he embarked upon this legislation without at least making an effort to consult not only with the national authority governing the trade union movement but with the individual unions themselves. I think he might well have been assured of our co-operation in remedying the evils and abuses which do undoubtedly exist in the movement at the present time.</P>
    <P>The proposals made both in the 1919 memoranda and in the recent special trade union commission report were made in the best interests of the trade union movement.  The difference between the Minister's proposals and our proposals is that he is going to impose those conditions by way of an Act, whereas we only endeavoured to make representations for the purpose of coming together voluntarily to remedy those evils in the movement.  I think the Minister has made a cardinal mistake in not at least making an effort at consultation, but, as Senator Foran suggests, even now it is not too late to embark upon that course.  This measure, if put through, will result in serious trouble.  None of us wants trouble, but the trade union movement, so far as I can gather, has never been so angered or felt itself so affronted as it has been by the introduction of this Bill.  The Minister states that it is not a class measure.  To my mind, the imposition of a penalty by way of deposit immediately and definitely makes it a class measure, because there you have the financial standing of the unions brought into consideration.  If a union has money, it is recognised; if it has no money, it has no right to exist.  The trade union movement, as the Minister said, can paralyse the industry of the State, but on very rare occasions has that occurred.  In spite of all the allegations made against the trade union movement here, I do not think that the trade union movement in any other country is so quiescent, or has so much regard for the interests of the people and for the interests of the industrial life of the nation as a whole. Undoubtedly, the trade union movement can exercise great power, and can <Col N="2312" /> do great damage if it desires to do it, but I must emphatically deny that in the last 25 years it has done anything that would hurt the interests of the people of this country or the interests of the nation as a whole.  On occasions, we have had industrial disputes, but nothing of the magnitude of the disputes in other countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the ease with which trade unions can be established. Many of the trade unions which now find themselves in difficulties were established because of the conditions existing some 25 years ago. They were mainly break-aways from English unions here.  It was the desire to be in line with the general feelings in this country that caused those unions to break away.  In the main, the conditions existing here at that time gave them their inspiration to become separate Irish bodies.  Those are the difficulties with which we are confronted now.  Those unions, due to their smallness numerically and to the weakness of their financial position, are in difficulties, and are most resentful of the fact that they are now to be put out of existence by the very same people who urged their establishment. I was associated with a particular union some 20 years ago, and we were urged by the late General Michael Collins to endeavour to start an Irish union for our own industry. We did not succeed in doing so, but we received our inspiration and our orders and some financial help from him.  The Minister has laid great stress on the undesirability of small unions. All the small unions are not the cause of industrial strife in this country. Some of them are amongst the best unions in this country.  I, myself, represent a very small and insignificant union.  It is numerically small, having only 1,100 or 1,200 members. Compared with Senator Foran's union we are quite insignificant.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stressed the fact that some reorganisation of the trade union movement is necessary, and I am not denying that.  I think I am the only member of the Oireachtas who signed memorandum No. 1 to which he referred, and I will stand over every line of that memorandum.  Nothing has occurred since then to induce me <Col N="2313" /> to alter my mind with regard to the proposals to which I appended my name.  I am still standing over that. As Senator Foran pointed out a few minutes ago, this country owes a great deal to the British trade union movement. There is no doubt about that.  Many of the benefits enjoyed by Irish trade unionists to-day are due primarily to the activities of British trade unions in this country.  I am not going to say that I stand now for the permanent establishment of British trade unions in this country.  My views on that are fairly well known amongst my colleagues.</P>
    <P>I still think that the Irish trade union movement should have its headquarters in Ireland and should have its whole government directed from this country and no other country.  I am still of that opinion, but I do not think the Minister's proposal is going to help us in that regard.  On the contrary, I think it is going to retard our efforts in that respect.  I am not speaking against British trade unions as such at all.  I represent them in an organisation in which 50-50 probably is the proportion of Irish and English unions, and I am not making any attempt to belittle or to minimise the great benefit they have been to the whole working class movement in this country.  On the question of the small unions, the Minister seems to be of the opinion that any internecine trouble or any inter-union disputes we have had in this country are due to small unions.</P>

      <P>Not all of it.  If I may correct the Senator, I would not like the House or anybody else to feel that I believe that all the disputes have been due to the small unions.  In fact, some of the disputes have been due to the larger unions, where they have overlapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCampbell" hpid="Mr. Campbell Mr. Campbell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that any proposal the Minister has made is going to eliminate that difficulty from <Col N="2314" /> the whole scheme of our industrial organisation.  It has been claimed for this Bill that it is going to do a whole lot of things that people in a position to judge say it cannot do.  It is proposed to build up stronger and better unions.  Undoubtedly, they may destroy the smaller unions, but what happened before may happen again, that is, that these small unions may be driven underground and may establish illegal organisations, as was done before.  They will not be able to avail of the conditions of the Bill itself to operate, but there is no reason why they cannot carry on as small illegal organisations.</P>
      <P>It has also been claimed for this Bill that it will prevent strikes and senseless disputes.  I am not going to comment on that.  I do not believe it will, but I would quote from a speech made recently by the president of the biggest union in this country at their annual conference in Waterford a few months ago.  Mr. Tom Kennedy, president of that union, an ex-member of this House, in the course of his address there, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Bill did none of the things so many had been crying for.  It would not do away with unnecessary, unofficial strikes; it would not bring peace in industry.  He did not think it could even do away with what was called inter-union rivalry. It would not prove to be the machinery for the settlement of disputes. In its general principles, in its aims, intention and policy, this was a measure which they, as trade unionists, could not accept and must fight.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the opinion of the president of a union that, I suppose, is one of the best conducted unions in this country. That is his conviction&mdash;that what is claimed for the Bill will not come to pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister intends to pay any attention to the amendment that Senator Foran has moved.  I think it would be in the interests of the whole movement and in the interests of the nation as a whole. It would be particularly in the interests of the nation at a time when we require <Col N="2315" /> that all our people should stand together in this national emergency. I do not want to play on that at all, but I do think the Minister has done more to impair the national unity which was so evident in September, 1939, than anything that has happened in this country since.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I was amazed at the hostility to the Bill that has been shown during the past seven or eight weeks, and I do not think that hostility would have reached such a crescendo if the Minister had taken the steps suggested in this amendment of first consulting with the Trade Union Congress and, if necessary, with the unions against whom these charges of inefficiency and internecine strife have been alleged.  I think these difficulties might well have been got over without the necessity for introducing a Bill here that has aroused angry passions and has created resentment throughout the whole trade union movement.  I really think that the Minister should have taken that course in the first instance.  At least he ought to have explored the ground and ascertained what our views were.  Allegations have been made in other places, even by our own colleagues, that at least some members of the Trade Union Congress are parties to this Bill.  I emphatically deny that.  There was no consultation whatever with the Trade Union Congress or with any officials of the Trade Union Congress, so far as I know.  I repudiate that, because some of us have been blackballed by our own colleagues for being parties to the introduction of this Bill.  While I admit that some remedy is necessary for the present condition of affairs, I do not think that these defects or these weaknesses would be remedied by this Bill. Whatever opinions may exist on the merits or demerits of this Bill, or whatever views may be entertained as to its ultimate effects for good or ill on the organised trade union body, there is, I venture to submit, no doubt whatever that its introduction has aroused not only a feeling of deep resentment, but one of very real alarm in the ranks of organised trade unionists throughout the country.  No measure that has been introduced during its life has so <Col N="2316" /> seriously perturbed trade unionists or, in my opinion, so seriously menaced the whole structure of the trade union movement as this Bill to which the Minister this evening asked this House to accord a Second Reading.</P>
    <P>It is a measure fraught not only with serious consequences for every individual trade unionist organised in his or her trade union, but it is also a measure that threatens&mdash;if and when it becomes law, and if the Minister persists in his intention of enforcing it&mdash; to have serious repercussions even for the Government itself.</P>
    <P>At first glance one might be inclined to regard such feelings of alarm and expressions of resentment as strange and difficult to understand, but when it is recollected that the promulgation of that nefarious piece of emergency legislation, to which Senator Foran has already referred, namely, the Emergency Powers Order (No. 83), almost synchronised with the introduction of this Bill in the Dáil, fair-minded members of this House will, I think, agree that trade unionists have good reason to be suspicious and resentful of this Bill, a Bill likely to be so serious in its implications for each and every individual member of the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>As if that were not enough to arouse their anger and to excite their suspicion, there is the further incentive to opposition in the statement that this Bill is only the first of three or four measures intended to curb and to regulate the trade unions and to relegate them to that position which the Government think they ought to occupy.  Is it any wonder, therefore, that a movement that has been built up at so much sacrifice and at so much suffering to its individual members should be so solicitous to maintain its interests and so jealous to safeguard its hardly won rights, rights very often won from unscrupulous employers only after intense suffering and privation on the part of trade unionists and their families?</P>
    <P>I am long enough a trade unionist&mdash; over 35 years&mdash;to know and to appreciate what such sacrifice and suffering meant in the past.  That it was necessary <Col N="2317" /> to undergo such misery to win for themselves and their families a bare existence is ever present in the minds of the vast majority of workers and that memory is an urge and an inspiration to them not to relinquish their right to be members of a trade union of their own choice and not to relax their grip on those weapons that have won for themselves something approximating to a decent Christian standard of life.  When I say that, I wish to say that I am no advocate of class warfare but it is necessary at times for workers to take these steps of striking and, as Senator Foran said, even of taking the extreme step&mdash;which I do not approve of at all&mdash;of declaring a lightning strike, to win for themselves those conditions which are denied to them and to which they feel they are entitled.</P>
    <P>Having regard to these facts, it is hardly to be wondered at that trade unionists would be so suspicious of the whole purpose and intent, not only of this Bill, about which they have heard so much, but also the other Bills, about which so far they have heard very little, but which, it has been freely stated, are likely to follow the present measure on to the Statute Book.  All the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the introduction of this Bill&mdash;the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order and the intimation of further legislation to curb the trade unions&mdash; are quite rightly regarded as signals of danger by the average trade unionist and, in my opinion, they furnish to every fair-minded and reasonable individual an understandable and justifiable explanation in regard to the widespread opposition to this measure. Who can blame the average trade unionist if he is fearful of the consequences of it and if he is reluctant to take what he honestly regards as a leap in the dark?</P>
    <P>Somebody has said that there would inevitably be opposition to any Bill of this kind, but if the Minister had been anxious to secure that that opposition should have reached the crescendo that it has reached, he could not have achieved it better than by making the cardinal error he did in, consciously or unconsciously, associating its introduction <Col N="2318" /> with the promulgation of the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order.  The whole trade union movement has been angered and gravely affronted as it has never been before, and all the indications at the moment are that every step possible will be taken to resist the Bill, if and when it becomes law, and to render it completely inoperative. That is the position as I envisage it at the moment.</P>
    <P>I was astounded at the extent of the opposition to this measure.  How it was engendered I cannot say, but the whole trade union movement, from the Trades Union Congress down, has registered its opposition to this measure and its determination to oppose it.  I do not know how that is going to be prevented.  It is for that reason that I earnestly urge the Minister, even at this stage, to take some steps by way of consultation with the Trades Union Congress, or with the unions that he thinks ought to be disposed of or liquidated, in order to see if there could not be some accommodation arranged so as to enable them to settle their differences.  I am seconding the amendment proposed by Senator Foran in the hope that something will be done to arrest what I think will have very serious consequences, not only for the trade union movement, but for the unity of the nation as a whole.</P>

It takes almost a whole day in some instances to get here, and another to get back.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are, to a considerable extent, indebted to the two representatives of Labour in this House for the moderate tone adopted by them towards this measure, and for the interpretation which they gave of the amendment that stands in the names of Senators Foran and Campbell.  It seems to me that it would be a pity if this Bill were to be debated, in this House, at any rate, in any other spirit.  I was relieved to find that they did not follow the Minister and read a lot of extracts from 1919 which, at one point, I was a little afraid they might be tempted to do. One thing which I was told by a friend of mine, and which I have certainly had to learn in politics, is that you do not get into Heaven by being consistent, and, so far as public affairs are concerned, there is no particular virtue in absolute consistency, provided you are honest and have the courage to say when you have changed your point of view.  I personally do not place much importance on the statements made in 1919, but if I did, looking at them somewhat from the employer's point of view, I should be frightened of some of them, and they would make me oppose the Bill.  If I believed that some of the prophecies in respect of a dominant union were likely to materialise from closer and better organisation of the trade union movement and of employers&mdash;a point which is very often forgotten in reference to this Bill&mdash;if I thought it would simply mean that we were to have one union, or even two dominant unions, in Éire, I should be definitely frightened, and particularly in the present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a division I shall support the amendment proposed by Senator Hayes, but, before giving any reasons for doing so, I should like to appeal to the Minister to accept, in principle if not in their actual form, the suggestions made by Senator Foran.  It is easy to argue&mdash;and I think no one here would really seriously dispute it&mdash;that there <Col N="2320" /> has been a certain tide of unreasoning opposition outside Parliament in certain quarters, but because opposition is unreasonable is no proof that it is not genuine and no proof that it is not serious.  It seems to me that this Bill &mdash;as, I hope, amended&mdash;is not going to be a success on the lines on which the Minister anticipates and hopes.  It it is going to be a source of enmity, bad feeling and distrust on the part of the trade unions.  From the point of view of creating industrial peace, and making for better relations as between employers and employees, it will fail in its purpose if it is to be ushered in under these circumstances. The Minister, as I thought and as I indicated at the time by an interruption, misunderstood the proposals in the second amendment.  I knew what they apparently meant on paper, but I was not clear as to the extent to which they might be taken as indicating a conciliatory attitude on the part of Senator Foran and Senator Campbell; but after listening to their speeches it is quite clear that Senator Foran is asking now, at this late hour, that there might be a conference before the Committee Stage.  That clearly does not envisage what the Minister thought&mdash;that is, that the proposal was that there was to be no legislation.</P>
    <P>I would very seriously urge on the House and on the Minister that as between the possible gain from having a conference&mdash;and, possibly, one also with the employers on certain matters, but that point I would not press&mdash;and going ahead now, blindly turning down the proposal which came from the Labour representatives here and getting the Bill through immediately, I would say that undoubtedly the Minister has everything to gain by waiting.  Take the worst.  Assume that there is no measure of agreement at all.  What has the Minister lost?  He has lost, let us say, two months until this House meets again, and he is then in the position to prove what he says now&mdash; that he cannot get any agreement, and could not get any agreement, with the trade unions.  That is what he might lose, but as against that he would be in the strong position that he made a genuine attempt &mdash; and presumably <Col N="2321" /> Parliament will have some knowledge of what took place, and will be very much better able to pass judgment, and, while I cannot prophesy, Parliament will, I think, be more ready to pass the Minister's proposals if it believes they were being met in an utterly unreasonable manner.</P>
    <P>If he delays and has a conference, or provides for consultation in some way or other, he will, as I have said, have lost two months, but there is every possibility, even if there is not complete agreement, that a fair portion of the Bill will be the outcome of agreement. Sometimes it is quite impossible to get people together on a projected reform, but when they find, if they do not come together and reach some agreement, that somebody else is going to do something that they do not like, and know that they have no power to prevent it, then they may be prepared to adopt a more conciliatory attitude.  In such a case you may find that you can get agreement that you would not get in other circumstances. It does not always happen, but surely it is worth trying.  I am not at all certain that you would not find, if half a dozen representative employers met a number of representative trade union leaders to examine this Bill and were to present to the Minister their comments on it, and then jointly discussed it with him, it would have good results.  I will not go so far as to prophesy that you would get complete agreement, but I do suggest that you would get agreement on quite a number of matters, and that partial agreement even might give the Bill a chance of working which it otherwise would not have.</P>
    <P>I put that suggestion forward because I honestly believe it is desirable to do so in the interests of industrial peace which, after all, is presumably the main, if not the only, reason why the Minister should introduce this Bill.  I suggest the Minister would be wise to meet that suggestion either by accepting the amendment, or without accepting it, for the House simply to agree to adjourn the debate on the Second Reading.  If it be not thought well to do that, the House could adjourn the debate on the <Col N="2322" /> Second Reading this evening for, say, two months.  In the meantime, nothing except an amount of political time will be lost.  If that course does not commend itself to the House, there is another possible alternative which I had in mind even before I heard the speeches from Labour members this evening that I might possibly propose after the Second Reading had been carried.  The course I had in mind was to give the Bill a Second Reading, and then refer it to a Select Committee, the Select Committee to be carefully chosen, to have power to hear evidence, to discuss the whole measure and to make amendments, and, as a result of its efforts, to try to secure a measure of agreement.  The House would afterwards deal with the committee's recommendations. I put that suggestion forward in all seriousness, and, in view of the fact that I wish to emphasise it, I do not intend now to deal at any length with things in the Bill which I do not like.  If I were to do so I might only weaken, to a certain extent, the suggestion that I am now making.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I think I ought to explain the reasons why, if it goes to a division, I would support the amendment proposed by Senator Hayes, and formally seconded by myself.  Over a year ago I moved a motion in this House in very general terms which was accepted.  When moving it I spoke at some considerable length showing that I, for my part, had given considerable thought to this problem.  I was very much interested when I saw an article which appeared in <i>Studies</i> last December, by the Rev. Dr. Lucey, of Maynooth, which was on very much the same lines as the views I had expressed earlier.  I mention that because he emphasised, even more than I did, that the time was not ripe, even if it were desirable, for anything in the nature of compulsory arbitration, and indicating that he believes that compulsory investigation, if conciliation in the first instance does not succeed, might be introduced.  He made various suggestions in connection with that problem. I do not say that you could introduce it simply by itself.  To go into that fully now would virtually be to go over the speech which I took more than an hour to deliver on the motion a year <Col N="2323" /> ago.  Naturally, I do not propose to do that.  I have very considerable misgivings as to the passing of this Bill as it stands without any other proposals. In the first place, it is the intention of the Bill to create one or two big unions, and one, or perhaps&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What justification is there for that statement in anything that I have said, or in anything that is in the Bill?  I beg the Senator's pardon, but that is almost deliberate misrepresentation.  I have never said that it was the intention of this Bill to create one or two big unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not accuse the Minister of saying that.  I was expressing my views and trying to express them moderately on what I conceive to be certain dangers in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>May I call the Senator's attention to what he did say? He has stated that it was the intention of this Bill to create one or two big unions.  There is no such preamble in the Bill.  I have never made a statement of the sort, and it certainly is not my intention.  My intention is, if I can, to compel the myriads of small unions to amalgamate in larger units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I never even suggested what was the Minister's intention, but what I was endeavouring to do was to state what, from my reading of the Bill, will be the result of it.  The Minister interrupted me before I had finished.  If I simply said &ldquo;one or two big unions&rdquo;, it might be misunderstood. I am not at all suggesting that it is undesirable, but if Senators care to read the speech I made over a year ago they will find that I argued on quite contrary lines.  The effect of the Bill might be, and certainly would be in certain cases, that certain unions, presumably having amalgamated, one for the workers in a particular trade and one for the employers in a particular trade, might be designated as the only unions which would be in a position to negotiate on wages and other matters.  To my mind, if you give that monopoly of negotiation to <Col N="2324" /> one or two unions they will inevitably become big unions, and when I use the word &ldquo;big&rdquo; I mean it in relation to a trade.  In the case of one trade a membership of 100 might be considered a big union, but when I use the word &ldquo;big&rdquo; I do not necessarily mean the exact number in a union.  By &ldquo;big&rdquo; I mean in relation to an industry.  I see a possible danger in the establishment of one organisation for one particular industry or, possibly, even for a group of industries, and of having it faced on the opposite side with another union, these being the only two which would have authority to negotiate generally on behalf of employers and of workers and of having no other machinery in the event of a deadlock than we have at the present moment.</P>
      <P>The Minister made it very clear to-day that he is totally and absolutely opposed to the setting up of an industrial court which would investigate disputes.  I am still of the opinion that the existence of such a court would be valuable.  Further, as I have already indicated, I have very grave doubts as to the wisdom of proceeding with this Bill, particularly in view of the hostility which it has evoked, until there is available some other machinery than we have at the present time. I believe that an independent court which could make recommendations in the case of a dispute is the furthest that we can go at the present time.  I do not at all agree with the Minister that you cannot have a court without having compulsory arbitration, or that the setting up of such a court must inevitably lead to compulsory arbitration, and that compulsory arbitration must be a failure because it has been a failure in New Zealand and Australia. I do not believe that compulsory arbitration will work unless you have the organisation which is envisaged by this Bill or by some better Bill.  I do not believe that any democratic State, in which there is a large measure of freedom, can come along to organisations of workers and employers and enforce compulsory arbitration from above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe it would work, or that it would be desirable even if it did work.  At the same time I think we could go a long way towards <Col N="2325" /> providing machinery that would be very much better, machinery for the investigation of disputes and their cause, and possibly of providing remedies before a strike takes place. If this Bill is to be forced through shall we say against the opposition of the trade union movement, I believe that it would be very much wiser for the Government to introduce at the same time some kind of machinery for dealing with industrial disputes.  Further than that, when I spoke before, I said that &ldquo;many persons will not agree with me in this but I would like to see it obligatory on every worker to join a trade union and on every employer to join an employers' association.&rdquo; The Bill does not go so far as that&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;but it creates a situation which might mean, in practice, though not in theory, that that would be achieved.  If there be only a limited number of organisations which have the right to negotiate, it may very soon become obvious that it is desirable to be a member of one or the other.  I went on to say further that I believed this would reduce the number of strikes, if we had at the same time an industrial court which would investigate matters which could not be settled between the two recognised bodies for negotiating or the three or four bodies as the case might be.  The Minister's answer to that is that, in Sweden, there is an industrial court and the people do not use it. So far, I have never got into litigation in a court and I hope I never shall. But the fact that I do not wish to use the court is no reason why I should want to abolish it.  It not infrequently happens that, if you have a tribunal to which you can resort, even though it be not obligatory to accept the decisions, you reach a measure of agreement by facing the facts which renders resort to the court unnecessary. While such a court, if established, would be used a great deal at first, I believe that, as time went on, its use would prove to be less necessary. The Minister thinks that that is a reason why we should not have it. I think it is a reason why we should have it.</P>
    <P>I said further: &ldquo;Before I would be prepared to advocate legislation on <Col N="2326" /> such drastic lines&mdash;legislation making it virtually obligatory on an employer or a worker to belong to an organisation&mdash;I consider it would be essential to provide a well-thought-out code which would regulate relations between individual workers and their unions and between employers and their associations.&rdquo;  It seems to me that this is one of the faults in this Bill.  It does provide, in certain circumstances&mdash;though not as well as it might&mdash;a certain amount of protection but it seems to me that if you are going to have one or two bodies&mdash;I prefer one to the two&mdash;with a monopoly so far as the right to negotiate is concerned, you must take some reasonable steps to protect the individual, whether that individual be an employer or worker.</P>
    <P>He should have certain fundamental rights which might be of a very simple character.  It seems to me that a worker in a particular industry, on complying with certain statutory conditions, should be entitled to membership of the appropriate union and that there should be no danger whatever of his finding himself left out.  The employer should have exactly the same right.  I know that the Bill, while not providing any code, does go some little distance in that direction in a case where there is only one union with the right to negotiate.  But if there are two unions with the right to negotiate, a person could be left out of both and find himself unable to obtain work or unable, in the case of the employer, to participate in negotiations.</P>
    <P>The case I am trying to make is that this Bill does not do all that is necessary to carry out the organisation not only of trade unions but the organisation of employers which, it must be remembered, is envisaged and intended in this Bill.  At any rate, I hope that, if the Bill is passed, it will have the effect of increasing the measure of organisation on the part of employers because, while we have possibly too many trade unions, we, probably, have too few employers' trade organisations which are suitable for negotiation. Other points I prefer to leave to the Committee Stage but I should again like to say that to delay the passage of the Bill a couple of months would do <Col N="2327" /> no harm.  It would allay agitation for the time being.  It would make us perfectly satisfied&mdash;I, for one, am not satisfied&mdash;that it was impossible to reach a considerable measure of agreement. Any kind of organisation of voluntary bodies and bodies which, as the Minister pointed out, are, to a large extent, to remain voluntary, can be done by consent is worth a hundred times what can be done by force.  Even if we were to lose something which is near and dear to the Minister in this Bill and if we were to get three-fourths of what is proposed by consent, with a reasonable assurance that it would work, it might be far better than 100 per cent. with opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever success or failure may attend my effort, my intention is to make a purely objective examination of this measure.  I am resolved that I shall make no attempt whatever to discredit this Bill either before the country or before the Parliament except in so far as it outrages established rights and seeks to transgress principles which are fundamental. I have been a trade unionist for more years than I should care to recall.  I was a member of several trade unions that died very quickly and I was a member of several trade unions which survived and still survive, even my membership.  I am a member of one trade union which has survived many battles and succeeded in many fights and which has on its registers the names of some men that Irish history will cherish and hand down to posterity with reverential regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, however, does not bind me to the inherent weaknesses underlying the method of trade union organisation, nor to the weakness arising from the continued existence of that defective method of organisation, but trade unionism is not industrial insurance. Trade unionism is a philosophy of life in operation; an organism in a state of evolution, and if you attempt to put it into the strait jacket of rigid legislation, it will rip open that jacket, with serious injury to the general community and possibly, to itself.  I do not propose <Col N="2328" /> to say how that will be brought about.  If I did, that would, possibly, be construed as a threat, but I am sure the Minister is sufficiently well acquainted with the way Irish character reacts to restrictive legislation, and I want to assure the Minister that Irish character and Irish temperament are sufficiently versatile, and that Irish temperament, Irish vitality, and Irish versatility have survived even a Fianna Fáil administration.</P>
    <P>I do not mean that the development of trade unionism cannot be guided and directed, but that direction and guidance should be left to people who are fully acquainted with the history, aspirations and activities of trade unionism, and should not be superimposed from quarters where it may be doubted that the principles of trade unionism are considered, and it should not take the form of restrictions and inhibitions which are not only antagonistic to the fundamentals underlying trade unionism but which are violently contrary to the very elements and dictates of natural justice itself. The weakness in trade unionist organisation can be remedied by examination, discussion, and goodwill, brought about by the Government of the State conferring with the government of the trade unions and putting into a statute their united wisdom, experience and outlooks.  These will be directive and stimulating to the trade unions, but the provisions in the Bill that is now before us will restrict the operation of their rights, impede their natural development, and revive and continue resentment.</P>
    <P>The most drastic, restrictive and provocative portion of the Bill is Section 6.  Sub-section (1) of that section says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any body of persons, not being an excepted body, to carry on negotiations for the fixing of wages or other conditions of employment unless such body is the holder of a negotiation licence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, there are many organisations which cannot survive and pay the stipulated price for a negotiation licence.  There are many trade unions <Col N="2329" /> whose funds would never be large enough to pay for the luxury of a negotiation licence.  In the small towns with a population of 10,000 and under organisations operate which effectively influence the standard of living of the workers in these districts.  They seldom find it necessary to resort to drastic action, because the general community there have an intimate knowledge of the people at the head of these organisations, and they also understand that their demands are invariably just and reasonable, and thus public opinion generally veers around to the side of the workers.  These organisations, moreover, are taken as representing the workers' outlook in these districts. Thus, when a crisis was threatened some months ago direct representation was given to these bodies on the local committees out of which grew such things as Air Raid Precaution organisations, parish councils, Local Security Force and Local Defence Force.  These organisations are, therefore, a moral force and a vital factor in the life of the local community.  Make it impossible for them to exist, and that force and factor disappear.</P>
    <P>Let us leave the abstract and come down to the concrete.  I live in Ennis. It is a town of over 5,000 inhabitants. In that town for over 30 years a local organisation, known as the Ennis United Labourers' Association, has materially influenced the wages and living conditions of all the workers in the town and around it.  Its members pay a contribution of 3d. per week. Out of this they keep a hall, and pay all things incidental to it&mdash;light, fire, and one or two part-time officials.  They also pay a small mortality benefit.  Its membership is, on an average, about 300.  Employment in the town is very limited, and labour is more or less of a casual nature.  In Clarecastle there is another organisation, built on much the same lines, and the same can be said of its influence in the area.  It would take the Ennis United Labourers' Association about six years, with a membership of 300 and no defaulters, to accumulate £1,000, and during these six years they could not pay rent nor have fire or light nor any paid official.  Now, Section 6 says that:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2330" />&ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any body of persons, not being an excepted body, to carry on negotiations for the fixing of wages or other conditions of employment unless such body is the holder of a negotiation licence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister has assumed the black cap in connection with these organisations, and his intention is to wipe them out as effective factors in the lives of these communities. I do not say that this Bill will succeed in doing it.  I doubt very much if the wording&mdash;the <i>ipsissima verba</i>&mdash;of his section is sufficiently clear for that, but that matters little.  At this stage, I am concerned only with the intention at the back of the section.</P>
    <P>These two organisations I have mentioned cannot any longer make an application for an increase in wages or improved conditions; they may not write and suggest the introduction of even a wash-hand basin in any employment in which their members work. Every one of these workers&mdash;several hundred of them&mdash;must make separate agreements with their employers&mdash;so many hundred separate agreements with so many hundred chances for sporadic breaches of these agreements. The Minister does not seem to realise that a trade union agreement of that kind is an insurance policy for the employer as well as for the worker.  If you have the moral weight of 300 workers behind your agreement with the association, instead of the vagaries and fancies of individuals, collective bargaining by trade unions and employers is the very best guarantee that the community can have against disorganisation and disruption in industry, but the Minister does not seem to realise that.  You are destroying the means by which that can be carried on in very large areas of the State. You are making it impossible for such organisations as those I have mentioned to carry on because of the very heavy money fine you impose on them, and you are supplanting comparative order by superlative chaos.</P>
    <P>Let me advert again to the concrete. In Ennis it is possible that, because of the high cost of living, the workers may seek an advance of 5/- or 2/6, or whatever you like, in their wages&mdash;that <Col N="2331" /> is, when Emergency Powers Order 83 has gone the way of the majority.  If the organisation makes a joint claim, I take it that the intention of the Bill is that they can be charged with an offence&mdash;candidly, I do not know what the offence is, but they can be charged with an offence.  If they go on strike and attempt to picket the business premises of their employers, they are guilty, under the provisions of this Bill, of conspiracy, and can be arrested for it.  Under the provisions of this Bill they will be guilty of a crime, and the only one means that they have of bringing a grievance effectively to the notice of the public is, not by negotiation, not by picketing, but by paying £1,000 to the Government for the privilege of exercising an undeniable right.  This section, therefore, constitutes a very interesting challenge to the Constitution of Ireland.  In Article 40 of the Constitution we read that &ldquo;the State guarantees liberty for the exercise of the following rights,&rdquo; and then, among the rights set forth, you have, in sub-paragraph (ii): &ldquo;The right of the citizens to assemble peaceably and without arms,&rdquo; and again, &ldquo;The right of the citizens to form associations and unions.&rdquo;  These guarantees are, of course, very important for the citizen.</P>
    <P>They are fundamental; they are inherent; they existed before the Constitution; they are principles of natural justice.  Let us suppose that the Ennis United Labourers' Association, in the furtherance of a perfectly justifiable demand and in the exercise of an undeniable right, called a meeting of the workers of the district for some public place in the town, say, the town hall, and at that meeting it was decided to make a claim on the employers of the town for an advance of 2/6 per week in wages, and the secretary of the association was directed to send a demand to the employers making that claim.  Or again, let us assume that the employers called a meeting and decided to give an advance or to refuse an advance, are both sides guilty of an offence or have both sides broken the law?  If the employers decided to meet a deputation from the association, do they <Col N="2332" /> still violate the law?  If again the position becomes difficult and a stoppage of work is imminent and if some public man, say, like my good friend, Senator Honan, chairman of the urban council, or the parish priest, calls a public meeting of all these parties, a conference representative of both employers and workers, presided over by some trusted public man, is that conference breaking the law and can a charge be brought against the members of that conference?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any body of persons, not being an excepted body, to carry on negotiations for the fixing of wages or other conditions of employment unless such body is the holder of a negotiation licence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Are you carrying on negotiations when you call a meeting to consider whether an advance of 2/6 is to be given or not?</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that all this activity revolves round the holding of public meetings which is a right that the Constitution guarantees.  If the Ennis United Labourers' Association act illegally in calling a public meeting of the workers of the town, and if it is illegal to send from that meeting a demand for an increase in wages, where is Article 40 of the Constitution of Ireland which guarantees the right of the citizen to meet peaceably and without arms?  Dicey&mdash;one of the greatest authorities possibly there is on Constitutional law&mdash;says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An assembly convened for a lawful object, assembled in a place which the meeting has a right to occupy and acting in a peaceable manner, which inspires no person with fear, is a lawful assembly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He further sets out the right of public meeting.  It must not be called to commit a nuisance, to commit a trespass and it must not be an unlawful assembly.  Now what does he describe as an unlawful assembly?  One called to assemble or which when assembled commits a breach of the peace, assembled for any purpose in such a manner as to cause reasonable persons to fear a breach of the peace, assembled to commit a crime.  Now, can it be said that according to any tenet of positive or other law that these <Col N="2333" /> people are assembled to commit a nuisance or commit a crime of any kind?  Article 40 of our own Constitution more or less bears out Dicey when it says that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;provisions may, however, be enacted to prevent or control meetings which are calculated to cause a breach of the peace or to be a danger or nuisance to the general public.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Such meetings as I have described are not calculated to be a nuisance, or to cause a breach of the peace.  It does not require a very fertile imagination to see situations such as I have outlined arising in many towns in the State, bringing disorganisation to industry and concern to the general community.  In considering this Bill, the provisions of the Constitution of Ireland cannot be overstressed.  Sub-section (2) of Section 6 must be read in conjunction with Section 11 in order to see how the Bill affects even authorised trade unions and excepted bodies.  Sub-section (2) of Section 6 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where any body of persons acts in contravention of this section, the members of the committee of management or other controlling authority of such body and such of the officers of such body as consent to or facilitate such act, shall each be guilty of an offence under this section and shall each be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding ten pounds together with, in the case of a continuing offence, a further fine not exceeding one pound for every day during which the offence is continued.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, that is clearly an attempt to get at a trade union through its officials.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister made himself acquainted with what was the law before the passage of the Trade Disputes Act of 1906, and before and after the celebrated case of Taff Vale Railway v. the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants.  Let me quote from Halsbury's <i>Laws of England</i> in connection with that decision. He states that up to that decision the position was that a registered union could be sued in its registered <Col N="2334" /> name in respect of a tort committed by its agents.  A trade union, registered or unregistered, could be sued in a representative action if the persons selected as defendants were by their position fairly representative of the union, as, for instance, the executive committee and the trustees.  A trade union was responsible for unlawful acts committed by men acting as agents of the union in furtherance of a strike sanctioned by the authorised officers of the union.  The trustees might be joined, and an order made against them for payment of damages and costs out of the property of the union. At the end of each paragraph Halsbury says: &ldquo;This is no longer the law&rdquo;, and he proceeds to give the following as the law after the Trade Disputes Act of 1906:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No action lies against a trade union or any branch of the union, whether of workmen or masters, or against any members or officials thereof on behalf of themselves and all other members of the union or branch in respect of any tortious act alleged to have been committed by or on behalf of the union or branch, and the liability of the trustees to be sued does not extend to an action in respect of any tortious act committed by or on behalf of the union in contemplation or further ance of a trade dispute.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Trade Disputes Act of 1906 states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An action against a trade union whether of workmen or masters, or against any members or officials thereof, on behalf of themselves and of other members of the trade union in respect of any tortious act alleged to have been committed by or on behalf of the trade union shall not be entertained by any court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a decided case, the learned judge in the case of Bussy v. The Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants and Bell, which was reported in the Times Law Reports, page 436, in reference to the words &ldquo;on behalf of themselves and all other members of the trade union&rdquo;, said: &ldquo;These words mean <Col N="2335" /> that the members and the officials cannot be sued so as to make a trade union liable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now the position is clear.  The Conspiracy Act of 1875 was altered by the Trade Disputes Act of 1906 in Sections 2, 3 and 4 in connection with trade unions, but we now revert exactly to the position we were in before the decision in the Taff Vale case.  The full force of the Conspiracy Act comes in against trade unions which have not got a negotiation licence.  I should like to make the point here that Section 11 says that Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Trade Disputes Act shall apply only in relation to authorised trade unions, which for the time being are holders of negotiation licences.  Therefore, an authorised trade union which does not hold a negotiation licence will still be liable for the torts of its members and an excepted body, unless it has a negotiation licence, will be liable for the torts of its members.  It is no harm to emphasise also that a tort, being a civil wrong, may be committed even when there is no trade dispute in operation.  Our conception of fair play in respect of the workers' rights in trade disputes seems to fall far short of the Englishman's conception.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is pregnant with peculiar possibilities.  You pay anywhere from £1,000 to £10,000 and you may negotiate, strike and picket.  It is a very interesting inquiry&mdash;how does the payment of this money give you the right to strike, to negotiate, or to picket?  It is a very interesting exercise in casuistry for the Minister to defend the position that the payment of a certain amount of money gives one citizen a certain right above another citizen.</P>
    <P>Let me revert to the concrete for the Minister.  A building contractor is engaged in building houses at Inchicore, at Whitehall, at Tipperary and at Ennis.  He employs a large staff of workers.  In the building scheme at Inchicore the workers belong to a comparatively large trade union whose members are more or less in permanent employment.  Their trade union can <Col N="2336" /> pay the necessary amount of money to the court in order to secure the right of picketing, and in order to secure the operation of Sections 2, 3 and 4 to prevent a charge of conspiracy being brought against them.  The trade union in operation at Whitehall is perhaps a comparatively small union which cannot afford to pay £1,000 or £2,000, and the one in Tipperary and the one in Clare are local unions. Here is the position then.  The workers in the trade union at Inchicore make a demand upon the same employer for an increase of 5d. per hour in their rate of wages.  The workers in Whitehall hear that the demand is being made and they make a similar claim, and the workers in Tipperary and Clare also make a similar claim.  The only union entitled to negotiate&mdash;the union at Inchicore&mdash;does so, but an agreement is not reached.  The union at Inchicore withdraws its members from the work. The men at Whitehall, Tipperary and Ennis are also withdrawn.  But note this.  The workers at Inchicore are entitled to picket.  They are entitled to walk up and down in front of the place carrying a placard: &ldquo;Strike on here&rdquo;.  The workers in Whitehall and the workers in Tipperary and Ennis are not entitled to picket.  Will the Minister exercise his casuistry and tell me what gives citizens in Inchicore the right to picket, while citizens in Whitehall have not the right to picket? They made the same claim, they are doing the same kind of work, they are workers for the same contractor, have the same conditions of employment and receive the same wages.  Will the Minister indicate to the House how it is that by paying £5,000 or £10,000 the workers in Inchicore can succeed in securing that right?</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to Article 40 of the Constitution again in connection with that matter.  I am very fond of this Constitution.  The Minister owes me £100 in connection with a bet made in Clare about it.  I suppose it is because he was in the Department of Finance that he did not think of clearing off that debt.  Article 40 of the Constitution says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The State guarantees liberty for the exercise of the following rights, <Col N="2337" /> subject to public order and morality:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The right of the citizens to form associations and unions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is this qualification, however:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Laws regulating the manner in which the right of forming associations and unions and the right of free assembly may be exercised shall contain no political, religious or class discrimination.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is to be no political, religious or class discrimination.  Are you not creating a class within a class when you say that the workers in Inchicore may picket because their organisation can afford to pay £10,000 or £5,000 or £1,000, but the workers in Ennis or in Whitehall or in Tipperary may not picket?  They have no rights, they are criminals and outlaws.  The workers in Inchicore are citizens carrying on a perfectly legal action within the law. The workers in Whitehall, the workers in Tipperary, and the workers in Ennis are outlaws and criminals.  That is the position to which I should like the Minister to address himself and tell us how it can be justified.</P>
    <P>These are but a few of the points which can be raised on this Bill.  There are many others.  For instance, what is meant by &ldquo;negotiate.&rdquo;  I have been inquisitive enough to look up the meaning of the word in a dictionary and this is what I found:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To procure, manage or arrange by mutual intercourse an agreement; to sell, to pass, or transfer; to transact or arrange business; to hold intercourse for the purpose of mutual agreement; to treat with others.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the writing of a letter by the secretary of an organisation to an employer or a number of employers constitute negotiating?  If two or three men call on an employer and say that they call on behalf of a certain body of workers, does that constitute negotiating?</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government have shown in their attitude towards the working community a total lack of sympathy or even understanding of their position.  This Bill is not a unit <Col N="2338" /> in itself.  It cannot be taken apart from the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order.  It cannot be taken apart also from the fact that unemployment assistance is withheld from people who do not join, the Construction Corps.  All these things show the Government's philosophy towards those who produce for the community.  This Bill will fail both as a policy and a piece of legislation. As a policy it will bring total chaos where some order previously prevailed. It will be injurious to the community, to industry, and to labour.  It will force action of a kind not now contemplated. It is anti-social, antidemocratic, and anti-Constitutional. As a piece of legislation, it is porous and flabby and will prove incapable of effective operation.  It is the greatest piece of namby-pamby legislation that even a Fianna Fáil Government could conceive.</P>
    <P>We are but asking for natural justice for the workers&mdash;God's freedom if you like&mdash;and no distinction before the law for any set of citizens against the other.  About a quarter of a century ago a young poet was very keen on this natural justice, this freedom of God.  He wrote a poem about it.  I do not subscribe to all the sentiments in it, but I subscribe to some in one of the stanzas.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Give wives to fools and gold to knaves</P>
    <P>And rank to the servile knee.</P>
    <P>But the wind and the rain on the open road</P>
    <P>And the freedom of God give me.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are asking but for the freedom of God for the trade unions of this country. I heartily commend to the Minister this stanza written 25 years ago by John Francis MacEntee.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Whatever the cost and whatever the means, the Irish trade union movement must compel the Government to withdraw the Trade Union Bill.  The Irish trade union movement must and will remain free and independent of all other classes and the Government.

Cé h-iad an lucht oibre?  Adeirimse gur lucht oibre furmhór muintir na hÉireann, lucht na tuaithe, feirmeoirí (má's feirmeóirí i ndáiríribh iad), mná na tíre.

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to those of the members who have urged the Minister not to proceed with this measure until he has had consultations with the representatives of the trade union movement.  I can think of nothing so politically unwise as an attempt to force this measure through the House in face of the determined opposition of those who are most intimately concerned with it.  If we take into account the organised workers of this country and the workers who are not organised in any unions, and their families, as well as the masters, organised and unorganised, I think we can say that, directly or indirectly, more than half of the population of this country is affected by this measure.  Surely it is not unreasonable to suggest that those who are directly concerned, and who have shown that they are definitely opposed to this Bill, should be consulted with a view to reaching some measure of agreement.  I believe that the Minister would be surprised at the measure of agreement which he could reach if consultation took place with the representatives of the unions.  I think we could gather from the speeches made on behalf of the trade union movement by Senators Foran and Campbell that there are many matters on which agreement could be reached.  I cannot understand why that course was not taken at the beginning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's declared object is to secure peace in industry.  Obviously, if we want peace, we should go out to seek it in a peaceful way, and I cannot say that the Minister did that.  I do not think any more inopportune time <Col N="2343" /> could be selected for the introduction of this measure than the time selected by the Government.  The Minister should know that the atmosphere created by the order which was referred to here, the stand-still order, was one in which this measure could not get the reasonable consideration which it might have got in other circumstances. Apart from that, I am wondering what was the dire necessity for the introduction of this measure during the present emergency?  According to the Minister's own statement, this unsatisfactory condition of the trade union movement has existed for a very long time, but if it caused any disturbance in industry, or any injury to the community in the past, that injury or disturbance was not evidenced since this emergency arose. Since this emergency arose, I cannot call to mind any incidents of inter-union disputes or disputes caused by internecine abuses.  I think Senator Foran made it very clear that the fact that we were in a state of emergency to some extent lessened these disputes. That is my experience in any case.  The production of food or fuel has not been in any way lessened by trade union disputes. Where any little incidents occurred&mdash;call them strikes if you like &mdash;in Kerry or Donegal, they were not the result of trade union activity.  It was more or less spontaneous action on the part of the workers; it was not organised action in the sense in which we think of an organised strike in connection with the trade union movement. That is why I say that there could be no more inopportune time for the introduction of a measure of this kind.  The opposition of the trade union movement to this Bill has been outspoken and determined.  Whether that opposition is justified, or whether it is reasonable, it is there in any case.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is passed in its present form, or even in an amended form, unless it is passed by agreement, it cannot be made effective without the co-operation of the trade union movement. It cannot achieve anything without that co-operation.  Let us see what are its principal provisions.  A union cannot carry on negotiations unless it has a negotiation licence.  But <Col N="2344" /> a union must apply for a negotiation licence.  Similarly, the tribunal which is to be established under this Bill cannot function unless application is made to it.  Suppose, and it is not impossible, that the trade union movement, resenting the manner in which it has been treated and the fact that it has not been consulted, decides that it will not co-operate; suppose it adopts a policy of passive resistance; suppose it says, &ldquo;we will not apply for a negotiation licence; we will not apply to the tribunal.&rdquo;  Nothing in this Bill can force them to do it, except what might be called the coercive provision that they will be prevented from carrying on negotiations for increased wages.  But they cannot carry on negotiations for increased wages now; they will not get them in any case.  As I say, without the co-operation of the trade union movement the Bill becomes a dead letter.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the necessity for the amalgamation of unions.  There is nothing in this Bill to bring about amalgamation unless the unions are willing to set about it themselves.  The Bill does not force them to amalgamate. I feel that the Minister is only wasting his time if he thinks that he will bring about an improvement in trade union conditions here by forcing this Bill through the Oireachtas.  At the same time, having had some experience of the trade union movement in the past, I believe that he will find within the movement a considerable amount of reason and a considerable desire to bring about a reorganisation of the unions.  As I interpreted his attitude towards Senator Foran's motion, it was: &ldquo;Where is the use?  I did not consult them because consultation would have been no use.&rdquo;  That was his reason for saying that he thought the amendment would serve no useful purpose.  But it is worth trying.  If he honestly and sincerely tries to reach agreement with the unions and fails, he will then be in a much stronger position coming back to this House and asking for this Bill.  I very strongly urge that he should take that course.</P>
    <P>There are many flaws in this Bill to which I should like to refer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2345" /> There is one especially, despite what he says about amalgamation and the necessity for having one union, as far as possible, dealing with one particular industry.  I refer to what the Bill is doing in the case, say, of the railway service.  We have in the railway a very big union in which practically all the railway workers are organised&mdash;the N.U.R.  Some years ago there was formed what we call a breakaway union. A small body of these workers broke away and formed a union of their own. The Minister is anxious for amalgamation. I think it would be accepted that it would be advisable to have one union acting for railwaymen.  That would seem to be his own policy.  But he has introduced a clause which makes it impossible for the N.U.R., which would be the one union which would cater for railwaymen, and he has done that because the N.U.R. is called&mdash; and I think it is not properly called&mdash; a British trade union.  It is not a British trade union if it is composed entirely of Irishmen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer also to the position which is created in this Bill for the union to which I happen to belong.  That is a registered trade union; it also appears here to be an excepted body; but it is forced to become an authorised union by the terms of this Bill.  I do not see the purpose of setting it down as an excepted body and at the same time forcing it to become an authorised union and pay £6,000 as a deposit. Otherwise, it cannot carry on negotiations without leaving itself and every one of its members open to prosecution for the torts of its members.  However, if the Bill gets a Second Reading, I shall go into more detail on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish now to urge as strongly as I possibly can that the advice tendered to the Minister by Senator Foran, Senator Campbell and Senator Douglas should be accepted and that the Minister should postpone any further action in connection with this Bill until he has an opportunity of going into conference with the representatives of the unions and seeing how far a <Col N="2346" /> measure of agreement can be obtained.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, I have reason to think he might be surprised at the measure of agreement that can be reached if such conference is entered upon with goodwill, as I believe it could be.  The trade unionists, if they are inclined to be intractable, will know that, if they cannot be reasonable and will not make an honest effort to reach agreement, this Bill is staring them in the face.  That may have an effect on their action.  I believe it will, but in any case the Minister will have tried to do what, in my opinion, he should have done at the beginning, before ever this Bill was introduced, that is, to hold consultation with the parties directly concerned, and try to see what measure of agreement can be reached. There are many matters on which I believe agreement could be reached.  For instance, I have no doubt whatsoever that agreement could be reached on measures which would prevent breakaway unions, which would prevent, for instance, a small body of seven members forming themselves into a trade union.  I think that there would be immediate agreement on that matter.</P>
    <P>I think that the wiser course in this matter of trade union legislation would be to proceed step by step, to legislate perhaps more with a view to the future, to prevent things happening in the future that happened in the past, rather than to try, by one stroke of the pen, to do away with all those things that have grown up during the whole 50 or 60 years' life of the trade union movement.  For instance, we could begin and say that no more small unions will be formed, that no more breakaway unions will be allowed to operate.  The Minister stressed, and rightly stressed&mdash;I am in thorough agreement with him&mdash;how wrong it was that a body of seven members could form themselves into a trade union and proceed to organise workers in opposition to a union already operating and already recognised.  It would be quite easy to prevent that.  There would be other things, I am quite sure, on which a measure of agreement could be reached.  I again most strongly urge the Minister to adopt that course, in the interests of peace, and in the <Col N="2347" /> interests of the whole community, for I believe that no good purpose would be served by pushing this measure through the Oireachtas in the temper and in the atmosphere which has been created as a result of its introduction and the circumstances of its introduction. If the Minister does that, I think he will be doing a good thing, and I do not believe for one minute that there would be any loss of prestige or anything of that kind on the part of the Minister or the Government if they were to take that step.  I believe that everybody in the country will say that the Minister and the Government have taken a wise step, if they do that. As I have said, their position will be strengthened if, having done their utmost to get an agreed measure, and having failed to get it, they come back to the House again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain difficulty about rising to speak on this particular Bill and on the two motions or amendments before the House. There are various reasons why that difficulty exists for me.  I was very interested in the career of this Bill since its introduction in the Dáil, and on every occasion that I could manage it I went into the Dáil to hear the discussions. The result is that I am fairly familiar with the arguments that were advanced against the Bill and with the sounder arguments that were put up in reply.  There is a further difficulty, and it arises out of the very full, very complete and, as I believe, the very effective speech made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce here this evening.  Because of these facts, I find it hard to say anything that may be new or very helpful.  Some Senators appear to think that the Minister's speech was too long.  It was long, but it was worth hearing.  That speech has gone on record, and I feel sure that, should it ever arise that this question will have to be tested before the people, that speech in itself will be as full and complete an answer to any charge that may be brought against the Minister and his intentions as could be wished for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody agrees that something <Col N="2348" /> should be done.  Every Senator who spoke here this evening agreed that the trade union movement needs an overhauling.  I am afraid there was a lot of wishful thinking.  Something must be done, we are told, but nobody knows how it is going to be done, and even some Senators admitted that they did not know when anything would be done if the matter is left for the trade unions themselves.  The position is that the Minister has recognised, in agreement with every responsible labour leader and in agreement with everyone who has devoted any attention to the difficulties encountered in the development of Irish industry within the last 20 years, that something has to be done, and the Minister has indicated to these people that, as far as lies in his power, he is going to make available the means by which that something can be done.</P>
    <P>The aim of this Bill, so far as I can see, is a relatively simple one.  It is merely to create what one might call an attitude of mind among trade unionists.  I do not believe that the Bill of itself is going to stop strikes, that it is going to do away with strikes.  Everything depends on the attitude of the people towards it.  One can educate the people to oppose this Bill.  It has even been suggested here this evening that that opposition may take a very serious form.  I might go so far as to say that some of the speakers sailed rather closely to the wind in dealing with that aspect of the matter.  If responsible people are going to point out, unfairly, I hold, to the ordinary trade unionist who may not be sufficiently educated and responsible in these matters how grievously this Bill is going to injure him, if he is going to point out to the trade unionist how he may oppose it, how he may thwart and upset the law of the State&mdash;if responsible labour leaders are going to adopt anything approaching that attitude, then they are going to inflict very serious injury on the cause which, I believe, they sincerely have at heart, and, further, they are going to inflict severe injury on this country, which has already in many ways suffered enough.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a gesture more than anything else.  I might spend the night <Col N="2349" /> here pointing out why the Bill is called for.  I went to the trouble of studying in the Library reports which were quoted here this evening, and I went studiously through the annual reports of the trade union movement&mdash;I might say, in passing, that I consider myself as much a representative of the workers as anybody here&mdash;and I am satisfied that there is in existence evidence in abundance from trade unionists alone to prove that this Bill is demanded and that it will render signal service to the labour cause if it is accepted in the spirit in which it is intended.  I was a member of different trade unions, whenever it suited me, in order that I should not be idle.  If I could not get work at my craft, I never had any objection to taking up a pick or shovel or to going into an ordinary non-craft union.  Sometimes in recent years I have been wondering whether the time for trade unions has not gone.</P>

      <P>On balance, remembering the utility of trade unions in the past, realising their great possibilities for good in the future&mdash;if we care to use them as we should&mdash;and realising at the same time to what a great extent the State has taken over the functions of trade unions&mdash;weighing one against the other, I am convinced that the trade union movement is desirable and should be encouraged. There is no doubt in my mind, on reflection, as to the advantages of the trade union movement, but I do think that there is too much senseless talk about the freedom of trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Bill that has been introduced into this House or, for that matter, into every Parliament, set about restricting the freedom of somebody in the community; otherwise there would have been no need to introduce that Bill at all.  This Bill undoubtedly aims at interfering with certain liberties&mdash; not exactly with rights, mark you, but with certain liberties.  I think we ought to face up to the fact that conditions have changed and times have changed and it is advisable from time <Col N="2350" /> to time in the interests of the community as a whole that certain liberties should be curtailed.  There is nothing sinful or wrong in it; such action here is in the interests of the community and, above all, it is in the interests of the workers, that these liberties that are about to be restricted should be restricted.  Again, I say that if one examines the case objectively, as was suggested this evening it should be examined, it will be found that abundant evidence in that regard exists, not from capitalists, but from the workers and the workers' representatives.</P>
    <P>The Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order has been referred to.  I am not going to deal with it at any length here, but I should like to say this in passing, that if this war continues&mdash;we hope it will not, and I would like the occasion to arise to-morrow when that order could be discarded completely; I would like to see the Minister to-night issuing a cancellation of Order No. 83&mdash;and if conditions develop as they seem likely to, there is no body of people who eventually will be more grateful to the Government for Order No. 83 than the people it is supposed to damage, that is, the workers. It is not immediately that the good effects of Order (No. 83) are to be seen, but only as conditions become worse which I may say again we all pray they will not.</P>
    <P>In a way, I should not get up here at all to speak this evening because such an effective case has been made for the Bill by the Minister, but it has been said on occasions that the fact that more people do not get up on this side to support the Government on certain measures is an indication that they are dissatisfied with the Government's measures.  That suggestion is an added reason for my getting up at all to speak.  I should like to see the trade unions fulfil functions far different from those for which they were originally established.  Nobody visualises a return to the conditions existing at the time of the passing of the Act of 1802; nobody visualises a return to the conditions which gave rise to the Factory Acts which were passed during the last century. Nobody in his sane senses will say that <Col N="2351" /> any Government elected in this country will neglect the interests of the workers and of the poor, or that anything it can humanly do will not be done.  We are agreed that we have not found a formula by which all our difficulties can be solved, but one thing is certain and one thing we ought to acknowledge, that is, that no Government will arise in this country that would dare to neglect the interests of the poor and of the workers.  But there are functions, newer functions, which I think Labour might fulfil.  Senator Campbell referred to some of them this evening when he spoke about education.  I would go further.  I should like to see Labour organised to go into production.  It gives me no great satisfaction to see any trade union movement handing over&mdash;even though they are handed over free of interest&mdash;large sums of money to the Government.  They are to be thanked, I agree, and their action is fully appreciated, but, at the same time, I should much prefer to see Labour utilise the funds, which accumulate in its hands, in the interests of the workers.</P>
    <P>We did not hear any reference this evening to the Encyclicals.  I subscribe to these Encyclicals in full, but I was glad that these noble documents were not bandied about and hurled at the heads of Senators this evening.  In these Encyclicals stands out clearly the teaching that every effort should be made to put property in the hands of the workers and I do suggest that there is a function which might well be undertaken by Labour, when it becomes fully organised, when the known weaknesses have been eradicated and when it develops into a strong organisation capable of accumulating larger funds, that is, that it should undertake as far as possible to provide employment itself and to secure property for the workers.  In that connection, I have argued before that, as it seems to me, one of the best things the leaders of Labour could do in the appointment of organisers, secretaries and other officials throughout the country would be to get men and women who have made a good study of economic and social problems, <Col N="2352" /> people with the highest possible standard of education especially in these matters.  There is no use suggesting that I want to impose university graduates on the Labour movement, that I want to impose on Labour a class which does not belong to Labour. I would not dream of doing any such thing.  From experience, I know that if you get these better educated young men and women to take charge of the movement you are simply putting your own in charge of the movement.  But there, I suggest, it comes back to the old point, that the whole difficulty here, as elsewhere, seems to be one of education. Labour, however, would be well advised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is difficult for me to avoid giving a lecture because I have been so long studying this problem and, with all respect and deference to the official representatives of Labour, my knowledge of the problem is so intimate, that I think I can justly claim to have the qualifications for giving a lecture on it.  However, I realise that time is running out and that other speakers have to follow, and I propose to confine myself to dealing with just one or two more of the points raised.  The Conciliation Act of 1919 was referred to, and I should like to say that I agree with the Minister and with other speakers that compulsory arbitration is not likely to be worth while trying for a long time to come.  I do not believe it will work, but I do believe this&mdash;and this is where I think we were becoming confused this evening&mdash;that there are certain services, even certain industries, in which strikes should be prohibited completely. I subscribe to that fully, but, on the question of general compulsory arbitration, which is implied in Senator Hayes' amendment, I do not agree, because I do not think it would work. <Col N="2353" /> Circumstances are different in Sweden. It was worth while referring to Sweden, but, in Sweden many things approach the ideal, but, if they do, it is because the attitude of mind in Sweden is so different from the attitude of mind elsewhere.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that the strengthening of the labour movement, the building up of large unions, would possibly lead to trouble.  As long as I can remember&mdash;and I can remember well the Congress in Drogheda in 1919 &mdash;I have always accepted the argument in favour of one big union.  I have no fear of large unions.  In effect, employers are a large united body. They will stand together when their interests are involved.  The politicians say that preparation is the best line of defence, and, accepting that, one can say that the stronger labour is, the less likelihood there is of serious trouble arising.  If labour is well equipped, mentally and financially, we can take it that employers, on the other hand, will also be well equipped, mentally and financially, and you will have something approaching equality. If you have that equality, you are less likely to have trouble than you are when one side is very strong and the other side weak.  I, at any rate, have no fear whatever from the growing and strengthening of the trade union movement. It is to be commended, and I think in that strength, that extensive organised and ordered movement lies the security of the workers and of the capitalists as well&mdash;in other words, the security of the whole country.</P>
      <P>It has been mentioned here, and also in the Dáil, that because workers are playing the part they are playing in the national movement, this Bill should not be proceeded with.  Let this Bill go through or let it not go through, I do not think that unity is in danger. From my knowledge of the men in the Local Defence Force&mdash;I know a good many of them and had the honour of serving with them for quite a time&mdash; they are I should say, as to 95 per cent. workers&mdash;there is no danger of their handing up their rifles or their badges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, I wonder, why should it be claimed that, because a certain amount of opposition seems to have been generated <Col N="2354" /> to this Bill, the Minister should withdraw it, or even that he should postpone it?  I believe in doing things in a peaceful way.  I remember, when the Bill was introduced in the Dáil, I thought that Labour would have drafted very useful amendments to it. If they had done so I am certain that these amendments would have been met fairly.  It was the peaceful way of approaching the problem.  I agree that every step should be taken to do things in a peaceful way.  But I wonder should we acknowledge the right of any section to select just what legislation suits it?  There has been opposition in this House to Bills on many occasions, and opposition to them in the Dáil.  In the case of the County Management Bill, people put up their hands and told us that all was lost and that the country was fomenting.  I did not believe it, and I do not now believe it.  It is not true.  I do not believe that the great body of Irish workers are opposed to this Bill.  If Labour leaders would accept it, as I say, in the spirit in which it is intended, and would endeavour to educate their members to the great possibilities of the Bill to the advantage of the workers, there would be no danger whatever. But even so, I have faith enough in the good sense of Irish workers&mdash;I grew up with many of them and I have worked with them&mdash;to know that they will not break the law if this Bill is made the law, if they get a fair lead from those who are reputed to be their leaders.</P>
    <P>That is about all I want to say now, not because I have not more to say, but because I realise that other speakers, particularly those who may be described as opposition speakers, are entitled to a chance of expressing their views, perhaps more than we on this side are.  I do appeal to everybody to give this Bill fair consideration. If it goes through and becomes an Act, I hope Labour leaders will show the same spirit towards it that they have shown practically during the whole of this discussion&mdash;that they are capable of rising to fine heights and that workers will have no need to be ashamed of their leaders in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnLynch" hpid="Mr. E. Lynch Mr. E. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have an opportunity of replying to several <Col N="2355" /> of the very interesting points raised by Senator O Buachalla, but time does not permit.  Consequently, I must proceed with the discussion of the motion.  The Minister, in his introductory speech, said this was a very simple Bill.  Now, the Bill itself may be simple, but I suggest that the circumstances to which the Bill addresses itself are anything but simple.  In fact, I can conceive of no set of circumstances more complex or diverse to which legislation could address itself than the circumstances of the trade union movement.  These diversities and complexities have grown up over a long period of time, and there is quite a long and very interesting history attached thereto. This Bill, when it endeavours to deal with those circumstances sets itself, in my opinion, a very formidable task. Legislation which seeks to deal with circumstances in relation to certain organisations &mdash; organic circumstances, structural circumstances, ideological circumstances and legal circumstances, all of the greatest complexity and diversity&mdash;it seems to me, from an analysis of those circumstances, historical, legal, ideological and otherwise, will fail in its operation.  In the amendment which we are putting forward, we suggest that the further Parliamentary progress of this Bill should be suspended for the purpose of consulting those who are vitally interested and vitally concerned with this legislation.  In my opinion and that of my colleagues the Bill will fail. That is an additional reason why the Minister, after listening to this debate, should reconsider his attitude and fall in with the amendment.  If he does so, he will find, following the plea made here this evening by Senator O'Connell, that he will receive help and aid in connection with the Bill from those who are vitally concerned with it.  There will be a more harmonious acceptance of the purposes to be achieved by it than if he were to proceed with it in the manner already outlined by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in anybody saying that there has not been a considerable amount of controversy in connection <Col N="2356" /> with the Bill.  It has been clearly and definitely manifested in many places, officially and otherwise, that the Bill is unacceptable to the trade union movement.  The Minister treated us to lengthy quotations from memoranda produced by a conference of trade unions which discussed these issues in recent years.  That conference was of a most representative character and impressed practically every responsible official and leading man in the trade union movement.  The Minister referred to the congress at Drogheda and to the opposition manifested there.  I might remind him that there have been general protests in relation to this legislation, all of which goes to indicate clearly that the measure is not acceptable to those whose interests are affected by it.</P>
    <P>That should weigh considerably with the Minister and cause him to reflect before he proceeds further with this measure.  That opposition should not be ignored.  We are suggesting that it should be consulted which, I think, would be the wisest course.</P>
    <P>The Bill aims at a reduction of the multiplicity of unions.  It is doubtful that the method proposed in this legislation is the wisest.  It will, unquestionably, if it operates as it is intended to operate, cause a reduction numerically in the unions operating in this country but that might not be satisfactory.  The end achieved may not give us that harmony which is, apparently, desired by the Government and the framers of this Bill.  The movement has sought to rectify itself and that shows an indication to create a newer and better organisation.  Therefore, if the intention of the Minister be on the same lines, there should be no difficulty whatsoever in bringing together all those concerned, both from the side of the Government and from the side of the movement, by way of consultation, so that the end to be achieved may be achieved by more harmonious methods than are proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give negotiation licences to certain organisations. The method of giving those licences by way of compelling the <Col N="2357" /> organisations to deposit a large sum of money is, in our opinion, not the wisest method.  Furthermore, the question of the utilisation of a negotiation licence. when you give that licence to certain bodies and refuse it to others, would seem to be an infraction of the natural right of human beings to organise and cohere for certain definite legal purposes sufficient unto themselves.  They have exercised that right up to the present.  In the future, the granting and exercising of that right is to be conditioned by the deposit of a certain amount of money.  In other words, only those organisations which possess certain wealth will be in a position to secure this negotiating right and those organisations not in a position to put down the deposit will be denied the right of performing this function and denied what, in our opinion, is the natural right to look after their own interests&mdash;a right which, as Senator Hogan pointed out this evening, is a clear Constitutional right.  The Constitution to which Senator Hogan referred says that no class legislation is to be enacted.  Does not a Bill which makes it obligatory on an organisation to possess certain economic wealth infringe the Constitution, because it takes from those who do not possess this financial wealth what appears to be a natural right&mdash;namely, to look after their own interests within their own organisations, since they have been granted the Constitutional right to form unions and organisations? It would, therefore, seem to be infringing very largely the Constitutional right of a certain number of workers to practise their callings and to exercise the natural function of their organisations.  However, it seems that, to-day, a modern State is entitled to override all such natural rights.  I am not surprised at Senator O Buachalla telling us that, perhaps, the day is gone entirely for trade unions.  If that be the mind of Senator O Buachalla&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is speaking his mind and that of the Government, it would seem to us as if we had reached <Col N="2358" /> what is known in contemporary history as the &ldquo;authoritarian State,&rdquo; in which the rights of individuals and organisations of all kinds and descriptions can be completely over-ridden by the Government. If that day has come, we are gradually arriving at the totalitarian. State, in which every human right will be made subordinate to whatever the State considers the interest of the nation or community at that particular time.  I do not know whether that is the mind of the Minister on the point, but it would seem that we are gradually developing towards that concept of society in the legislation before us this evening.</P>
      <P>The opposition to this measure is, as I have said, widespread and bitter. One has only to analyse very closely such organisations as trade unions to see why this interference with them is so bitterly resented.  That interference might not have been so bitterly resented if there had been previous consultation, or if the Minister were now to agree to consultation.  Resentment has, certainly, been made very manifest throughout the country.  It is extremely widespread and must continue to be so if this measure is persisted in.  There are many reasons why such opposition should be encountered.  One has only to analyse the origin of the trade union movement and its growth and development to realise the difficulties it encountered throughout that growth, the tortuous path it pursued, and the persecution to which it was subjected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of the developing industrial struggle of great intensity of a few centuries ago, we find the early trade union movement completely outlawed. It was only in comparatively recent times the movement secured the legal position and status which it enjoys to-day.  That persecution&mdash;jailings, deportations, etc.&mdash;was, inevitably, bound to leave its impress on the mentality of that movement&mdash;in other words, to leave a birthmark on that movement.  For that reason, and other reasons, we find bitter, widespread opposition in the country when it is suggested that the movement should be interfered with, and especially interfered with by the State.  That is due, in part, to the hostile treatment that <Col N="2359" /> movement received in its infancy not only from employers, but from the State, and very often from the judiciary operating on behalf of the State.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why opposition has been manifested to this legislation.  Again, we must look into the infancy and growth of the movement. It grew up very largely, in the first instance, as crafts.  The movement was largely composed of craft unions in its first stages.  It was not until much later in its history we got the growth of what is now known as the general union.  Anybody who studies these crafts during the last few hundred years will see them operating with many peculiar customs and modes of procedure.  These customs and modes of procedure created a certain mentality in the craft union itself.</P>
    <P>Each and every one of them has its own methods and it would be found difficult, in operation, to associate those bodies in what the Minister was pleased to call, this evening, some form of greater federation, because of that peculiar, domestic, inherent quality in the crafts which distinguishes them one from another.  They are very largely like families, with their own domestic lives and their own peculiar outlook on life, and one can only ask oneself whether, if you were arbitrarily to take a half dozen cottiers and suddenly fire them into some large tenement house, you would secure harmony in the tenement. I suggest that you would not secure harmony and that what you would have done would be to bring in to existence tenement intestinal difficulties and warrings and scrappings. Very largely, that is what is going to happen to-day where you are endeavouring, by the arbitrary method of a financial deposit, to compel these unions, where they do not lay it down, to come into organisations within which they find it difficult to associate themselves.</P>
    <P>Those, in my opinion, are very important reasons why the Minister will find that the legislation is hardly calculated to succeed in its objective. Again, there is the concept held by the trade unions that the trade union itself is an offensive and a defensive <Col N="2360" /> weapon for the economic interests of the members thereof, and if they consider that this sword and shield of their economic existence is to be impaired in any way by this legislation&mdash;you cannot expect them to analyse these measures in minutiæ&mdash;they cannot be blamed if they realise and feel that the legislation is going to interfere with the effectiveness of their organisations which have proved of such great utility to them in building up the economic position and their status of themselves as a class, and of themselves individually, in their economic lives.</P>
    <P>Unquestionably, the trade union movement has been of the greatest advantage to the workers in that regard. They can look back and see the position of slavery to which their forefathers were condemned until such time as they learned the value of organisation and until such time as that organisation was legalised and they were given a legal position within the law, such as that legal position was and is.</P>
    <P>These are reasons why the Minister should accept the reasoned amendment put forward from these benches, and take the movement into his confidence and discuss these various matters with it, because it is of the utmost importance that they should be discussed in that way.</P>
    <P>Now, I should like to refer briefly to some aspects of the Bill itself and to see whether the Bill, as it is framed, does not contain certain difficulties. The first to which I desire to refer is Section 7 (a), defining a registered trade union.  It says &ldquo;either it is registered under the Trade Union Acts 1871 to 1935, or, if not so registered, it is a trade union under the law of another country.&rdquo;  Well, it is easy to comprehend what is a trade union registered under the Trade Union Acts in this country, but it is not quite so easy to see what is intended by a trade union under the law of another country.  Those are two methods by which the Bill endeavours to demark and decide what are to be the bodies which shall be constituted as trade unions.  It would be interesting to learn by what machinery the Minister proposes to ascertain what is a trade <Col N="2361" /> union under the law of another country.  The laws of countries differ, one from another, and what may constitute a trade union under the law of one country may not constitute a trade union under the law of another country at all.  The Bill does not indicate that, and neither did the Minister, in his speech this evening, tell us by what procedure it is proposed to find out what is a trade union in another country.  I presume he will tell us that before we leave this evening.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the position of trade unions in other countries is one which we will find anomalous in this country. We have trade unions registered in this country and they are corporate bodies, complete corporate entities within this country.  We have trade unions that are complete corporate bodies in this country and are not registered, and we have also bodies which are not registered in this country and are not corporate bodies within this country, and hence they must be looked upon as unregistered bodies in this country. I think we have already had a sufficient number of cases decided in this country to satisfy the Minister that these bodies are unregistered bodies and, being unregistered bodies, he will find that they have not got legal status to the extent to which other bodies possess that legal status.  There are many peculiar legal consequences, which will be raised by this Bill, which will flow from the position occupied by such unregistered bodies in this country, and to some extent, perhaps, also from the position of registered trade unions in this country.  However, we shall come to that later on.</P>
    <P>Before doing so, I should just like to refer to Section 13 (a).  When the phrase &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; is used there, it is difficult for us, who may be presumed to have some knowledge of trade unionism, and, perhaps, some little knowledge of trade union law, to know what is connoted or what is to be understood by the phrase &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; when we are not informed as to the manner or method of procedure by which we shall learn what will be a trade union under the law of another country.  It is difficult to see, therefore, what shall be the position of a <Col N="2362" /> trade union under Section 13 (a). That sub-section says that &ldquo;such trade union shall include in its rules or constitution provisions specifying the conditions of entry&rdquo;, and so on.  Now, in regard to those bodies, to which I have referred as unregistered bodies&mdash; I think Senator Campbell said that they constituted about 50 per cent. of the trade unionists in this country&mdash; the rules and constitution of such bodies are under the control, direction and guidance of executives in other countries.  How such persons directing and controlling the activities of an organisation, portion of which is operating in this country, shall be brought under the jurisdiction or under this Bill is not clear to some of us.  The penalties provided would seem, therefore, not to be capable of being enforced against such people.  I cannot see how the local officials, who, as everybody knows, must act under the authority of executives elsewhere, can be made amenable for the actions of their superiors in another country.</P>
    <P>In paragraph (b) it is provided that the trade union shall maintain an office within the State for the purposes of this Act.  If the Minister will look up the official record of unions in this country, he will find that quite a very large percentage of them are incapable of maintaining an office in this country, because they are financially too weak to defray the cost of maintaining an office and officials in this country.  It is very difficult to see how these large numbers of small unions incapable of maintaining an office and officials who shall keep the register open, can be dealt with.  In passing, in referring to the small trade union, I want to say that it is small very often, not because of any wrong method of procedure or administration, but because of the technical nature of the industry for which it is catering which prevents it from having a large membership.  Furthermore, a union may be financially weak because it has had to dispose of its funds for purposes within the union, and, thirdly, it may not have actuarially related its contributions to its financial liabilities.  These are some reasons why some trade unions are small and <Col N="2363" /> incapable therefore of maintaining an office in this State for the purposes of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In paragraph (b) of the same section it is provided that the trade union shall give notice in writing to the Minister of the name of a person ordinarily resident in the State whom it considers suitable for accepting service of documents on its behalf, and any document whatsoever may be served on such trade union by enclosing it in an envelope addressed to such person at the said office.  In my opinion&mdash;I may be utterly wrong in this&mdash;there is an intention there to create what appears to me to be a trustee for the purpose of this Bill, because although it does not specifically say so, this person shall accept documents and apparently can be sued and can sue. That would seem to have been inserted for the purpose of meeting the peculiar position occupied in this country by what is known as the unregistered trade union.  As I have said, the unregistered trade union is a body which has certain immunities apart from the immunity generally given trade unions under Section 4 of the Trade Disputes Act of 1906.  I am of the opinion&mdash; the Minister can tell me if I am wrong &mdash;that the person set forth here in this section would have no more power, unless there is a definite repeal of earlier legislation, than he has at present to be considered a trustee than any other member of that organisation. It would seem, therefore, that while he may be served with these documents under this section, he cannot either be sued or sue himself on behalf of the union, because I think it has been well laid down already that the trustees of non-registered unions are not in a suable position, and that they cannot sue of themselves either.</P>
    <P>The next important section that we have to deal with is Section 16.  That section says that wherever a court makes an order, decree or judgment for the payment of money by a trade union which is the holder of a negotiation licence, to any person, the High Court may, on the application of such person, order such money to be paid out of the deposit maintained by the <Col N="2364" /> trade union.  It goes on to deal with the position of that deposit when it arrives at the High Court.  It seems that an aggrieved party or creditor, to reach the deposit in the High Court, must first of all secure a judgment, order or decree in any court before he can proceed to the High Court to satisfy his demand out of the deposit. Now, what are the circumstances in which a person may become a creditor of a trade union?  Very often a person becomes a creditor of a trade union if that person has been awarded damages for libel in a tortious action.</P>
    <P>We see from Section 4 of the Trade Disputes Act of 1906 that an action against a trade union or against any members or officials thereof in respect of any tortious act alleged to have been committed by or on behalf of the trade union shall not be entertained by any court.  So, therefore, if a person is damnified by the tortious action of a union or an official of the union, the union is protected and that person is not capable of suing in court because the union would plead the protection of Section 4 of the Trade Disputes Act. That law has been confirmed by a recent judgment of Judge Meredith in an action in which two trade unions in this country were concerned.  Consequently, if the ordinary court is incapable of dealing with such a case, then the deposit cannot be reached because no judgment can be secured in the ordinary court, the District Court, the Circuit Court or otherwise.  That is the position, as I understand it, of registered trade unions.  The position is still more difficult in regard to the unregistered trade union because it is non-suable through its trustees, being an unregistered body.  Creditors or people damnified by trade unions cannot plead their actions by virtue of these immunities granted trade unions which hold a very specialised position in the <i>corpus</i> of our law.  Consequently, you will find, in regard, first of all, to 50 per cent. of the trade unions in this country, which are non-registered trade unions, that no actions against these parties can succeed in these courts, by virtue of the fact that the control of such unions is outside the jurisdiction.  Consequently, their deposits <Col N="2365" /> in the High Court are immune from any form of attachment.  Then you have in relation to the registered trade unions the position that they are immune with regard to actions for tort, such as libel, and in that case libel is not solely confined to libel arising out of or in furtherance of a trade dispute.  Very often trade unions run newspapers, which are a fruitful cause of such actions, and they have that immunity under the body of law which has given to trade unions that peculiar position in our law.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the reasons why we think the Minister should accept the amendment standing in the names of Senators Foran and Campbell.  There are, as I have said, those difficulties of association.  You will find great difficulties there.  The unions themselves might suggest methods and means of overcoming those if they were consulted. They have their own outlook on these matters and they are entitled to that.  They are there as objectively and as stubbornly as any other fact or factor in life.  Then I suggest there is this peculiar legal position in relation to the trade unions whose control is outside this country, that they are not bodies corporate in this country and that the method proposed in the Bill to give them a corporate existence in my opinion does not give them a corporate existence, nor even a quasi-corporate existence.  Furthermore, I think that legislation of this kind can only succeed when those bodies with which it is proposed to deal have been made full and complete corporate bodies and distinct legal entities within this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the experience which many of those who sit near me have of the working of trade unions here or elsewhere, nor can I claim to have given a close study to the relations of capital and labour that other Senators can properly claim for themselves.  My approach to the subject is that of the ordinary citizen who wishes to follow his vocation peacefully and quietly and who would like at the same time to see his neighbours in the same happy position and to see essential services, industrial and otherwise, going on efficiently and contentedly. <Col N="2366" /> Lack of contentment in any section of the community affects the whole community.  It is disturbing to us that there should be any lack of content.  Therefore, it is a matter, not merely of selfish disturbance, but a matter in which right-minded people should feel anxious if any section of the community has in its own mind a just cause of discontent, whether one agrees with that judgment or not.</P>
      <P>I have listened to a great part of the debate.  I have listened to a great deal of what the Minister said in introducing the Bill, and read a good deal of what he and others said in the other House, and I am still puzzled as to why this Bill is being brought in. The only real basis which stimulated or decided the Government to introduce such a Bill, so far as I have been able to judge from the statements of the Minister and others, is that there is sometimes disunion amongst trade unions and disputes between trade unions which cause inconvenience or dislocation to industry.  But I do not think the Minister, in spite of his lengthy argument, established that this Bill would really be effective in doing away with such disputes between different trade unions.  He has spoken as if small unions were the cause of much disagreement.  I do not know that he has established that case either.  Of course, one cannot remember everything he said in his exhaustive statement, but I do not think he attempted by instance to show that the continued existence of the small union was a danger to the peace of industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, I notice in the Bill that there is a special provision for the continued existence of certain small unions; that is a small union amongst the employees of a particular industry or employer.  No doubt those house unions are sometimes very useful and can do very useful work in a peaceful and pleasant way as between employees and employer.  But they have another side of which we have known something in Dublin before now, where there have been unions which in fact were organised and mainly controlled by the employer to the great disturbance of good feeling <Col N="2367" /> in the particular employment, and in employment generally in the city. These small unions no doubt have their dangers as large unions have, but that they have been the great danger to industry or to industrial peace that is suggested by the introduction of this Bill is hard to accept.</P>
    <P>Now, while I am puzzled as to why this Bill has been drawn up at all, I am much more puzzled as to why it is introduced at this particular point in the history of the country.  Is it an emergency measure?  No such claim is made for it.  Is there any special call for it at present?  Is the country in any particular danger from industrial disputes at the moment that such a Bill should be pushed through with all possible speed?  It has been stated, and I think quite accurately, by several Senators to-day that labour has been very peaceful and quiet of late; that there have not been many labour disputes.  I think that is an accurate statement. I have no exact knowledge, but those who have exact knowledge have stated it, and it has not been contradicted. Is there any urgent reason why the Bill should become law at once?  I think it should be recognised, not in order that labour should be shown any favour, but in order that its importance to the community should get full weight, that labour has in recent times shown as full a sense of responsibility to the country as any other section of the community.  It was suggested, I think, that that should not bear any weight with the House in considering this measure.  I think it should.  I think it shows that labour is a very important and responsible body in the country and should be treated as a responsible body and not treated, I will not say, as a criminal body&mdash;that is not suggested&mdash;but as a body which is potentially mischievous, at any rate. All of us are potentially mischievous no doubt, but we do not need laws brought in <i>ad hoc</i> to restrain us from the particular form of mischief which the Government or the Minister may think we are particularly liable to fall into.</P>
    <P>Several Senators have said, and of <Col N="2368" /> course it is obvious, that the trade union movement in past history has done a great deal for the advancement of the working people in this and other countries.  The horrors of 100 years ago have largely disappeared in civilised lands.  Many Senators referred to the improvement that has taken place in the hours and conditions of labour, but I think Labour has contributed something equally important, to which, so far as I heard the debate, little reference was made.  It has educated the working man into the recognition that he is a human being with equal rights with other human beings; that he is free and independent; and nothing in the history of this or any other civilised country has contributed so much to the growth of that consciousness of new freedom as the Labour movement, having regard to the tyranny exerted over workers 100 years ago.  How did that happen?  It was not so much by shaking off the shackles of unfair conditions as by the fact that it has developed the minds of men. It has been a spontaneous movement, spontaneous amongst themselves. Here I come to what I think is the gravest criticism of the Bill. Senator Foran made it to-day.  He said that reform of labour organisations should come out of the Labour movement itself.  Unless it comes out of the Labour movement it is spurious, is bound to fail, and will never have any cordial support from those engaged in labour.</P>
    <P>I do not see the need for this Bill. I think it is inopportune, and that it is from its nature going on wrong lines. I think any reform must come from the movement itself, must be spontaneous from the people in it, and not be imposed upon it from above.  The establishment of unions&mdash;all of which must be unions with considerable money behind them&mdash;to be selected by tribunals savours far too much of regimentation to be effective.  There are some whose minds run in the direction of regimentation, to whom organisation by the State seems to be very good because it is organisation by the State.  The last speaker spoke of this tendency&mdash;the authoritarian tendency. <Col N="2369" /> I agree that it is a tendency that one meets in unexpected places. It is a tendency which appears to be growing in our legislation in recent years.  It always grows in times of emergency, such as war. That cannot be helped, but it should be curbed and checked as far as possible.  When dealing with legislation that is concerned not with special war conditions but with ordinary conditions of industrial life, we should be very careful not to let our minds run away with any authoritarian tendency of that sort.</P>
    <P>Senator Buckley closed his speech by asking: Why should the Government withdraw the Bill?  He argued that the Government should not withdraw the Bill because it aroused opposition. Of course not; every Bill arouses opposition.  But the Government, before introducing such a measure, should pay attention to reasonable opposition and reasonable criticism.  I think that is what Senator Buckley had in mind, and not, because rash threats are made by irresponsible people, that the Government should be intimidated about a measure the utility of which it is convinced. Where reasonable criticism is made, and a case is not established to convince the large majority that the matter is urgent, a Bill of this kind, dealing with permanent conditions&mdash;as far as any conditions are permanent&mdash; should not be introduced at a time when we should be attending to matters on which we should try to have agreement and that have a bearing on the present national emergency.  I hope the Minister will consider that he would be doing better for organised labour, for industrial peace and our welfare by withdrawing the Bill and following the advice given in Senator Foran's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamMagennis" hpid="Professor Magennis Professor Magennis">
      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately Senator Hayes is not in the House at present.  There was a strange hiatus in his argument that the measure should be postponed, not, as was the customary formula long ago, to this day six months, but until an industrial court had been set up.  The Senator devoted himself for a considerable time to an elaboration <Col N="2370" /> of his idea of an industrial court and its excellence.  With a great deal of what he said on that point most of us agree.  But the next proposal in furtherance of industrial peace surpasses understanding.  He argued that there was nothing in this measure which would preclude a Government from setting up such a court.  I submit that if his argument were to be effective&mdash;in fact, in order&mdash;it should have been made clear, or even made speciously clear, that there was something in the idea of the present Bill, if it were passed, which would frustrate the realisation of his idea.  There was reluctance to deal with that at all.  So far we can only regard his amendment as mere opposition to the proposal.  The second amendment seemed to me to be very attractive at first.  It was a proposal not to postpone this Bill merely, but to arrive at agreement between representatives of Labour and the Government, so that there should be a measure enacted that would embody agreed proposals. I was disillusioned with regard to that by the speech of Senator O'Connell. It is said that March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb.  The Senator began like a lion.  It is the leonine part that remains in my memory.  His argument was a series of threats.</P>
      <P>If they were not meant as threats, they were at any rate intimidatory prophecies that, if the Bill were carried, the trade union advocates and representatives would make its working impossible.  He gave us a variety of instances to show how that could be done.  Naturally, it occurs to one's mind that, if the Government is to enter into conference with representatives of labour of that mind and if the issue, if any were agreed upon, is to be enacted, what is to be enacted would be what they dictate rather than what has been arrived at by reciprocal understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speech on behalf of the Labour amendment which struck me most was that of Senator Hogan.  He uttered a profound truth when he said that trade unionism is a philosophy of life, but he did not adhere very closely to the philosophy of life which I at first understood him to refer to.  Trade <Col N="2371" /> unionism is a philosophy of life, but it is not the philosophy of the Red Flag. It is the philosophy of enlightened freedom, of the assertion of the rights of the individual person, of the natural right of man.  That natural right is enshrined in our Constitution&mdash;the two Constitutions that we enacted&mdash;and is declared as the right of free association. I have mentioned that I have been a faithful and consistent adherent of that philosophy from the first moment that I was able to think about these problems of a sociological character.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch who, as a lawyer, is well acquainted with the legal aspects of these problems, spoke of the comparative recency of the recognition of trade unions.  It is so recent as practically 1857.  That liberty of workmen's associations was struggled for, the battle was won, and again the battle was lost, on the Continent more than once; and it was only after the publication of the famous encyclical <i>Rerum Novarum</i> that there was general recognition of rights of the working men everywhere on the Continent to free association, in defence of their rights to frugal and reasonable human comfort, derived from the remuneration of their labour, and for all the other conditions of life which they were entitled to as human persons.  It is a philosophy of liberty, it is a philosophy of the rights of man, it is a philosophy of the right of the citizen to do freely what is reasonable and within the law of God and within what we would call &ldquo;the rule of right reason&rdquo;, speaking in terms of philosophy.  Civil society, which is so often spoken of as the State, is organised especially to defend and protect these natural rights of the individual and, consequently, its own rights as a community of persons.  In asserting the liberty of association, the Christian thinkers asserted a right for which, as one of the Labour Senators said, men had made sacrifices and died. But what has happened since?  The reservation that is made, as well as I remember, in <i>Rerum Novarum</i> is that it is only just and reasonable that the citizens should be free to act rationally, <Col N="2372" /> provided that that free action is not an attack upon the common weal or to do injury to others.  That is a very important proviso.</P>
    <P>Senator Campbell spoke of the union here in the city of Dublin of which he is a representative.  He said it was a small union, but that it is powerful.  It has only 1,100 members, but how is it functioning?  To make the cost of printing higher in the city of Dublin than anywhere else in the whole of Ireland.  There have been strikes which it organised.  I do not object to strikes in principle; that is, the right to strike is a necessary part of the freedom to assert the natural right to free association in the interest of securing the natural rights of the members of the association.  I take the cost of printing as an example.  It has been made so high that, in the Standing Committee of the National University, when we had to consider applications of graduates to have theses printed, with a grant-in-aid for publication, we had to take into account the fact that there was no use in getting a competitive estimate from Dublin, that the graduates had to be recommended to seek printing estimates in Enniscorthy or from the Dun Dealgan Press or anywhere outside the city.  That is using the power of combination for oppressive purposes.  We know very well when the association became powerful in point of numbers and when it was in competition with others serving the same ends, to show that &ldquo;Codlin was the friend and not Short&rdquo;.  In that competition to show which of them could secure the greater measure of benefit for its members, and in that way produce a landslide from one side to the other, the rights of society were neglected.  That is the evil to which reference has been made, again and again.  There is nobody more ready than I.  I am sure, to recognise the iniquity of this use of its iron strength &mdash;the right of free association&mdash;to deprive the ordinary citizen of his natural rights and, in fact, to make war occasionally on the organisation of society.  Surely the Government, representing the State or civil society, cannot look on with untroubled mind at the rivalry of trade union leaders, <Col N="2373" /> in powerful combinations, to upset society.  It is the duty of society&mdash;it is organised for that purpose&mdash;to protect the liberty of the individual and the social liberty.  I see that much merit in this Bill.</P>
    <P>We are asked by Senator Rowlette and Senator O'Connell practically the same question&mdash;why introduce this Bill now?  The mover of the Labour amendment also asked that question, as did several others.  I read with great interest the speech on the Report Stage by one of the Labour representatives in the Dáil&mdash;my friend Deputy Davin&mdash;and he admits that, in 1935 or 1936, there might have been some reason for the introduction of a Bill like this, but he denounces and lashes with rage the introduction of it now. What has happened between 1935 and 1936 that has so bettered the relations as to make what was called for and necessary in those years quite unnecessary now&mdash;or make it not only unnecessary, but actually wrong to introduce it?  The present emergency, I should say.  Out of evil cometh good.</P>
    <P>We have the time and the opportunity now to do what we know has become necessary.  Recently, it is quite true that there has been none of those strikes due to rivalries and jealousies between trade union leaders, but the possibility of their renewal exists to-day as strongly as ever.  Nothing has happened, except the emergency, to stay the hands of those rivals who fight out their battles precisely as the gangsters in Chicago, the rival bands of racketeers and what not, use their machine guns upon each other or on passing motor cars, and leave children dead on the streets. Surely, in the name of the social good, in fact in the name of trade unionism itself, measures should be taken now? Now is the time, when we have the opportunity to discuss all those things. It is alleged that there is no element of class warfare.  That is to ask us to believe that there are no Communists in the city, that there is no Communistic element in any trade union, struggling for mastery in it, striving to use its organisation and its funds for the red flag philosophy of life. <Col N="2374" /> Senator Campbell repudiated any sympathy with the class war, but a great deal of what he said was on behalf of the class war.</P>
    <P>When I heard the Minister quoting Mr. Thomas Johnson, whose views on social problems and suggestions for solution of them I have learned from long experience to think of value, and when I heard that he had declared 22 years ago that what the trade union advocates should look to was not the present or the past&mdash;those are not his exact words, but I am attempting to give the spirit of what he said&mdash;but that they should take the long view, and see afar off the future goal to which trade unionism was moving, I thought that was very wise advice.  It was advice, as a matter of fact, to put the house of trade unionism in order, to quote a formula which has been used several times in this debate.  When is it to be put in order, or how is it to be put in order?  If we do not make a beginning now, there will be no contribution made towards a solution of the problem.  There is no hostility to trade unionism, rightly understood, discoverable in the Bill before us. It is alleged that the provision with regard to deposits amounts to such a differentiation between union and union, between union of employers and union of employees, as to constitute class legislation.  When a friend of mine, recently deceased, secured through long contests in the courts that a company which attempted to do business in life insurance within our bailiwick, within our Twenty-Six Counties, should make a deposit of £25,000, who ever saw in that security anything that could be described as class legislation?  When there is a sane demand that a body of men who hold themselves out to function in such wise as to prolong the benefits of a number of people who subscribe to funds over which they have control should offer security to those subscribers and to the public by showing that they can, as we say in slang, deliver the goods, that is not class legislation.  That seems to me very wise.</P>
    <P>Another of the speakers from the Labour group has suggested that there is something disastrous about the introduction <Col N="2375" /> of this Bill.  I think it was Senator Campbell who said&mdash;it was said in the Dáil before him&mdash;that this effort at legislation would destroy national unity as nothing else had destroyed it.  Why should a serious and well-intentioned effort on the part of the Government to discharge its duty to society, to do for trade unionism what the best minds of the trade unions themselves had desired, create national disunity?  The answer is very easy.  Senator O'Connell said that bringing this Bill forward at this time was unfortunate, and he gave the reason why it was unfortunate &mdash;that in the atmosphere at present existing this Bill could not get reasonable discussion.  There was a confession. This Bill could not, in the present atmosphere, get reasonable discussion.  Why could it not?  It was suggested that it was because of Order No. 83.  What created the atmosphere was the storm of obloquy that blew when the Labour leaders became active against it.  None of us who suffered from the operation of the same order with regard to restrictions upon the earnings of investments ever howled down the Government because the Government was forced to take those restrictive measures in an emergency, but the people of the country were called upon to howl and rage against the Government as making an unfair attack upon their rights to higher wages.  An effort to stay proceedings which might result in national injury was made to appear as an attack upon the working man and his rights. There is an attempt to make this Bill itself appear as an attack upon the working man and his rights.  Those who put their trust in the speakers to that effect naturally accept what they are told, and so it is a fact&mdash;I do not deny it&mdash;that there is this storm of rage against the Government and its proposals, and this threat to throw them out of power by the votes of the workers at the first opportunity.  But who created that?  It was not created by the action of the Government in discharge of its duty, but by those who misrepresented it&mdash;not wilfully misrepresented it; I make no such accusation&mdash;those who failed to deal sympathetically <Col N="2376" /> with the proposals of the Government and the purposes that dictated them.</P>
    <P>I contend that this is a serious effort to take the first step towards reform. It does not interfere with anything that anyone could desire for the better organisation of Labour.  On the contrary, it is an attempt to remove one difficulty from it&mdash;the operation of rival dictatorships.  The Bill aims at the reduction of the movement to its legitimate form, namely, to preserve the rights of workers of different types and to secure for them truly human conditions of life and advance for them and for their children.  It is to remove an obstacle to that social idea that this measure is introduced and to pave the way to further social betterment. If I were not convinced, as I am convinced, that this Bill is conceived in the best interests of trade unionism rightly understood I would not vote for it.</P>

      <P>Then, if it was the Labour Congress that asked for it, I think it should be left to the Labour Congress to try to settle it.  I am very pleased with the attitude that has been taken to this Bill here this evening. The speeches of such Senators as Senator Rowlette and Senator Douglas and of the Labour representatives here this evening should impress the Minister. After all, they are reasonable men who, after full consideration, have made an appeal to the Minister.  If my voice could be heard, I would add it to the appeal that these gentlemen have already made and request the Minister to postpone the Bill for a certain period.  I, for one, cannot see what he would lose by postponing the Bill, and I do believe there is everything to gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of democratic government is government by the people, for the people.  You will never govern the Irish people against their will.  As has been already stated&mdash;and rightly stated&mdash;certain opposition shown to the Bill was carried too far, and there <Col N="2378" /> were certain statements made which were not correct, but at the same time any little rights that the workers of this country enjoy at the present time or have been enjoyed were too hardly won to give away.  I would be surprised that the Fianna Fáil Party would have any connection with the taking away of these rights.  I am satisfied that there was no intention, in introducing the Bill, to take away the rights of the workers.  As a matter of fact, I am surprised that the Bill has been continued, in view of the opposition.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been fairly and honestly met in this House, and the unreasonable agitation that has been made elsewhere has not been made to it here. The chief reason given for the introduction of this Bill is that there was rivalry amongst trade unions.  That is the only genuine reason given that I can see&mdash;that there was rivalry amongst trade unions and certain disputes. I think that members of this House and members of the other House should be the last in the world to say anything against rivalry.  The very foundations of the State are built on rivalry.  In the other House the leaders of the Opposition are paid so that there will be keen rivalry.  They get an extra allowance to be keen rivals.  Certain Senators may laugh at the statement, but that is what the ordinary man outside will think. Leaders in this House are paid for rivalry.  I wonder what the citizens of the nation would think if the Minister were to bring forward a Bill that no political organisation could start in this country unless it made a deposit of so many thousand pounds.  Again people will laugh at that&mdash;they may laugh at it&mdash;but within our own time we have seen greater attempts from political organisations to overthrow the State, and when they did not succeed in overthrowing the State they went out to Spain.  I cannot see the sense in providing that certain organisations cannot come together in their own peaceful way, within the law, to try to better themselves and to hold what they have already gained.  As far as I am concerned, I would certainly vote for the amendment of <Col N="2379" /> Senator Foran and Senator Campbell. I hope the Minister will accept it.  I feel it is not good that this Bill should be pressed at the present time.  We have come together, and the Irish people have come together at the present time on bigger questions than the Trade Union Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Hogan made a very great case this evening when he said that a small party down in Clare could not come together or meet to better their conditions.  Is it not a terrible state of affairs to say that 40 farm labourers in a country district could not come together and make any demands for the betterment of their own class unless they paid a certain deposit?  It is certainly not consistent with the political freedom we have within this country, and I believe that the majority of trade unionists&mdash;and I am speaking as one who has been a member of a trade union for 23 years&mdash;can only take the same view as I do of it.  I feel that it is not the Minister's intention in bringing it forward to take away the rights of workers, but that is the view that the ordinary worker takes of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, it will be necessary for workers' unions to take out a licence before they can negotiate.  I do not think that is quite in keeping with the freedom we are supposed to have.  As a matter of fact, I feel that since we attained freedom it has become more and more necessary for every man to have a licence.  When we were under a foreign Government, it was only necessary to have a licence for a public house, a dog, and a gun; but now people have to take out a licence for practically everything.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I will make an earnest appeal to the Minister to pay close attention to the very wise statements made by different Senators this evening. I urge him to postpone the further consideration of this legislation until he has an opportunity of meeting the representatives of different trade unions.  I believe he will find that they will be very reasonable and considerate. It is my honest belief that if legislation is brought forward with the <Col N="2380" /> co-operation of these people it will be effective, but if it is brought forward without their co-operation, I am afraid it will not be so effective.  As a trade unionist, I am prepared to obey the law of the land, whatever it may be. If the Minister will only meet these people, it will be the best day's work that he could do for the trade unionists of the country and for the reputation of the Party he represents, a Party that has, since it came into office, so consistently upheld the cause of the workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was moving the Second Reading of this Bill, he described it as a simple measure.  That came as a revelation to most of us, particularly those of us who remember the course of this measure through the other House. When it was first introduced in the Dáil I think it consisted of something like 28 sections.  There were 35 amendments introduced following discussion in the Dáil.  I might remark, incidentally, that the discussion was confined almost entirely to the Minister and to members of the Opposition Parties. There must have been very strong support&mdash;although it must have been formidable it was certainly very silent &mdash;at the back of the Minister when he was able to get 35 amendments through.  He showed tremendous fortitude, as well he could with such backing.  The 35 amendments that were introduced had the effect of making it almost a new Bill.  The original Bill was practically butchered, yet one cannot forget that when the Minister was introducing it he described it as quite a simple measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the Minister could tackle anything so difficult in the way of legislation as a measure seeking to cover the whole field of trade unionism.  It must be remembered that trade unionists do not all spring from the same group.  We have a multiplicity of unions, some 70 in all, and they all have a different origin.  We have heard much talk about preventing breaksaway from the original unions.  I submit that breaksaway were necessary in some cases, cases where, for instance, the original unions did not <Col N="2381" /> adequately discharge their duties and where they allowed the business of the unions to degenerate.  Some of the breaksaway that have been so much talked of here have grown into powerful unions, unions that have been very effective in achieving a betterment of conditions of labour in many branches of industry.  As a matter of fact, some of the very strongest unions in this and other countries are unions that broke away from the parent body.  This Bill makes provision for a static condition in connection with trade unions.  The Minister does not seem to recognise that in the ordinary development of trade union life such things as a breakaway must and will occur.</P>
    <P>One of the main faults of this Bill is that it seems to take for granted that the existing unions are sufficient to cater for the wants of trade unionists in this country.  That is not so and, therefore, the Bill is based on an assumption that is definitely false, as the Minister will soon learn.  Apparently he has the idea in his mind that you can prevent strikes by legislation of this sort.  I suggest that strikes can only be prevented by goodwill, by mutual agreement, by concessions, by negotiations and by conciliation.  If the Minister is of the opinion that he can deal effectively with labour disputes through the medium of an Act of Parliament or by methods of physical force, I think he is very much mistaken and I suggest that that attitude is a rather unique one for any Minister or Government to take up.</P>
    <P>If we consider the history of trade unionism, we find that every Government that hoped to have a lease of power, or to do the best for its people, arranged its legislation so as to meet the requirements of trade unions.  Here we have a Government that considers itself a good Government trying to foist on Irish trade unionists a piece of legislation that they are one and all against.  Not one member of a trade union has uttered a single word of approval in regard to this Bill.  So far as I know, not one member of the Minister's Party in the other House has uttered a single word of approval. Not one employer in this House has uttered a word of approval.  Why, <Col N="2382" /> then, should the Minister persist with this legislation?  What is the secret and dreadful emergency that threatens the country in relation to trade union matters when the Minister, on his own volition, produces a Bill of 28 sections, then introduces 35 amendments and makes it a much larger Bill, each amendment blotting out the original idea that was in the Minister's mind?</P>
    <P>There was an extraordinary change observed during the passing of the Bill through the other House.  The Minister, after saying it was a simple measure, found it necessary to introduce 35 amendments, amendments apparently of great importance because they gave a greater body to the Bill than the original 28 sections.  I think that procedure in itself should be sufficient to show that it was an ill-digested and an ill-thought-out Bill that was produced in the first instance.  While the Minister may have the best intentions in the world and may feel that this legislation will assist in bringing peace and harmony into industry and will eventually be for the good of the workers, I think that he will find it very difficult to convince the workers that that is really his intention.  It is unfortunate, from the Minister's point of view, that this legislation follows so closely on the introduction of the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order.  The workers are driven to the conclusion that this is one of a series of Bills that will not be in their interests.</P>
    <P>The main point that I should like to emphasise is the threat that is there in relation to the smaller and more useful unions.  That is the point that has raised most doubts in the minds of the workers.  The working classes are deeply attached to these unions and many workers have grown up with them; indeed, they were part and parcel of their being.  They looked on these unions as a tower of strength between them and the greed and inhumanity&mdash;if I may use the word&mdash;of some of those under whom they had to earn their wages.  These small unions are being filched away by the Minister with one fell swoop.  It is no wonder, in such circumstances, that the minds of the workers are filled with grave suspicion that the Minister is <Col N="2383" /> really out to destroy the power of the trade unions.  The rank and file are well disposed and are right at heart.</P>
    <P>If I thought for a moment that this legislation would make for peace and harmony in industrial life, I would be the first&mdash;and so, I am sure, would the members of the Labour Party&mdash;to speak in favour of it.  Surely we are not all hypocrites on these benches, and those who spoke against the Bill must certainly be giving voice to their personal sentiments.  I was rather surprised by the remarks of Senator Magennis, whose doctrines are sound and humane.  He almost accused some of the Labour Party of being guilty of misrepresentation in their interpretation of Emergency Order No. 83.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a rather poor qualification which will not be much consolation to those accused.  Emergency Order No. 83, however, stands in all its nudity for the world to see.  He who runs may read, and it is almost impossible that any attempt could be made to misrepresent such an order, which makes it illegal for a man, no matter how goodwilled he may be, or how disposed he may be to grant increases of wages or improved working conditions, to do so.  That could not be misrepresented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we have said, the Bill is one of the most serious a Minister ever tackled, and I say that the Minister must have the courage of a lion to go through with it, in face of all the opposition it has met and in defiance of all who wish to stand by good, ordered government and by trade unionism well-ordered and well-calculated to make a prosperous State.  He has wonderful courage, but, without being offensive, it is courage of a very foolhardy, reckless kind, ill-timed and ill-considered as the Bill is.  I earnestly appeal to him, although it is difficult to make an appeal in face of the hard things I have said about the Minister and the Bill, to give the unions an opportunity of consultation on the Bill, in order that some agreed measure may in time be evolved, because no measure <Col N="2384" /> imposed against the will of the people will ever be effective.  The Minister knows enough of the Irish character to understand that, and his task in putting this Bill into force will be very difficult, if not impossible, and will not be worth the trouble.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose, if I can avoid it, to keep the House very long, but I feel it essential, in view of the speeches made here, to put some facts before the House for its consideration before it votes on either of these amendments.  There have been, briefly, five grounds of opposition to the Bill: firstly, that the case for the Bill has not been proved; secondly, that the trade union movement has not been consulted; thirdly, that permanent machinery should be provided for the compulsory investigation of industrial disputes; fourthly, that the Bill seeks to impose an unnatural shape on the trade union movement in this country and is, in short, authoritarian in principle; and fifthly, that this is not the appropriate time to proceed with such a measure.</P>
      <P>I have founded my case for this Bill upon the fact that there exists, and that there is admitted to exist, bitter inter-union rivalry in the trade union movement, and that that inter-union rivalry has resulted in grave inconvenience and serious loss to the people of this State as a whole and to the workers of this city in particular. Senator O'Connell and Senator Rowlette both said that they could not recall any incidents since the outbreak of this war of that inter-union rivalry occasioning grave loss to the people of the country.  In the course of the debates upon this Bill in the Dáil and in my opening statement here, I was careful to refrain from mentioning specific instances of disputes which had resulted in grave and serious loss to our community lest any instance which I might give might be taken as reflecting upon the trade union movement as a whole.  Since I have been challenged to prove my case, however, I now propose to relate to the House some things which have happened since the war broke out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had not been very long appointed Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="2385" /> when I had to deal with a dispute in the Dublin gas works.  In my view, after consideration of all the circumstances, that dispute was, in some part, ascribable to the rivalry existing between two trade unions catering for the workers of that concern.  In consequence of demands, which the responsible officers of one union considered to be exorbitant, but which were put forward on behalf of the members of another union, for a period of, I think, five weeks, the inflow of coal into the Dublin city gas works was held up.  The resultant depletion of stock since that time has never been made up, and we are now, as the citizens of this city know, confronted with the fact that, during the coming winter, it may be necessary to ration the supply of gas for domestic and industrial purposes in this city.  Who is going to be hit most by that?  Is it this capitalist class about which we have heard so much talk here to-night, or it is the workers of the City of Dublin who rely upon gas as the source of their heating and lighting in their homes, or those workers who are engaged in industrial concerns which rely upon gas for processing and power purposes?</P>
    <P>That incident occurred since the outbreak of the war, and it was my unfortunate duty to have to try to bring that dispute to an end.  It was not brought to an end until I had to intervene myself, but I think that, one way and another, fully ten days of my Ministerial time were occupied in trying to settle that dispute.  I could have much more profitably employed these ten days than in having to settle a wrangle between trade union leaders &mdash;because that, in the end, was what was really at issue: whether the prestige of one trade union leader, or one trade union, was going to suffer if either this demand were accepted or rejected. The dispute was settled, but in consequence of it, whether the prestige of the trade unions or of the trade union leaders involved suffered or not, the people of this city are now enduring the consequences of it.  It is not without its relevance, in connection with the agitation which has been waged against this Bill, that the leaders of <Col N="2386" /> the two trade unions concerned have been foremost in fomenting the opposition to it, because, I suppose, they realise that when this Bill goes through, that sort of thing will be at an end, because I will have given the trade union movement of this country a weapon wherewith to discipline its unruly members and its unreasonable organisations.</P>
    <P>That happened just in November, 1939, but it was not the only incident of this kind which did affect and might have affected much more severely the interests of the people of Dublin.  One January morning following I was telephoned to at my house to say that once again a lightning strike had taken place in the gas works of this city, and that if it were not settled the gas works would have to be shut down, at latest, at 12 o'clock that night.  Once again I and the officers of my Department had to personally intervene in this strike. We succeeded in settling it on the first day.  But it was quite clear to me that the responsible officers of the trade union to which the strikers belonged were afraid to tell their workers to go back to work and to have some regard for the interests of their fellow-workers in the City of Dublin.  They felt, I believe, that if they did that it would be open to those workers to snap their fingers at them and say: &ldquo;We are going out of your union, we are going to join this union over here which is trying to get a foothold in the gas works and which is prepared to take us as members.&rdquo;  However, we settled that lightning strike.  I should say that in the first case I mentioned there were, I think, 48 or 50 people involved.</P>
    <P>The following Monday morning the same thing happened, only this time there were over 300 workers involved. Once again, we were called upon to handle the situation, and it was only at five minutes to 12 that night, when the evening shift was going off, and there was uncertainty as to whether the night shift would come on or not, that a stoppage was averted, and that the gas supply to this city was permitted to continue. The root trouble in that matter was the fact that the trade union leader responsible, a trade union leader who <Col N="2387" /> has been foremost in opposition to this Bill, was afraid to deal with his own members, to tell them straight and plain what was their duty to the people of this city and to the community.</P>
    <P>I have said here that, on occasions, disgruntled trade union officials who have been disciplined by their own unions have walked out of their trade union offices, and with six other men have proceeded to form another rival trade union.  I had to deal with the consequences of such a secession during last year's sugar beet campaign, when a trade union formed in this way, I think by a trade union official who left his previous trade union organisation under a cloud&mdash;we might as well speak plainly now that we have threats made as to what the trade union movement is going to do if this Bill goes through &mdash;went down into one of the sugar beet factories and sought to persuade a number of keymen to withdraw their labour from that factory.  If it had not been for the very definite intimation given to this gentleman that serious and grave action would be taken, he would have succeeded in shutting that factory down, occasioning a loss running into tens of thousands of pounds, and once again for what reason?  Because any seven Toms, Dicks or Harrys can come together, if they have a grievance against their trade union, and start a rival organisation, and then, in order as I have said to secure the prestige of being a fighting union and of justifying its existence, can create trouble in any industry in this country in which their followers can find a foothold.</P>
    <P>There is the case for this Bill.  These things have happened, not only in this year or last year.  They have been happening every year in Irish industry, but the fact that they have happened during the present war has convinced me, and has convinced the Government, that the time has come to end such abuses once and for all.  The trade union movement has been given every opportunity to deal with them, and it has failed to do so.  It has failed because I think it has been powerless to do so. If these things have happened during a time of war, what do we think is <Col N="2388" /> going to happen when peace is again restored in Europe, and when Irish industry, the Irish nation and the Irish State are facing the changed conditions that will then ensue?  Can we afford to have once again in our country the same sort of disruptive actions which the citizens and the people of this country endured during some years prior to 1939?  Are we to continue to contemplate that, when peace comes, the citizens of Dublin going out in the morning to enjoy a holiday may find that their whole means of transport have been shut down&mdash;of course, in this case, without the authority of the union, but nevertheless shut down&mdash;very largely because of the fact that there happen to be two unions struggling for the right to organise the workers in the Dublin transport services?  Are we going, if peace comes, when we are trying to recover some of our markets or, if we cannot recover those markets, to get a foothold in new markets, perhaps, for our products: are we going to have all our constructive efforts still at the mercy of the persons who have been responsible for the three incidents which I have just brought to the notice of the House?  So long as I have responsibility for the development of our industrial effort, and so long as the present Government is in office, we shall not stand for that kind of thing: we shall endeavour, by whatever means seem to be most reasonable and are likely to be most effective, to end it.</P>
    <P>Now, I think I have proved the case for the Bill.  This Bill, remember, does not propose to prevent strikes.  It is not a Bill to impose compulsory arbitration upon the Labour movement. Its purpose is to remove one of the principal causes of strikes.  What is the use of Senator Hayes coming along here and submitting a proposal which will deal with the evil as soon as it manifests itself, but that will fail to remove what is one of the principal causes of it?  I am not certain that the proposal which Senator Hayes puts forward would be effective for the purpose which he has in view.  I am not certain that the strike problem can <Col N="2389" /> be dealt with in that way.  One thing I do feel is that if we can remove, if we can in some way diminish the inter-union rivalry which exists&mdash;and we can do that, I believe, by making it much more difficult to form and register a trade union than it is at the present time&mdash;if we can do that, I think we shall have done something to diminish the number of senseless strikes, effective as some have been, which have taken place in Irish industry during the past 19 or 20 years. I do not go any further than that in regard to the Bill.  I do not put it forward as a panacea for all the evils which infest the Irish trade union movement, but I do believe it will deal with one of the principal causes of the industrial disturbances which we have had to endure in this country.</P>
    <P>The second ground of opposition to this Bill is that the trade union leaders have not been consulted&mdash;that we have not had conference with them. Let me recite the history of this question. In 1936, my predecessor met, I think, the representatives of the trade union movement in this country and told them that he was convinced, as I am convinced, that one of the primary causes of industrial unrest in the Twenty-Six Counties has been this inter-union rivalry which has led to competition for members and brought into use all sorts of questionable devices not merely for maintaining the prestige of one's own organisation but for &ldquo;downing&rdquo; other organisations.  We saw what bitterness such devices had engendered within the trade union movement even so far back as 1921, when we had the representative of one Irish union, who is now a representative of an English union, getting up and accusing the trade union of which he is now an official of felon-setting him in the City of Galway.  The bitterness and rivalry which existed in 1921 has persisted ever since, so that, in 1936, my predecessor met representatives of the Trade Union Congress and told them that that congress must take steps to put the Irish trade union movement upon a more rational basis, to rid itself of its internecine disputes and provide machinery whereby this competition of unions with one another for membership <Col N="2390" /> would be kept within reasonable bounds.</P>
    <P>In consequence of that, the Trade Union Congress set up the commission to which I referred in my opening speech on this Bill.  That commission was no more expeditious in dealing with the problem entrusted to it than would be any Government commission. In fact, it seemed to be so dilatory in discharging that task that, on 15th November, 1937, the following letter was issued on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To the Secretary of the Irish Trade Union Congress.</P>
    <P>A Chara&mdash;I am directed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to inform you that he understands your executive has had under consideration for some time the question of improving the organisation of the trade union movement in the Saor-stát, having regard particularly to the necessity for eliminating inter-union rivalry and thus obviating the friction and other evil consequences to which such rivalry inevitably leads. The Minister would be glad to be informed what progress has been made in the consideration of this problem.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then follows this significant passage&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the Minister or his officers can be of any assistance in dealing with any particular aspects of the problem, he will consider what steps he can usefully take in the matter on hearing from you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I regret to say that offer of the Minister did not meet with the wholehearted acceptance which Senator O'Connell and other Senators have suggested a similar offer would meet with if made by me now.  On the contrary, that offer was ignored.  The Minister heard nothing further about his offer to co-operate with the Irish Trade Union Congress and the Irish trade Union movement in, to quote the phrase used here, &ldquo;putting its house in order.&rdquo;  So, this matter dragged on until February, 1939, when we had that special conference of the trade unions to which I have referred.  As we know, the efforts made by those who have the interests of the Irish worker and the Irish trade union movement really at heart to secure the reform of the trade <Col N="2391" /> union movement were signally defeated at that special conference.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for dealing with this matter then fell to me.  After the experiences which I have recited to the House, I decided that the matter would brook no further delay and I had prepared, in consultation with the officers of my Department, the heads of a Bill. I want again to make clear that, so far as this Bill is concerned, no trade union official, no member of a trade union and no trade union organisation is responsible for its provisions, good, bad or indifferent.  But I do say that, at a very early stage, the generality of the trade union movement knew what my mind was in regard to the reform or rationalisation of that movement and what form my proposals would take. If proof were needed of that, I have only to refer to the speech made by a representative trade unionist, a leading officer of one of the amalgamated unions and a member of the Dáil, which speech was made in, I think, February of this year.  As I have said, that is clear proof that the trade union movement knew, at any rate, what form my proposals would take.  From that date up to the present I have not received a single suggestion, put forward officially on behalf of any trade union or of any organisation representing the trade union movement as a whole, for the amendment or alteration of my proposals.</P>
    <P>The Bill which was to give effect to these proposals was drafted and received its First Reading on 30th April of this year.  It was circulated within a very short time, if not immediately. It was circulated, at any rate, in time for the Irish Trade Union Congress to call a special conference to consider it.  Having considered the Bill, that conference decided to oppose the measure.  I understood&mdash;I have since reason to believe that, perhaps, it was a misunderstanding on my part &mdash;that it also decided that amendments might be put down to it.</P>
    <P>The Bill received its Second Reading on the 4th June of this year, and following on the Second Reading I received a deputation from the Irish <Col N="2392" /> Trade Union Congress, and that deals with the suggestion made by Senator Rowlette that we are acting in a dictatorial or authoritarian way.  I am sorry that the Senator was not here, because he would have heard how seriously the life of this community was put in jeopardy by the trade unions of whose activities he is unaware.  At any rate, however, as I have said, I met a deputation from the Irish Trade Union Congress, and we discussed this Bill, and I must say that we discussed it in a reasonable frame of mind.  The members of the deputation did not, for a moment, conceal the fact that their members were opposed to this Bill.</P>

      <P>Well, the Senator and I must be at cross-purposes, because I understood that I was meeting members of the Labour Party and <Col N="2393" /> of the Trade Union Congress in connection with this Bill.  However, Senator Lynch is probably in a better position to speak on that matter than I am, and accordingly, subject to the reservation which he wishes me to impose upon my statement, I shall say that I understood that I was meeting responsible representatives of Labour, including representatives of the Trade Union Congress and of the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>Well, if the position amounts to this: that the Irish Trade Union Congress was saving itself, in the light of the resolution which was adopted at the special conference where, in fact, I think, they were told that there was going to be nothing except opposition to this Bill, then I have nothing further to say; but I do say this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnLynch" hpid="Mr. E. Lynch Mr. E. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no such injunction or instruction at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole proceedings are shrouded in mystery, and therefore I should like to recount them to the House as they appear to me, and subject to any correction which Senator Lynch may wish to make.  When I met this deputation, it is quite true that they represented to me that their members were opposed to the Bill.  They were not prepared to state the grounds of their opposition, but simply indicated that they were opposed to any Trade Union Bill, to any Bill dealing, good, bad or indifferent, with the Irish trade union movement.  There seemed to be a feeling that the Irish trade union movement was something apart from the life of this community and that it was not to be subject to the laws of this country.  Now, they put that in the politest way, but I did gather that, perhaps, amendments might be put down and discussed in the Dáil, and, sure enough, amendments were put down for discussion in the Dáil, by members of the Irish Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequent to the meeting to which I have referred, I then was asked to meet a deputation from the Dublin <Col N="2394" /> Trades Council.  I met the deputation from the Dublin Trades Council, headed, signally enough, by the chairman, who happens to be a member of the Amalgamated Society of Wood-workers to whose activities in this country I made some reference in the other House.  Well, if the first interview, to which I have referred, with some members of the Irish Labour movement was, at any rate, polite, firm and courteous, I cannot say that unreservedly in regard to the interview with the second body, because those gentlemen were not prepared to discuss the Bill, good, bad or indifferent.  They were not prepared to discuss any amendment to the Bill, and, ultimately, the table was thumped in front of my face and in front of the other people who were there, and we were told that the Bill must be withdrawn and that there would be no amendments to it. I do not know whether the chairman of the Dublin Trades Council or the other very prominent trade union leader who was there, Mr. Larkin&mdash;and there is no reason to conceal his name because he himself has already referred to what transpired at the meeting with this deputation&mdash;as I say, I do not know whether the Trade Union Congress, or the Council of Action or the chairman of the Dublin Trades Council, or Mr. Larkin, control the Labour Party in the Dáil, but to my surprise the amendments which were put down and which I was examining as representing the considered opinion of the responsible leaders of the Irish trade union movement in this country, were not moved and, instead of having a reasonable discussion of this Bill in the Dáil, we had the prolonged campaign of obstruction which, as Senators know, not merely impeded the progress of the Bill through the House, but held up the public business of this country for four or five weeks.</P>
    <P>Now let us see what happened following the Committee Stage of the Bill when these amendments were not moved.  Senator Cummins has referred to the fact that I found it necessary to bring in 35 amendments to this Bill, and Senator Rowlette has suggested in the course of his speech to-night that I am putting this Bill through in <Col N="2395" /> complete disregard of the views which had been expressed by responsible trade unionists in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrRobertJRowlette" hpid="Dr. Rowlette Dr. Rowlette">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Rowlette</NameTxt>
      <P>I made no such suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I took the Senator as making that suggestion, and I am sorry if I misrepresented him, but I did think that he implied that.  He deplored the fact that a Bill of this sort should be put on the Statute Book without considering the objections that had been raised to it and the views of those who were opposed to it, and Senator Cummins has twitted me with the fact that I found it necessary to put down 35 amendments to this Bill.  Why?  It was because the Irish Labour Party in the Dáil failed to do their duty as members of a deliberative assembly and to move the amendments they put down and which it might have been thought would make the Bill more acceptable to the trade union organisations, and perhaps to the trade union workers generally.  I had to do, therefore, on the Report Stage, the job that the Irish Labour Party in the Dáil failed to do.  I had, in order to make it more convenient for members of the Dáil to consider the amendments, to introduce 35 amendments&mdash;in fact, to take out whole sections and re-write them, put them in such order that the sections could be read as a whole, and necessarily had to make consequential amendments in other sections.  In consequence of these amendments, however, we have in the Bill at the present moment a tribunal which, I think, is almost a replica of the tribunal which was suggested by an amendment put down by the Labour Party and the Bill has been amended in several other ways to meet the viewpoint which was expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has now come from the Dáil to this House, and I am asked now, after this history of a problem going back over 20 years, and five years after my predecessor told the trade union movement that if it did not do something to remove these causes of industrial unrest which, he thought, were within its power to remove, <Col N="2396" /> months after the general form of my proposals was widely known to the movement, and weeks, and even months, after the Bill had been introduced, and after those who might be taken as representating the Labour Party or as being the mouthpiece of the Trade Union Congress and the trade union officials at least, if not the trade union movement as a whole, had refused to discuss the Bill in a reasonable way&mdash;after all that history, and in view of these happenings, I am now asked in this House to hold up the further progress of this Bill in order to discuss the matter with a body which has treated the Minister in this, as I think, quite unjustifiable way.</P>
    <P>Now, I know how anxious the Senators who put down these amendments are that this thing should not develop further on the lines on which it has been developed heretofore, but I cannot but feel, with full knowledge of everything that has gone before, that if I were to meet the national executive of the Trade Union Congress, those meetings would end in the same futile way as other attempts made by that organisation to reform itself have ended.  I cannot but feel that if I were to meet the executive, its members would be faced with exactly the same sort of attack as other people, who were alleged to be responsible for this Bill, had to face and had to meet in Drogheda and elsewhere over the past two or three months.  In fact, I believe that we would have those who failed to secure election on that executive going out and alleging that all this was a plan carried through by the weak-kneed Labour leaders&mdash;as they would be dubbed, but, as I think, the very responsible, statesmanlike leaders&mdash; and the Minister who was trying in some way to hamstring the Labour movement in this country.  Do we not know that the same policy would be pursued again, that in order that one particular union leader might score off the others, the officers of the particular unions which now find themselves in jeopardy would go out and conduct exactly the same scurrilous campaign against the Minister and against those members of the Trade Union Congress who were meeting him, <Col N="2397" /> and that as a result we would have no other proposals to put to the Oireachtas and the people of the country than those now contained in the Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would have a very fine argument for them then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good argument for them now.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good argument for them now in the history of this whole question and in the ill consequences and the misfortunes which it has brought on the people of this country.  But I prefer, because I think, rightly or wrongly, that it is only if the State carries full responsibility for this Bill that beneficial results will flow from it, to put the Bill through without in any way compromising any section of the trade union movement in this country.  They are going to have a difficult job enough when the Bill is through in trying to reorganise the movement in the way in which it should be reorganised.  I do not think there is any responsible Labour leader, anyone who has real concern for his class and his country, who does not feel that some amalgamation must take place, that some unions must go out of existence, and they will be able to tackle that problem, I think, in a more secure fashion if they have no discussions with me about this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is in the Bill?  I have been accused by Senator Doctor Rowlette, once again, of trying to impose some unnatural mould or unnatural form on the Irish trade union movement.  He has stated that the Bill is authoritarian in principle.  Is it authoritarian to compel a medical practitioner to enter his name on a register and to pay a fee after he has inscribed his name on that register?  What does this Bill ask trade unions to do except to register here in this country and that, when they do seek to carry on the business of negotiating for the fixing of wages and conditions of employment, they shall put down a deposit?  What is authoritarian or unnatural about that?  In what way does that compel the trade union movement to fashion <Col N="2398" /> itself into an unnatural shape?  The only thing it does, as I have already said, is to prevent the too-easy formation of trade unions in the country and to compel those who are unsuitable and those which are giving unsatisfactory service to their members, as their records show, to seek amalgamation and incorporation with other bodies which have shown themselves to be in a better position to look after the workers of this country.</P>
    <P>It is quite true, perhaps&mdash;I refer to the dispute which took place between workers employed by the gas company &mdash;that one of the unions concerned in that dispute will have to seek amalgamation under the Bill.  That is quite probable; but if it does, let nobody be under any delusion.  It is not because that union has been well managed that it is in that position. Everybody knows the history of it.  Are we going to allow that sort of thing to go on?  Are we going to allow these men who cannot control their own people, because their own union affairs are not in order, to jeopardise the continuance of a vital service to this city? We cannot do it and I am not going to stand for it.  As I have said, one of the unions will have, perhaps, to go out of existence or to seek amalgamation when the Bill becomes law.  I think, bearing in mind what I have seen and bearing in mind what has transpired in the last few months, that this is not going to be any national loss.  It is not going to be any loss either to the unfortunate workers who had to maintain that organisation.</P>
    <P>We are told this is not an appropriate time for bringing in legislation of this sort.  How much longer are we going to tolerate the state of affairs which would permit incidents such as I have referred to to continue? Remember that the policies and actions of these unions are not controllable by the Irish Trade Union Congress.  I do not for a moment suggest&mdash;and I want to be emphatic about this&mdash;that any responsible officer of the Trade Union Congress would stand over incidents of the kind I have referred to.  In fact, I have proof that they would not, but they cannot of their own power stop them.  I know they would be willing to do so, but <Col N="2399" /> they have no powers to deal with the sort of people who are responsible for this sort of thing and accordingly somebody else must step in and deal with it.</P>
    <P>I am told that this is not an appropriate time to introduce this Bill.  The Government has been often blamed, wrongly blamed in my view, for not acting expeditiously, for not taking time by the forelock in regard to certain problems.  Are we going to wait until we are faced with the confusion, the readjustments and the difficulties which will be the inevitable consequence of this present war before we act in this matter?  Are we going to wait until we find ourselves faced with the demobilisation of 50,000 men from the Army?  Are we going to wait until we find, as I have said already, that our position in our export markets has become more difficult and until we shall have to find new markets to compensate ourselves for those which we may lose?  Are we going to wait until we have had to put our economy on a wholly different basis before we start dealing with this problem, or ask the unions themselves to deal with it? Remember, I am not saying to these unions: &ldquo;You must amalgamate into one big union&rdquo; or &ldquo;You must form ten or 20 industrial groups.&rdquo; What I am doing is, I am creating a condition in which those unions which are inefficient, ineffective and, in my view, are unfit to exist, will have to consider their position in relation to other trade unions and will have to make up their minds which of them they are going to ask to take them in.</P>
    <P>I want to see a strong well-organised trade union movement in this country. I want to see a similar body in a position to act on behalf of the employers in this country.  I think it is only when you can get responsible organisations negotiating and acting on behalf of these two principal fundamental elements in our economy that you are going to get that responsibility, that judgment and sagacity, which make for industrial peace.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out that while we have had compulsory arbitration in New Zealand and compulsory arbitration in Australia, and while such <Col N="2400" /> systems have been there for a long time, they have not succeeded in preventing industrial disputes. I have pointed to the fact that in Sweden, apparently, an industrial court has been effective, and its effectiveness has been ascribed by experienced judges in the International Labour Office to the fact that there exist in Sweden strong, effective and efficient organisations of workers and employers who meet, as was indicated by Senator O Buachalla and Senator Magennis, around a council table as equals, knowing each other's strength and not anxious to put an issue to the final test, but anxious only to seek a compromise which will be satisfactory to both sides and which, because they both represent the community, will therefore serve the interests of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>That is the aim I have in view in introducing this Bill.  It is the only solid foundation upon which we can build industrial progress, industrial prosperity and industrial peace in this country.  Nothing can be built on shifting sand and, however the Irish trade union movement is to evolve, whether the issues it raises with other interests in our economy are to be settled by arbitration, conciliation or otherwise, it must have a solid foundation, as the trade union movement both of employers and workers has in Sweden.  That foundation does not exist here.  There is no denying that fact but I think, if this Bill is adopted, we shall have enabled the trade union movement to lay that foundation and to ensure its continuous and happy development in this country.</P>

      <P>No.  The Minister's speech was the concluding speech.  The main question before the House is: &ldquo;That the Trade Union Bill, 1941, be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  To that question the two amendments set forth on the Order Paper have been proposed. I am now putting the question in the form I announced at the beginning of the debate, namely: &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand part of the Question.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>It was suggested yesterday here, when I was unfortunately absent, that I had in some way committed an abuse of the processes of the House by tabling a motion and not proceeding with it, although a particular hour had been fixed for its discussion.  I should like to explain that I had every intention of proceeding with the motion and that I only refrained from doing so, much against my own inclination, because of eleventh hour representations by certain Senators who sympathised with it in substance, but believed it would lead to undesirable statements being made and because of inquiries of my own afterwards which tended to show that these apprehensions were well-founded. No inconvenience was caused to the Taoiseach as he was informed of the situation before the end of his ordinary office hours.</P>
      <P>I am sorry if any inconvenience was caused to the Seanad, but the arrangement of the hour for the discussion of the motion had not been made to suit me, but to suit others, and had, in fact, come upon me as a surprise when I heard of it yesterday afternoon.  I wish to add that I dissent from the view that there is anything improper in tabling motions, even when there is no definite intention to proceed with them.  I believe it to be an established practice in democratic assemblies to use the formulation of motions as a method of crystallising opinion on matters of importance, but I repeat that I had every intention of proceeding with this motion, that it was inspired by a genuine and intense anxiety about the country's defences, and that I may still proceed with it at some future date.</P>
