    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>What we had here is the substitution in the Constitution for an Irish word of another word of narrower meaning.  The word is &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; in English, and in Article 17 it appears to mean tax-revenue.  I thought here it meant all kinds of revenue, but the Irish text certainly gives it a meaning which is narrower. The word &ldquo;stáitchíos&rdquo; would appear to mean taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that there is a general principle that the revenue should be put into the Central Fund.  However, there may be exceptions to that.  The revenues are sent in to the Central Fund, but we have, for instance, as an example, the fees of the Veterinary College.  These fees do not come in directly.  They are treated as Appropriations-in-Aid, I think.  The general principle is that the tax revenue goes into the Central Fund, but there are certain proceeds which come in from the activities of a number of Departments, and they are put in as <Col N="1199" /> a set-off to that Department before they go to the Central Fund.  There is an example in the case of the Department of Agriculture.  There is a sum voted for the Veterinary College, and there are set off against it the fees for students.  There is another case in which all the revenue that comes in is not sent to the Central Fund.  On the other hand, there are the fees from the Passport Office.  That is not treated as an Appropriation-in-Aid to the Department of External Affairs, but as extra Exchequer receipts, and is sent in directly.</P>
      <P>For example, suppose you have in one of the schools of the Department of Agriculture a certain amount of produce, which would be exhibited at some exhibition, and a certain sum of money might be secured for it.  That sum of money does not, in practice, go directly to the Exchequer.  It is used as an Appropriation-in-Aid for the use of the Department.  The feeling is that the word &ldquo;fagháltas&rdquo; has a wider meaning than the interpretation which has been given to the other.  In practice, what happens is that the proceeds of customs and excise and taxes of that sort go into the Central Fund, but not every receipt goes in directly to the Central Fund.  Portion of it is set off against Departmental expenditure, and in the Estimate it appears as an Appropriation-in-Aid.  That is the only case where it really does not go into the Central Fund; in the other case it goes in as an extra Exchequer receipt. For example, the whole of the expenses of the Passport Office are borne by the Department, and then the fees from the Passport Office are treated as extra Exchequer receipts.  The real intention here was to use a word that would be of narrow interpretation similar to the word &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; in English.  In the other cases, where the word &ldquo;stáitchíos&rdquo; is used, it was felt to be better to give the narrower sense. I think, on the whole, it gives a word in Irish, which corresponds to the more or less restricted meaning we have used it for elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a question with regard to Article 17, sub-section <Col N="1200" /> (2).  The entity referred to seems to be the same.  I may have taken the thing wrongly.  I presume that moneys coming in from the Veterinary College are covered by the form of words &ldquo;appropriation of revenue or other income&rdquo;.  It says &ldquo;all revenues of the State from whatever source arising&rdquo;.  Is it a fact that Article 11 and Article 17, sub-section (2) relate to the same thing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that we would be able to get complete agreement, because you have a general principle more or less with certain exceptions.  The general principle is that the revenue of the State should be put into the Central Fund.  The question is, are you to do that and insist that there should be no subtraction? It is really a question of book-keeping.  If you want to insist on the principle that all moneys must come into the Central Fund you would have no such thing as Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>You would alter the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>You can work on that system.  That is the general system, but there are certain expenses which have in practice been treated as Appropriations-in-Aid.  I think they have the same system in Britain, but I do not know very much about the system there.  It is a matter of convenience in practice that some of these should be regarded as Departmental receipts, and that you should subtract these.  It is a case of lessening the current amount of the Departmental expenses.  For instance, take the case of an agricultural college.  Say £10,000 came in and there was some £100,000 total expenses.  There was £10,000 coming in as receipts.  You have two ways in which that could be dealt with. You can get the £100,000 to appear in the Estimate as the expenses of the college and there would be no question of the receipts that come in.  They would go into the Central Fund, but it would appear that the expenses of the college were £100,000, whereas if £10,000 came from the produce of the farm or something like that, they subtract <Col N="1201" /> that as an Appropriation-in-Aid, and you see only £90,000 appearing as the expenses of the college.  Which is the better way of presenting it to the public in order to present a clear picture of the expenses?  That is what we are dealing with.  If we want to see the cost of the Department of External Affairs to the country we can subtract from the apparent expenses, salaries, etc., anything the Department gets in as a result of its activities such as passport fees, etc.  That can be done, but it is not done.</P>
      <P>The practice is to put down the expenses of the Department of External Affairs as so much and then you may see in some note that there is an anticipation that a certain amount will be received in passport fees.  It is not there and then subtracted.  It does not really matter which of the two methods is adopted, but a practice has grown up which has been found satisfactory and we do not propose to alter it.  The only question is what words you will use.  Take the word &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; which has been used.  The word &ldquo;revenue&rdquo;, if used in the broad sense, means everything that comes into the State, whether it be fees or the proceeds of a sale of agricultural produce.  Are you going to take that as revenue?  Apparently a narrower sense has been given to the word &ldquo;revenue&rdquo;, in some instances. In one case it means all that comes in and in the other case it means the net sum that comes in.  This is necessary to make it accord with practice. It is merely an effort to make the English and the Irish meaning accord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree that if we take it that some things are subtracted, then the word &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; normally refers only to the normal revenue of the State and does not include moneys received for lands or buildings The word &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; is used at two points in the Constitution.  At one point the Article says: &ldquo;All revenues of the State from whatever source arising&rdquo;.  If you are going to give a narrower meaning to the word &ldquo;revenues&rdquo;&mdash;this is in the form of a query&mdash;it means money from whatever source arising, whether from income-tax <Col N="1202" /> or a tax on silk stockings.  The Taoiseach has explained that as used in Article 11, the phrase, although it says: &ldquo;all revenues of the State from whatever source arising&rdquo; excludes such things as money received from passport fees.  In the other Article we have the phrase: &ldquo;The appropriation of revenue or other public money&rdquo;.  I understand the whole method of accounting in the Government, but if I take what the Taoiseach said then I shall read the English phrase &ldquo;Appropriation of revenues or other public moneys&rdquo; to mean any money whatever coming into the State.  If I take the Taoiseach's interpretation then &ldquo;all revenues of the State from whatever source arising&rdquo; does not include a whole series of sums of money that come into the State.  That is how I read the English.  As to the meaning of &ldquo;fagháltas&rdquo; and &ldquo;stát-chíos&rdquo;, I can see there is a difference.  It may well be that the Taoiseach has indicated the difference in the Irish which is not indicated in English.  If what he says is correct then I presume I am right in saying that as far as Article 11 is concerned, it only refers to what in the narrow sense can be described as revenue, or does it refer to something which in quantity, source and variety, would be different to what is referred to in Article 17?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could convince Senator Fitzgerald if the Taoiseach will allow me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 11 says: &ldquo;All revenues of the State from whatever source arising&rdquo;.  At first sight, you have the word &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; corresponding to the Irish &ldquo;fagháltas&rdquo;.  Take revenue in the narrow sense.  You can have revenues in the narrow sense from whatever source arising.  There is no doubt you can use &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; in Article 11 in the narrow sense.  You <Col N="1203" /> then go on to Article 17, Section 2. Before I pass from Article 11, perhaps I should point out that there is the qualification &ldquo;subject to such exceptions as may be provided by law&rdquo; so that it is quite clear you are not bound in the Constitution.  You can by legislation change that.  In Article 17, Section 2, it is set out: &ldquo;Dáil Eireann shall not pass any vote or resolution, and no law shall be enacted for the appropriation of revenue or other public moneys unless the purpose of the appropriation shall have been recommended to Dáil Eireann by a message from the Government signed by the Taoiseach&rdquo;.  Here it is &ldquo;appropriation of revenue or other public moneys&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is distinguished there, but the form of words englobes two things.  Suppose by what is meant in the narrow sense, revenue, we get £10,000,000 a year, and suppose form these other heterogeneous sums, we get another £2,000,000 or a total of £12,000,000, what I want to know is, does Article 11 refer only to the £10,000,000, and does Article 17 refer to the £12,000,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me it refers in both cases to the narrow sense.  It is a question of the kind of accounting carried out in the Department of Finance.  I see no difficulty at all here in saying: &ldquo;Dáil Eireann shall not pass any vote or resolution for the appropriation of revenue or other public moneys&rdquo;.  That means the net amount that comes in, revenue in the narrow sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If you carry on with the quotation you will see my point: &ldquo;the appropriation of revenue or other public moneys&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's point is that if the word &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; is consistent with public moneys, there is no use in bringing in the latter phrase.  If we were using revenue in the broad sense, there would be no meaning in &ldquo;or other public moneys&rdquo;, because revenue would be the complete receipts of every kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entirely at one <Col N="1204" /> with the Taoiseach, but if you go back to Article 11 it says: &ldquo;All revenue of the State from whatever source arising&rdquo;.  If the word &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; only refers to moneys that come in in a certain way, to the whole of the £10,000,000 to which I have already referred, then that Article 11 cannot englobe, incorporate or relate to the extra £2,000,000 received from heterogeneous sources.  The other Article says: &ldquo;the appropriation of revenue or other public moneys&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That phrase adverts to other public moneys as well as revenue.  Article 11 says &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; and if it means revenue in the narrow sense, well and good.  That only refers to the difference of source as between a tax on tea and income-tax or death duties. But if Article 11 is intended, by enlarging words &ldquo;of from whatever source arising&rdquo;, to refer to the total sum that I previously indicated as £12,000,000, then I think that the word &ldquo;revenue&rdquo;, as used in one Article, is in one sense and, as used in another, is in another sense.  Does the total sum in any given year referred to in Article 11 amount to a different sum from that referred to in Article 17?  If it does, then the thing is quite clear; if not, it is misleading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would seem that we are using the word &ldquo;narrow&rdquo; for convenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>And also for convenience I use the two figures £12,000,000 and £10,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that there is no confusion at all.  In fact, by 17 (2) it seems to me that it was clearly borne in mind that &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; was used in the narrow sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to say what the original intention was, but it is a fact now that they fit in quite clearly in the narrow sense.  The only thing is that, in Article 11, the original intention was that it should be as broad as &ldquo;fagháltas&rdquo; in Irish, but it brings the English words into closer contact and gives the same significance to the word in Article 11 <Col N="1205" /> and Article 17.  If we use it in the narrow sense, therefore in Irish we should use it in the narrow sense. Therefore there is no confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, but if the word &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; in both cases refers to the narrow meaning, it is not enlarged and made a greater sum by those additional words &ldquo;from whatever source arising&rdquo;.  If revenue means the narrow thing, then no matter what source it arises from, it merely means the totality of that sum; it does not include the additional sums from the heterogeneous sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I find it very difficult to go back to the original but it is quite clear.  When you read this first, it is quite possible for a person who does not know the accounting system in the State to read this Article 11 and think that every single sum of money in any way owed to the State, or which becomes the property of the State, would be put into the Central Fund.  But in fact that is not done, and, therefore, you cannot make this correspond with the practice if you use that wide meaning.  But you can have a variety of revenues in the narrow sense too, and it means that these net sums that come into the Central Fund, no matter where they come from, will have to be appropriated by law so as to prevent the Executive from playing round with the sums they receive, or using them for purposes not already sanctioned by Parliament.  I am not saying what was the original meaning, because I would have to admit that if I read it at first sight without knowing the accounting system of the State I would be inclined to use &ldquo;revenue&rdquo; in the broad sense. &ldquo;From whatever source arising&rdquo; gave the impression of a broad sense, whereas, we find in practice, the phrases are quite consistent, but there was one flaw, the word &ldquo;fagháltas&rdquo; in Irish suggested the wider meaning of revenue, whereas, in fact, to be consistent, we would have to use the narrow word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, providing it is recognised that Article 11 will be interpreted to refer to a different sum from Article 17.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is quite plain now, State revenue and State receipts are two different things.  In this Constitution the word &ldquo;receipts&rdquo; is translated &ldquo;fágháltas&rdquo; and the translators availed of the amending Bill to keep the word &ldquo;fágháltas&rdquo;, including tax revenue, fees paid in veterinary colleges, and such things as money paid for State produce at shows, and they are using the word &ldquo;cíos&rdquo; or &ldquo;stáitchíos&rdquo;' in the narrow meaning of revenue.  I think it is a good idea.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On reference No. 2. I do not know if it is necessary to explain it.  The point there was that in the Constitution there was no provision made for the possibility of death occurring between the time the President was elected and the time he took office.  This is only to make sure that if the President has been elected and should die in the intervening period between his election and his taking office, there should be a new election.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it is necessary to explain each of these.  In the case of No. 3 there was a double thing to be corrected in regard to the Irish text.  First of all, the Oireachtas was used in Irish, whereas it should be the two Houses, because the President is part of the Oireachtas, and he could not send a message to himself.  The next thing is the word used for message.  We want to suggest a message different from that intended.  This was only a message.  In the broad sense it might be a message on the radio, or a speech published, or he might come in person to the two Houses and address them. So they have used this word to give it a broad meaning.  It is used occasionally as meaning &ldquo;address&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>On reference No. 7.  I am sure this is not really relevant, because this is merely improving the Irish.  What we are doing now does show that if the present vocational organisation commission makes certain recommendations they cannot override the provisions about the Seanad that we are making in this Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot override it, but the Constitution is sufficiently wide to make it possible for them to fit any scheme likely to be evolved into it.  This is only remedying an oversight.  What happened was, there was an amendment in the Dáil with regard to the constitution of the Seanad and there was a reference in the original draft to a certain type of electorate and that phrase happened to stick on without any real reason for it.</P>

      <P>There is a vocational commission sitting and it may or may not make a proposal for a council of corporations which, strictly speaking, should not have any political function whatever.  If it does that I maintain that it would not be possible&mdash;taking what I call the ordinary intelligent idea of a vocational system whereby corporations meet in council&mdash;to have that when you have sub-divided the idea of corporations.  The idea of corporations is that, as they are externally known, they have representatives and consist of both employer and worker, both labour and capital.  Here, quite contrary <Col N="1208" /> to the whole corporative idea, we abstract from the corporation labour, as a separate entity, whereas the whole idea is to create a unified entity from the two bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that that is so, either.  Do not imagine that you are going to have a corporative organisation overnight.  Unless you have a complete and absolute revolution, it is almost certain that you will come by easy stages to the corporative form of organisation and it will be all the better for that.  Take, as an example, the agricultural industry.  It is extremely difficult to see how that can be made into a corporative entity. It may happen that you will have a section of labour which you may wish to have represented and which may not easily fit into the corporate idea at all. A portion of our economic life may be made into corporate form and there may be an outside portion which may not be so made.  This gives you an opportunity to have a proper balance. We cannot wait all the time for things to happen.</P>
      <P>If there is a new organisation of the State, which would warrant a completely new House which would not fit in with this Constitution, there is a way of changing the Constitution.  It might be as well that a big change of that sort would be referred to the people directly.  It is a mistake to think that this is an absolutely rigid Constitution.  It is not.  We are not a tremendously big community.  We have only about 3,000,000 people and one would like to avoid as much cost as possible, but, by referendum you can have the Constitution amended.  Therefore, we need not hesitate to pass the Articles in the Constitution referring to the Seanad simply because a commission may suggest a type of corporative organisation which, if it did, would take a couple of years to bring about. In the meantime, State institutions must go on.  This provision does not tie us up for all time.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach so far as he goes.  If the Constitution laid down that, in such a body as we are, there should not be <Col N="1209" /> representation of labour, it might be as harmful as if it were put in.  Very often, you have the phrase: &ldquo;The Dáil shall consist of representatives elected in such a manner as shall be prescribed by law.&rdquo;  I cannot see why this subsidiary detail in relation to the second House should be in the Constitution. In relation to the Dáil, you do not say that members shall be elected by constituencies one of which shall be Kildare-Carlow.  You leave that to be settled by ordinary legislation.  Once you decide that there shall be a second body, you can, if you like, lay down some general principle regarding it in the Constitution though, personally, I like to have as little as possible in a Constitution.  To lay down that what, at one moment in our history, seems to be the most apt system shall be adopted and to give that the seal of permanency by incorporating it in the Constitution seems to me to be an unwise course.  I do not say that we are going to be handicapped by that in a month or in a year, but I do feel that the Constitution should contain only what is necessary for continuity of government and for the protection of the rights of the human person.  We are arbitrarily laying down a system here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As regards reference 10, the intention was to make sure that the necessary number of days was <Col N="1210" /> given to the President for the signing of a Bill.  There was some dispute as to whether three clear days would be given or not.  A Bill is presented to the President on a certain day.  It was considered unwise to commence counting the period from the date on which the Bill was passed, because it might be passed on a Saturday and it might not be presented to the President until Monday. Time begins to run from the day on which it is presented.  The President cannot sign before the fifth day and must sign not later than the seventh day.  The purpose of that will be seen by reference to the Constitution.  Time must be allowed to enable a petition to be presented These periods of time are chosen to give a sufficient period for consideration to the President and to allow things which might have to be done in the interval, by way of petition or otherwise, to be done.</P>

      <P>In reference No. 11, we are repeating what has already been provided.  In the event of a conflict between the text in the official and in the national language, the text in the national language is to prevail.  I do think that that, from the sentimental point of view, is quite charming, but we ought to face up to facts.  Here we are dealing with a divergence of opinion regarding the Irish and English texts. Take the way the Constitution was debated in the Dáil, and the way we are debating it here.  There are men with what is called a very good knowledge of Irish in this House, but will anybody suggest that they gave to the matter in the Irish text the care and brought to bear on it the specialised learning, as one might say, in phraseology that is brought to bear upon the official text by the draftsmen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government employs official draftsmen, who are not only lawyers, but who have specialised in law in the matter of drafting.  You then bring along somebody with a good knowledge of Irish.  I have at the moment men on each side of me with a good knowledge of Irish.  These men also know the English language.  I do not want to hurt their feelings when I say I think they know English not less well than <Col N="1211" /> they know Irish.  They know the subtleties, the distinctions of words and meaning of phrase in English not less well than they know those in Irish. Would it be suggested&mdash;now, I do not want anyone to take offence&mdash;that anybody here who has an excellent knowledge of Irish would be an appropriate person to employ as the official draftsman in English?  Remember that he, whoever he is, does know English not less well than he knows Irish.  He has at least as good a knowledge, but you do not employ him as a draftsman knowing that, in the phraseology of a legal document, you must aim at a very exact, precise and definite meaning. That definite meaning in legal documents is usually attained by the fact that you use words and phrase forms that&mdash;through long usage historically and by legal precedence&mdash;have been known to relate to just this precise condition and not to any variation of it to left or right.  The English language &mdash;not by anything innate in it, but by the fact that over centuries it has been used for certain purposes, while the Irish language has not&mdash;is capable of that precision.</P>
    <P>Can any Senator here say that one can express in Irish any exact and precise meaning as you usually can express it in English?  I would not contest that, but I say that when he has done all that in regard to any legal complex matter and when I present what he has written to anybody who knows Irish as well as he does, No. 1 cannot guarantee to me that the form of words he has used must of necessity convey exactly the idea he wished to express to the other man.  I do not say that the English text should remain for ever the appropriate one, but let us face facts.</P>
    <P>Is there anybody in this country who has a more intimate knowledge of the Irish language than he himself, or a person of his ordinary education and standard, has of English?  I do not believe it.  Is it possible for anybody to have also that peculiar qualification in draftsmanship which is possessed by the Government draftsman?  It is not, because the material is not there.  The Government draftsman works upon the <Col N="1212" /> fact that, generation after generation, laws have been enacted, considered, discussed and forms of words have been established as meaning one thing and not another.</P>
    <P>The drafting of Bills in Irish is a very good work, because it may happen as time goes on&mdash;it can only be by time&mdash;that that precision would be possible.  The Taoiseach said a while ago that it would be bad suddenly to switch off to a corporative system.  It would also be bad suddenly to establish a strict definition of words in Irish. Normally, that definition is built up by historical usage.  In drafting a Bill in Irish one has to ensure a certain uniformity.  One has to establish the meaning of certain phrases, and one has to deal at the same time with an enormous amount of legislative ideas. At the present moment, we have not got that fixed phraseology in Irish, and I am pretty well prepared&mdash;though not completely prepared&mdash;to challenge anyone, with this document&mdash;the Constitution which I have in front of me&mdash;to say that what is written in Irish necessarily means exactly what it does mean to any person who has the best competent knowledge of Irish, without having read the English text.</P>
    <P>You can employ the best draftsmen to draft a Bill in Irish, but they necessarily break new ground.  They must, in an arbitrary way, decide that a certain form of words means this and not some other thing.  That has been done already with other modern languages, but not with Irish.  It may be that I am making a fuss about nothing. The case may not arise but, if you say that the Irish text is the text to be known to the law, you are creating an impossible position.  It would be quite simple for two lawyers or two judges to declare contrary opinions, and both have the same amount of evidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Not to the same extent. Wherever they do, it is admitted that it is undesirable.  It is obviated by the fact that, over generations, laws have been written in a given language with a precise and exact meaning for <Col N="1213" /> different phrases.  That has not been the case in Irish&mdash;not because of any inferiority, but because of a different historical experience in one language. I do not wish to prohibit the Irish text from ever being considered.  However, we are passing a Bill in this House where the majority do not understand Irish.</P>
      <P>It has previously been passed in the Dáil, where the majority do not understand Irish, and it will be discussed in the courts, where the majority of judges and lawyers do not understand Irish; and I do say that that is an unwise procedure.  It has a sentimental appeal to people who love to talk about the Irish language, if not in Irish; but it is blind idealism when it takes the form of refusing to accept something which is a fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator appears to be unwilling to recognise things which are facts.  There has been a body of men devoted solely, for a period of 20 years, to this task of finding phraseology&mdash;words, for the most part&mdash;to enable the Irish language to express in a very definite form all the ideas we require to bring forward in Acts of Parliament.  My own belief is that the Irish language is much more precise.  English is generally of a vague character and lends itself to a variety of meanings.  That is one of the reasons given by some critics of poetry, for example, in regard to English poetry.  It is suggested that French is not so good because the language is not so vague and does not enable you to go off so easily into the vague realms which please some people in that respect.  I think that, first of all, there must be a conflict.  You have the two texts.  You must have a conflict between the two and you will not have a conflict between the two unless the two are not capable of having the same precise meaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach says there will not be a conflict unless the two texts are not capable of having the same meaning.  May I suggest a correction there&mdash;unless the two texts are capable of having different meanings? You cannot say you may have a <Col N="1214" /> conflict when the two languages are not capable of having the same meaning; you can have a conflict when they are capable of having a different meaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going into this with the subtlety of the Senator. What I say is there must be a conflict between the texts before a difficulty arises and, I would say, a conflict where the meaning in one cannot be reconciled with the meaning in the other.  If that conflict arises, then the Irish text is to be taken as the determining text.  There is a part of the statement which is quite true, and that is, that as the Dáil and Seanad are constituted at present, although there is quite a number who can read the two languages&mdash;I do not know the numbers so I cannot say definitely&mdash;it is possible that a majority in both are not competent to understand and satisfy themselves that there are expressed in Irish the ideas they want to have in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested in the Dáil that in order to satisfy themselves there was no trick being played upon them in any way they should set up a small committee, a non-Party committee, of those who were competent to read the Irish language, so as to see whether the words that were written there expressed the idea or not; they would satisfy themselves that, in so far as it is possible for two texts of two languages to express identically the same thing, it was done.  That suggestion was not carried out and I think for this reason, that it was felt that in case there was any attempt being made to put over, so to speak, in Irish something which was not conveyed in English, there were enough people of all the Parties who would immediately see such a thing and bring it to light. They were also probably affected by the assurance which I have that this text had been very carefully examined; first of all it evolved with Irish and English side by side being used as the medium for the expression of ideas, then when it was coming into the final stages we got representatives of the translation department precisely to see that the words that were used were consistent; that nothing was brought <Col N="1215" /> in by amateur draftsmen which was contrary to the practice that had grown up and the words that had been used in the Acts of Parliament, so as to bring about uniformity in so far as it was possible.  As a result of these assurances, the Dáil did not set up a special commission.</P>
    <P>I do not know what action the Seanad is going to take, but the Dáil did not set up a commission.  I would have welcomed it.  I would have preferred it.  I thought it was more in keeping with the general duty of the House in passing an Act which was being passed in both languages that that should be done.  But I think if ever a beginning is to be made it is about time it should be made now. Remember, there has been preparation for doing this sort of work, 20 years of preparation, by a very competent body of people who have devoted themselves to this sort of work.  There is also the fact that the English language is not a very precise language.  You find from time to time when there is something you want to know accurately that there is ambiguity.  I think in the Irish language you have not nearly as much ambiguity.  If a layman is writing a will it is better for him to avoid the phraseology of the lawyers.  He will probably put his foot in it if he attempts to adopt their phraseology.  If you are writing a will you write it in simple language.  The simpler language you use the better.  That is what is happening here in Irish.  There is very simple, direct language used.  I think in the case particularly of a Constitution it is not the Parliamentary Draftsman you want.  The Parliamentary Draftsman in this case agreed absolutely.  In the original stage I put it to him that it was better that the Constitution should not be drafted by the Parliamentary Draftsman at all, and he agreed with me because, if it were drafted as an Act of Parliament, we would have to approach it in a different way.</P>
    <P>The Constitution is intended to be given, as far as possible, in broad terms and in simple language, and I believe that for the Constitution here the Irish language, in the state we have reached for the drafting of Bills and so on and its application to law, <Col N="1216" /> is just as fit to express ideas as the English language.  The only difficulty we have is the difficulty that it is being passed by the two Houses, and there are members of the two Houses who do not know Irish and, therefore, it may be said that they are passing an Act without full knowledge of what they are doing.  But most of us have been for a considerable time members of one House or the other, or both, and we all know there are many votes given in both Houses, unfortunately, by members who have not studied closely the text of the Bills that they are passing.</P>

      <P>That is the position. Even though it is something that one naturally deplores, it is something that we have to take into account, and there is nothing so very exceptional being done here.  But I would suggest, if the Seanad wants to do it, to set up a small committee to go over the Irish text and to examine it from that point of view.  Remember, the fault is not that the Irish language is not capable of doing all this.  I am certain it is. It is not that the Irish language, independently of this English text, has not the meanings that it will have when compared with the English text.  It might be said that perhaps a person who has never read a law measure or any of the Acts might not agree with that, but if anybody who has been studying a translation of Acts of Parliament takes up that Constitution he will read it without any doubt without any reference to the English text.  But if he has, as he will have, the English text at his side and if he does know the English language as well as the Irish language, then any difficulty he may have is simply a question of: Is this Irish phrase capable of the meaning which is attributed to it in the English phrase?  I am assuring the House that the greatest care has been taken to see that that is so.  The real fault is that the Houses are purporting to pass something which every member does not thoroughly understand.  That <Col N="1217" /> is a fault.  It is a pity, but it is not a thing that happens in this case only because, as I say, it is happening in the case of English every day.</P>

      <P>As to reference No 15, this amendment provides that when a matter relating to the Constitution comes before the Supreme Court, only one judgment shall be pronounced, and a dissenting judge shall not have power to express his views.  Is there any argument in favour of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some.  In the Dáil there were arguments on the opposite side.  Apparently there are two schools of thought on this matter, as to whether in certain cases it is desirable that each judge should deliver his judgment separately, or that the judgment of the court as a whole only should be given.  The reason for only one judgment is that it gives certainty. In that sense it is the judgment. It does not lead to canvassing and saying there was another view taken by another judge.  For instance, in the Court of Criminal Appeal, the judgment is by a majority, and only one judgment is given.  Supposing, for instance, a man is condemned to death, only one judgment is given and it prevents uncertainty.  The object is to get a decision.  If you had three or five judges, the chief function is still to get a decision, and if there is a decision in the Court of Criminal Appeal, there is only one decision in order that there should be certainty, and to avoid canvassing as to the different views of different judges.  It is so in the law and in regard to questions in relation to the Constitution, whether an appeal is referred to the court of law by the President, or whether it comes to the Supreme Court as a matter of ordinary litigation, it is desirable that there should be a judgment, and that the judgment should be determined and fixed, and that we should not have canvassing going on as we had on a previous occasion, one person saying that a judge of the High Court has given his opinion that the law is unconstitutional, and then it was decided by the majority of the Supreme Court that it is constitutional.  There would be counting of heads, and people saying <Col N="1219" /> that the matter was not settled at all.</P>
      <P>What you want in these cases is that there should be a definite decision.  If that decision is such that the public interest does not appear to be served by it, legislation can be enacted to change it.  If it appears not to correspond with the public interest the Constitution will have to be changed, but it is important that there should be a definite decision, and that we should have no canvassing and counting of heads as occurred in the other cases.  That is the point of view from which we have acted.  That is the basis &mdash;the definiteness and certainty of the decision.  The opposite point of view was expressed in the Dáil, in which it was suggested that it was a pity that we should kill this canvassing and discussion that would go on if the opinions of the different judges were to be given.  It was suggested that it would excite a great deal more interest in the Constitution and help to educate the people in regard to the nature of constitutional matters.  We felt it was far more important that we should have a definite judgment, and that if there is to be education of the public it should be in another way.  It was more important that there should be a definite decision.  The point of view that this has been framed from is the point of view of those who hold that the best thing is to get a definite decision, and that once the decision is there the less canvassing there is about it, the more certainty there is, the better.</P>

      <P>Surely, sir, in a country such as this the position is that what we would like best would be that the public should be interested in our laws, and above all should be interested in a fundamental document like the Constitution.  As they are a free people we are interested in our people being educated, and the best thing that could happen would be that they should have all the information that is available from the best sources with regard to their own laws.  It is, I understand, desirable in the case of a Court of Criminal Appeal decision that the decision should be given <Col N="1220" /> clearly, and that no dissenting judgment should be given, but in this case it may be a matter of comparative unimportance or a matter of great importance which does not involve death, and it seems to me much more desirable that we should have not only the decision but the reasons for the decision and dissenting judgments.  I see very little reason for preventing dissenting judges from stating their views.</P>
      <P>Those who would be interested, I am afraid they would be generally a minority of the public, in constitutional law and the progress and well-being of the Constitution of the State, should surely have available the views of the Supreme Court on matters of this kind.  I think An Taoiseach is unintentionally clouding the issues when he said what we need is a clear and definite decision.  It is quite possible to have a clear and definite decision, to have the reasons for it, and to make the law operative and, at the same time, to have what you always get from the judges a temperate statement of another point of view.</P>
      <P>It would be a good thing, if only from the angle of education, if the people took an interest in politics.  In spite of the abuse of politics that we hear in this country our greatest defect is that there is not enough interest taken in politics.  I think it is fair to say that hardly anybody is interested in the Constitution.  The education of the minority is very important.  It very often happens that two judges reach the same decision, but reach it by different roads, and from the point of view of legal education, and not only of legal education but of political education, which perhaps is the rock upon which democracy has foundered, it would be a very good thing.  It is very important that the people should have respect for their Constitution and their courts, and if legal decisions are given, and the reasons for them given to the people, it will, at least, help to make them interested in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that informed discussion about such a matter as a Constitutional amendment or Bills that have passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas is a very desirable thing. <Col N="1221" /> What the Taoiseach desires to prevent is something which unfortunately he cannot prevent and which nobody in his position can prevent.  He wants to prevent people going around canvassing and saying: &ldquo;Aye, you had three in favour of this, but you had two against it.&rdquo;  Is not the Taoiseach, who knows the country pretty well, aware that where judges pronounce a majority judgment, those who are against the measure which has been approved by the Supreme Court will go round saying, and saying very effectively: &ldquo;I know so-and-so was against it, I know he thinks so-and-so.&rdquo;  Instead of having any effective counter to that kind of rumour, you will have complete silence.  I think instead of preventing ignorant, prejudiced and perhaps passionate discussion, this kind of provision will rather help that sort of rumour-mongering at which most people&mdash;and I think particularly our own people&mdash;are rather adept.  It is not a matter of vital importance but, at the same time, I think considering the system of government we have adopted it would be desirable that as much light as possible should be thrown on the proceedings of our Parliament and of our courts and on the reasons for which judicial decisions are arrived at.  Remember we have, in fact, adopted the main body of English law and that law depends to a very large extent upon judicial decision. There is no reason why we should adopt certain parts of it and not adopt other parts which in themselves are good.  I think the idea of looking at this from the viewpoint that we want a decision, and that we do not want anybody to canvass the reasons for the decision, is taking what may appear at first sight to be a practical view but which in reality is a very short-sighted view.  I think the people's interests in our courts and our Constitution should be stimulated as much as possible.  This is a step towards keeping them in ignorance and towards supporting rumour-mongering.  I think the original provision was much better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach spoke about canvassing in regard to the decision of the courts.  I want to say that the courts in this instance will be deciding what is the law, and that is <Col N="1222" /> something very different from what is a penal sanction applied to a given individual. Say that a question under Article 34 of the Constitution comes before the Supreme Court.  The Taoiseach seems to suggest that if you have two judges giving one opinion, and three giving another opinion, there is a lack of finality.  That is not the case.  Suppose a majority of the court says that a particular law is something which all commonsense tells you it is not, what is the effect of the decision of the three?  The effect of that decision is that the from of words in the Constitution means exactly what those three have said&mdash;in effect, these three in interpreting the law are making the law to mean that thing.  Therefore, there is no fear of not getting a decision, provided you have an uneven number of judges, which you will have. I object to the suggestion that if two judges give it as their opinion that a certain thing means A, and three others give it as their opinion that it means B, there is no final decision that it does mean B., just as much as if full legislative force were possessed by these three judges.  They are making law, by interpretation, if you like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Say, again, that the Government brings in a Bill here and I or any other Senator, perhaps Senator Buckley, may get up and make an absolutely overwhelming case against the Government's proposal.  It is then put to a vote and the &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; go in and vote for the Government against him. I myself might be supporting him and feel very strongly on the point, but am I going, after the Bill is enacted, to say that all the arguments were against the Government, and that quite a large section voted against it? That is altogether irrelevant.  The truth is that it is the law, and is binding upon me, and I am bound to obey it.  It is absolutely final.  No matter what I say here against a proposal of the Government, once it becomes the law I am bound to obey it.  I object to the Taoiseach's suggestion that where two judges hold a contrary opinion, there is no finality about the decision. You might just as well say that if the Government propose a Bill here there should be no speeches against it <Col N="1223" /> because people will be canvassing about it.  To my mind, that is a wrong understanding of the situation.</P>

      <P>I doubt whether there is any really adequate reason for this amendment.  If I were in the Taoiseach's place I would hardly have thought it worth while to introduce it. On the other hand, I see no strong objection to it.  The one point I want to make is that I believe it is mistaken psychology to say that the absence of the publication of dissentient judgments will kill interest in the Constitution. I happen to be one of those people who would read any judgments that would be published about the Constitution, but I think the man in the street, who you want to be more interested in the Constitution, would turn with a certain amount of aversion from reading accounts which included two or three judgments which tended to confuse him.  He would be more likely to read one judgment that put the decision clearly.</P>

      <P>There are two points of view on this, and it is very hard to surrender or give up the point of view. I am satisfied that on the whole it is better that it should be this way.  I understand the point of view of those opposed to it.  I did not, of course, say that reasons should not be given for the decision.  Of course there will be.  When a judge is summing up he will probably give reasons for his decision, not as his decision, but as the decision of the majority, and it is quite possible that in order to present the matter completely and fully he might also indicate in some from or other the various views and balance arrived at by his colleagues and by the majority.  Of course, I know that the decision would be reached by the majority, but it is the acceptance of that by the people as a thing that is definite and fixed and not as something that could be held to have meant something else, that I am anxious about.  Generally, about the question of education, that can be done in the court, if there is sufficient interest in it.  It will be in the proceedings in court and I presume there will be lawyers on both sides presenting the various points of view and there will be an opportunity there for <Col N="1224" /> the average person who wants to read about it.</P>
      <P>But I think you will agree that, if we were able to frame a Constitution about which there could be no second opinion, which would be so simple in its phraseology and so definite that there could be no question of any divergence of views, that would be the ideal Constitution.  If you want to have a lot of education about it, let us be vague and have cases in the courts every day and have a lot of intellectual exercise, but that would be very expensive and unsatisfactory from the point of view of the Constitution. As you cannot hope to get a document which will not give rise to a difference of opinion somewhere, let us go the nearest we can to it and try to get a definite decision, so that eventually it will be accepted by everybody as a definitely decided thing.  I can only give the point of view, and those who take a different point of view will provide the second of the two schools, and then I am afraid there is no convincing one or the other.  It is only a question of the decision which is best and we are presenting it in this form.</P>

    <P>The object is to provide some safeguard against any undue prolongation of the very extensive powers that are at present wielded by the Executive over the persons, the property, and even the minds of individual citizens. If the war were to come to an end to-morrow I, personally, would not be very apprehensive that the present Government would strive to continue the suspension of Constitutional guarantees for an unreasonable time. But the war may not end for years to come.  And by the time it does end it is possible that those who are holding Ministerial office may have had their minds, to some extent, warped and corrupted by too long a tenure of absolute power, or it may even go on so long that there will be quite different people occupying the seats of the mighty in this country, from those who occupy them to-day.  Furthermore, in this Bill, this eleventh-hour Bill for amending the Constitution, we are legislating for much more than the present moment.  It is, unfortunately, only too likely that in the future there will be other wars and other emergencies, and we have a duty to posterity not to make it too easy to smother liberty. It is all very well to say that the decision in these things must be left to the elected representatives of the <Col N="1226" /> people, and that they are the only ones to decide vital questions, and that nobody can ever &ldquo;guard the guardians&rdquo;; and I would certainly agree that sound instincts and traditions widely spread among the people about the essentials of freedom are worth more than any written Constitution.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, we have a written Constitution, and when you have a written Constitution, you naturally want to bring it into the fullest possible accord with your fundamental principles.  The very fact of having such a Constitution shows that you think that something can be done even indirectly to &ldquo;guard the guardians&rdquo;, and I think there is no doubt that the shape of a nation's institutions can have an important effect upon the possibility of government by a majority Party becoming either a racket or a tyranny.  Having, as we have, a Dáil, a Seanad and a President, and a legal Supreme Court with powers of interpretation, we have given ourselves a Constitution that can be described in the time-worn phrase as a Constitution of checks and balances. That has long been considered as one of the best safeguards against despotic rule, but a democratic majority can be as undesirably despotic as can an oligarchy or a tyranny. The difficulty always is to draw the line.  If you overdo your checks you have frustration and impotence which lead in the end to conditions even more fatal to individual freedom than despotism is.  I believe that that danger has been avoided in our Constitution, and it is the opposite danger, the danger of despotism, that is created by the suspension of constitutional guarantees. The proposal in my amendment is intended as a very mild sort of safeguard against despotism, and I do not think it has any tendency to create the danger of impotence leading on to anarchy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has spoken of the undesirability of a clash between the President and the Government on vital issues.  No doubt clashes are always undesirable in themselves, but they may sometimes be the lesser of two evils.  I agree that a deadlock is a thing that is fatal to the machinery of <Col N="1227" /> Government, but a clash is not the same thing as a deadlock, and this amendment provides for the solution of any clash by means of reference to the people.  If clashes are to be avoided at all costs there is no sense in having checks and balances at all. On the last day the Seanad met the Taoiseach said that one of the principal functions of the President was to act as a guardian of the Constitution for the people.  I assume that that was not mere empty rhetoric and, if not, it necessarily implied, at any rate, the possibility of a clash.  A watchdog that is kept gagged so that it cannot either bark or bite when burglars are reported in the neighbourhood is not really worth his keep and can serve no purpose except giving a false sense of security.</P>
    <P>Party discipline in Ireland, whether for good or evil, is very rigid, and that is a fact that causes a special danger to freedom.  Debates that take place behind closed doors at Party meetings often have more importance than open debates in the Dáil and Seanad; and it is significant that the travelling expenses of members attending such Party meetings are actually paid out of the public purse.  The proceedings of Parliament have not so much deliberative character as I would like to see, and they may have even less as time goes on.  Consequently the duty of the President to guard the Constitution for the people may some day become more onerous than it is at present.  I suggest to the Seanad that the case of these immense emergency powers the Government are asking us to continue after the actual war is over is surely a case where the President should be given some degree of responsibility.</P>

      <P>I do not think that there is any need for me to develop the arguments put forward in favour of the amendment.  I am fully in favour of this proposal.  When any body of men get used to despotic power, get used to getting things done by order and find that all the inconvenience attending upon Parliamentary debate can be thrust aside by special machinery, they are tempted <Col N="1228" /> to continue to perpetuate the luxury of such a state of affairs.  I do feel that some check on the lines suggested is necessary to the preservation of essential liberties in normal times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess that I have a very open mind on this matter.  There is, of course, the danger that, at a time of crisis, the body immediately responsible for the safety of the community and of the State would be deprived of those powers at a time when their deliberate opinion is that they were necessary to them.  On the other hand, there is the danger that people who have got accustomed to using quick ways may, as suggested by the last Senator, be tempted to continue using them long after the real need has passed.  I tried originally to get a solution by fixing a definite time&mdash;say six months or thereabouts&mdash; after the conflict had ceased, but you cannot indicate when the conflict has ceased.  It might be that just seven months would be required instead of six.  This suggestion of using the President is much better than any attempt to fix a period, such as six months.  There is a danger inasmuch as the President has not direct and immediate responsibility for the safety of the State, though he has responsibility in regard to the Constitution. It will, of course, be argued that anybody who comes to the office of President will have experience of public affairs and will not arrive at a decision without consulting the Council of State, which is so constituted that it contains members of different Parties, men of wisdom in public affairs and men versed in the law.  If his only thought was the safety of the community and if he were honestly coming to a sound opinion, after consulting the Council of State, he would have to approve of the continuance of the powers.  In that case, there would not be any clash or, if there were, it would be the fault of the Administration. On the other hand, the Administration has the responsibility.  If you have two bodies who are both interested in one thing only&mdash;the safety of the State and the community&mdash;and if they differ, the clash will have to be settled in the way indicated here&mdash;by <Col N="1229" /> way of plebiscite.  You are going to have a plebiscite taken in conditions of such a character that the Executive believes that even the Constitution should not operate.  Is that a time in which a plebiscite can profitably be taken?  Assuming for the moment that the Executive are acting in good faith, as the President is, the clash has to be settled at a time when, in the opinion of the Executive or Administration, there is such a danger to the State that the emergency powers which they have had during the war situation should be continued.  It is very difficult to decide in this case.</P>
      <P>I must say that I am leaning to accepting, not this particular amendment, but some modification of it.  I know that those who think that anything like a rigid Constitution is a mistake will be definitely opposed to that.  They will say: if you want to have good government, put responsibility in certain hands, hold them accountable and do not tie them up. If we were acting on that principle absolutely, we should have no Constitution other than the Legislature, supreme from day to day.  We have not acted on that principle and it would, probably, be more in accord with the general spirit of our Constitution to accept an amendment such as that which the Senator has suggested. There is, however, one thing I should like to do if we accepted a modification of this amendment.  In other cases, when legislation is sent to the people by way of referendum, the alternative of a general election is given to the Government.</P>
      <P>Assuming that the Government in power was the only body with a majority in Parliament, and that a decision adverse to them was arrived at by the people, you would have a conflict. You would have the people responsible without the powers that they felt were necessary to do their work properly.  You would have a clash between the policy expressed by the people and the policy which the majority of the members of the Parliament supported.  I am afraid that that would quickly lead to an election afterwards. Why should we not, if we are to use this way of settling the matter, give the alternative of an election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" /> Suppose, in the present crisis, there was a situation in which the majority of Parliament felt they were being so hampered that the safety of the State was actually involved.  They might have to go to the people to get the strength and the powers necessary safely to steer the State through a crisis such as the present.  If it happened that the President, acting in good faith, wanted to have the period of emergency ended, and the Government, with its knowledge and experience, was of opinion that it could not carry on in these circumstances, you would be obliged, if the people decided in favour of the President's point of view, to have an election, so that you might as well face an election in the first instance.  If we are to accept this proposal, we shall, I think, have to provide for that.  I am prepared to consider the matter if any strong body of opinion in the House supports the Senator's view, and, in that event, on Report Stage, I am prepared to bring in an amendment of the kind indicated.  I think that we would have to bring in, side by side with this, the other suggestion that there could be the alternative of an election.  In other words, if the President came to the decision&mdash;having heard the Council of State&mdash;that the period of the emergency should end, then the Government should have the choice of letting that matter be settled by a plebiscite within a certain time, or having an election within that time, and then a vote of Dáil Eireann. A definite time would have to be fixed. It is Dáil Eireann that would have to settle it after the election by a vote saying whether the period of emergency would continue.  That should be effective in itself, no matter what view would be taken by the Second House.</P>
    <P>In considering this, we must consider that there must be a joint resolution by both Houses, and that it is possible for one House to hold it up. If this had been moved definitely by the Opposition in the Dáil, I certainly would be prepared to meet it on the general lines I am suggesting.  As it has passed through the Dáil, I am rather loth to change it, unless there is a strong opinion favouring it.  I have not consulted my colleagues on this <Col N="1231" /> matter at all, and would like to discuss it with them before the next meeting, if the change is to be introduced&mdash;and, in that case, I should like to be fortified with the views of other Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that I am very pleased with this amendment. I can see one difficulty about it.  Let us take it that this were accepted and became part of the Constitution.  The Administration in power at the time would, undoubtedly, be in touch with the affairs in the country much more than any individual.  There is no doubt that some people&mdash;for their own reasons or to obtain certain Party advantage&mdash;would be anxious that the President should be compelled to take this action.  I would feel rather sorry for the President at that time.  Undoubtedly, we would be overwhelmed with resolutions, recommendations and letters from all over the country, calling on him to put this into force.  If the country had expressed confidence in the Administration for the time being, it would be safer to leave the matter in their hands.</P>
      <P>If interested parties took advantage of this point, it might lead to confusion. Interested parties would bring pressure to bear on the President and it might be the cause of confusion at a time when confusion might be very dangerous.  Personally, while it might be desirable to have a check on the Administration, I think it is taking a rather pessimistic view of what the Administration in power might do.  I am not very much opposed to it, but believe it may be more dangerous than good.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I venture to suggest to the Senator that discontent that can express itself constitutionally is much less dangerous than discontent that cannot.  There is far more danger of explosion if we have a large number of people here who feel that the Oireachtas are abusing their position and that they have no Constitutional remedy or check upon them.  It is almost inconceivable that anybody elected to the position of President would force a referendum or general election on the country at a moment <Col N="1232" /> when it would palpably be dangerous to the very foundations of the State to hold one; but it is less inconceivable that some Government might hold office at some future date and some Parliament might exist&mdash;it has happened before in history&mdash;which wished to continue to keep the enormous powers over the individual that are given, by our present arrangements, to Government and to Parliament during the state of emergency.  That seems to be far and away the more real danger of the two.  For my part, I am quite content with the modification suggested by the Taoiseach, that it should be open to the Government to substitute a general election for a referendum. It seems to be perfectly reasonable, and I have no objection to raise to that.</P>
      <P>As regards the suggestion that the President is not a person who is in touch with realities and the actual dangers of the times, I would say that, if he is not, he ought to be.  I should think there was something wrong with our system of government if the Administration did not keep the President fully informed of all that was taking place&mdash;at any rate to the same extent as the British Government keep the British King informed.  If they do not do that, I do not think they are treating the office of President with proper respect or taking the advantage they might take of the existence of such a functionary.</P>
      <P>After all, the President is a man who can hold office for 14 years&mdash;two periods of seven years&mdash;and, in the course of that long term of office, he ought to acquire a great deal of valuable experience and&mdash;without of course any power to dictate the policy of the Government&mdash;he should be able to help them to mould their policy, by giving them the advantage of his experience of men and things.  There may be several changes of Government during his period of office and, just as a wise king has often been of great help to the Government of the time in Great Britain, so a wise President who has been fully informed&mdash;as he should be&mdash;would be of considerable assistance to the Government in office here from time to time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On the whole, I am against the amendment.  So far as I have given any coherent thought to political matters, it seems to me that you must correlate power and responsibility. I objected always to this Referendum.  A person who is responsible must decide what is to be done. For instance, when this amendment of the Constitution&mdash;the big one&mdash;was put to the people in 1937, what would have been the position of the then Administration, if they had obtained a majority to elect them as a Government and there had been a majority against them on that point&mdash;the Constitution&mdash; which was a fundamental one in their policy?</P>
      <P>At the end of a period of conflict the Administration may be corrupt and may want to hold on to its job and all the rest of it.  The only way of meeting that, I think, is by the situation we have in which we have a plurality of Houses&mdash;we have two at the moment&mdash; who by vote can get rid of that Administration.  I cannot see a better way than that.  If, although the war is ended, the Government judges that there is an emergency, that the very fabric of the State and the life of the State is still in danger then a referendum is put to the people.  Senator MacDermot says that a President can be in office for 14 years.  He then, if I may say so, goes on to assume that in such a position, the President being there for 14 years, a lot of new lads would come in as a Government.  It is not fair to put responsibility for the life and well-being of the State on a multitude of people.  That is the responsibility of the Government and its judgment must be adequated to a situation related to the well-being of the whole State.  It is its responsibility.  You put a referendum to the people.  We know how they voted about this Constitution. Without reading the thing whatever, they will be led by the whim of the moment or whatever case happens to be made to them.  You go and say, &ldquo;Your Constitutional rights are withheld from you&rdquo;; you make quite a good case on it and they vote accordingly. The only thing for a Government to do when that is done would be to have a general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1234" /> Therefore, the proper system would be that in such a case, the President can dissolve the two Houses of the Oireachtas and force a general election. That would involve an amendment in a totally different place.</P>
    <P>There is no way of making absolute certainty in life.  On the one hand, you can tie up the Administration so much that they can never do any act without having a general election or referendum.  On the other hand, you can give them such power that if they are corrupt, if they have considerations other than the well-being of the State, they can use that power, not for the purpose for which it was given to them. You can only have a certain amount of reasonable control, and the idea of controlling them by referendum seems to me about the very worst possible system.  It is giving the power to decide to a body of people, or to a multitude, who are not themselves responsible for the action going to be taken, and it seems to me, therefore, wrong.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I would like to point out in relation to this.  Senator MacDermot referred to the President being there for 14 years, and seemed to assume that because the normal life of Parliament is only five years, therefore the Government is always going to be new every five years.  It is quite possible for the same Administration to be in power for 40 years.  In regard to this substantive amendment that is being dealt with here&mdash;&ldquo;and &lsquo;time of war, or armed rebellion,&rsquo; includes such time after the termination of any such war....&rdquo;, I wonder if in the drafting of that advertence was had to what was meant by the term &ldquo;the termination of such war&rdquo;?  Everybody here knows, for instance, that Great Britain was at war with Turkey in the years of the last war, what is called the war from 1914 to 1918.  If this applied to England in relation to the war with Turkey, what date, do you think, would have been &ldquo;some time after the termination of such war&rdquo;?  Legally, the war between Great Britain and Turkey did not end until 1924.  I do not know when the war between the United States and Turkey ended, or if it has ended.  I do not think it had ended in 1927.  As I read <Col N="1235" /> the original thing, if we could put ourselves back to the position of 1914-18 and take what I may call the determining factor in the war between Great Britain and Turkey by the term here, &ldquo;includes such time after the termination of any war, or any such armed conflict, as aforesaid&rdquo;, strictly speaking, that time would have been a time after 1924 in relation to that.</P>
    <P>As far as the present emergency is concerned, if the time period is going to be fixed by the termination of war, war is only terminated when the two countries formally make their peace treaty.  As I say, the Treaty of Lausanne was made in 1924.  The officials behind the Taoiseach will be able to tell us when the war between the United States ended.  It does seem to me that Senator MacDermot would have done more to shorten the period during which the Government could arrogate to itself these exceptional powers if he had proposed an amendment with regard to the phrasing there because, remember, the end of the war does not mean when fighting ends; it means when a formal pact has been made in relation to it, a pact which declares that the previous condition of war has now terminated and a condition of peace has come about.</P>
    <P>To go back to the amendment itself, on the whole, I do not see any strong objection to some such amendment as Senator MacDermot proposes, but if such amendment is brought in, do not put any undue hopes in the thing because, when you hand over responsibility for the administration of the State to a body of men and make them responsible to a Legislature consisting of two Houses, if you are then going to try to put on other safeguards, as, for instance, reference to the whole people, you are only creating a machine which either will not be used or, if it is going to be used, can be used in a way which is more calculated to be harmful to the people of the country than leaving powers in the hands of an executive would be.  The truth is that when you have given power of voting to a people nothing can save that people if it insists upon voting for the wrong people.  It would <Col N="1236" /> be wrong to say to them: &ldquo;You can vote for these people but do not worry about the fact that they are venal, corrupt or incompetent&rdquo;&mdash;or whatever objection you might have&mdash;&ldquo;because the law is so drafted that they will never be able to do anything to harm you.&rdquo;  The Government is responsible for the administration of the country and it is the responsibility of the people to vote, and if the people do not recognise that responsibility then no arbitrary from of words is going to save them from what is coming to them.</P>

      <P>I submit that this amendment is quite unnecessary. I believe the situation, especially with regard to the present world-wide war, is not quite so simple as the last speaker seems to regard it.  We have the experience of the last Great War and we remember&mdash;I am sure that most of us do&mdash;that there was a great difficulty confronting English administration as to when the war was to be declared over.  To the best of my recollection, for a period longer than two years, there was a marked difference of opinion between statesmen as to whether or not it was advisable to declare the war at an end at a particular moment.  This is a very complicated war.  Senator Fitzgerald talks about a war between Turkey and another country being over when the two belligerents had declared that it was over, but in the present war how many subjugated countries are in question whose diplomatic representation has been withdrawn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Diplomatic representation has been withdrawn on the ground that they are no longer sovereign States.  Suppose the main belligerents declare the war at an end, probably the States deprived of their sovereignty would insist on an effort to resume their sovereignty and declare the war was not at an end as far as they were concerned, in what position would the neutral State be in regard to the complicated situation such as I envisage? After all, the Government of the country, more particularly the Minister for External Affairs, is better informed than the President could be, even <Col N="1237" /> though, as suggested by Senator MacDermot, the Taoiseach was to keep the President informed from day to day.  Now Senator Fitzgerald showed what is really in his mind when he contemplates the Minister for External Affairs or the Taoiseach, as it happens in this case to be the same person, who is referred to, keeping the President informed how things are going.  He is still further amending the Constitution if he is to convert an tUachtaráin into a sort of monarch or constitutional king.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I say &ldquo;Senator Fitzgerald&rdquo;?  Senator MacDermot spoke of that.  I thank you for the correction.  It is to Senator MacDermot I allude.  He said that it was to be presumed that the Uachtarán would be kept informed. Does that make it right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>The quotation was correct, although by a slip of the tongue the reference to it was not correct.  The Uachtarán is not a monarch, nor is he, like the President of the United States, the chief of the Executive.  He is as was described: &ldquo;the embodiment of the nation&rdquo;.  He represents in a personal form the nation.  It is true he can be invested with powers when these powers are given to him.  Under Article 12 I think it is, that is dealt with.  No, that is the oath he takes.  He takes an oath &ldquo;solemnly and sincerely promises and declares&rdquo; that he will maintain the Constitution of Ireland, uphold its laws and fulfil his duties, so that one asks what are his duties.  These are set out in the Constitution.  It is sub-section (1) of the same section: &ldquo;There shall be a President of Ireland (Uachtarán na hÉireann) hereinafter called the President, who shall take precedence over all other persons in the State and who shall exercise and perform the powers and functions conferred on the President by this Constitution and by law.&rdquo;  So that if we are to confer <Col N="1238" /> further powers on the President other than these given in the Constitution it will be by a specific enactment.  It is my case that we do not need to extend these powers within the Constitution for this purpose that Senator MacDermot has in view, because in one of the sub-sections he is empowered to summon either one or both of the Houses of the Oireachtas, and it does not say for any particular purpose.  It is not limited in regard to that.</P>
      <P>I apologise for not being able on the spur of the moment to give the exact number of the reference.  It is Article 13, section 2, sub-section (3):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The President may at any time, after consultation with the Council of State, convene a meeting of either or both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So that if the unhappy state of affairs that Senator MacDermot has in mind should, unfortunately, arise, that there is conflict of view between the Uachtarán and the Executive Ministry as to whether or not the state of war referred to in the Constitution has passed away, it is within the power, I submit, under this sub-section, of the President, on the advice, or with the approval of, or after consultation with the Council of State, to call both Houses of Parliment together, or one of them, and submit to Parliament the issues.  In other words, that is an appeal to the people.  It is a more exact use of the instruments of government set up by the people than to have recourse to a very exceptional thing which is used, no doubt, in Switzerland, the referendum, of whose use and the value of whose use we are very much in the dark.  It is very problematical.  It happens to have been adopted and enacted by the people, and you do not get rid of it, for the enlightenment of Senator Fitzgerald, by indicating a further employment of it, as suggested by the Senator.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to be clear about what Senator Fitzgerald says, but Senator Fitzgerald made an attack on the referendum, at least that is what I understood. Sometimes it is very hard to understand him, but on this occasion that is the impression he gave me, and I am referring to his argument.  I say that he condemns the referendum, and that he says he desires to have it done away with, and I say that it is not going to help him to do away with it if he includes in the Constitution an arrangement for the further and extended use of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, we are in perfect agreement, and the Senator need not interrupt me any further.  He has a habit of interrupting and, of course, he must be indulged but there is a limit.  Suppose the worst to have happened, and Senator MacDermot's situation had arisen, and the referendum is employed, and the issue is to be in effect the utter condemnation of the Government.  The people are called upon to declare that they are doing something different from their pledges, that it amounts to an abuse of their powers, that comes from the spirit of autocracy, and that from long exercise of emergency powers they have become autocrats, despots.  That is the political arrangement in this country where there is Party government such as prevails at present.  That, in effect, raises a question of no confidence in the Government and the voters are to be the Parliamentary electors, not the elected representatives of the people and the Second Chamber. Does anyone doubt that all the machinery of Party propaganda will at once be brought into active operation to beat them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> I do not think that that is a desirable situation to create, that first of all having created the office, and appointed an honoured citizen to be the embodiment of the State, you should then have a Government using all these propagandist powers and raising all sorts of political issues to could the real issue, that in fact the Government should be placed in this position, that they say to those who returned them to power: &ldquo;We are indicted for the misdemeanour of usurping powers and of seeking to maintain possession of these powers.  If you agree with the Uachtarán you are doing more than turning out the Government.  The indictment is more than an indictment of a Government that is incompetent.  It is an indictment of a Government that it is making itself into a sort of corporative dictator.&rdquo;  With that issue before the country, is it not clear that a passionate Party spirit will be aroused in the fullest measure?  It seems to me that everything that could be done to prevent such a feeling being aroused in the country should be done.  We have a way in that sub-section which I quoted.  Suppose it did happen that the Government presented a plausible excuse to retain emergency powers beyond the proper period.  It is within the powers already given to the Uachtarán to summon Parliament and to make that an issue&mdash;in other words, to call upon Parliament to demand that the Taoiseach and his Cabinet should resign.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the suggestion made by Senator Magennis does not help us at all.  It is inconceivable that a Government would try to retain emergency powers beyond the time that it really should have them unless in doing so it has the support of a majority in the Oireachtas. We may take it that if this crime against the people ever occurred, it would be a crime in which not only the Executive of the day but the majority of the day in both Houses of the Oireachtas would be participants.  So, if the President is ever to fulfil at all the duty which the Taoiseach said a week ago here in this House was one of his principal functions, namely to <Col N="1241" /> act as guardian of the Constitution for the people, if he is ever to fulfil that function in the sort of circumstances I have imagined, he has got to guard the people as much against the Oireachtas as against the Executive.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald says that the people must abide by the consequences of their acts, and if they elect a bad Government or a bad majority, there is nothing that can save them.  That seems to be an argument that can be carried altogether too far.  It is an argument really for having nothing but single-chamber government without any checks or balances at all.  I would not agree that that was a sound point of view even in normal times.  Let me put this to Senator Fitzgerald: even in the case of the present Government, did the people at the time they elected them last, ever dream that during their term of office they would assume powers over the individual citizen that they have in fact been compelled by circumstances to assume?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if the word &ldquo;assume&rdquo; indicated to the Senator that I was blaming the Government for anything they have done but they have, in fact, been clothed with powers which no elector ever dreamed they would be clothed with during their period of office.  It never occurred to the mind of any elector that the Constitutional guarantees enshrined in our Constitution would be suspended in the near future as they have been suspended.  I suggest that that is a consideration to be borne in mind.  Really what we are dealing with here is something very abnormal. We are dealing with the taking away from the individual of the whole body of guarantees that he believed himself to be protected by for ever.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the definition of responsible public opinion is but I am sure there are a good many people of the country that regret it very deeply.  There are a good many people of a subversive order of mind who regret that these powers were conferred on the Government by the Oireachtas.  While I think it is right in present circumstances that these powers should have been given by the Oireachtas it does not follow that the same thing might not happen in future on an occasion when it would not be justified.  I think we have initiated a tremendous precedent in the matter of giving the Executive extraordinary powers.  In the days when we were attacking the British Government about Coercion Acts, etc., it never occurred to me that an Irish Government would be found exercising the sort of powers that the Irish Government is now exercising.  That may have been due to short-sightedness or lack of imagination on my part, but we have set a terrific precedent in the power we have now given to our Executive and I suggest that we should do everything that in us lies to prevent that precedent being extended in an undesirable manner in some future generation, that we have a duty to posterity to be very careful in what we are doing, and that if there <Col N="1243" /> is any meaning at all in the statement of the Taoiseach that one of the principal functions of the President was to guard the Constitution for the people, here in this matter of the suspension of the Constitution is an ideal opportunity for that duty being imposed upon him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree that we should do everything we can to provide every possible safeguard, but I do not agree that we shall provide such a safeguard by the insertion of this amendment.  Senator MacDermot pre-supposes a certain situation here in the country, that a clash will arise between the President and the Government and that the Government will obstinately hold to office despite any feeling which may exist as to their right to hold office.  To my mind, if such a situation as that existed, nothing which we could do here would provide an efficient safeguard.  With regard to the setting of a time limit, it is reasonable to assume that in a period of undeclared wars&mdash;we will probably have an undeclared peace. That will create difficulties as to the time limit, but what is most serious in connection with this is that, first of all, we accept the position in which only with the consent of both Houses of the Oireachtas can a state of emergency be declared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that state of emergency has existed for a considerable time we then suggest that the people who declared the state of emergency are not the proper people to declare that the state of emergency ceases to exist.  If we are going to accept that position we are going to declare now, beforehand, that the Parliamentary institutions are not capable of deciding such matters at all, and we are going to take the decision out of the hands of the Oireachtas and put the question to the people at a time when it is natural to suppose that the people would be least in a position to make such drastic decisions.  Senator MacDermot, I think, suggested that a Government may carry on without a majority in the country or even without a majority in the Oireachtas.  Well, they may carry <Col N="1244" /> on without a majority in the Oireachtas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

      <P>Well, without one in the country.  They may carry on without one in the country, and therefore it is possible that they may carry on for a certain time without a majority in the Oireachtas.  But if the Government lost contact to such an extent as is suggested, with the people of the country, they would not for long retain a majority in the Dáil or Seanad.  I think we are really trying to provide safeguards where it is not possible to provide such safeguards, and in doing so we may do considerable harm without hope of doing any reasonable amount of good.</P>

      <P>One thing seems to me to emerge from this discussion, now that an amendment like this is before the House, and it is that such an amendment could not possibly be accepted without the fullest consideration by the responsible Government.  It is pointed out that the reason is that we have not got a cast-iron Constitution. But what is written in the Constitution is meant to be fundamental law.  Every word that goes into it&mdash; and this is the point I want to make&mdash; should be weighed, and all the implications should be most carefully judged. Now, a proposal like this though it may seem plausible &mdash; and it was suggested by Senator MacDermot that the phrase was that the President was the watch-dog of the Constitution and the liberties of the people &mdash; might endanger the constitutional rights of the people by giving the President such powers as are implicit in the amendment.  It seems to me that the wording of it is rather loose. I do not make any reflection on Senator MacDermot's draftsmanship, but the implications could be very serious.  It says: &ldquo;Provided that if it should at any time appear to the President after consultation with the Council of State.&rdquo;  It does not say &ldquo;on the advice of the Council of State&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are not such implications as there are in this case. The amendment visualises possibly a state of affairs where the President is in opposition to the Oireachtas and the Executive on the important point as to whether these emergency powers, which the elected representatives of the people gave the Government, should be taken from them; whether the time had come for that; and that postulates a very difficult situation, when the two Houses of Parliament are not reliable, apparently, and the Government is not reliable, and the President at his own discretion could put the country into the turmoil of referendum. A referendum, I imagine, would be far worse than any general election, and there may or may not be the same opportunity of putting the issues clearly.  In face of such difficulty as is envisaged, it would be very difficult to put them before the people clearly. I do not know that the people could give a good answer in such circumstances, and the principle of the President going over the heads of the elected representatives to the people themselves, without having first put it to the elected representatives, is one that might easily be dangerous.  I do not know whether the initiative of the referendum has been defended by law or whether there could be a new way of instituting that referendum, but certainly I would like to impress on the Taoiseach that such an amendment as this, is full of implications that should be most carefully weighed before it should be accepted.</P>

      <P>I listened with some interest to Senator Quirke's remarks, and I wondered whether he was speaking as an advocate or a realist.  Surely Senator Quirke does not suggest that Party independence is so strong that at a certain stage when the liberties of the people are being disregarded they <Col N="1246" /> will revolt against the Government and turn them out.  If that is Senator Quirke's view it is not mine.  Party discipline is so strong, and the individual personal interests of Parties to remain in power are so strong, that things will have to go very far before they would say to their leader: &ldquo;Look here, we are going to turn you out.&rdquo; I do not agree for a moment that responsibility of Party is sufficient to safeguard the Constitution or the liberties of the people.</P>
      <P>What is concrete is the interests of the Party; the liberties of the people, valuable as they are, are somewhat indefinite.  As long as the period of election is not prolonged I will be quite happy.  In the 17th century we had what was known as the Long Parliament, a Government which stayed in indefinitely under emergency powers.  If it were possible in some way to frame an amendment to limit the term definitely to the time when hostilities cease, it would be satisfactory, and if there was a difficulty about when hostilities ceased, then, as long as the Government had outrun its normal parliamentary existence, there should be a general election.  That would satisfy me. There may be some difficulty about approaching the thing from that angle. I think Senator MacDermot's method is probably the one that is capable of being brought within the framework of the written Constitution more easily.</P>

      <P>We must look beyond the present emergency in considering this amendment.  We are asked to give in the Constitution power to some future President that may be very dangerous.  In introducing the amendment, Senator MacDermot said that this war might be a long war and that, during its course, we might even see changes of Government.  Let us examine the matter from that point of view, knowing that the ordinary term of office of a President is seven years. In the present case, we had election by choice.  If we assume that we are to have an election of President by the people, we shall realise that it will be necessary for the person elected to have the support of one or other of the <Col N="1247" /> big political parties.  Otherwise, he could not be elected.  His having no politics is as much out of the question as our trying to make believe that the members of the Seanad are nonpolitical.</P>

      <P>I am discussing the probability of the war lasting for some time and the probability of future emergencies.  What we are doing in this Constitution will outlast the present emergency and what the Senator inserts in it now will hold for all time. If that be the case, the President may be elected on a, more or less, party ticket.  Changes of Government may come along and a particular Government may find it necessary to declare that a period of emergency exists, just as the present Government found it necessary so to declare.  That Government may hold different views from the President then in office and they may be justified in declaring a state of emergency.  In that, they may have the backing of the entire people.  The President, because of his political outlook or because he might be influenced by someone, could put the question to the people as to whether this state of emergency should be permitted and he could force the Government to appeal to the people either by referendum or by general election.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that that whole difficulty arises because the Government which is now in power, and which is likely to remain in power for a considerable length of time, is only a national Government in inverted commas.  At the last election, it certainly commanded a majority of the voters, but very substantial sections of the community voted for the principal Opposition Party and for the Labour Party, and they would also have voted for the kind of party to which I would belong if I belonged to a party at all.  In normal times of peace, we are quite prepared to accept the come and go of party government, but when an emergency situation such as the present arises, it is questionable whether a national Government which is only a national Government in inverted commas has the moral right to exercise the powers which have, in fact, been given to this Government under the Emergency Powers Act.  It is also questionable whether the principal Opposition Party were within their political duty in agreeing to confer on a Government of the type indicated powers so extraordinary with reference to the rights of every individual citizen.  Looking back on it now, I think that the attitude of those of us who claim to be, and are, independent, was that they should have insisted on the formation of a truly national Government, representing every important section of the people, before agreeing to confer powers so extraordinary on any Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak as an Independent, but I should like to remind the House that those of us who sit for a university constituency have a representative quality which was at one time considered adequate to justify our membership of the other House and which is rather unique, if I may say so without <Col N="1249" /> undue conceit, in this Assembly, which is not, in general, elected on any very wide democratic franchise.  When I speak as an Independent, therefore, I do so as spokesman of a section of the community which might well be 10 per cent., or even more, of the people, and I think a certain amount of weight should be attributed to sentiments such as I am now trying to express. If a Government existed&mdash;presided over, of course, by the present Taoiseach&mdash;which was representative of every section of political activity in the country, I think it could be trusted not to abuse its powers in any way. When the emergency situation came to an end, I think that the internal frictions that would probably arise in such an Executive Council would ensure that an election would take place reasonably soon after the war was over and that we would resume normal constitutional life.  The danger, if any, of the usurpation of authority by such a Government would be greatly minimised. That, it seems to me, would constitute an adequate guarantee that the Constitutional rights of every section of the people would be safeguarded. As for the particular proposal put forward by Senator MacDermot, after listening to the arguments for and against, I am inclined to the view that it would introduce unnecessary and undesirable complications into our Constitution and put both the Government and the Uachtaran in a difficult and anomalous position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to adjust certain matters relating to the export of butter and the collection of fees which have been affected by the present emergency.  As the Bill was being introduced for that purpose, advantage was taken of the occasion to introduce a few other amendments to the legislation already in being.  I am sure the House is aware that, at the beginning of the war, the Minister of Food in Great Britain decided that it would be more convenient for the British to purchase any imported commodities from some sort of central exporting agency on this side.  We were faced, therefore, with the necessity of establishing some such machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a Butter Marketing Committee operating here following the passage of the Dairy Produce (Price <Col N="1251" /> Stabilisation) Act, in 1935.  That committee had taken an interest in the export of butter in the way of advice more than anything else.  They had advised the creameries what quantities to export and the more profitable markets that would be found for that butter.  As the committee was there, naturally it was selected as the best body for the central export of butter. Now, the Committee really had not the powers it should have had for this purpose.  There were three consequences of this change.  Butter had to be exported by a body which legally was not competent to do so.  The new change also did away to a certain extent with my powers of control over the making of butter.  It also took away my right to collect fees on export.  Under the main Act the export of butter is confined to persons registered in certain registers under the Act.  This committee was not registered.  It is true, of course, that it could register, but there would be needless expenditure, as they would need premises which were not necessary for any reason but that of registration.</P>
    <P>Under the main Act also, I can only interfere with the manufacturers of butter where it is being exported by the manufacturer.  There again, seeing that the butter was passed on from the creamery to this committee, my right of interference with the creameries was largely removed.  With regard to fees, they were fixed in the main Act at 4d. per cwt. on the exported butter. At the time the main Act was going through, the greater part of the creamery butter was exported.  Now, however, we export only about one-third of the total output of creamery butter.  Although the output has gone up considerably, it appears that the amount of butter consumed at home has gone up also.  It does appear to be rather unfair now, on account of that change, that the one-third exporting butter should pay the fees and the other two-thirds pay none.  It is proposed in this Bill, therefore, to remedy that by putting 2d. per cwt. on all butter produced, whether exported or sold at home.  We are providing in this <Col N="1252" /> Bill that that fee be collected on all butter produced.  It will make very little difference in the total amount collected. I think the amount contributed averaged about £6,000 per annum.  If the output this year remains the same as last year, the amount would be £6,250.</P>
    <P>We are taking the opportunity to make other amendments in the main Act.  The principal thing is that we are taking power to prescribe qualifications for managers of auxiliary creameries.  Up to this point, qualifications were prescribed for managers of central creameries, but now we wish to deal with the managers of auxiliaries and the assistant managers of central creameries.  When the original Act was passed, the training of creamery managers was on an unorganised basis&mdash;it was in its infancy&mdash;but since then University College, Cork, has turned out a number of trained men. There are men available now for these positions and it is a pity that they should not be appointed wherever a vacancy occurs.  My intention is not to disturb the managers already there in the auxiliary creameries if they are carrying out their work satisfactorily &mdash;and I am quite sure that practically all of them are acting in a satisfactory manner&mdash;but where vacancies arise trained men will be appointed and, as the years go on, we may expect to have more efficient management both in the auxiliaries and in the centrals.</P>
    <P>There are something like 300 auxiliary creameries in the country.  A very small proportion have trained men at the present time, and, when they all have trained men, we can expect to see a further improvement in the industry.  Undoubtedly, there has been a wonderful improvement in the quality of creamery butter since the main Act was passed in 1924.  With further progress, both in management and in other ways, we expect to have the reputation of our creamery butter increased even further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The necessity to amend the legislation here again arises out of the emergency. The committee that I have already referred to was set up under the original Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Act, 1935, and, as I already explained, they were dealing in an advisory way with the export of butter.  When the emergency arose they were put in control of the export of butter.  In the first place, under that Act they had authority to deal only with butter, but recently the Minister for Food in Great Britain asked to have cheese also exported through some central organisation, and this committee is dealing with cheese.  The first point we want to get right is that they should have power to deal with all dairy produce as well as butter.  The second point is this, that I had power to pay the expenses of that committee under the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Act, but it was only working expenses, that is, payment of staff and so on, which amounted to about £150 a month, or something small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that they have to purchase the butter and hold it some time before exporting, they will need a very much larger amount of money and I am asking in this Bill for power to authorise that committee to overdraw in the bank, with the concurrence of <Col N="1254" /> the Minister for Finance, to the extent of £500,000.  That money, of course, will be repaid when the butter is exported. It is only by way of loan.</P>
    <P>Under Section 4 of the 1938 Act, which is also an amending Act, there was general power to impose a levy on stocks of butter in the hands of registered proprietors and butter traders on an appointed day.  We found it to be administratively impossible to collect this levy in all cases. There are, as every Senator will realise, some thousands of retailers in this country, and some of those people might only hold a few pounds of butter. We are, therefore, proposing to exempt anybody holding less than three cwt. of butter whenever a levy is struck. We are also asking for returns from the retailers in this case.  Rather through an oversight, a creamery that had produced butter and held butter on hands at a time a levy is struck under the present legislation is not liable for the levy.  That is very inequitable and is also being made right in this Bill.  Butter held in cold storage is liable for levy within seven days.  In some cases that butter may not be taken out of cold store for sale for some months, and it is rather hard on the owner to pay this levy.  Under this Bill the levy will not be collectable until it is removed from cold store.</P>
    <P>Under the Principal Act also, a levy can only be imposed on the first day of a month.  That is being changed so that the levy can be put on at any date in the month that may be suitable.  These changes with regard to the levy may appear rather formidable to some Senators, but I can assure the Seanad that they are very trivial.  They will make for easier working in the collection of levies and so on, and are not going to hurt anybody. In fact, they are mostly in the way of relief to the owners of butter, giving them more time to pay, and so on.  I may say also, for the information of the Seanad, that there is no danger whatever that any levy will be collected this year.  All the payments will be the other way.  A subsidy will be payable on exports and a subsidy will even be payable on production <Col N="1255" /> so as to help the producer of butter for the home market.  There are no levies whatever collectable this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh yes.  In answer to Senator Goulding, I may say that last year we exported butter much earlier than was the practice.  There were various reasons for that, principally military ones, but in any case we exported the butter early and we did provide for a 10 per cent. margin.  I mean we kept 10 per cent. more than we would have kept in the normal way, to provide against contingencies.  The 10 per cent. was not sufficient on account of the very dry season but I think we are not likely to make the same mistake again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This also is an amending Bill and contains a number of amendments more or less of a drafting kind.  Some of the amendments perhaps will be considered rather more serious than drafting. Some of the provisions inserted, for which I am responsible, are designed to meet difficulties which may arise if through a combination among suppliers, distributors or carriers an attempt was made to hold up supplies.  Some of the other provisions are put in at the request of the milk <Col N="1256" /> boards, where all interests in the milk business are represented.  Perhaps I should just say a word first about the working of the Milk Act which was passed in 1936 for the supply of milk to the cities.</P>
      <P>I think on the whole it has worked satisfactorily; that is, it has fulfilled the purpose for which it was brought in, to give the producers as much as possible of the amount that is paid by the consumer.  It has also secured the producer against exploitation of any kind by the distributors and has introduced a degree of regularisation in the milk business both to the producer, the trader and the public.</P>
      <P>It has been represented to me that during the period of peak production the producers do not get the prescribed price.  That is one of the things we have found impossible to deal with by legislation, at least by legislation within the framework of a milk board and so on.  One can, I suppose, consider legislation which would make that right, but it would be of a very much more comprehensive type.  I think the Seanad should not have any great sympathy with the producers in that regard.  The law is there and they can insist, legally, on the price laid down, and if they do not get that price it is due to the fact that they have voluntarily agreed to give a hand-back. They have actually, as a matter of fact, committed an illegality in not taking the prescribed price.  I do not want to say it is an easy matter for the producer to co-operate in this way.  I know it is a very big thing for the producers all to come together and co-operate and see that exploitation does not take place, but I think they should be able to co-operate at least to the extent of seeing that they would not get less than the prescribed price. This Bill is mainly designed to improve the machinery of the Principal Act. It makes provision for the winding up of a milk board.  It makes provision for limitation of sale, and it makes provision for yearly contracts.  These are the three big points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the winding up of a board, I propose to take power to wind up a board if it should be necessary. There are various reasons why it might <Col N="1257" /> be necessary.  In the first place, if the dairy interests on the board came to me now and said they wanted it wound up and that they thought it was no longer necessary to have it there, there is no legal way of winding it up.  There has always, of course, been the possibility of the producers or some people interested combining to deprive the people of the city of milk and it might be necessary temporarily to suspend a board while this stoppage takes place.  I think that Senators will agree that where we bring in legislation to protect an interest like the interest of the producers in five named counties it is not fair that they should use that position to withhold supplies knowing that legally no other supplies can come in.  It is provided that any surplus funds will be devoted to some agricultural purpose or rural industry.</P>
    <P>The second point with regard to the creameries is that during the milk stoppage here in 1939 I had to appeal to certain creameries to send milk to Dublin to get supplies, and I gave a guarantee to them that if they sent this milk they would be permitted to continue the business of sending milk to Dublin provided they fulfilled certain conditions.  One was, of course, that they would register under the Milk and Dairies Act&mdash;that is an Act administered by the Minister for Local Government&mdash;and they have to conform to that Act, and to satisfy the Department of Public Health that the milk is fit for human consumption.  The position arising out of this is that about seven creameries have decided to continue in the business.  There were several more creameries supplying milk, but only seven have decided to continue, and the amount of milk that will be sent in by these creameries will not make a very substantial difference to the suppliers.  As a matter of fact the suppliers, that is, the farmers in these five counties, are not able to meet the requirements of this city.  In the winter especially, Dublin would be seriously short of milk were it not for the supply that comes in from the creameries.  Provision is also made in this Bill to control the quantity of milk that may be sent in.  There are a certain number of creameries <Col N="1258" /> registered under the Principal Act. There was nothing in the Principal Act to limit the amount of milk that might be sent in.  There is a certain fear that if these six or seven creameries combine together they could probably, over a period, make it very uncomfortable for farmers within the area, and perhaps even drive some of them out of business and in that way secure for themselves a great part of the Dublin market here.  Power has been taken to limit them to the amount they had been supplying over the last three years.</P>
    <P>The third principal point is that power is taken to prescribe yearly contracts.  I think myself that is a very important provision and I think it is a provision that should remove the number of complaints made here by the suppliers in the area.  A complaint has been made in regard to the country suppliers.  We make a distinction between what are known as the country suppliers and the cowkeepers. The cowkeepers are the men around the city who supply direct.  They are retailers.  The country suppliers live a distance outside and send in milk to be distributed by the wholesalers and retailers.  These country suppliers allege, sometimes with truth, that the wholesalers and retailers take less milk during the flush period, the reason being that the cowkeepers try to extend their market during these two months of May and June and deprive the country supplier in that way of part of his market.  That is very unfair to the country supplier, because he has gone to the expense of keeping the supply during the winter and then, when he has the supplies during May and June, he is cut down.  The yearly contract may, I hope, remove that.  Probably there will be ways found to get around it, but if the suppliers interested insist on these yearly contracts, it may at least remove one of their biggest grievances. If there is a combination amongst producers to withhold supplies this restriction would be an obstacle to getting supplies into the area.  To overcome that difficulty I am taking power to issue licences to acquire milk from persons who are not <Col N="1259" /> registered for the sale of milk in that district.</P>
    <P>The only other point is that it has been suggested, and it may be suggested here, that I should have gone further and should make provision for the establishment of a central marketing agency in the Milk Board area.  The proposal was put to me by country producers, but when the matter came up for discussion amongst other interests concerned it was opposed.  If all the producers had agreed it might be possible to do something, but there was a conflict between the country producers and the cow-keepers.  It was very hard to do anything for, roughly, half of the producers as against the interests of the others.  I do recognise, however, that the present scheme is not by any means entirely satisfactory.  It is probably more satisfactory than before the board was set up, but it is not entirely satisfactory.  I am quite prepared to consider any scheme put up, preferably if it has the support of a substantial section of the industry. If I thought the scheme was feasible and good, I would have no hesitation in coming before both Houses again with the necessary legislation. I should like to repeat that, without any legislation, although I am not saying it is a small matter, it is possible for the producers to have greater co-operation amongst themselves. I think every Senator will agree that if producers could arrange for greater co-operation it would be the ideal method.  If that co-operation grew and developed it would be much better for the producers themselves and eventually would mean that consumers in the city would get better and cheaper milk when the organisation was properly established.</P>

      <P>Perhaps in connection with this Bill, which raises important questions of public policy and public health, I might be allowed to make some general remarks with reference to the problem with which the Bill attempts to deal.  It is, I think, a fact that is not generally realised, that the consumption of milk in our towns and cities is very much less than, for reasons of health, it should be.  It <Col N="1260" /> is also very much less than it is amongst our country population if we may believe official statistics.  According to the Report on Agricultural Output for 1926-27, the total output of milk in the Twenty-Six County area was 589,000,000 gallons.  Of that total, 1,800,000 people who lived in the country at that time consumed 69,000,000 gallons of whole milk, which is equivalent to a consumption of .84 of a pint per person per day.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, when we consider the 1,156,000 people who at that time were living in the towns and cities, their estimated consumption of whole milk worked out at only 20,000,000 gallons which is equivalent to only .38 of a pint per person per day.  In other words, there was a difference in the consumption of milk per person per day, amounting to nearly half a pint, according to whether a person lived in a town or village or whether he lived among the people who 14 years ago were living in the country.  Since then there has been a considerable influx of country people into Dublin and the probabilities are, taking them on the average, that these people, who in the country were consuming an average of nearly a pint per person per day, are now, when they are living in the towns and cities, consuming only .38 or about one-third of a pint per person per day. Therefore, one effect of the influx of 100,000 people into urban areas in the last 14 years is that probably the consumption of whole milk by our people as a whole has diminished by something which I work out at 2,300,000 gallons a year.  That is a thing that is certainly going to be injurious to our people as a whole and something which it should be public policy to remedy in connection with this problem of improving the trade in whole milk from the point of view of both consumer and producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make a few comprehensive suggestions with reference to the Bill.  First of all, I would say that the Bill shows far too much consideration for existing vested interests. There is a jungle of vested interests connected with this whole milk business and the matter will never be put <Col N="1261" /> right until the Minister, or some person in his position, enters that jungle and hacks his way through it, opening it up to daylight, and treating every vested interest, whether that of farmer or dairyman, absolutely ruthlessly so long as he is sure that he is furthering a policy which is beneficial to the public health and is in accordance with public welfare.  Not that I am suggesting that any positive injustice should be inflicted on these people. The people who suffer will be entitled, of course, to reasonable compensation, but there should be no hesitation about what the object of the policy is, to try to improve the quality of milk distributed, while at the same time cheapening its cost to the consumer and giving an adequate price to the producer.</P>
    <P>The anomalies in regard to the price of milk in the city are simply terrific. Down in the country, in the milk producing areas, the farmers are, I will not say glad, to accept, but at all events they acquiesce in accepting, rather less than 1d. per pint for milk they send to the creameries, that is 1d. per pint or 8d. per gallon, if you allow 2d. as the value of the skim milk which is returned to them.  A penny per pint is 8d. per gallon or 2d. a quart.  The price of milk per quart in the city varies at present from somewhere in the neighbourhood of 6d. to somewhere in the region of 9d.  I am not saying that there is not some justification for a difference in price because I know it costs a good deal more to produce and sell milk in the urban areas than to produce and sell milk to a rural creamery.  Nevertheless, the disparity between 1d. a pint in Tipperary and 9d. a quart paid by consumers for the best quality of milk in Dublin, is much too wide.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that the source of Dublin's milk supply might be divided under four main headings. Apparently there survive the prehistoric Dublin cow-keepers who keep cows in back yards somewhere in the city.  I thought they were as dead as the dodo, but apparently they still exist and they still distribute an important portion of the city's milk supply.  The first part of public policy should be to <Col N="1262" /> wipe out the keeping of cows under such insanitary and uneconomic conditions as the keeping of cows in the back yards of Dublin necessarily implies.  The proper place to keep them is in the open country.  There again you must give reasonable compensation, but for the sake of the public health, these particular sources of supply should be wiped out and wiped out as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the matter is that in recent months these yards appear to have been a hot-bed of foot-and-mouth disease.  Since some of the cows are kept in quarters which never see sunshine, it becomes nearly impossible to eradicate the disease once it has found its way into these yards.</P>
    <P>Another important source of Dublin's milk supply is the large wholesale retailers who have creameries in Dublin and who collect milk by lorry over the so-called Dublin production area, mainly in Counties Wicklow, Dublin, Kildare and Meath.  These represent a much more efficient contribution to the problem of supplying Dublin, though I am not suggesting that their relations with the farmers who produce and sell milk to them are necessarily everything that they should be.  Nevertheless, the organisation which they do represent is something which I think ought to be retained in some form or other, though not necessarily under its present auspices. Another important source of milk is the producer-retailer who has a farm, often in the neighbourhood of Dublin, and who retails his milk as well as produces it.  This section of the supply doubtless represents many different grades of quality, but nevertheless does contain some of the very best producers of the highest class milk available for sale in Dublin, and the best members of this class should receive every encouragement to go on producing high-class tuberculin-tested milk, and should get a preferential price which would reward them for their trouble and expense in producing that high class milk.  Whatever reorganisation of milk distribution takes place&mdash; and I am going to recommend a drastic reorganisation of it&mdash;nothing should be done which would obliterate the identity of those valuable producer-retailers <Col N="1263" /> or prevent them enjoying the goodwill they built up by their efforts over recent years or cut them off from their connection with customers who have a consumers' preference for the milk they have been known to supply.</P>
    <P>The fourth section of supply is these creameries outside the Dublin production area which entered the trade at a time when there was a certain amount of heart-burning among what I might call the organised farmers' section of County Dublin.  At all events, there was a strike threatened or called, and these creameries were brought in at that time, and a certain amount of feeling seems to have prevailed.  I think nothing that happened then should influence our attitude to those creameries now as a possible source of supply to Dublin.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that the Bill, in so far as it limits the amount of milk which these co-operative creameries down in the country may send to Dublin, is to that extent a bad Bill, and no limit should be put on the expansion of these creameries as a source of supply for whole milk for consumption in Dublin &mdash;or, at all events, no rigid limitation. The only drawback I see about a too great expansion from that source is that it is a distant source, and it is desirable, especially in time of emergency, such as the present, that much of the supply in the City of Dublin should come from within a radius of 20 to 30 miles.  I want to see, however, these co-operative creameries continue to be a source of supply, and I want to see that trade enjoying a reasonable possibility of expansion.  The milk which these creameries sell in Dublin is, I assume, pasteurised milk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all pasteurised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>And I believe the milk which is produced in the Dublin production area, and treated by wholesale creameries which have their premises in Dublin, is also pasteurised milk.  But there is a difference between the pasteurised milk which is pasteurised within a few hours of milking and pasteurised milk collected over a radius of 20 or 30 miles and brought to <Col N="1264" /> Dublin and then pasteurised several hours afterwards.  In the interval, considerable damage can happen to milk by infection by germs, and the same result is not likely in the case where milk is pasteurised soon after milking, which is the kind of milk these co-operative creameries are in a position to send. Therefore, from the point of view of pasteurisation, I think it probable that the creamery produces a better article than the other institutions near Dublin, although I have in mind that the institutions in Dublin do their best, and that the article they produce is a good article.  It should be public policy that, in general, the milk allowed to be sold for human consumption should be properly pasteurised milk produced in institutions properly supervised under Government officials, and that the only new milk, not pasteurised, allowed to be sold, should be milk produced under hygienic conditions from tuberculin-tested herds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief reason why there is such a wide disparity between the prices ultimately paid by the consumer even of poor milk, in Dublin, and the price received by the original producer of it, is that the cost of distribution is inordinately high, and the reason for that is because so many competitive organisations are tumbling over one another to distribute milk in the same district.  There is hardly a street in Dublin in which you will not see half a dozen or more milk carts delivering milk about the same time.  The obvious solution for that waste of effort is to put the distribution of milk under a single organised control.  The obvious body which should have the control of the distribution of whole milk is, of course, the Dublin Corporation. I see no reason why it should not be one of the activities of the Dublin Corporation to distribute the milk supply of the people of Dublin in the same kind of way&mdash;not necessarily by the same technique&mdash;as they distribute the water supply.  In that case the corporation would make its contracts with the creameries down in Tipperary, and would take over after paying compensation, the existing creameries in the neighbourhood of Dublin, and make contracts with the people now supplying the private wholesale firms, <Col N="1265" /> and would require the pasteurisation of all milk, and provide for the distribution of all milk; and if they did, I think they would be able to cut the price down to something not far above 2d. per pint if they achieved all the economies which, in theory, ought to be achievable by such a unitary form of organisation.</P>
    <P>There remains the question of private producer-retailers producing high-class tuberculin-tested milk which ought not to be pasteurised, and in which the goodwill of the people producing it ought to be preserved.  There is no doubt that a large part of their expense of production is due to the fact that they have their own private system of distribution, and I do not see that they should not be able to make arrangements with the municipal authority to distribute their milk in bottles bearing their name, to such customers as wanted to buy their milk and pay their price for it, while they themselves were content to produce the milk and bring it to a single depot or municipal distributing agency.  In that kind of way even the private producer-retailer should be able to make a substantial economy in the cost, and the consumer ready to pay a higher price for tuberculin-tested milk, would probably find that article obtainable at a cheaper price than it is now under an inefficient system of distribution.  I would be glad if the Minister would express his attitude to some of these rather drastic and comprehensive suggestions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy to be in a position to endorse almost everything that the last speaker has said.  It is very refreshing to have from him a practical speech on questions of agriculture, he so very often brought us into the realms of theory where a few of us were in a position to understand him.  I would like to stress, if I may, the approach to this problem, and I think we have to treat milk in a very different light from almost any other foods.  Milk is a germ-carrier. It is a perishable and essential food. There is a very good case for treating milk totally differently from the way you would treat other agricultural produce&mdash;potatoes, <Col N="1266" /> barley and so forth. The approach should be more from the consumer's end.  It should start with the necessity for giving the consumer pure milk at the lowest possible price. When one talks about pure milk, one must differentiate between different classes of milk none of which carries infection.  Senator Johnston spoke on that point.  We have the tuberculin-tested herd, which provides very high-grade milk, but we must recognise that people with means will be the chief market for that kind of milk.  There ought to be no offence against public health in giving everybody germ-proof milk&mdash;that is, pasteurised milk.  I know that there is some theory that, by pasteurisation, you lose certain essential vitamins.  Doctors do not agree about that and, for the present, I think you must be satisfied with giving everybody milk free from noxious germs, even if some of the medical experts or bacteriological experts say you have destroyed certain essential vitamins, because, after all, vitamins do not exist solely in milk.  You can get them in other forms of food.</P>
      <P>There is a certain belief that the regulations under the Dairy and Cowsheds Order contribute effectively to the security of milk against disease. I do not believe for a moment that they do.  I see their operation in practice and I think they are very largely superficial.  You put down a concrete floor.  You make the milkers go through the form of washing their hands.  In fact, that means dipping their hands in a bucket of dirty water. You make certain regulations about aprons, but does anybody suggest that any of these precautions really kill germs?  I do not believe for a moment that the experts believe they kill germs.  Incidentally, could the Minister persuade one of the research schools to make an examination of the respective freedom from germs of ordinary samples of creamery milk, taken at random, and samples of milk produced on farms that comply with the Dairies and Cowsheds Order?  From the point of view of bacteria content, I do not think you would find one different from the other.  That is a piece of practical research which, I think, should be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1267" /> With regard to the area of production, I can see certain convenience and certain&mdash;but very slender&mdash;justification in giving a closed market to producers within certain counties.  Why should there not be a free market in milk in Dublin and Cork as there is in all other centres in the country?  The Government rather drifted into giving a closed market to Dublin on account of the strikes and certain difficulties of supply that should have been settled in another way.  Approaching the question primarily from the point of view of the interests of the consumer, I do not think that any restriction should be placed on the sources from which milk is drawn.  The farmers are in a position to organise themselves and I think that should be a fair defence. The State should not step in to protect them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the distributors, I agree, in broad principle, with what Senator Johnston has said.  It may be argued that the present methods are efficient, but it would take a lot to persuade me that there is efficiency when you see lorries, horse-carts, bicycle-carriers, dog-carts and other forms of conveyance serving the same area with milk.  It is incredible that, if distribution were brought under a central organisation and the whole of one street served by one distributor, the cost could not be enormously reduced. I feel in this matter a socialist &mdash;an unusual frame of mind for me. Cheap milk free from disease is essential for our poor people.  That should be the aim of the Government and vested interests should give way ruthlessly to that aim.  I do not say that there should not be compensation.  I believe that there would be ample finance within an efficient system to provide compensation for any persons put out of business.  I also feel that some body&mdash;not necessarily the corporation, because there is too much politics in a body like that, but a public utility society on the lines of the Electricity Supply Board&mdash;should be set up to carry out the distribution of milk within our large cities.  It seems exceedingly unfair that, in the country, you should have to retail milk <Col N="1268" /> for 1/3 or 1/4 a gallon while here in the city the price is double that.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister is not going to let the thing drift merely on the lines of the present legislation.  I do not like commissions but if he were to set up a body with clearly-defined terms of reference to examine and report on the most efficient method of milk distribution in our cities, it would probably be a sound angle from which to approach the problem.  He ought to keep all vested interests out of it.  I do not think that there is anything exceedingly technical in the problem.  Business people without any interest in the trade would be the best people to examine and report on a problem of that kind.  As regards compensation, you have given certain vested rights to producers within five counties.  I should be very sorry to see a position develop whereby, because producers in these five counties have a closed market, they should at any time be entitled to compensation.  I think they have no claim for compensation over any other milk producer in the country. Therefore, I ask the Minister, when considering the development of our milk supply, to look upon it primarily from the viewpoint of the interests of the consumer.  He should aim at a noxious-free supply of milk.  That is the condition that should govern this policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>In a Bill like this where, in principle, we are all agreed, I suppose it is inevitable that we would wander a lot in the course of the debate.  In the discussion of a question like milk, in which so many diverse opinions are held by both medical men and plain people like myself, there is scope for many and varying opinions.  This amending Bill has been made necessary from the experience of the Act already in operation.  The Minister took things as he found them when he introduced the Act which has been operating for some years past.  As far as we know the Minister's mind, as expressed in the other House or here to-day, it is as radical as that of Senator Johnston or as that of somebody who has become suddenly socialist like Senator Sir John Keane. There is very little to be said on this <Col N="1269" /> question of milk, as we are all nearly of the one mind.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the real value of milk as a food is not realised.  The whole problem of the milk supply in the City of Dublin will only be tackled properly when someone has made a census of the milk consumption of the citizens and has discovered the minimum necessary to maintain them in a reasonable state of health.  Apparently, nobody has thought of attempting anything like that so far.  The main purpose of this Bill is to provide milk for the citizens of Dublin.  It is providing some milk, but not anything like an adequate supply, and I wonder when that adequate supply will be provided.</P>
      <P>On some of the other Bills we have discussed to-day on their Second Stages, I might have said that the milk production of the country has dropped steadily year by year.  That is a rather disturbing situation, but it is a fact.</P>
      <P>We should first take a census of the quantity of milk necessary to give to Dublin a reasonable amount of this most essential food of all.  Next to that, there should be a closer study of our food values.  If we had anything like that being done in the country, the consumption of milk&mdash;not alone in the City of Dublin, but in the rural districts where milk is produced&mdash;would be much larger, and the race as a whole would benefit considerably.  It would astonish many people to learn the amount consumed in the farmers' houses, from which great quantities are sent away.  The Minister should also do something to determine, in a positive and concrete way, the cost of producing a gallon of milk.  I think I have said to the Minister in another place that years ago he had the point of view that it cost over 6d. a gallon.  Investigations which have been carried out elsewhere in the country by one who can be regarded as an authority by all of us&mdash;Professor Murphy of Cork &mdash;have established the fact that it takes approximately 7d. to produce a gallon of milk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking it on a Limerick farm as produced in winter and summer. <Col N="1270" /> I do not say that that is the most efficient production.  I do not say that the cows which yield this milk costing 7d. a gallon were the heaviest yielders. I do not say that it cannot be produced more cheaply than that.  However, all that is part of the problem.  There were members of the Dublin Milk Producers' Association protesting against the price fixed by the Minister.  There were strikes some time ago, and milk was brought in from some creameries to save the situation, and a certain position is now being set up in regard to those creameries.  In the settlement of a strike, what could one do but settle it in an arbitrary fashion and allow a minimum to the farmers for the milk? I am not suggesting that the farmers are not very much better off than they were before the legislation was enacted.  What we really need&mdash;not for the sake of supplying the City of Dublin alone, but for the sake of the country as a whole&mdash;is, under the Minister's authority, definite figures showing what milk production costs over a period.  In all this question of milk production, the whole future of our people is much more intimately linked up than a great many of us realise.  We have all sorts of figures being given in the arguments farmers make.  We know how the people complain of the price of butter at 1/6 per lb.  When you tell these people that the farmer is only getting 6d. a gallon for milk at the creamery, they stand aghast and say they are paying 2/- in Dublin.  In order to clear the jungle, as Senator Johnston said, that is one of the first questions to be dealt with, not only from the point of view of cheap milk for cities and towns, but also from the point of view of the production of milk for our creameries in the country generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We then come to the position with regard to the production of milk throughout the 12 months.  The Minister is making provision for yearly contracts, and I am in favour of that. If an attempt is being made in legislation like this to give producers a reasonable price and at the same time to feed people, let me say that it is very important to give people food at the time they want the food.  The greatest difficulty is to find milk for <Col N="1271" /> the people in winter time&mdash;and that is the time when there is really a demand for this food.  For the next two or three months of the summer, they would probably carry-on on 50 per cent.&mdash; certainly on two-thirds&mdash;of the supply which is essential to them in winter. In fact, they would probably be in better health on 50 per cent. of the milk consumption for the next few months than they would by doubling the consumption through the months of the winter.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with regard to winter production is that you must pay the price.  You must aim at production all the year round for the people supplying the City of Dublin, and it should be aimed at also in regard to the country generally.  That can only be achieved by paying the price.  It is very fine to urge cheap milk, but we must ensure wider consumption also.</P>
    <P>You will not get enough milk if you will not pay the people who are producing it something above the cost of production.  The great difficulty in this country in producing milk in winter is that it is very costly to produce.  We are denying our own people and the children of this country milk in winter, when they want it most, because the cost of production is relatively much higher than it is in summer.  There is a problem there and we do not solve it in a Bill like this.  I think we have to approach it from an entirely different angle.  It ought to be a matter of policy.  In my view, as far as the City of Dublin is concerned, the Minister, through his board, ought to cut down the price to producers in summer and raise it correspondingly in winter in order to get an adequate supply of milk during the winter months.</P>
    <P>My view in regard to milk and also in regard to other agricultural products is that there ought to be no possibility of any group of people getting into a position where they can carry out a policy of exploitation.  I think it would be a bad policy for the farmers to attempt to pursue.  With regard to the production of highest grade milk, while it ought to be the aim, and while it is very commendable on the part of <Col N="1272" /> those who have achieved that high standard already, even when we get the highest standard which it is possible for us to reach in the production of milk, there ought to be no possibility of exploiting that position.  It is something which, from the producers' point of view, ought to be avoided and, from the State's point of view, should be prevented.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of talk with regard to the question of clean milk and pasteurisation.  I am always at a loss to know how much of the ill-health of the country is due to impure milk and how much to lack of sufficient milk. I do not know whether we have statistics of any great value in helping us to a conclusion in this respect.  Instead of going to all the cost of pasteurisation which, in my view anyhow, if it destroys the bad, destroys some of the good in the milk&mdash;and I think some medical men hold the same view&mdash; I would prefer to begin at the beginning. I would prefer, whatever Senator Sir John Keane's view may be about it, to go down to the cowhouses in the country and try to make them clean and healthy, and make the stock therein clean and healthy, and make the men who milk the cows do their job. In that way, I think we would go far to eliminate the incidence of disease about which we hear so much to-day. When I see the number of hospitals we are building throughout the country it makes me feel that we do not expect to have a vigorous, healthy people in the years to come, that we believe two-thirds of the population will have to pass through the hospitals in future. I would prefer that we should aim at a policy of building up a healthy race, who would not want hospitals and who would want fewer doctors.</P>
    <P>With regard to the production of clean, healthy milk, I think it would be sounder, from the State's point of view, to tackle this on the farms, in the cowhouses and stock, carrying out the conditions there which are essential to the production of clean milk, and develop from that on, doing our best to keep it clean all the way down to the consumer.  I think eventually we will come to that.  In the meantime we may spend a great deal of money and <Col N="1273" /> energy and years, but in the end we will go back down to where the impure milk probably has its origin.</P>
    <P>There is no need to go into the many questions raised and debated in the other House.  I think the Minister's attitude on the whole with regard to this measure, and his attitude towards the farmers, as far as I can judge it, is considerate.  I find fault, however, with the farmers who are engaged in this business that they have not before to-day come together and formed a co-operative organisation for the distribution and sale of milk.  Rather than setting up public utility corporations or anything like that, I think if the farmers, who are the producers of the bulk of the milk which comes into the City of Dublin for sale, did the right thing by themselves and were looking to the future and to a branch of their industry from which they could derive a reasonable income, the foundation on which they would build is the co-operative idea.  They would come in and make provision for yearly contracts. They would set up their own depots in the City of Dublin.  If for a month, or two, or three during the summer there was a surplus over what it was possible to have distributed and consumed in the city they would find another way of dealing with it.  If they had an organisation such as that we would not have any of the complaints we hear to-day that the proprietary concerns leave the farmers' milk on the roadside, that they will not take it, that it is not sold, that it is lost, and not used.</P>
    <P>It is a deplorable condition of things that in a country like this anyone should stand up and say that milk is left on the roadside and is wasted.  I think the Minister should determine to discover the cost of production of milk not only from the point of view of those who are engaged in the trade in Dublin, but in order that if difficulties arise in future, with regard to costs, he will be able to put the figures before those who are to arbitrate on such a question.  He would be able to say: &ldquo;There are the costs, as determined under ordinary conditions, and there is no need to have strikes or to have quarrels about this.&rdquo;  In addition, I <Col N="1274" /> think he ought to aim at co-operative organisation and give all possible assistance through his Milk Board and through his officials to establishing such organisation amongst the farmers. I think if that were done a great many of the middlemen who are in this business would be eliminated.  Some of these middlemen are probably getting more out of it than the people who are producing the milk.  By that means you would definitely have cheaper milk and, I believe, healthier, cleaner milk.  But much more than the Minister has attempted yet has to be done before the ideal which I think every member of this House and, I am sure, the Minister, sets before him is achieved.</P>

      <P>Tá sé chó déannach, níl mé chun morán a rádh.  Ba mhaith liom cupla focal a rádh.  We had a long discussion here ranging over wide fields, but my object is to speak on behalf of the poor of the city who are paying a big price for milk, whoever is responsible.  In the poorest retail shops in this city, poor people are paying at the rate of 1/8 per gallon for milk.  These poor people, the poorest of the poor, who are living on outdoor relief and unemployment assistance, have to pay 1/8 per gallon as the lowest price at which they can get milk.  In comparison with that, the price that is being paid to the farmers down the country is, I think, something less than 7d. per gallon.  We naturally ask ourselves the question: How is this allowed to go on?  The man who is responsible for all the hardship and trouble and expense of milk-producing gets something less than 7d. a gallon, I think, in the creameries and the poor people are paying at the rate of 1/8 a gallon.  I am sure the Minister will have a very fine answer to make, but it is a fact, at all events, which requires consideration and looking into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard Senator Johnston ranging over a wide area here.  Everything seems to be going wrong according to him, and the Senator says that the cow-keepers' yards of Dublin are insanitary. There are two members of the Dublin Corporation on my left and they know, as I know, that the cow-keepers are probably the hardest <Col N="1275" /> worked sections of the citizens of this city.  I think I may say they are the hardest worked section of the citizens. They have heavy rates to pay and they have to pay the standard rate of wages to the men they employ. The milk is produced under certain restrictions and conditions, and the public health authorities have their inspection of the article, and the veterinary surgeons are inspecting their cow-houses.  Now, I cannot see how it is that dairymen cannot produce milk as cleanly in a dairy yard in Dublin as they can produce it on a farm down the country.  When I was a boy going to school I milked cows, and I know all about the milking of cows, just as much as some of the arm-chair dairymen we have here.  Senator Sir John Keane seemed to cast a slight upon the manner in which milk is produced in Dublin.  He referred to the need for washing hands and the clothing which the workers have to get here in this city.  How much more carefully is milking carried on down through the counties where the lorries pick it up on the side of the road? There are common-sense people here, and they know how much more carefully it is done where milk is left on the side of the road.  I know what I am talking about.</P>
    <P>There is one thing the Minister might pay a little attention to, and I presume possibly he has done so. In this city the majority of the big dairy houses are wiped out through foot-and-mouth disease.  Nearly all the big dairy producing yards are wiped out.  I do not know whether these people will be able to get their yards stocked again before next July, August and September. If they are not able to get them stocked I am afraid there will be a very serious crisis in this city in these months, when milk is beginning to get scarce and the weather is beginning to get hot, and the milk is beginning to get sour in long train or lorry journeys. In my opinion there will arise a very serious situation in the months of August or September, when the milk will be getting scarce and brought into the city in long train or lorry journeys. Senator Johnston referred to the fact <Col N="1276" /> that the Dublin Corporation should engage in trading in milk as is done in Waterford.  Although he is a professor in Dublin, Senator Johnston has very little knowledge of things as they exist in Dublin.  Senator Sir John Keane, although he first approved of the Senator's remark, afterwards disagreed with him because he said there was too much politics in the Dublin Corporation. Well, I would like to know if Senator Sir John Keane ever paid any attention to politics.  I think it was Bobby Burns who wrote: &ldquo;Oh, would some power the giftie gie us to see ourselves as others see us&rdquo;.  It is a pity that these people who criticise do not at first examine themselves and examine their own consciences to see whether they can speak about it.</P>
    <P>Well, Sir, what I stood up here to do was to ask the Minister to look into the question whether poor Dublin citizens cannot get milk at a cheaper price, considering the price at which it is sold in the creameries, and furthermore, as there are milk producers here, why is it that our farmers do not make some provision for winter dairying?  Surely our climate is much milder than the climate of Denmark, and if Denmark can make a success of winter dairying or butter producing during the winter, why cannot we do it with our milder climate and richer soil?  I also wanted to ask the Minister if he cannot give, and I presume he will be able to give, some reason for the difference between 7d. a gallon that the farmers get and the 1/8 per gallon that is the cheapest price here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I entirely agree with the Minister in saying that the 1936 Act has given general satisfaction.  I think there is nobody in the trade, and I do not remember <Col N="1277" /> a time when my people were not sending in to Dublin&mdash;there is nobody in the trade who would go back to the conditions previous to the 1936 Act&mdash;I am sorry if I have to agree that if the Act has not been as effective as it should have been it is, to an extent, our own people's fault.  It is rather humiliating to have to admit this, but the fact remains that the hand-back, or the giving of luck as we call it in the country, has done a tremendous amount of harm to the effective working of the Act, especially where there are two prices, as when the wholesaler has to depend on the retailers to sell the milk.  A great many of them went on strike to get the higher price than by giving the hand-back&mdash;it has disorganised the market and created chaos in the trade. The Minister has put in penalties, at least on paper, but until we have co-operation and until the people whom this Act was brought in to benefit avail of that benefit I do not see any great hope of doing away with this evil.  As far as the creameries are concerned, I do not see that anyone has any quarrel.  The creameries have fulfilled the Milk and Dairies Act or the Clean Milk Act in coming into Dublin, and I am sure they will have to fulfil it the same as anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has already pointed out the big difficulty, namely surplus of milk in May and June.  That is due to two causes.  He mentioned one of them, the local producer, the man in whom my friend Senator Healy is interested who feeds extensively during the winter.  His cows, as one Senator mentioned, do not see the sun at all during the winter months.  Then he takes grass on the 11-months' system, and when his cows, which have been so very well fed during the winter, are sent out on this grass they milk very heavily.  He finds himself with a large surplus of milk and sells it at any old price.  Unfortunately there are also a number of people down the country who will not carry on winter dairying. The main body of suppliers to the city who live in the adjacent counties do carry on winter dairying but it imposes heavy costs upon them.  It is, however, very beneficial to the country <Col N="1278" /> because it involves more tillage and means more employment.  This is the type of dairying that should be carried on by people who have a market, as we have, in the city.  There are unfortunately some people who send practically no milk to the city in winter time and then they come along with large supplies in summer; they add more confusion to that already existing.  I think a solution for this chaos would be provided if the suggestion of Senator Baxter, that an all-round price for the whole year should be fixed, were adopted.  I have often put that to the Minister myself.</P>
    <P>I think one of the big difficulties in ensuring regularity of supplies is the fact that the price of milk is reduced at the beginning of May.  Then it is raised again in August and once more in October.  Naturally consumers are puzzled by these frequent price changes.  I think the whole trouble could be obviated if an arrangement were made that only the same people who supplied milk to the city during the winter were allowed to supply it during the summer.  By the adoption of what is now provided for in this Bill, yearly contracts, that could be got over.  If a man makes a yearly contract, he knows the price he is going to get and he can make his arrangements accordingly.  I believe that system would result in an increase in winter dairying and would mean more tillage and more employment.  I should like to convert the Minister and his Department to that point of view, that we should get the Milk Board to fix a price for the whole year round.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston and some other Senators dealt with the whole country in their remarks.  A fact that strikes me very forcibly is that frequently we hear a lot in this House about the woes of the farmer, but the very moment the farmer comes to look for a decent price for something which he has to sell, a price which it is in our power to ensure for him, it will not be given him.  We are told that it is going to cost too much.  Other people are allowed decent wages and salaries, but if the farmer says &ldquo;I want an economic price for my produce; I want something for <Col N="1279" /> myself and I want to be able to pay a decent wage to those whom I employ&rdquo;, he is told that it would cost too much.  I quite agree that farmers are supplying milk to creameries at a much lower price, but that is not our fault.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that a very large percentage of this milk is supplied by farmers who engage in dairying only during the summer months.  If a man is to engage in dairying for the whole year round, he cannot produce milk at the same rate.  I have been sending out milk since I came into possession of the place I hold at present and I can assure you I am not getting 100 per cent. more than I was receiving 28 or 29 years ago.  On the other hand all my outgoings, with the exception of rent, have increased by considerably more than 100 per cent. Carriage for instance has increased by 150 per cent.  Wages have also increased by more than 100 per cent. and the cost of feeding and everything else has risen accordingly.  At no time, taking the whole year round, have I got more than 100 per cent. or hardly even 100 per cent. more than the prices which obtained when I first started in the business.  There are no fortunes to be made in the industry at all.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Senator Baxter has left the House.  I remember an occasion when another member of the same commission said that milk could be produced at 6d.&mdash;that was during the summer months.  Under present conditions you may produce it at about 7d. but last winter it could not be produced at anything like that figure.  Senator Baxter has great faith in the co-operative movement.  I agree with him in that but we must remember that when a co-operative store was started in the city the result was disastrous.  It was, of course, started at a bad time, during the Civil War, but the people who had anything to do with it are since very nervous about touching a similar project.  I made an effort six or seven years ago to get one going but we could get nobody to take on the job.</P>
    <P>Probably the Minister may see his <Col N="1280" /> way sometime in the future to arrange to have a depot in Dublin controlled by the Dublin Milk Board or some other semi-Government body into which all milk would be sent and to which distributors would have to go for their supply.  In that way, we could deal with people who send an irregular supply and who sell at a low price.  I know the difficulty is that the Dublin cowkeepers might object to that but I think that it should present no difficulty to them.  I think they could continue trading as they always did.  They bring the milk round from door to door and they do not directly interfere with our trade.  We send the milk to wholesalers and retailers.</P>
    <P>The charge has been also made that a monopoly has been set up but we must remember that, in the five counties specified, anybody has a right to send milk to Dublin provided they fulfil the conditions laid down in the Milk and Dairies Act.  Furthermore, nobody who was sending milk to Dublin from any part of Ireland at the time the Act was passed is debarred from sending milk now.  On the whole I welcome this Bill.  I should like if it had gone much further but we cannot travel too quickly as I have already said.  Probably in another year or two, the Minister will find it possible to extend these measures.  I am sure that he is quite willing to adopt any scheme that is calculated to promote the interests of all concerned.  I was more or less the originator of the scheme which he has already accepted and I hope to give him another scheme before the year is out.</P>
    <P>We heard a good deal during the debate to the effect that the price of milk should be controlled by the law of supply and demand.  I say that that is nonsense.  Any man engaged in dairying must make a living out of it.  If we were to apply the law of supply and demand to wages, it would react unfairly on labour.  Similarly, if we were to apply it to other agricultural products, there would be no such thing as a fixed price for beet and wheat.  When milk has to be produced under the conditions prescribed under the Milk and Dairies Act, the people who are producing <Col N="1281" /> that milk are entitled at least to get the cost of production out of it, and something over and above that to enable them to live on fairly reasonable standards.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the two questions that I have put up to him&mdash;the possibility of trying to get all milk sent to the one place, and above all, when fixing the next price, to fix it for the whole of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two systems in this country; one is where the farmer's wife produces milk and sends it to the creamery, and the other is where she produces milk for human consumption.  Senator Healy referred to the fact that they were sending milk to the creamery at 7d. per gallon while they were getting one and a half times that in Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>

I may be wrong, but I am open to correction.  That is my candid opinion.</P>

      <P>There is nobody more anxious that the poor would get cheap milk than I am.  I am with Senator Healy in that, but how to do it is the question.  Whether any statement made in this House would lead to cheaper milk for the people of Dublin or not remains to be seen.  Production, consumption and distribution of milk in this country are lamentably bad.</P>
      <P>We are aiming at producing cows that yield about 400 gallons per annum. On the Continent they have produced a type of cow that yields 600.  The explanation is that we specialise in store cattle, good for breeding purposes, and we more or less neglect the milking qualities.  I am wondering whether it would not be more or less legitimate to put a tax on the production of our store cattle and subsidise the dairying side of the industry.  It is a very delicate and difficult matter, but it has occurred to me as a possible solution. While we have to deal with low-grade milking cows, which are definitely good for beef purposes, the cost of milk production in this country is bound to be high.  In London 80 per cent. of the distribution of milk is carried out by one firm&mdash;the United Dairies.  In the City of Dublin I do not know how many are engaged in it, but at any rate it is quite clear that the distribution is very costly and cumbersome, and if the Minister could do anything about arranging for a central depot on the lines on which the London milk supply is arranged, he would be doing a very great day's work.  He has the medical qualifications, and he has the agricultural qualifications, and if he combines both, and during his term of office did something to meet the milk situation in Dublin he would be doing something which generations yet unborn would thank him for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is need in Dublin for a central depot; an arrangement with the producers themselves, with a public company, or with the State.  When we arrive at that stage the distribution of milk will be more healthy, wholesome and economic.  As far as I know, cow-yards are peculiar to Dublin.  I do not know that they exist in any other place to the same extent.  I doubt <Col N="1283" /> if there are any in Cork.  You might find one or two cow-yards in some of the big English cities, but they are all over the place in Dublin, and during this epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease the cow-yards must have suffered considerably, and it would be, I think, an opportune time to eliminate them, because it does not appear to be sanitary or healthy, and it is peculiar to Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Callaghan has made a statement which, if correct, will have a very important bearing on this subject.  He states that he was a dairy farmer supplying a creamery, and that he also supplied the city, and he said that the dairy farmer producing for the creamery was as well off as the farmer producing for the city.  If that is so, it shows that the extra price in the city is not due to the producers, and we must seek elsewhere for the reason for the great discrepancy between the price in the city and that obtained by the producer. Like some other speakers, I have been surprised at the extraordinary price of milk in the city, and I have sought in vain for an explanation for it.  I think it could be reasonably said that the price of milk, taken all the year round, to the ordinary customer in the city, would not be less than 1/10 per gallon. We export normally about 400,000 cwts. of butter every year, and the equivalent <Col N="1284" /> in gallons of milk would be roughly about 100,000,000.  Taking the price last year at 126/- and allowing for the cost of transit and the value of the milk retained, I think that I could place the value, the net price received for that milk, from the export market, at about 6½d. per gallon.  There were 100,000,000 sold at 6½d., and at the same time it was not sold at less than 1/10 in Dublin.  There is a terrible difference between the two, and I cannot understand why it should be.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with some of the objections raised to allowing the population of the cities to take milk from the outside districts.  It is said that the milk produced under country conditions and sent to the creameries is not fit for human consumption, that it is likely to be tainted, or infected with germs, and that it is not clean. Looking fairly at the matter, the first factor that will confront any expert who examines the situation is that the farmers, the farmers' wives, their children and their labourers have been drinking that milk for years, and that if it were infected with tuberculosis, or if it were dirty, they would not be the healthy individuals they are.  This whole question regarding tuberculosis has been exaggerated.  There cannot be any serious danger from tubercular germs in the milk produced in the country, because very few cases of tuberculosis amongst people in the country could be traced to infection from milk.  Many years ago, a German professor stated that tuberculosis was not transferable from animals to human beings.  That has been contested since, but experience in the country would go to show that that was the case.  There may be cases of infection amongst children but they are very few and they excite observation because of their tragic nature.  These cases, however, are not comparable with the number of deaths that take place from malnutrition. That is a fact which we have to face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Working people in the towns and cities and people out of employment say that they are scarcely able to buy any new milk for their children and the result is that they are undernourished. <Col N="1285" /> The difference between 1/2 per gallon and 1/10 per gallon would be responsible for the loss of hundreds of lives of children in our cities.  That must be so because these children do not get a sufficiency of milk, and the result is that they are underfed and undernourished and subject to disease. People in the cities are not getting enough milk and we ought all to endeavour to see how that want can be met.  The milk supplied by tuberculin-tested herds is, undoubtedly, a very good milk and I am sure it cannot be produced at a much lesser figure than that at which it is being sold. Producers of milk are not getting any exceptional price and, under the conditions governing the production of milk, there is very little profit in it. The milk which is so plentiful in the country should be made available for the masses of the people in the cities. Those who are well off are able to purchase the tuberculin-tested milk and it is worth the price.  But, for ordinary people who cannot afford that, the milk supply of the country should, by some means, be made available.  The milk produced all over the country, particularly in the creameries, is as good as is being produced for consumption in the cities.  The butter-content of creamery milk all the year round would be 3.50 starting, in the month of April at 3.20, while in the month of November it would be 4.50.</P>
    <P>The point was made that the milk supply of the country was purely a summer supply.  That is not exactly true.  There is an ample supply to the creameries from the month of March until nearly the end of December. There would be sufficient milk to supply a great portion of the city's wants for nine months of the year, and it would go very far towards supplying those wants during another month or two.  I see no reason why, if there were proper organisation as regards transport and distribution, the counties should not be able to supply the city at a reasonable rate.  I am not an expert on this matter, but I think that the cost of distribution and the overlapping of interests in the city must be responsible for the exceptionally high costs.  I rather like the idea of <Col N="1286" /> a central marketing organisation which has been urged.  That has been the solution of some difficulties as regards the butter trade.  It has enabled the consumer to receive his butter at one price for several years, whether there was a slump or a glut.  The same thing could, possibly, be done for the milk supply.</P>
    <P>Another reason for the high price is the wastage of milk.  With existing prices, there is not enough consumption and, at times, a surplus is left on the hands of the producers.  One producer said some time ago that he had to spill out his milk.  That milk should be turned into butter and not allowed to go waste.  The main point is that, by some means or other, a sufficient supply of cheap milk should be provided for the masses of the people in the city.  If we produce milk at about 6½d., allowing for everything, I feel quite sure that, if proper distribution were arranged, that milk could be sold in Dublin at 1/2, or at most 1/4, all the year round.  I see no reason why it should not be.  I should prefer milk to be produced in the neighbouring counties to avoid transit charges.  I should not like to see very much milk coming from the south because it would disorganise the economy of the dairying districts.  The separated milk is retained after the making of the butter and is used for feeding pigs and live stock.  That milk would be lost for this purpose if the supplies went to the cities.  It would be quite easy to get over the objections raised to having milk supplied to the cities from outside counties.  As regards cleanliness, the restrictions imposed are exaggerated. They have been responsible, indeed, for a great deal of the cost.  I feel strongly that these bacteriological experts or medical experts have run amok in that direction and piled on the costs by making unnecessary restrictions. All that is required is that the milk should be produced under clean conditions and it is quite easy to do that.  It would be quite easy to enforce that all over the country.  If farmers were guaranteed a little extra per gallon they would produce milk in reasonably clean condition.  Too many regulations and conditions have been <Col N="1287" /> imposed and these have entailed great expenditure.  I will show how this works out.  A creamery supplied some years ago to the boards of health at 8d. per gallon in summer and 10d. in the winter, so a little money went a long way.  That was, perhaps, the best scheme that was administered, as a relieving officer did the work and the people who needed the milk got it. Then the dairy regulations came into force and the sale of milk by creameries or private suppliers was suspended.  Conditions were introduced for the supply of milk and no provision was made for cases like this. I would like to support the suggestion made by Senator Johnston that some means should be considered by which the surplus milk should be made available for the people in the cities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>One point which I would like to bring to the Minister's attention is that, in the Golden Vale, where we have an abundance of milk, it would appear that it is very difficult to purchase milk in small quantities. In rural areas children have to travel a mile or two to purchase a pint of milk, although a neighbour produces thousands of gallons.  Either he would appear to be unwilling to sell or is prohibited by the creameries from doing so.  I understand he must have a certain licence to enable him to sell; but it seems preposterous that a rural would-be purchaser has to pass a farm place where thousands of gallons are produced in the week and cannot purchase a pint of milk there, even though he is prepared to pay a much higher price than the farmer would get at the creamery.  If it is the case that creamery managers have power to prohibit purchase, it is wrong; and, if it is not, the matter should be set right. Undoubtedly, there is a scarcity of milk for purchasers in rural districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very much surprised at the figures given by Professor Johnston in regard to the quantities consumed in the rural areas.  It is my experience that the last drop is supplied to the creameries and the minimum kept in the farmhouse.  They depend on skim milk for household purposes.  I think <Col N="1288" /> that is a tragedy.  One of the finest foods is being sold at 3½d. a gallon in the South of Ireland.  It is surely worth much more than that as a food, even though it is pasteurised.  I agree with Senators who say that there are too many restrictions with regard to the quality of milk.  I am in favour of pure milk production, but in farmers' houses, where milk is produced in large quantities, the incidence of tuberculosis is rare.  Tuberculosis exists to a much greater extent amongst the families of the poor people, who consume no milk as a food in itself, but use it in tea in very small quantities. The incidence of tubercular disease is greater there than amongst the children of farmers who consume milk and take butter.</P>
    <P>I often wonder whether the creameries are not an unmixed blessing. The farmers individually spend half the day delivering a few gallons of milk to a creamery, and come home with a few shillings in their pockets. Except in cases where the milk is produced in very large quantities, the system is not advantageous in an agricultural country.  It would be better for the farmer who has a few cows to make his own butter under proper conditions than to send the milk four or five miles to the creamery.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Senator who stated that the fundamental point is the dairy, the home and the environment in which the milk is produced and that these should be properly looked after.  If a better standard of milk producing cow were insisted on, there would not be the scarcity of milk and the exorbitant prices in cities and towns.  I understand that the milk, to the purchaser here, costs almost four times as much as the producer gets from the creameries in the South of Ireland.  I think that can be verified in the City of Dublin.  More encouragement should be given to the small farmers with three or four cows to produce their own butter and sell it as they did in former years.  A butter market could be established in suitable centres, and they could go there once a week, instead of trotting to the creamery every day with the <Col N="1289" /> pony and trap and wasting the better portion of the day.</P>
    <P>Nobody should be allowed to continue producing milk of inferior quality.  It costs as much to keep a cow which is a bad producer of milk as it does to keep any other.  There are many farms where you can see the attenuated half-starved cows.  The production of home butter in small quantities should be considered.  This should become less of a seasonal occupation and less dependent on nature and grass.  Cows are being kept in back gardens and backyards which should be out in the country and it is cruelty to animals to keep them in that way for the greater portion of their lives&mdash;feeding them very often on foreign feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>The Minister might enlighten us in regard to the scarcity of milk for sale in rural areas, and the consequent small consumption.  Transport is a terrible problem.  We find milk coming to large centres of production from districts 20 and 30 miles away. Possibly, milk is brought into the City of Dublin and sent back to supply large consumers of milk in the country. These transport anomalies could be remedied.  While they continue, we will have high milk prices.  Senator Campbell says that the farmers are getting high prices, but I do not believe that is so.  We should be glad to see them get better prices to enable them to increase their stock and replace old and useless stock by better-class animals.  Whoever is getting the high price, I would say the producer is not getting it.  I believe he has the least slice out of the profits, if any, that come from the production of milk.</P>

      <P>It is a surprise to me to hear it suggested, and I do not agree, that there should be a reserve market in Dublin for a few counties and a few creameries to send milk here.  I do not believe there should be a reserve market in any of the cities in this country.  I think there should be a free market and that anyone who has surplus milk down the country who desires to send it here should be <Col N="1290" /> allowed to do so.  Then you would have, to my mind, cheaper milk for the poor of the cities.  There is something wrong in the system when the price of milk is double what the producer gets before it reaches the consumer in the city.  There are, I believe, a few creameries licensed to sell milk here if they wish, but there are other creameries who would not be granted a licence.  I think that is not fair.  What my friend said about the shortage of milk in rural areas is not true.  The farmers who produce milk in rural areas are prepared at any time to sell milk to the poor of the area, and they would get much more for it than they would get by sending it to the creamery.  I want to refer to the price that the creameries are receiving at the moment, and received last year for their milk.  It is quite correct to say, as some Senators said here, that it would be on an average about 6d. a gallon.  That is small, and I want to say that the farmers in the coming season would not be able to produce milk at that low figure for the year. If they receive 1/10 or 2/- a gallon in the City of Dublin, surely the farmer down the country is entitled to at least 10d. a gallon.  Anything less than 10d. a gallon for the farmer selling his milk to the creamery certainly would not pay him or would not cover the cost of production.  That is being discussed throughout the country, and the creamery proprietors, creamery suppliers and the shareholders of the creameries have all agreed that they could not continue to produce milk at that low price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question was raised about the condition of the milk in rural areas, and the condition of the dairies and the manner in which milk is distributed to creameries.  The House must be aware that under the 1924 Dairy Produce Act milk must be delivered to the creameries in a clean condition and in clean vessels, and if an inspector of the Department finds that the milk is not clean or the cans that it was delivered in are not clean, there is a prosecution immediately.  As a man who knows a good deal about that part of it&mdash;and I welcomed that Act very much&mdash;I say it has improved the condition of the milk <Col N="1291" /> delivered at the creameries.  The creameries have to keep their plant in perfect order and in a clean condition. In view of the cost of all that, I would be inclined to give a kindly hint to the Minister that he should seriously consider increasing the price to farmers down the country for their milk for this season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a very interesting debate and I am sure the Minister found it useful.  It took cognisance of the fact that the Minister's problem, or rather the problem of the Dublin people, is to reconcile two points: One is to produce large quantities of good milk at a low price so that the people who need it most, the poor with large families, may have it in sufficient quantities, and the other is to be able to pay such a price to the producer that it would be worth his while to produce all through the year. To make these two coincide is very difficult and it would require all the best brains the Minister has at his disposal to solve the problem thus presented, but it is a problem that has to be solved.  The production of milk at this particular time is of more than usual importance owing to the difficulty about tea.  The best fluid our people could substitute for tea is, of course, milk and I join with the other Senators who have spoken of the difficulties that have been laid on the producers by insistence on too rigid conditions.  This has been the case in Northern Ireland where many people produced good milk in good quantities, but a fanciful system of classification of dairies and producers left the ordinary people out of production altogether and then the price of milk became so high that poor people were not able to buy it.  In this part of the country, and in Dublin especially, a great deal has been done by the Government in its grant for free milk.  And here I would like to pay tribute to the grand work done by such societies as the Infant Aid Society.  In giving money for the supply of milk to the children of the poorest of the poor a high standard of milk was insisted on and so it is that these children get the best milk that can be produced in Ireland. <Col N="1292" /> Money cannot buy better milk.  That is all brought to the doors of the poor in the purest and best condition.  It took organising to do this and the Minister, I am sure, is conscious of the good work that was done by the women who are in charge of that particular scheme.</P>
      <P>With regard to the country people, I think if farmers were taught and if they had a proper class of wife&mdash;I always have to come back to that again&mdash;they would keep their dairy clean, as their mothers did, as all our mothers did.  They would be proud of their dairies and proud of their good butter and the good farmer's wife, with her standard of cleanliness, would ensure that the conditions were good enough for everybody.</P>
      <P>I agree, of course, with the Senator who spoke about milking strains.  That is a thing to which we should give great attention.  There is probably going to be a great change in our economy after the war.  Our relations with other countries will probably be very much modified and we will be producing, perhaps, more for ourselves, in consideration of our own needs rather than the needs of outsiders.  All these things will be present in the Minister's mind when he is addressing himself to the milk problem.  However, I think he has got most useful help from this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two things struck me as of very great importance.  That was the suggestion of a sort of central milk depot here in Dublin, and the other thing was that we should aim at the development of co-operation among the farmers. This problem of milk production is perhaps the most insistent and imperative that we have at the present moment.  I do not know whether the Agricultural Commission reported on it but it is a portion of our whole agricultural problem and you cannot segregate it from the whole agricultural position.  The question that we are dealing with is to find its place in the whole agricultural scheme, but for the moment the problem that the Minister has is to see that this country produces sufficient milk of good quality <Col N="1293" /> and at a price that is not beyond the reach of those who need it most.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Senator Mrs. Concannon has summarised what everybody wants, that is, to get a sufficient quantity of pure and good milk at a remunerative price to the producer sold at a cheap cost to the consumer.  Well, it is not an easy thing to do.  Most of our difficulties, I suppose, arise from the fact that it is very hard to please both the producer and the consumer in any of the articles of agricultural production that we have to deal with.  I quite agree with what some of the Senators said here, and the last Senator who spoke, that milk is a very important and a very essential item of diet and that we should even depart from the ordinary procedure that we adopt in other things to see that the poor and consumers in general get milk in good condition at a reasonable price.  Well now, I must say that I feel very much encouraged to have men like Senator Johnston and Senator Sir John Keane finding fault with me, because I am not radical enough and because I am not socialist enough in my views on this question, because I believe that myself.  I would like very much to go further in this thing and I would like very much to take over some of the vested interests and deal with them rather drastically, as suggested by these Senators, and see if the thing could not be rationalised, if the whole question of distribution of milk in the city could not be rationalised, so as to see the people get a good supply at a reasonable price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various schemes have been thought of.  The first one that would naturally occur to anybody is the scheme mentioned by some Senators, that is, co-operation amongst the producers themselves. But Senator Byrne told you that that was tried and failed.  Even so, we should not take that as ruling the project out as hopeless, but I am afraid there are big obstacles in the way of getting this done on a co-operative basis.  There was the other suggestion made; one that gave a partial solution of the problem was made by Senator Byrne, and that is, a milk depôt, to which all milk would be brought and given out through the <Col N="1294" /> present channel of distribution.  That would only solve the problem of the producer.  It would ensure that the producer would get his price, but it would not go further, and it would not, I think, lessen in any way the price of milk to the consumers; so to that extent it is only a partial solution, but it might give a step towards a final solution of both ends of the scheme, that is, the producers and the consumers together.  Another suggestion that was made here by some of the Senators was that it should be done as a municipal enterprise.  I believe myself that that is the proper solution.  It is a scheme we have at present under consideration.  It is being considered, and I hope that the corporation may take the same view as some of the Senators here, because I think it is a matter that should be done by the municipality.  It is not a matter for the State as, for instance, the central marketing of butter is probably a matter for the State because all butter is dealt with in the same way throughout the country, whether it is exported or used for home consumption.  But in this matter we are dealing with Dublin, Cork, and Limerick, and so on, and in that way it is a matter for each municipality to deal with for itself.</P>
    <P>The big consuming centre, of course, is Dublin, and I do hope the Dublin Corporation will take the view that this matter should be dealt with municipally, and I agree with what one Senator says, that if the Dublin Corporation were to take over this matter, they could have the present fixed price, and have the interest of those who are unnecessarily in the business compensated, and provide adequate compensation, and in providing that they could deliver milk cheaper to the consumers of this city.  I am quite sure they could do that, and at the same time ensure a supply of milk of the best quality. The same applies to Cork.  That is the big question that came up for discussion. There are a few other points that arose.  Senator Johnston spoke of the small amount of milk that is consumed. The Senator says that in the census that was taken in 1926 it was estimated that 20,000,000 gallons were consumed by our urban population or non-agricultural <Col N="1295" /> population, I should put it. Well, that non-agricultural population is somewhat over 1,000,000.  It is between 1,100,000 and 1,200,000.  Whether that figure is correct or not, I do not know.  They did not seem to have the same opportunity of giving an exact estimate as we have.  The Milk Board here in Dublin is collecting a levy on the milk consumed, and they get returns on that, and every Senator will know that when a dairyman makes a return on which he pays a levy, he does not make it higher than it is.</P>
    <P>According to the returns made the consumption here in the city, which includes Dun Laoghaire, is 40,000 gallons, that is, for 500,000, and that would work out at more than half-a-pint a head.  It is .6 per person and not .38 as Senator Johnston's figure would show.  Going further, it works out at 14,500,000 gallons in the City of Dublin, and the number of people in this area form considerably less than half the non-agricultural population, so that the consumption, therefore, at the present time amongst the non-agricultural population must be about 30,000,000 gallons and not 20,000,000 as mentioned by Senator Johnston.  Now there was a lot of talk here about the farmer selling the milk at 7d. or 6d. a gallon and the consumer pays 9d. a quart.  It is always possible to get figures of that kind.  It is just like the figure mentioned of the farmer selling his pig at 80/- per cwt., which is 8d. per lb., and the consumer paying 2/4, but the farmer has sold the pig live weight and the consumer bought a particular pound off that pig, the back rasher.  Here again you have farmers selling milk at 6d. a gallon to the creameries, but it must be remembered that they are supplying the creameries and are getting skimmed milk back.  Senator Johnston says that is value for 2d. per gallon, and I think he is right.  The fact must also be remembered that the farmer is practically a seasonal producer.  He supplies very big quantities during the summer and he only supplies a small quantity during the winter.  In any case he is not the supplier to the city.</P>
    <P>The supplier to the city must maintain his herd to produce a certain <Col N="1296" /> quantity of milk the whole year round. That means he must purchase cows when they are dear coming on to the winter and get rid of them when they are no use at a very low price.</P>
    <P>He must purchase concentrated feeding stuff at a very high price to keep his herd milking at full capacity during the winter and he must pay higher wages than his neighbours who are not in the milk business.  If you have two farmers living side by side say in County Wicklow, one engaged in mixed farming and the other in producing milk for the Dublin market, the farmer who is sending milk to Dublin must get his men in at four or five or perhaps six o'clock in the morning.  The farmer who is engaged in mixed farming need not have his men in until eight o'clock to do their nine-hour day. Naturally no one will argue that it is as easy to go into work at four o'clock in the morning as it is at eight o'clock.  The result is that the dairy farmer who supplies milk to the city must pay higher wages.  He has quite a lot of costs of that kind to contend with.  The average price for his milk for the whole year round is about 1/1 a gallon.  It is necessary to make that correction.  It is not correct to say that the milk sent to Dublin is produced at 6d. a gallon, nor is it correct to say that people in Dublin have to pay 8d. or 9d. a quart for that milk. Some people may be paying that price but it is possible for poor people in some parts of Dublin to buy milk over the counter at 2d. a pint.</P>

      <P>A rich person can get it if he is prepared to pocket his pride and go for it with a jug.  It is possible for any person to buy milk over the counter in certain parts of Dublin at that price.  People, however, who get milk delivered to their homes have to pay for the luxury of having that milk brought to their doors.  I believe that milk is delivered at present at a price as low as 2½d. per pint though some people may be paying 3½d. or 4d.</P>

      <P>I did not know that the price was as low as that, but I know that in some cases it is delivered at a price as low as 2½d. per pint.  I know the price varies very much.  Many people are paying for getting the milk in a certain condition and in a certain receptacle such as a bottle or a carton container.  They are prepared to pay an extra price for that.  It is very hard to make any estimate of the cost of distribution because it varies very much.  I do not know what a fair cost of distribution would be.  We have not carried out any investigation here, but I have read of investigations which were carried out in England.  A Royal Commission considered the matter there recently, and I think they thought that milk could be distributed in London at about 9d. a gallon.  There was also an investigation carried out in Cambridge by the agricultural section of the Cambridge University. They put the cost of distribution as high as 1/- or 1/2 a gallon.  Opinions differ there, as here.  It is very difficult, indeed it is impossible, to get any sort of firm figure on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That recalls to my mind the fact that on a former occasion, when we were discussing the question of the price of bread sold over the counter as compared with the price of bread delivered, what struck me was that the man who made the delivery was getting a greater return for the delivery than the farmer who was producing the wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the cost of delivery is very high in Dublin; it was pointed out here that there are cars coming into every street and that a very big saving could be made by rationalisation.  That, however, would mean putting certain people out of business who would have to be compensated.  It might be possible to provide for that and still have milk cheaper than it is at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1298" /> A point was also raised about keeping cows in yards in the city.  There seems to be a difference of opinion on that question.  I have never had any view upon it but, luckily for myself, I need not have any view.  It is a matter for the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  If the Minister or his officers think that these premises are not sanitary, these people will not be allowed to carry on business.  No investigation has been carried out as to the quality of milk produced in creameries or the wholesomeness of that milk.  Senator Sir John Keane asked a question about that.  I do not know whether it would be possible to get that done or not. The point was made by three or four Senators whether it would not be better to have enough milk and to take some risk as to the quality.  That again is a very difficult question to decide.  I think that probably Senators who raised the question are right when they suggest that there is more ill-health, or at least lack of health, amongst those who do not get enough milk than there is amongst those who get enough milk.  I think it is probably true that those who take the risk, without all the various examinations, tubercular tests, etc., and who drink enough milk, are, on the average, much more healthy than the poor people who do not get enough milk.  I do not say that any moral or lesson should be drawn from that, but I think it is a fact.</P>
    <P>The question was raised by Senator Sir John Keane whether pasteurisation injured milk in any way.  I do not know, but I know that medical officers in charge of some of the great cities of England will not permit pasteurised milk into their cities, while others in charge of other cities will not permit anything except pasteurised milk to be sold.  We cannot get any unanimity on that point.  I did read an article written by some person who carried out experiments and he did not place very much reliance on this argument about vitamins.  He described an experiment he carried out in which he fed a certain number of rats on tubercule-free milk, a certain number on pasteurised milk, a third lot on milk taken straight from <Col N="1299" /> the cow, a fourth on dried milk powder and a fifth on condensed milk.  He tried all the different varieties and he said the result of his experiment after three months' feeding showed that there was not the slightest difference between one rat and another.  Senator Sir John Keane observed, and other Senators have agreed, that it is a wrong principle to limit the market for Dublin to a certain number of farmers. I admit the principle is wrong, but still it was necessary in all the circumstances. We have not done any injury to any farmer, because when the Act was first brought in in 1936, we allowed any farmer who was sending milk to Dublin at that time to continue in business.  He has a special licence and he can continue for all time to supply milk here.</P>
    <P>Senator Healy raised a matter about the Dublin dairies where herds have been wiped out by foot-and-mouth disease, and he thinks that a serious position may arise if these people are unable to restock their dairies before the autumn.  There again, it is not a matter really for me.  As far as my Department is concerned, we are practically finished now with these particular premises where foot-and-mouth disease occurred in Dublin, and it is now a matter for the Minister for Public Health or the public health authorities in the City of Dublin to allow those dairies to come along again.  I do not know, of course, whether they will or not, or whether the owners are prepared again to go into business.  In any case, I do not think that that will be serious.  I think we will always be able to get enough milk from the creamery supply to make up for any deficiency in the city.  Since Senator Byrne raised the question of a level price the whole year round, I think that would be an ideal solution if this business was being done by the municipality or alternatively if we had a milk depôt as outlined by Senator Byrne.  It would be possible then, I think, to have the level price the whole year round.  I am sure it would be much better and much more convenient for consumers, that if they had to pay 2d. a pint in the summer, going up to <Col N="1300" /> 4d. per pint in the winter, to have it at 3d. per pint all the year round.  The price to the producer could be adjusted and it would be better for the consumer. But first we would have to have a depôt, and somebody, such as the municipality, doing the whole job.</P>
    <P>The only other point raised was that by Senator Cummins&mdash;that it is difficult to get milk even in such a very large producing area as the Golden Vale.  That is true, I believe.  It is due to the Milk and Dairies Act.  The farmers who supply milk to the creameries are not registered under the Act and, therefore, are not permitted to sell milk for human consumption. There is a certain proviso attaching to it that they can sell milk to their own employees up to about a gallon a day, I think, but they are not permitted to sell outside.  So that it is quite possible that people in the country, living in the midst of the dairying district, may not be able to get milk for human consumption because it would not pay the farmers to register unless they did a fair business. We are investigating it and are trying to get some solution during the present crisis, even though it may be only a temporary one.  These were the only points that were raised, as far as I can recall, and I do agree with some of the Senators who spoke here, that the discussion was very helpful and certainly very wide.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a further measure intended to secure that such of our mineral resources as are capable of being worked economically will be developed.  The provisions of the Bill follow closely the provisions of the Slievardagh Act.  In both cases the Minister for Industry and Commerce is authorised to register <Col N="1301" /> a company under the Companies Acts.  The share capital of this company will be for a nominal amount, as was the case under the Slievardagh Act.  The moneys needed in this case will likewise be provided by way of repayable advances.  In this case, as in the case of the Slievardagh, the amount of the advance is limited.  Here the limit is £50,000.  The sums needed from time to time will be borne on the Vote for Industry and Commerce.  Before proceeding to discuss the purposes of the Bill, the Seanad might expect a word from me in justification of the method adopted for financing the new company.  Certain members of the Seanad criticised the method adopted for financing the Slievardagh Company. They argued that it was bad finance to fix at £100 the nominal capital of a company charged with the development of a coalfield, and they expressed the hope that the precedent created in the Slievardagh Act would not be followed in other Bills.  I have carefully considered the points which were made, but I have found myself unable to depart from the procedure which was embodied in the earlier Act. There are very good reasons for not departing from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a speculative enterprise, financed out of public moneys&mdash;and all mining enterprises have necessarily an element of speculation about them&mdash;it is desirable that the activities of the company to whom the enterprise is entrusted should be kept under reasonably constant supervision by the authority which is providing the finances&mdash;in this case the Oireachtas.  The provisions in this Bill require that the moneys to be provided for the company should be carried annually on the Vote for Industry and Commerce, and that procedure will provide members of the Oireachtas with the opportunity of examining the progress which is being made by the company, and of considering the returns being secured from the enterprise; and if it is found desirable in the light of the facts as they then exist, of either curtailing its activities or putting a definite end to them, the Oireachtas has the opportunity of doing that under the method of financing <Col N="1302" /> which is provided for in this Bill. Secondly, the total amount of moneys that may have to be put at the disposal of the new company cannot be estimated even roughly at this stage. The amount of money which it will require will depend on the extent and character of the exploration work which the company finds itself justified in undertaking.</P>
    <P>The cost of any particular project can only be estimated when the company has actually received tenders for the work.  At this stage the number of prospects which the company may decide to investigate over a period of time is a matter of sheer conjecture. It is impossible in such circumstances, to try to make an estimate of the company's requirements.  All we can do is to fix a limit to the State's commitments under the Bill, and within that limit to provide the company with such finances as its activities, from time to time, may require, and as the Oireachtas may think to be justifiable.  This Bill, therefore, and the Slievardagh Act are similar in their general framework, and in the method adopted for financing them.  The task to be entrusted to the two companies, however, are in some respects not quite similar.  The primary task of the Slievardagh Company was the specific one of developing a coalfield which had already been surveyed.  The general task of the company to be created under this Bill will be to survey and examine areas which have not yet been examined, and to report which of them contain deposits that are worth developing.  The importance of this task and the necessity for it, I think, will be readily accepted.</P>
    <P>The first step towards a proper exploitation of our mineral resources is to learn more about them, their extent, their accessibility and their practical value.  Our knowledge to-day under these heads is so meagre that all we can say about the majority of our mineral deposits is that we know of their presence.  Nobody can say authoritatively that they are worth developing.  Neither can anybody say that they are not worth developing. The idea that there are no mineral deposits in Ireland capable of economic exploitation may be as far removed <Col N="1303" /> from the truth as the idea that the country is rich in mineral resources. The primary object of this company is to ascertain what the truth is.  No real progress can be made until the facts are established as precisely as it is possible to establish them.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, no guarantee that the surveys and prospecting to be undertaken by this company will lead to the establishment of successful mining enterprises.  In mining ventures, there are no certainties.  All that can be said is that there is a chance that self-supporting mineral enterprises will be established as a result of the investigations to be undertaken under the auspices of this company. One of the factors favouring that chance is the revolution that has taken place during the past 50 years in metallurgical and mining technique. New methods for the development of areas have been evolved and, under these, lodes which were formerly regarded as worthless can now be worked at a profit.  The general task of the company, therefore, will be to ascertain all that can be learned about our mineral deposits and to assess, as far as we can, the potentialities they possess.  With that general task, the provisions of Parts I and II of the Bill deal.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill goes further.  It invests the Minister for Industry and Commerce with powers to acquire on behalf of the company certain kinds of mineral enterprises as going concerns. Admittedly, the powers sought by the Minister in this part of the Bill are wide, but they are also carefully circumscribed. The Minister is not being authorised to acquire compulsorily enterprises of all kinds.  Compulsory powers are limited to the acquisition of concerns engaged in the development of mineral substances which are essential to the life of the community, and these can be acquired only when the quantities raised are short of the quantities needed by the community&mdash; when it would appear that it is in the public interest that they should be taken out of the hands of inefficient or inexperienced management and entrusted to more capable persons with <Col N="1304" /> a view to developing them to the extent to which they can be utilised to meet the public needs in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>For any concerns which may be acquired under Part III of the Bill compensation will be payable.  There are, in this part of the Bill, rather elaborate provisions regulating the payment of compensation and the basis of its assessment.  The rules about compensation follow the rules laid down in the Minerals Development Act.  The compensation may be fixed by agreement and, in default of agreement, is left for settlement by the mining board.  The mining board, as the House is, perhaps, aware, is a tribunal which was first established under the Minerals Development Act of 1931 and re-established under the Minerals Development Act of 1940.  It has been selected as the tribunal to which claims arising under this Bill will be referred for settlement for the reason that, by its very constitution, it is ideally suited for assessing the value of minerals and mining enterprises. The chairman of the board must, under the Act, be a barrister or a solicitor of, at least, ten years' standing.  The second member of the board must be one of the panel of official arbitrators, appointed under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.  The third member must be an officer of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>In the details of the Bill there is, I think, nothing which needs special mention.  In deference to what was said in the Seanad when the Slievardagh Bill was being discussed, I have provided that the accounts and reports of the company shall be laid before the Seanad as well as before the Dáil.  Parts I and II of the Bill follow the provisions of the Slievardagh Act.  Under Part III, the kind of businesses which may be acquired on behalf of the company are described.  As I have already indicated, they must be mining enterprises working commodities essential to the life of the community and they must furthermore be enterprises which, in present circumstances, are not meeting <Col N="1305" /> the needs of the community so that a more efficient exploitation of the minerals concerned is desirable.  In this part of the Bill provision is made regarding the notice to be served on existing owners and the method of settling the compensation which may be due to them for the property acquired.  The last section of this part of the Bill provides that an annual statement shall be furnished to the Oireachtas giving particulars of the company's operations during the year, including particulars of the businesses acquired by the company during that period.</P>

      <P>The Minister drew an analogy between the first and second parts of this Bill and the Slievardagh Act.  Frankly, I did not like the Slievardagh Bill.  Under normal circumstances, I should have voted against it, but the Minister may remember that one of the guiding points to agreement with it was that it related to an immediately-felt want arising out of the emergency&mdash;the shortage of fuel.  If the Slievardagh mines were of real value, considered in relation to world prices, normally one should expect some private person, moved by motives of his own betterment, to take them up and develop them.</P>
      <P>If the people in this country may be short of fuel, it might quite reasonably be right and proper that we should disregard what might be called a fair price for fuel, and be allowed to spend what would be really more than it was worth, in order to produce more in the special circumstances.  The Minister says that Parts I and II roughly provide for a survey and that at the present moment we only know that there are certain minerals in certain places, and that it is worth paying to find out whether they are in exploitable quantity or not.  I agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as this Bill arises out of completely abnormal circumstances of the time, when we are spending money in a way which would be quite lunatic except in these peculiar circumstances, I do not see why we should not spend it to find out if there is anything in the <Col N="1306" /> country which would have a certain moral effect on people who think that their patriotism requires them to pay no regard for truth and to believe that this country contains minerals existing under the soil when, in fact, they may not exist at all.  That has never been my idea of the requirements of patriotism.  The Minister says that Part III of the Bill gives him rather remarkable powers.  I believe that the Executive should have much more power than Deputies think but, in this sphere, the Government should have practically no power in normal circumstances. He says that the powers will relate only to enterprises relating to a mineral which is nationally necessary and will only relate when the national needs are more than the present quantity produced.  He did not clarify that point.</P>
    <P>It may well be, in relation to a particular substance, that nationally we consume more than is produced in the mines in this country producing that substance.  That may be the case, but we might have all we want by buying something that, normally, can be imported at a reasonable price.  If he is assuming that we need a certain amount nationally, that these mines produce a less amount, and that the deficit in requirements is not obtainable from overseas, in the present circumstances, then I quite agree.  The procedure he suggested seemed to me to imply that the mines would only be working&mdash;as far as one could judge by any reasonable calculation&mdash;after the present emergency would be over.  He seemed to suggest a sort of dual activity&mdash;surveying and then buying out these companies.  I cannot quite recall the Minister's point now.  We ought to hope that by the time the surveying would be complete &mdash; even taking a pessimistic view&mdash;the emergency would be over.</P>
    <P>The Minister also talked about companies being efficiently run and that the Bill provided that the new control must contain a barrister of ten years' standing, a civil servant, and a valuer &mdash; at present on the board. Frankly, I have not much belief in these businesses run by civil servants.</P>

      <P>I object on principle, in a general way, to a Government deciding that a man who owns property is not running it efficiently, and deciding that somebody should take it over. Therefore, in so far as the activities provided under this Bill are really analogous to the Slievardagh mines case, I would support it at the present time.  We supported the Slievardagh case because it related to fuel at a time when the people may be caused definite suffering by lack of fuel.  We know that the money might be spent wastefully, and decided we would not be too exacting or too exigent to see that the Government got value for the money.  In relation to the taking over of these businesses, I would be glad to know if it will relate only to something which is immediately necessary, and which cannot be obtained from overseas at present.  I distrust a Government Department with the powers we are giving them, in that they may become enthusiastic and start all sorts of businesses which would continue after the emergency.  I do not mind continuing one, if it can be shown to be an economic proposition.  While the abnormal circumstances are present, one does not need to know that the cost per ton of the given substance will not be greater than the cost per ton normally in the world, but we should not be committed to some business which will carry on after the emergency, if the costs are one penny per ton more than we would pay for the same goods outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill arises directly out of the emergency, to meet circumstances belonging to the emergency, and it is of such a nature as to be analogous to the Slievardagh Mines Bill.  That might be well and good, but I feel it is a danger, in relation to any Government <Col N="1308" /> during this period of emergency. The tendency is for the Government to extend its powers and sphere of operations in every way.  That is very dangerous for the situation after the emergency. We have all sorts of emergency powers here now, which we have agreed to rationally, though rather reluctantly, because they relate to particular circumstances.  When the emergency is over, it will not be as easy to get back into normal circumstances as it was to get into the abnormal circumstances.</P>
    <P>I would like to feel that the Government, in exercising these powers, will not only accept the limitations in the Bill, but will interpret them in a very rigid way, and will not put up money unless it is vitally necessary to the people at this time for something which is not procurable otherwise.  I should like to feel also that it will be borne in mind that the real specific purpose for such activities arises out of the emergency, and that, as soon as normal conditions are restored in the world, the whole situation will be considered in the light of the new circumstances, and the Government Department concerned will not feel that it must continue such schemes merely in order to justify what it has undertaken in the emergency time.  I should like the Minister to give the House the assurance that this is an emergency measure and that it will be strictly interpreted as such.</P>

      <P>My intervention at this stage is more or less of an inquiring nature.  We are interested, in the County Clare, in mineral resources which we have there as phosphates, and would like to know whether they will come under the terms of this Bill and, if not, whether this Bill could be expanded or enlarged in some way. I have no authority to speak for the present proprietors of those minerals, which are in private hands.  I am aware that if there were more capital and a bigger organisation the scheme could be very much extended.  I believe at the present time they are producing about 300 tons per week of raw material.  Every farmer will tell <Col N="1309" /> you that phosphates will be the thing most needed in the coming season. There is an unlimited supply of the raw material there and if it were developed to the full, instead of 300 tons a week, about could produce 300,000 tons a week.  I wish to inquire if it will come under the scope of the Bill in any way so that it may be further developed.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to this method of finance.  Whatever the objections may be to the method of providing fixed capital adopted in the Industrial Alcohol Act, in the case of an enterprise which was intended to give us a substitute for imported petrol, and which I now understand is not being operated at all, it seems rather roundabout and rather misleading to apply loans which are going to bear a rate of interest and be repaid.  As far as I can see there is no conceivable prospect of a company like this earning anything and being in a position to repay loans and interest. It is rather a pretence that we should put it in that form.  But there it is.  I suppose later on the Minister will have to go through the form of asking the authority of Parliament to remit the interest which has accumulated, and so on.  It seems a roundabout business, but I am afraid when you get a mixture of State and business you do get extraordinary roundabout methods and fictitious situations, which, of course, no business enterprise would ever have for a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential section in this Bill appears to me to be Section 18 (a). Apparently this company can only acquire commodities &ldquo;essential to the life of the community&rdquo;.  Consider the ambiguity that would cause in the case of a mining enterprise about to be acquired.  Picture to yourself the difficulty of the judge who would have to determine whether the mineral was essential to the life of the community. Imagine the arguments the lawyers would have on a point of that kind.  I think it would be far better if the Minister were to schedule the minerals that this company should have power to acquire.  Limestone, you may say, is essential to the life of the community. Lime is certainly essential <Col N="1310" /> now when there is a shortage of fertilisers. Is gold essential to the life of the community?  I rather doubt it.</P>

It seems to me a very loose term and you are going to turn the courts loose on that. It is the basis of the whole Bill&mdash;&ldquo;essential to the life of the com-community&rdquo;&mdash;and I do not see how you could ever make the case.  I can conceive no mineral that is essential to the life of the community or for which you could not get a substitute.</P>

I wish the Minister would deal with that point, but I do think he should attempt to approach it more directly and schedule the minerals that the Government has power to acquire instead of walking into a terrible region of disputation and doubt in a provision of that kind. That is the only thing I have to say at this Stage, but on the Committee Stage I may have to make some more detailed comments on certain subjects.</P>

Senator Fitzgerald said that it was suggested by certain people that unless a man believed there was any amount of minerals everywhere under the soil of this country he would be regarded as not being a good Irishman. I would not go as far as that, <Col N="1311" /> but I would say that a Minister for Industry and Commerce who would not explore the possibilities of mineral development in the country would not be a good Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>I think it is a proper thing for any Minister for Industry and Commerce or any Government in any country to examine the situation and see exactly where they stand as far as possible development of their own country is concerned.  It is quite evident from Senator Fitzgerald's speech that his policy is a free trade policy.  Perhaps he does not say it in so many words, but it is quite evident that his policy would be that if the war happened to end suddenly, when we were half way through with the development of a mine, we should stop short.</P>

If in normal times we would be buying bauxite, or whatever it might be, gold or silver, from abroad at £x, I do not want, because there is an emergency and we pass this legislation, to commit the State afterwards to producing it here at £x plus £y.

      <P>I have no notion whatever of getting into a discussion on x plus y or x2 plus y2, or anything like that.  But all those theories have been blown sky-high within the last four or five years and definitely within the last 12 months.  If you were to follow that policy to its logical conclusion, in normal times&mdash;I am not talking about a period of emergency at all&mdash;we would be importing potatoes here; we would be importing oats and wheat and everything <Col N="1312" /> else, because they can be produced cheaper somewhere else.  That policy is just national insanity and because the people regarded it as national insanity they turned away from it and adopted another policy. However, if I were to talk like that I would be accused of talking politics in a non-political House.  I believe that a good deal of work remains to be done in that connection, and if we really wanted, for example, to ascertain how little we know with regard to the minerals in the country and what minerals we have, we need only go back to the Slievardagh Report, where we found a variation of something like 95,000,000 tons between one expert and another.  As a result of our lack of attention to such matters we found ourselves when the war broke out with practically no resources so far as artificial manures are concerned.  Possibly, but for the war, we would never have developed the phosphate mines in Clare.  As far as the x plus y policy is concerned, the economic value of any proposition must necessarily be decided by the natural conditions and regardless of what the conditions may be when this war is over we should all agree on one thing, and that is that we have learned a lesson by the position created by the war, and that if we had never got into the war or into a state of emergency such as the present, we should produce such necessary materials at home.</P>

      <P>A Cathaoirligh, I am not a very great optimist at all about the mineral wealth of this country, but I am quite prepared to spend a certain amount of money in finding out whether we really have much mineral wealth or not.  I am not an advocate either of the Manchester School of Economics.  I think, as Senator Quirke has pointed out, we have discovered the fallacy of that policy already and though it may be financial heresy, I think that the people of this country would be wise to pay a little more for the material produced in their own country by their own people than it can be obtained for in some country abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>Because after all, you must realise when you import any material from a foreign country you are supporting the people of that country.  You are paying their wages and you are paying the dividends of the shareholders of the country that produces these things.  It would be good finance and good economics to pay a little more for the article in your own country and pay these dividends and these wages at home.  Now I think that is elementary.  I think it would be worth while spending money to find out whether we have the mineral wealth some people think we have.  Personally, I do not think we have it, and as one who has made a little experiment in that direction I may tell you that it has not strengthened my belief in the <Col N="1314" /> mineral wealth at all.  I wonder how much money has been lost in this country in mineral exploitation.  If one goes into County Wicklow, which is the biggest county in this connection, and if one goes to the Vale of Avoca and looks at the abandoned mines there it is clear that there is an enormous amount of money sunk in these mines.  Men who were enterprising enough to sink shafts and run galleries through the earth here and there discovered a certain amount of minerals, but they lost all their capital.</P>
      <P>It is quite possible that there is mineral in some of the other counties. We always held when the British Government was in power in this country that they deliberately concealed any minerals that we had and did not make any effort to prospect for our mineral wealth and we held that when we got control of the country into our own hands we would prove to the whole world that we were possessed of enormous mineral wealth.  Well, now it would be just as well to spend some money in proving whether we or the other people were right.  Although I do not expect any great return from these things I think it is worth a trial. I think that this company will have a roving commission to prospect for minerals all over the country, but I take it that this will not be a development company.  For instance, if it discovers a deposit of any of these minerals we have here in any county in Ireland it will make a report and then it would be left to private enterprise to work that deposit.</P>

I am afraid there is a certain amount of hardship there, and I am afraid there is a danger of interfering with the rights of the individual.</P>
      <P>They are taking out of the hands of that company a thing of potential value that the company had been operating but at the time they were not able to run it efficiently for want of finance.  Why not place the State finances at the disposal of the company by means of a debenture or mortgage charge on the company's assets instead of taking it out of their hands altogether?

      <P>Part I and Part II of this Bill are intended to operate in what would be normal circumstances and their purpose is to enable a company to be set up whose primary task would be to explore and survey our mineral deposits.  Senator Goulding has said that we have only got to look at the wrecks of mineral enterprises which are to be found all over the country to realise how much money <Col N="1316" /> has been sunk in mineral exploitation and how much money has been lost, and lost because of the fact that there had not been made an adequate survey to settle whether it was justifiable to initiate the undertakings or not.  I feel, at any rate, that the fate of so many mineral enterprises has been so ill-starred that before we can hope to induce private enterprise to look at mineral development seriously we shall have to be in a position to give a much greater information in regard to them than hitherto.  One of the primary purposes of the company is to secure that information.</P>
      <P>After the information has been secured, it will fall to the Minister to decide, if the company's investigations show that it is a workable mineral deposit, whether the deposit is going to be worked by this company, by another company set up <i>ad hoc</i> or by, what in my view would be preferable, a competent private enterprise.  If we found that there were persons who were competent, with the necessary experience and capital, or at least with substantial capital resources, they would be assisted by the Department&mdash;at least they would be assisted by me so long as I am Minister in charge of the Department&mdash;and we would endeavour to get private enterprise to undertake the development work.  If we do not succeed in interesting private enterprise in a mineral deposit which we think should be developed, bearing in mind the public good, then it would fall to us to consider whether we should utilise this company to develop it or set up a new company <i>ad hoc</i> for that purpose.  In either case we should have to come to the Dáil&mdash;in the case of this company, for the necessary finances and, in the case of a new company, for legislative authority to set it up.</P>
      <P>The third part of the Bill is related directly to the present emergency. Section 18 states that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever it appears to the Minister that for the purposes of obtaining in adequate quantities, commodities essential to the life of the community, the common good requires that the working of any particular <Col N="1317" /> deposit of minerals should be controlled by the State, and that to secure to the State effective control of the said deposit of minerals it is necessary that the Minister should acquire a particular existing mining business engaged in working the said deposit, or a portion of the said deposit, the Minister may either acquire the said mining business by agreement or, in default of agreement, compulsorily acquire the said business.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senators will note there that the acquisition can only be for the purpose of obtaining commodities essential to the life of the community, and that only in cases where the common good requires that the working of these commodities should be controlled by the State.  Quite obviously, I think it can be said that that relates only to the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  At least, that was my idea in introducing the Bill.  I think, in all the circumstances, that will be the principle which will be accepted by my successor in due course.  There are one or two deposits in existence at the present moment where examination may lead me to the conclusion that it would be my duty to exercise the powers conferred by this section, but I think we can take it that I should feel bound to be able to justify to the Oireachtas, in the cases to which I refer, so that there would be no doubt whatever that the commodities in question were essential to the life of the community.  However, if I, in the exercise of the powers under Section 18 proposed to acquire a business which was, in fact, not essential, the persons concerned in that business would, of course, have a remedy.  They could go to the court, and they would have an opportunity of disproving my contention, the contention of the Minister, that these commodities were essential to the life of the community.  Accordingly, since there is a resort to the courts left to the individuals concerned, I think that we may take it that the Minister would be chary about exercising the powers under Section 18 unless he were fully satisfied that it was essential to do so <Col N="1318" /> in the circumstances of the present time.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the fact that the limit of repayable advances which may be made to the company is £50,000.  It has been quite properly pointed out that that would not go very far in developing a mineral project.  We have fixed that limit by design in order to make it quite clear to the Oireachtas that our operations under this Bill are going to be subject to very strict and rigorous Parliamentary control.  If we did propose to undertake an ambitious development, the cost of which would exceed £50,000, we would have to come to the Oireachtas again with a new Bill and ask them to extend that limit.  We should have to explain to the Oireachtas why we wanted more money.</P>

      <P>It could be an amendment, but in fact it would be a new Bill.  It would be a Bill amending the principal Act.  In view of the fact that the amendment was limited to an increase in the aggregate amount that was voted by the Oireachtas, we might assume that the discussion on the Bill would be narrowed down to the simple purpose for which that particular money was required.  Therefore, the whole merits of the project would be discussed and debated in the Oireachtas.  We have adopted that course because it seems to us to ensure reasonable Parliamentary control over the operations of the company.</P>

    <P>Reference was made by Senator Honan to the Clare phosphates.  Well, it probably will be one of the things we shall have to look at, but I would not like anybody in the House or in the <Col N="1319" /> country to be under any illusions about the Clare phosphates.  The amount of the deposit there which may be easily worked is comparatively small.  In fact, I do not think that if the whole of the easy accessible deposits were to be taken out in one year, and if it could be manufactured, that it would go one-third of the way to meet our demands for phosphatic manures.  However, naturally, it would be one of things which would have to be looked at.  But more important, perhaps, than the development of the phosphate deposits in Clare, would be the work of trying to ascertain whether there were other more extensive and better phosphatic deposits in this country.</P>

      <P>Well, it has been recommended to us that we ought to look for them.  On that, there is no indication that there may be any others.  I should not like the House, either, to assume on this Bill that if we acquire mining businesses in the present circumstances, or if developing companies are set on foot, that it would be intended to continue to operate them after the emergency had passed.  It might be <Col N="1320" /> desirable to continue to operate them after the emergency has passed, but on the other hand, if the deposits were limited and small, it might be advisable to discontinue their operation after the emergency, and have them in reserve to meet such a position as we find ourselves in to-day.  Accordingly, I would like the Oireachtas to understand that in relation to the operations of this company there is no very set and definite policy of setting up a mining business and of continuing to work it irrespective of conditions which might exist after the emergency.  The main purpose of the company is to get a truer and better knowledge of the extent of our deposits, and concomitant with that, and arising particularly out of the emergency, to try to see what we could do to bring about a more extensive and efficient exploitation of such mineral deposits as may be at the moment available and as may be capable of supplying the commodities which are according to the phrase used in the Bill &ldquo;essential to the life of the community&rdquo;.</P>
