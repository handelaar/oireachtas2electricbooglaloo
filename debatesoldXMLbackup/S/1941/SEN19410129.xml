      <P>Might I claim the indulgence of the House for a few moments? I want to know if it would be possible to take Senator Hogan's motion at an earlier part of our proceedings.  I wonder would Senators agree to take it as No. 3 on the Order Paper?  If it were taken after Senator Johnston's motion, perhaps it could be dealt with this evening.  It relates to agriculture and it is a very important motion.  The Minister might be available this evening and, if Senators were willing to take it in the order I have suggested, probably it could be dealt with before we rise to-night.</P>

      <P>As Senators are aware, motions are placed on the Order Paper in the order in which they are received and, unless there is agreement with those in whose names the other motions stand, I do not think the House can do anything to meet Senator Foran's wishes.  I take it that Senator Johnston will move his motion after Senator Tierney's has been dealt with.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Educational Advisory" RHead="Council&mdash;Motion (Resumed)">
    <Title>Educational Advisory Council&mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion: &mdash;</P>
    <P>That Seanad Eireann is of opinion that the Government should establish a council of education to advise the Minister for Education in matters submitted to it by the Minister in relation to the working of his Department.&mdash;(Senator Tierney.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of my remarks in moving this motion I thought I made it plain that I had a double object.  One object was to try to induce the Government to set up an advisory council of the kind I suggested, and I thought I made it plain enough what kind of advisory council I had in mind.  The other object I had was to provoke the Seanad into a general debate on educational questions. I have always been struck by the silence that has prevailed on these matters ever since 1922, by the difficulty that has always existed in getting a number of most important topics connected with our general system of education discussed by either House of the Oireachtas.  It did not surprise or disappoint me, therefore, that the discussion on this motion took the form it did take.  As a matter of fact, I may say I succeeded almost too well in provoking the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with the criticisms that were offered to my motion, I think it would be more profitable to take, first <Col N="131" /> of all, what was said about the actual proposal for setting up a council of education, and I should like to reiterate to the House what exactly I meant by that proposal.  The discussion very largely took the form of speeches on things that I did not mean at all.  The Minister, for instance, devoted a very considerable part of his remarks to the criticism of a proposal which I did not make; that is to say, a proposal for some form of vocational council.  I made it perfectly clear that I was not calling for a vocational council.</P>
    <P>Then, again, the Minister took the view that in calling for a council of this kind I was trying to restore the old machinery of Dublin Castle.  That is a type of criticism which is all too prevalent in this country at the present moment.  It has been my lot on previous occasions, when I made suggestions that I thought were valuable or worthy of being considered, to have them turned down simply because something like what I proposed had been done by the British Government in times long gone past. I remember I once suggested that a series of well-prepared text books should be issued for the primary schools, both in the Irish and the English languages, on the model of the series of national school text books that used to be issued by the Commissioners of Primary Education.  I was denounced for that proposal simply because the Commissioners of Primary Education had issued text books of that kind, as if that alone were enough to condemn the proposal and any alternative to what was done here in the way of education under the British Government was better than what was done.</P>
    <P>I did not suggest that we should get back to the old Dublin Castle system, and I did not suggest we should set up a new system here which would be controlled by men not responsible to the people of Ireland.  There is a great deal to be said about the old boards we had here before the Treaty.  Everybody realises they were set up in pursuance of a certain object, that their policy was fairly carefully laid <Col N="132" /> down for them and that they did their duty faithfully in pursuance of that object and policy.  But it is quite possible to have similar machinery and to use it in pursuance of a totally different object.  I believe, and I think a great many people agree with me, that the machinery which existed here under Dublin Castle would be better machinery for carrying out the objects we have in view now than the machinery which we have put in its place.</P>
    <P>The men who made up these boards in the old days, both the primary board and the secondary board, were always men of very high educational distinction.  Some of them were not by any means Unionists or men hostile to the views of the majority of the Irish people.  You had people on these boards like Father Tom Finlay.  You had one of our distinguished colleagues in the Seanad at the present moment a member of some of these boards. Neither of these was a man who could be accused of having had any sympathy at any time in his life with the standpoint of Dublin Castle.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some rather gratuitous remarks, I thought, about the Resident Commissioner of National Education here in the old days.  I do not know very much what the political views of the last Resident Commissioner were.  I do not know whether I would have agreed with him if I had ever discussed politics with him; but there is one thing I do know, on which I cannot be contradicted.  That is that the Resident Commissioner of National Education was a scholar of high European reputation, a scholar of far greater reputation in other countries than anybody who is within 100 miles of the Department of Education at the moment.  That is the point I want to stress.  We have not got our educational system staffed at the present moment with men of anything like the same standard as the men appointed by the British Government.  I do not want Unionists to be appointed to this council.  I do not want enemies of the Irish language to be appointed.  I do not want the council to consist of men who will make it their whole object to defeat Government policy in relation <Col N="133" /> to the Irish language.  What I do feel is that we have, in doing away with these boards, set up a bureaucracy of the most extreme type in a department of national life where bureaucracy can do the greatest possible amount of harm and where it is likely to be least efficient.  It is in order to remedy that state of affairs that I suggested not that we should go back to Dublin Castle, not that we should appoint Unionists or ex-Unionists or people hostile to the views of the Irish people, but that the Government should itself, of its own choice, select a number of distinguished men, men of standing in scholarship and in education&mdash;and we have plenty of them in the country&mdash;and appoint them, to meet frequently, to supervise and to keep continually under examination certain aspects of our educational system and to give the Minister &mdash; who is bound at all times in all likelihood to be a politician, busy with a great many other things, and not necessarily at all an expert in education &mdash; the benefit of their experience, their knowledge and their advice.</P>
    <P>I cited as an example of the sort of thing I wanted the consultative committee that is in existence as part of the Board of Education in England. There again I suppose I would be accused of being a Unionist or of being hostile to the Irish language if I said that the English have in their Board of Education an institution which we might very well copy on our own scale and on our own level.  The Minister for Education in England is not merely the head of a rather under-staffed and badly-organised bureaucratic machine like what we have here.  He is the President of the Board of Education. He has under him two Parliamentary Secretaries, a number of chief inspectors, men of high standing, and, side by side with all these, he has this consultative committee which is perpetually at work and which, as I have said, has issued a number of the most important and most valuable reports on every aspect of English primary and secondary education during the last 15 or 20 years.  I had here in this House a copy of the latest report dealing with secondary <Col N="134" /> education.  I suggest to Senators who are at all interested in our system of education and what we should try to do here, that it would be a good thing to get the Spens report on secondary education in England and to see for themselves the kind of work that it is possible to have done with an instrument like that, the enormous value that is given by that sort of advisory council to the Board of Education itself, to the schools, to the parents and to everyone interested in the future progress of education.</P>
    <P>It was something like that I had in mind.  I specifically ruled out, perhaps not emphatically enough, the idea that I was suggesting a vocational council to which the Minister devoted so much attention.  I believe wholeheartedly that we in this country should work towards a state of affairs in which the State will, to a very considerable extent, loose its grip on our educational system.  I believe that ultimately, when we have got things properly organised, our teachers, headmasters and the people actually concerned with education, should have a great deal more say in questions which concern what they are teaching, why they are teaching, and the organisation of the whole programme, than they have at the present time.  I believe that that can best be achieved by means of the vocational organisation of education.  If there is any department of our social life in which the vocational principle could be applied profitably, I think it is education. To my mind, at any rate, there is everything to be said for giving more and more scope to vocational bodies of that kind and for loosening more and more the grip of bureaucracy, of the anonymous, impersonal clerkdom that we have at present, over our primary and secondary educational systems.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I can see that there are big difficulties in the way of setting up such a vocational body at present.  The preliminary organisation has not been done.  In spite of what the Minister said about all the bodies he is able to consult, our secondary system, in particular, is still far from being so organised that it can be fitted into a vocational system.  We cannot <Col N="135" /> wait, to my mind, until it has been sufficiently organised.  The reason, in my view at any rate, is that our whole educational system and our educational standards are rapidly going downhill at the present moment.  If we let things go on for ten or 15 years more as they have been going on &mdash; and it will probably take that time before we can get the vocational system fully under way &mdash; we shall have to begin building the educational system afresh, from the bottom up, at the end of that time.  When that stage has been reached, we shall hardly have anyone left in the country able to undertake a task of that kind.  The matter is one of real urgency.  Things are slipping month by month and year by year.  Anyone who is familiar with what is happening in the schools, primary and secondary, and in every branch of our educational system, knows that there are all sorts of things that need immediate attention, that need to be reformed, need to be reconsidered and unless they are reconsidered very soon, the time may come when we may not be able to reconsider them at all.  We want people who will have the trained knowledge and intelligence to do that.  It is for that reason that we ought to set up a council of this kind as an interim step.</P>
    <P>I do not see where the trouble would be or what difficulty the Minister would find in setting up such a council.  There are plenty of men available.  There are at least three ex-Ministers of Education, who could be called in to take part; there are men like presidents of university institutions; there are headmasters and distinguished teachers in secondary schools; there is the splendid organisation of primary teachers, and also an organisation of managers.  It would be quite easy, in order to make the council a valuable body, to get men who are experts in the matter of education, and it would also be comparatively easy, though the council might not be elected &mdash; not filled from the bottom up, so to speak &mdash; to get it fairly representative of all the educational work that is being done.</P>
    <P>The only condition which I would <Col N="136" /> lay down would be that the Minister, in selecting the members of such a council, should not select them for any political or extraneous reason, or for the reason that they are enthusiasts, in the sense in which Senator O'Buachalla used the word the other day, for the Irish language.  I should like to see them selected for their intellectual qualifications, for their training and for their standing in the educational world, and I see no difficulty in doing that if the Government think it worth while to do it and make up their minds to do it.  I do not at all wish to have a body like that chosen on any ground of hostility to the Irish language; but I want an attempt to secure that this whole question of the teaching of the language will at long last be taken out of the realm of politics, that it will be taken for granted that the people of Ireland, 99.9 per cent. of them, are in favour of doing as much for the Irish language as possibly can be done in the circumstances.  The number of people opposed to the Irish language, the number of people who want to see all work stopped in regard to its teaching, and who can be counted as real enemies of the language, is infinitesimal.  The vast majority of the people, whether engaged in education or otherwise, are only too anxious to do all that can be done to keep the language alive, to extend its use and to make it as far as possible the normal means of communication in the country.</P>
    <P>There are two difficulties to be considered in that respect.  One of them is the difficulty created by persistence on the part of those who officially represent the Irish language, in regarding everyone who differs from them by a hair's breadth as being an enemy and stigmatising everyone who gets up to offer an honest criticism about the methods they are using as an absolutely dyed-in-the-wool opponent of the whole idea of the revival.  That is one obstacle.  I would say, in all seriousness, to Senator O Buachalla and the heads of the Gaelic League that as long as they persist in that policy they are creating enemies for the language day by day.</P>

      <P>Let anyone who has doubts on that point read Senator O Buachalla's speech here on the last occasion we met.  Among other things he denouced me as the greatest living enemy of the Irish language.  And that is not the first time that has happened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I once had occasion to criticise the methods which are being used in teaching Irish in the schools, and the Gaelic League brought out a pamphlet called &ldquo;You can revive the Irish language.&rdquo;  They sent a copy to me and I was astonished to discover that the object of the pamphlet was to point out that I was the greatest enemy of the language.  It leaves me speechless &mdash; it staggers my intelligence.  To my mind, the fact that a body like the Gaelic League can issue such a statement is a grave sign that something serious is wrong with that body.  If their intelligence is only as high as that, if they think they can do good to the Irish language by denouncing me as an opponent of it, then there is small hope for the language so far as the Gaelic League is concerned.</P>
      <P>That habit of denouncing as an enemy everyone who utters any criticism at all, is in itself the greatest enemy of the language at the present moment.  I cannot understand why it is not possible for intelligent men in a small country to get together and consider this problem of the language revival on intellectual lines.  It is bounded by certain conditions which can be examined scientifically and delimited; it is a problem that can be met in certain ways and in those ways only.  Why should it not be possible for intelligent people, having all those emotions and all that enthusiasm of which Senator O Buachalla spoke, to come together and discuss that problem and see what can be done about it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggested nothing of the kind.  I suggested the plain fact that, people like Senator O Buachalla, instead of trying to organise some sort of intelligent approach to this problem, spend their time denouncing quite insignificant and unworthy people like myself who happen to differ from Senator O Buachalla, not on the principle of the question, but on the means to be adopted in solving it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>

      <P>Apart from this tendency to reject all criticism, no matter how well-meant, and to regard everyone as an enemy who does not keep &ldquo;to the general line,&rdquo; as they say in Soviet Russia, the other difficulty is that the whole question of the Irish language is bounded by certain things which can be done and certain things which cannot be done.  In regard at any rate to teaching through the medium of Irish in schools, as it is done at the present moment and has <Col N="139" /> been for a long time past, I suggest that our educational authorities have been trying to do instantly, or at great speed, a thing which it is in any case impossible to accomplish, one which they never will get done.  I suggest that, by trying to force the pace as they have been, instead of making progress they are simply going round in circles and creating enemies here for the Irish language every week that passes.  It should be possible to get this whole subject down to some sort of sane level, to have it discussed not as a matter of creed or confession or of political ideology &mdash; as it seems always to be discussed &mdash; but to have it considered as a national problem and as a problem which has certain conditions attached to it admitting of only certain solutions.</P>

      <P>I did not speak as though I thought that miracles were going to be performed in the revival of Irish.  I spoke entirely as an enthusiastic advocate of the revival &mdash; I have been that practically all my life &mdash; but the difficulty which I and thousands of people, people in increasing numbers, feel is that we are trying to do a thing which cannot be done and that in trying to do it we are creating all sorts of difficulties which we could have avoided if we had chosen our object with more intelligence and adapted our means more scientifically and more intelligently to the ends we have in view.  One reason why I brought up this motion at all was, that for a long time back I have had the feeling that, instead of making any progress in relation to our educational system, we are going back and that the standards in our secondary system, in particular, are steadily going down.</P>

      <P>That is just like the attitude of the Minister for Education himself &mdash; the attitude that certain subjects are forbidden subjects and must not be touched upon.  The Minister said that there are certain matters that are not open to discussion &mdash; in other words, that it does not matter whether these things are capable of accomplishment or not.  We must all bow our heads and carry on or, at least, let the Government, in our names, carry on.  There is quite an analogy between the outlook of Senators Mac Fhionnlaoich and O Buachalla on all these matters and that of the Marxian Socialists, who look forward to a kind of proletarian heaven on earth and want us to shut our eyes and accept all kinds of incompetence and foolishness in the expectation that heaven on earth is going to come about.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I question that, Sir.  I hold that it is connected with the motion, and it is a matter that has been widely discussed already on this debate.  But let me move on to another point.  I shall quote the Minister's exact words during the debate on the last occasion.  This is what he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am not one of those people who think you cannot have some educational loss, some educational waste, during the transition period through which we are passing.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like Senators to consider that sentence in all its implications, and to ask themselves the question: Who entitled the present Minister for Education, or anybody else, to maintain, in the first place, that there is any <Col N="141" /> necessity to have any educational loss in the effort to revive the Irish language, and in the second place, that the people of this country ought to be compelled to undergo that educational loss?  To me, at any rate, speaking as one Irishman, that sort of attitude implies a double blasphemy: a blasphemy, on the one hand, against the whole idea of reviving the Irish language, and a blasphemy, on the other hand, against the interests of our children whose educational prospects are to be destroyed in the effort to bring that policy into action.  I am one who has never believed &mdash; and I am sure there are thousands who are as much interested in the revival of the Irish language as I am, who would agree with me&mdash;I never have believed that there is any necessity in the world why a sane, sensible effort to revive the Irish language should involve any educational loss whatever to the people of this country or why there should be any going back or retrogression.  Any retrogression that there has been is not inherent in the task of receiving the Irish language or of spreading its use. The retrogression has been brought about through the stupidity of the Department of Education, and it is because I believe this that I want some effort made to correct the course that the Department of Education has set itself.</P>
    <P>It seems monstrous to me that our Houses of Parliament should sit by &mdash; after all that has happened in this country, and remembering all the men that have lost their lives in order that their children and ours should have a better life in the future &mdash; and allow the Minister for Education to get up here and say, as he has said time and time again both in the Dáil and in this House, that he realises that there must be an educational loss.</P>

      <P>Well, I do not want to go into the question of who gave the authority or set the standard, but I should like Senators in all seriousness and sincerity to face up to that question: whether you are enthusiastic about the revival of the Irish language or not, do you sincerely and honestly hold that its revival must, or even should, imply an educational loss?  If you do so hold, if you do think that you cannot revive the language without educational loss, how are you going to revive the Irish language if its revival implies a decline in our already very poor educational system?</P>

      <P>There again! Just because a foreign Government, the British Government, operating in this country the worst system of government that this world has ever known, did certain things here to our people, therefore our Government, a native Irish Government, is entitled to do the same things.  That is the sort of argument that is continually being put up &mdash; and, as a matter of fact, travesties of that argument.</P>

      <P>Again, we are entirely in agreement on the ultimate object.  The whole question at issue is the means to be adopted to attain that object, and I say that a cause, an educational cause, whose exponents state in public that, in order to attain their ends they have to bring about a certain loss in education in this country, is a cause that stands, to that extent, self-condemned.  The Minister spoke of the danger of a council, such as I have suggested, cutting across his responsibility to the Oireachtas.  I must say that I can only qualify that argument as rather a childish one. Nobody suggested that power should be taken out of the Minister's hands or that we should interfere in principle with the system we have.  What I have suggested is that we should add something to the system.  It is a very mild suggestion, and I quite agree with Senators who said that in all probability it would not produce very wonderful results.  I should not expect myself that it would produce marvellous results, but it may help at least to do one thing.  It may help to check <Col N="144" /> the downward tendency which I have been noticing in our educational system for a number of years back.  If it did even that, if it only checked it for a time, it would have given some value to the country, and that is all I have asked.  I have asked that a council should be set up which would be present to advise the Minister on all sorts of questions connected with educational curricula, and with the organisation, management and so on, of our schools.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;From the experience I have had of it &mdash; it is not very much, but it is probably more than most members of the community would have had &mdash; I cannot help concluding that the standard of education in those colleges is lamentable.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">

      <P>One qualification I have, at any rate, is that I come here, with a small number of others, as a representative of the teachers of Ireland &mdash; which I do not think the Senator is&mdash;and that I have been asked by quite a number of teachers, over and over again during the past few years, to bring in a motion like this, for the reason that it was felt, not only in regard to our training colleges but to the educational system generally, that the standard was going down.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we will not quarrel about qualifications.  I do not propose to quarrel with the Senator about my capacity to speak English.  I do not see any reason why the Minister should object to the setting up of an advisory council. There are plenty of examples of advisory councils of the kind I suggest. There is an advisory council of agriculture and in circumstances such as we have at present I am sure that it might be supremely valuable &mdash; I do not know very much about it.  At any rate, it gives the Department some little contact with the people, with the work that is being done in the country, and enables ordinary people engaged in that work to make their views heard by the Department.  What happens at present with regard to education?  The Department responsible has a staff of civil servants, and a political Minister, and you have available for consultation one or two bodies which might be regarded as fairly independent, but a large proportion of the bodies that the Minister consults is composed of people that have no independence at all.  They depend on the Minister and on Government policy for their salaries.  They are bodies of people to whom the Minister in the course of his speech referred several times as &ldquo;employees&rdquo;. I should like to draw the attention of the Seanad to that point while I am dealing with the state of education.  Is it a healthy thing that a very large proportion of those engaged in the teaching profession should be looked upon by the Department and the Minister as &ldquo;employees&rdquo; in that way?  How could employees discuss the Department's policy on equal terms?  The thing is impossible.  I gave instances where teachers, primary and secondary, have felt grave misgivings, and expressed the strongest criticism, about the policy of the Department in private, but are unable to make these criticisms in public for the very good reason that their salaries and whole prospects of life depend upon the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should explain that I led the House into error when I made that statement there about &ldquo;employees&rdquo;.  The teachers are more correctly described as public servants.  Of course they draw their remuneration from the State, but they have individual contracts with headmasters, as, for example, in the case of secondary teachers, or managers in the case of primary schools.  In using the term &ldquo;employees&rdquo; I was not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay on that point now.  The use of the term &ldquo;employees&rdquo; may not have been correct, but in my view it was rather significant. I am trying to suggest to the House and to the Minister that a body like what is suggested could do very valuable work for the Department, for the country, for the teachers, and for the parents.  It could do no harm.  It could make investigations into problems, call witnesses, and, perhaps, go into the schools to see how things were being done and, every now and again, like the consultative body in England, issue reports on problems that had been fully discussed.  Even if we did not always like what might be said in these reports, the fact that they were issued, that trouble was taken to prepare them, that evidence was gathered, and that some sort of intelligence was brought to bear on educational problems would be all to the good.  We should have more material to go on for discussion.  I am convinced, however acrimonious our discussion might be, that we cannot have too much discussion about education.  There is no other subject in all of our national life which it is so important to have continually discussed, and there is no other subject in which it is so dangerous to the country, not to have open public discussions, but fairly violent and concealed discontent.  That is what we have to a large extent under our present educational system.  I suggest that the reason for that state of affairs is that we have no organ which will enable the public or members of <Col N="147" /> the Oireachtas to discuss this whole question rationally, and that the setting-up of an advisory council, such as I suggest, would provide us with such an organ.</P>
      <P>I can see no reason, after all the debating, and making due allowances for all the sharp things that were said on every side, which would justify the Minister in turning down the proposal I made, and I sincerely hope, altogether irrespective of my prejudices or my views on the Irish language, that the Minister will consider the proposal seriously as a constructive one.  I have only two things to add about the whole subject of the debate.  In a way I almost regret that the question of the Irish language came into the discussion at all; but, after all, it would be impossible to have a real discussion on our primary and secondary education without bringing in the Irish language.  It is the central point of the whole system at present and, I hope, will remain at the centre of our educational system for many a long day.  I want to see our educational system revolving around the teaching of the Irish language in the schools.  I said many times that I am not at all to be taken as an opponent of the language or as wishing to have the Irish language set aside.  In dealing with this question it is very difficult to speak without the risk of creating a certain amount of acrimony, and most of the speeches delivered on the motion consisted of charges against me of saying things that, in many cases, I did not say at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I deal with these charges I should like to express my particular appreciation of the speeches made by Senator Hayes and Senator O'Connell on the motion.  To my mind they were both very valuable contributions to the debate and I should like to see Senators, if they regard me as being prejudiced or as having a peculiar personal point of view on the subject, studying the speeches of these two Senators carefully, and making up their own minds on what Senator O'Connell said about the question of teaching through <Col N="148" /> the medium of Irish in the primary schools.  I have been accused of attacking pupils in the secondary schools, while myself being ignorant of the English language.  I have been accused of criticising the teachers and criticising the authorities in these schools.  Every kind of shield has been put up by the Minister, and by those who support him, to ward off the real point of the criticism I was trying to offer.  It was directed, not against any of those people or institutions, but against the Minister's Department.  It was not even directed with any great energy against the Minister himself, because, as I said, this problem is not the creation of the present Minister for Education.  It is an inheritance he took over from his predecessors.  All he has done is to carry on from where they left off.  There is no difference so far as policy is concerned between one Minister and another in this respect. Every time you make a criticism of a Department &mdash; it is not confined, I am afraid, to the Department of Education &mdash; all our Departments have a tendency to try and find scapegoats for the criticism somewhere else.  Once before I had occasion to criticise the Government Publications Department when the then Minister for Finance was present. I discovered in a week's time that I was being dragged into a controversy about the personal merits of some civil servant connected with the Department.</P>
    <P>The same thing is done in relation to education.  When you criticise the system which has been imposed on our schools by the Department of Education, you are accused of finding fault with the pupils, with the teachers, and with the schools.  The fact of the matter is that I did not find fault with any of them.  If my speech is carefully read, it will be seen that I did not utter one single word of criticism of the pupils, the teachers or of the schools.  What I did criticise was this system which has been imposed on them.  I said, and I still say, that under a system like that no body of teachers could do good work. As regards criticism of pupils, of course the suggestion is merely puerile.  As regards criticism of <Col N="149" /> teachers, you have only to consider what I have said already.  I represent the teachers, and one of my reasons for speaking is that I have been asked by a great number of teachers to raise this question and that I know for a fact that, in both the primary and secondary schools all over the country, the teachers are full of discontent owing to the system and the methods being pursued by the Department of Education and the organisation which makes those methods more or less inevitable. The same thing applies to the schools. I do not think I uttered one word about the schools or the management of the schools, either primary or secondary.</P>
    <P>Now that I am on the point, the only thing that I blame about the schools or their management is that they are not courageous and open enough about this whole matter; that headmasters' conferences, and so on, have allowed a system, in which I do not think more than a tiny fraction have any belief, to be put across on them by this and previous Governments with practically no criticism at all so far as anyone could see.  The reason why I talk so much about teaching through the medium of Irish is simply that it is, to my mind, the kernel of the whole subject, and that, so far as Irish is concerned with our educational system, great damage is being done and the system is being distorted on account of the efforts made to push this reckless idea of teaching subjects through the medium of Irish in our secondary and primary schools.  When the Minister said that no pressure is used, there again you have an example of the sort of smoke screen which is always put out when any criticism is offered.</P>
    <P>I do not know why these things cannot be discussed fairly.  We have spokesmen of the Minister again and again putting up absurd statistics to prove that schools where subjects were taught through the medium of Irish were as good as others.  The examination results on which the statistics depend are the creation of the Department itself.  In fact, as is known by every university professor, in the arts faculty at any rate, the whole examination <Col N="150" /> system of the secondary branch has been, as I said, blown to the winds. The standards of secondary education have no relation at all to the standards that existed 25 or 30 years ago under the British.  When that is the case, what is the good of talking to the public about the successes gained by pupils in schools where subjects are taught through the medium of Irish? The figures given do not mean anything. They simply mean that the Department wants to make the public believe that successes are gained. They are not genuine statistics.  It is only trying to humbug the public to bring out statistics of that kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to refer to two kinds of pressure that are undoubtedly being brought to bear on schools, teachers, and pupils in this respect.  One of them is pressure by means of a higher endowment.  Schools are induced by means of an endowment amounting to as much as 50 per cent. on their capitation, as the Minister admitted, to engage in this practice of teaching through the medium of Irish. I know of one case where a very good teacher, a first-class teacher, lost his health through the effort to do that in order to bring his school into line sufficiently to get the larger grant from the Government.  He was one of the best teachers of his subjects in Ireland I should say.  That is an example of one kind of pressure.  That pressure is there and what is the use of trying to deny it?  The Minister says that there is no pressure and then he qualifies it by saying that there is no pressure from him personally.  Nobody believes that he goes around personally trying to force teachers to do things.  The pressure is there from the Department. It is part of a system which, with the lapse of years, in my view, has become a soulless system.</P>
      <P>So far as pupils are concerned, to deny that there is pressure to learn subjects through the medium of Irish is childish.  There is pressure to the extent that students who do not answer through the medium of Irish are penalised 10 per cent. in examinations. Those are students in very many cases whose own capacity in the Irish language is quite excellent.  I know a case of a child who was brought down from first place to second place in a recent examination because a competitor got 10 per cent. extra for doing a subject through the medium of Irish.  Another child was brought down from second to ninth place in the same examination. Senator O Buachalla may defend that system, but I do not think there is any defence for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam O Buachalla Liam O Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the bonus for mathematics is.  I would be in favour of doing away with bonuses of that kind as a general principle. I do not believe in trying to boost one subject artificially by means of marks in an examination, because it inevitably implies a certain amount of unfairness.  The children I am thinking of are children who can get high places in the subject of Irish in these examinations.  They are penalised because other children get 10 per cent. extra, and 10 per cent. on 400 marks is a considerable amount.  They get 10 per cent. extra because they make shift to answer through the medium of Irish. Whatever you may think about the system, to say that it does not imply pressure on the children or the schools is certainly to deceive the public. There is serious pressure employed&mdash; and I say that it has led to all sorts of extravagant results&mdash;through which teachers have been encouraged and almost forced to do things that neither they nor the children whom they teach are competent to do, and this through no fault of their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools have been encouraged to take up this practice, in order to get extra advantages out of it by way of grants or marks, when they are not able for it.  Everybody who has had anything to do with schools knows that that has happened time after time.  There is not a parent in this State, with a child in a secondary school, who is not aware that this subject is causing infinite trouble to the children and the schools.  I suggest to the Minister, and to others who speak on this in the future, that they should give the public at least credit for intelligence and not disclaim the pressure that they actually do put on.  Let us have the thing discussed fairly, and let us see what the policy is in reality.  To cloud the issue <Col N="153" /> by means of all these excuses, by suggesting that critics are abusing or denouncing the children, the teachers, or the schools, and by telling us what the examination results are, and that no pressure is being put on anybody&mdash; I suggest that all that is not worthy of a department of State.  I suggest that neither is it worthy of the people who are standing for it.  In spite of everything, I will persist in regarding the cause of the Irish language as the most important cause that is before the people of Ireland at the present moment.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that particular point before I finish in order that I may not be misunderstood.  In anything that I have said on this subject, I have not been speaking as an enemy of the Irish language or as a person who does not want to see everything done that can possibly be done within the limits of practicability for the Irish language.  I have not had Senator O Buachalla's experience as a teacher of the Irish language.  I have not had anything to do with Gaelic League classes, but I have taken an interest in Irish for years.</P>

      <P>What I mean is that the Senator began by teaching Gaelic League classes.  He has had long experience in teaching university classes in Irish.  I am not trying to insinuate anything against the Senator. What I want to convey is that I have had no experience of that kind, but I do sincerely say that I have always been intensely interested in the Irish language, and intensely anxious to see everything done that could be done to advance its cause.  My whole trouble is that I see things being done in the name of the Irish language which ought not to be done, in that name above all names.  I see things being done which, instead of advancing the cause of the Irish language or the cause of education in the country, are damaging both, and damaging them to a very grave and serious extent, to my knowledge, and to the knowledge of thousands of other people.</P>

I regard that as the really serious danger, and I think I could get very many people up and down the country to agree with me. If we go on as we are the time is surely coming when the generation upon whom this burden is being inflicted will turn against the whole idea of reviving the Irish language.

      <P>When speaking on the motion on the last day the House met&mdash;I am quoting from the Official Debates, column 88&mdash;I said: &ldquo;If I were to talk in Irish about economics to Senator Hayes...&rdquo; Obviously, the words should run: &ldquo;If I were speaking in Irish...&rdquo;.  A few lines further down, in the same column, the words occur: &ldquo;If I were to discuss the subject of commerce in English with Senator Tierney...&rdquo;.  The point I wanted to make was that if I were to discuss these things in English, Senators or others not familiar with these technical subjects, would not be anxious to discuss them.  The reason I am so anxious to make this correction is that I am afraid I misled Senator O'Connell in the debate, judging by his remarks in column 1089 of the Official Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the following motion which stands in the names of Senator Counihan and of myself:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Seanad is of opinion that, as the Commission on Agriculture, part of the terms of reference of which was to investigate the matter of the provision of credit for farmers, has suspended its inquiries, the Minister for Agriculture should appoint immediately a committee consisting of agriculturists, bankers, economists, and Departmental representatives, to inquire into the matter <Col N="156" /> of the liquidation of frozen loans, and to make recommendations as to the provision of credit for farmers.</P>
    <P>In the absence of Senator Counihan it falls to my lot to move this motion. I take this opportunity of expressing the great sympathy that we all feel with the Senator in the recent sad event which darkened his family life and brought sorrow to his home.  The motion asks the House to recommend that a commission be set up which, constituted in a certain way, could investigate the matter of frozen loans to farmers, and in particular go on to make recommendations with a view to improving the provision of credit for agriculture, especially in the present emergency.  Perhaps most of my remarks had better be related, at least in the first instance, to the problem of frozen loans.  It seems to be the peculiar fate of agriculture, and of farmers in all ages, that they are more the victims of unfavourable economic vicissitudes, and in particular of changes in the value of money, than almost any other section of the business community.  I use the phrase &ldquo;business community&rdquo; deliberately with reference to farmers, because farmers are, in the economic sense, members of the business community. They are people who have to make their living, as best they can, by the difference between the costs that they incur and the receipts that they get; but they are less fortunately situated than most other members of the business community, because, for reasons peculiar to the nature of their undertaking, they are not in a very strong bargaining position, and, therefore, are more likely to be the victims especially of changes in the general level of prices.</P>
    <P>Now, more than 2,000 years ago a very great Athenian acquired a great reputation for wisdom.  One of his titles to that reputation was that he liberated the tenant farmers of Attica from a burden of financial obligations which, in the changed economic circumstances of the time, had become literally intolerable for them.  Ever since it has been necessary, from time to time, for statesmanship to intervene in order to relieve farmers from the <Col N="157" /> burden of debts which, because of circumstances they could not foresee at the time they contracted these obligations, were impossible for them to repay.  Farmers are peculiarly the victims of circumstances.  When prices, generally, fall drastically, as prices did fall seriously after 1920, and, again, after 1931, they find, if they have incurred financial obligations at the peak point, that they are technically liable to repay in quart measures what they borrowed in pint measures formerly. Nominally, they owe the amount of money they have borrowed, but, actually, the amount of money that they owe (especially when the prices of the things that they have to sell have gone down), may have doubled or more than doubled in purchasing power, and, although, legally, the contract is for the return of the same amount of money, actually, if the letter of the law is adhered to in such cases, the farmers are being required to repay debts perhaps twice as great as the real purchasing power of what they borrowed.  Putting it in another way, the farmer in 1920 who borrowed the price of 20 bullocks might well have to sell 40 or 50 bullocks in 1930, and even more in 1932, in order to repay the nominal amount of his loan.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating any general revision of all monetary contracts entered into by our farmers and, in fact, we are fortunate in the fact that, speaking generally, our farmers have kept the banks at arm's length and are not heavily in debt&mdash;certainly not indebted to anything like the extent to which farmers in other countries have been indebted.  The financial dimensions of the problem which we are considering now are relatively small, and, for that very reason, I think our country has enjoyed a degree of financial stability in recent years which it would not have enjoyed if our farmers had been indebted to anything like the wholesale extent to which they were indebted in the United States of America, in New Zealand and in practically every other agricultural country in the world.  The frozen loans which I have especially in view, and which I think ought to be inquired into by an impartial tribunal, are loans incurred <Col N="158" /> before the year 1930, and incurred especially for the purpose of buying land at a time when the price of land was inordinately high in the years immediately after the last Great War. To my own personal knowledge, some of the banks were forward in encouraging their customers to borrow from them for the purpose of buying land at prices which turned out in the event to be quite fantastically high.  I say &ldquo;some of the banks,&rdquo; because, in this matter, not all the banks behaved in the same foolish and ill-considered way. I want to avoid mentioning the names either of banks or individuals, but it is a matter of general knowledge that, in this matter of encouraging farmers, in the peak time of 1920, to borrow money for the purpose of buying land, some of the banks were worse offenders than others.</P>
    <P>It might be said that the farmer entered into the contract with his eyes open, but his eyes were the eyes of the financial layman who could not foresee the future, and even the best financial experts in the world did not foresee, in 1920, the extent of the slump that would immediately follow.  Still less in 1929 did the financial experts foresee the extent of the economic depression that would afflict the world for the next five or ten years, so that if the farmers may be relieved of responsibility in the matter of foresight, at all events, we may say that the banks, which are supposed to be financially expert, to some extent have a greater degree of responsibility for the consequences of these ill-advised loans than the farmers, on whom in some cases, to my own personal knowledge, these loans were almost thrust by the banks.</P>
    <P>This problem of frozen loans was considered amongst other problems by the Banking Commission, but, in my view, it was not adequately considered by that commission, and evidently, judging by the terms of the report, the commission did not regard the problem as one of very grave importance. The commission itself contained a number of experts and a number of cranks, and, in addition to that, it was perhaps not as representative of what I might <Col N="159" /> call the ordinary working farmers of the country as it should have been, and it was not constituted in such a way as to have any instinctive sympathy with the farmers in this particular aspect of their problem.  If a commission of the kind which this motion recommends were set up, I think it might well recommend the establishment of a semi-judicial body which in other countries is called a Debt Adjustment Commission. That body would have the function of inviting applications from farmers, the victims of frozen loans, who considered that they had had a raw deal from their banks.  It would invite those farmers to state their case to the commission, which would hear the farmers' case and that of the bank, go into all the circumstances of each individual case and make recommendations for a settlement which would meet the equities of the situation, with, no doubt, a right of appeal to a court of law, as is also the position in New Zealand.  In fact, such a commission would fulfil much the same function in the relations between the victims of frozen loans and the banks as the Land Commission used to fulfil in coming between the Irish tenant farmers and a landlord system which they were unable to face up to themselves.</P>
    <P>In the interval since 1920, and since 1930, there have been individual settlements made by the banks with these frozen debtors, if I may coin the term, and I know that in many cases the banks have let off their debtors with substantial concessions.  I have heard of cases where as much as £20,000 was borrowed and as little as £5,000 accepted in full settlement, and, on the face of it, it would look as if in some cases the banks were almost unduly lenient, whereas, in other cases, to my personal knowledge, the banks have been unduly harsh.  They seem to have followed a policy of letting down lightly the debtor who made no serious attempt to pay, or who had local influence, or who perhaps was well in with one or other of the political factions. On the other hand, when they came across the honest, hard-working debtor who did his utmost to meet his obligations, they attempted to extract the last penny from him, and when they <Col N="160" /> had got all they could in the ordinary course of the business, they took the opportunity of selling the land for what they could get, being quite content with a very modest price for that land if it went anywhere near liquidating the final balance of the loan.  That policy which was followed in some cases is analogous to the policy of fleecing the farmer, in the first instance, then flaying him and finally selling the carcase, so to speak, for what it would fetch.</P>
    <P>The banks, in some cases, have been, I think, unduly lenient and, in other cases, unduly harsh, and my case is that there should be a semi-judicial body to stand between the banks and these frozen debtors and recommend an equitable settlement which every possible means should be brought to bear to make effective as between the banks and their debtors.  The Government may say that they made a substantial concession to farmers generally by halving the annuities in 1933.  Undoubtedly they did, but a general concession of that kind, while a matter of importance to everybody, is no solution of a problem which primarily affects only a minority of some 2,000 or 3,000 farmers.  The fact that nine of your neighbours have a concession, the capital value of which might aggregate £1,000, of which your share is £100, is not a great help to you in paying a debt of £1,000, if you owe £1,000, and the other nine owe nothing, so the reduction of the annuities is no solution of this particular problem, which is specific and refers only to some 2,000 or 3,000 farmers.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the experience of other countries where a similar problem existed and where, because the problem was much more serious in its general incidence, in its financial dimensions and affected a much larger proportion of the total agricultural interest, it was seriously dealt with and an equitable solution arrived at.  My information about New Zealand is derived from the New Zealand Year Book of 1939.  There, a series of Acts were passed, one called the Rural Mortgagors (Final Adjustment) Act, 1934-35, and another the Mortgagors and Lessees Rehabilitation Act, 1936.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> The general purpose of that legislation was expressed to be &ldquo;to retain farmer applicants in the use and occupation of their farms as efficient producers, and to make such adjustments of their liabilities as will ensure that the liabilities secured on any property do not exceed the value of that property&rdquo;.  And here was the principle which was given effect to in that legislation: &ldquo;If the basic value of the applicant's interest in any farm is less than the total amount of the principal and other moneys secured on it, the amount so secured is to be reduced to the basic value.  The balance is an adjustable debt which was deemed to have been discharged on a date to be fixed by the adjustment commission.&rdquo; In other words, if a farmer bought a farm for £4,000, borrowing £2,000 from a bank, and in the course of time the basic value of that farm fell to £1,000, then the farmer, instead of being deemed to owe £2,000 for that farm to the bank, would be deemed to owe only £1,000 to the bank for that farm, and the other £1,000 would be adjusted out of existence so far as the farmer was concerned, though, doubtless, provision was made by which the banks were compensated from some other source for the concession which they had to make to their debtors.  From information at my disposal, that principle has not been observed in many of the &ldquo;harsh&rdquo; cases which have been brought to my personal knowledge.</P>
    <P>In the case of New Zealand, as long ago as 1936, 14 Debt Adjustment Commissions were appointed, and the number was increased to 33 in May 1937.  These Debt Adjustment Commissions received 15,000 applications.  In 1,055 cases voluntary adjustments were made, but in 10,066 cases orders were made by a Debt Adjustment Commission the effect of which was that £4,000,000 was written off the principal of farm mortgages in New Zealand and £1,000,000 was written off the interest of farm mortgages.  That would seem to be a lot of money, and so it is, but to get it in its right proportion we must bear in mind that the extent to which land and farming is financed by mortgage debt in New Zealand is very much greater than the extent to which it is <Col N="162" /> so financed here.  The total indebtedness of our farmers to the banking system a few years ago was a matter of £12,000,000 or £13,000,000, and I am sure the addition of their debts to financial institutions of every kind would not bring that total up to £20,000,000, whereas the capital value of the assets associated with Irish agriculture must be well in the region of £300,000,000 or £400,000,000.  So that the amount of money which our farmers owe, by way of mortgage debt or otherwise, to financial institutions is only a trifling proportion of the total capital value of Irish agriculture.  On the other hand, in New Zealand, where these substantial concessions had to be made, the mortgage debt on country land, which was only £20,000,000 in 1900, rose to £50,000,000 in 1914, to £80,000,000 in 1920, to £125,000,000 in 1929, to £135,000,000 in 1933, and is estimated to be £130,000,000 in 1938. That shows that in that period, and especially since the end of the first Great War, New Zealand farmers were heavily increasing their mortgage indebtedness, but at the same time they were substantially increasing their agricultural productiveness for, if we look at the figures for the number of their dairy cows, we find that in 1900 they had only 355,000; in 1914 they had 634,000; in 1920 they had 893,000; in 1929 they had 1,371,000; in 1933 they had 1,846,000, and in 1938 they had 1,873,000&mdash;in other words, nearly twice as many cows as we have.  So that from the point of view of business enterprise the New Zealanders displayed considerable enterprise in expanding the amount of borrowed capital, while at the same time they were substantially increasing the amount of their agricultural production. We would be in a healthier position if our farmers could safely&mdash; and I emphasise the word &ldquo;safely&rdquo;&mdash; borrow from any source whatever the means of expanding agricultural production, and if we followed in our own case something like the example which the New Zealanders followed.  However, the point is that the £4,000,000 written off mortgage debt and the £1,000,000 written off mortgage interest in the case of New <Col N="163" /> Zealand agriculture is with reference to a total mortgage debt of £130,000,000, in other words, something like 3 per cent. of the total amount. Expressed in that form and applied to our own figure, which, in the case of total agricultural loans from the banking system only amounts to some £12,000,000 or £13,000,000, 3 per cent. on that is not a figure that should cause us any serious financial alarm.</P>
    <P>New Zealand is not the only country. In fact, I might almost say that ours, and probably Great Britain, are the only countries in which some revision on an equitable basis of agricultural loans has not taken place.  The United States of America is another country in which it was necessary to revise agricultural indebtedness and to write down a large proportion of that indebtedness in the years of the great depression.  I find from my records that farm debt in the United States of America amounted, in January, 1932, to 12,000 million dollars, of which mortgage debt represented 8,500 million dollars.  In other words, mortgage debt was more than two-thirds of the total farm indebtedness.  Now, the value of farm real estate in 1920 in the United States of America was 66,000 million dollars, but in 1933 it had fallen to 31,000 million dollars.  So that the mortgage debt of 8,500 million dollars, in relation to farm real estate worth only 31,000 million dollars, was equivalent to a mortgage debt representing 25 per cent. of the total value of farm real estate in the United States of America in that year, 1932-33.  Now, 25 per cent. of the value of farm real estate is a very big mortgage debt.  In our case a similar mortgage debt would be a matter of nearly £100,000,000.  We are not faced with a problem of anything like those dimensions.  Our problem is much smaller, but a problem of doing justice to a small and unfortunate minority of our farmers.  The American problem being what it was, was faced and dealt with.  It was dealt with by way of writing down a proportion of the loans in cases where it was utterly impossible for the farmer to meet his obligations while at the same time provision was made by <Col N="164" /> which the farmer thus relieved from an intolerable burden of indebtedness was able to borrow from fresh sources in order to resume full agricultural production. By the 1st December, 1933, 23 per cent. of the former indebtedness of American farmers had been written off.  In 81.6 per cent. of the cases voluntary reductions were accepted by creditors in the case of farmers who were able to borrow from other sources for re-financing their old debts&mdash;and that brings me to this point, that if you can open a way in which farmers burdened with intolerable debts can borrow for re-financing, they can then proceed to discuss terms of settlement with their creditors, whereas, if there is no possible way in which farmers can get any money at all from any source whatever, then they have nothing to offer their creditors and the situation simply drags on from one year to another until the last state of that loan and that farm is worse than the first.</P>
    <P>As already mentioned, the dimensions of our own farm debt problem are not alarming, as compared with other countries, and, probably for that very reason, nothing was done either by this Government or its predecessor to deal in an equitable manner with this old standing problem.  I would emphasise that in criticising the attitude of the Government to this problem I am not in any way indulging in Party criticism, because everything which I say of the present Government applies by implication to their predecessors, who also were guilty of criminal neglect in failing to deal with this problem at a time when it was much more manageable in its proportions. It appears from figures given in the Banking Commission Report that our farmers owed the banks in January, 1937, about £12,500,000, but that the banks owed the farmers by way of deposits as much as £35,500,000, so that on balance our agricultural interest, so far from owing money to the banking system, was the creditor of the banking system, but that, of course, does not help matters very much in the case of the 2,000 or 3,000 farmers who are the victims of those irrecoverable loans.</P>
    <P>The general relations of our farmers <Col N="165" /> to the banking system are indicated by the fact that that £12,000,000 or £13,000,000 owed to the banks was owed by 125,000 farmers, an average farm loan of about £100 each, and I am sure that in 99 out of 100 cases those loans are a source of mutual advantage to the farmers and to the banks.  No problem whatever arises with reference to the farmer who occasionally borrows £100 from the bank to buy stock, and, when he has sold his stock, automatically repays his loan.  That kind of loan from the banking system to provide working capital during the period of the year when additional working capital is necessary is altogether admirable, and rarely leads to the problem with which I am now dealing, the problem of frozen loans.  The problem with which I am concerned has arisen mainly owing to the ill-advised action of certain banks in advancing money to certain farmers to buy land at fancy prices in the years immediately following the last great war, and the number of farmers who were concerned with that kind of financial transaction is only a matter of about 2,000 or so according to my information.</P>

      <P>My information is based on the Report of the Banking Commission, page 206, where it says that, of 5,646 borrowers concerned with irrecoverable items, 3,732 owed less than £250 each, so that the other 2,000 odd owed more than £250 each, and I imagine the graver part of our problem is concerned with the 2,000 odd who owed more than £250 each.  To illustrate my remarks I should like to refer to one or two cases in point, which I quote not as final evidence but as evidence that there is a <i>prima facie</i> case for an impartial investigation. If, in the course of referring to specific case, I should inadvertently mention any names either of individuals or of banks, I hope the official reporter will leave a blank at that part of my remarks, because I do not wish to say <Col N="166" /> anything which would embarrass any individual, or to make any unfair use of my privilege.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try not to mention any names, but if I should do so you will know that it is inadvertent. Here is the case of a farm bought in December 1920 for £4,600.  The farmer in question put up £1,600 of his own money, and borrowed £3,000 from a bank.  He gave as security a mortgage on the farm and also a transfer of life insurance policies of the nominal value of £1,000, and in the course of the existence of this loan the farmer in question paid £700 which he realised by selling railway shares under pressure from the bank at a time when railway shares were extremely low in value.  The bank obtained a further £500 from the maturity of one of those life policies.  The other is about to mature in a year or two, and will yield the bank another £500 or £600.  That farmer happens to be a man with 12 children, of whom only three even now have reached their majority.  During all that time he was struggling to bring up this large family, and at the same time struggling to repay this loan.  After the bank had extracted from that farmer everything that it could extract by reason of its legal claims, the other day that farm was put up for sale by compulsion from the bank and given away&mdash;to use the phrase used to me&mdash;for £800, in a sale with reference to which my informant states there is reason to think that everything was not as it should be.  If you apply the New Zealand principle to that financial transaction, the farm, on the bank's own showing, had in November 1940 a basic value of £800, and consequently, applying the New Zealand principle, the money owed in respect of that farm should have been adjusted down to £800, so that the farmer, so far from owing £3,000 plus <Col N="167" /> interest, would owe only £800 in respect of that farm.  In fact, on the history of the case, he had already paid over £1,200 and applying the New Zealand principle to that farm he would be entitled to a refund of some hundreds of pounds.  I think it was an iniquitious thing to compel the sale of a farm of that kind in order to realise a trifling amount like that, when, with any kind of decent treatment, the farm might have been maintained in production, and the farmer allowed to carry on and provide for his large family.  Mind you, I know there are two sides to every question, and it is possible that if this case went before an impartial tribunal the bank would be able to throw much light on it, but my whole contention is that facts of this kind should be brought before an impartial tribunal which would investigate all the details of the case.  I should be only too glad to provide the Minister with all the data in my possession about that particular farm, if he will undertake to have it privately investigated by one of his officials, in order to see whether or not the facts bear the interpretation I am inclined to put on them.</P>
      <P>That is one case.  I could parallel that case by others, but I will not take up the time of the House in dealing with them.  I could instance cases where the banks appear to have been unduly harsh; but equally there are other cases where the banks have been unduly lenient.  Here is the case of a debt of £2,700 in respect of a good farm and residence worth now at least £5,000 and the bank accepted £1,500 in complete settlement.  Here is the case of a debt of £4,000 odd.  The bank has agreed to take £800 and an insurance policy of £300.  Here is the case of a debt of £500 and the bank has agreed to take £150 in final settlement. It might be just as much in the interests of the banks as of the frozen debtors if there was an impartial tribunal to decide what is a fair settlement in each case, so that the banks could not be imposed upon by debtors who may, perhaps, have too much local influence and possibly be tempted to take it out of other debtors who are honest but without local influence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="168" /> If a principle such as the New Zealand principle is applied, and a Debt Adjustment Commission established to recommend final settlement in cases of frozen loans, I think the principle of the farmer redeeming these adjusted debts by way of annuity should be adopted.  In other words, the debt adjustment commission, having decided what is the amount which should be regarded as a final settlement, the State should calculate the annuity over a number of years and allow the farmer to repay the State year by year the amount of that settlement, while the State, for its part, would facilitate the banks by transferring to them immediately the capital value of the annuity obligation thus undertaken.</P>
    <P>So far, it is merely a question of elementary justice and giving a square deal to an unfortunate minority of our fellow-countrymen; but the problem of finance is of the utmost importance if we are to achieve the maximum output from our agricultural industry, the industry upon which the life of the nation will depend in the course of the next year or two.  It is partly because I think a better atmosphere should be created as between the farmers and the banks that it is desirable that this old problem of frozen loans should be got out of the way.  I think it possible that farmers who are aware of cases where a bank has been unduly harsh to a neighbour in the matter of an old loan might be reluctant to have any financial dealings, even for a small sum, with that bank or any similar banks, and it is as important that the farmers should be in a mood to trust the banks as it is that the banks should be in a position to trust the farmers.  There should be mutual confidence between the farmers and the banks generally.</P>
    <P>At present the occupiers of grasslands are being invited to plough up their lands in order to grow wheat and, in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, it appears to be necessary that we should use even the ultimate reserves of our agriculture for that purpose.  It may be no harm to say, in parenthesis, that it is a matter for satisfaction that the owners of first-class pasturelands in this country resisted <Col N="169" /> the blandishments of the Minister's Department and did not grow wheat from 1932 to 1939, because their lands are now in better heart for the growing of wheat when wheat growing is a matter of admitted national necessity. The Minister's secretary made an interesting speech at Navan the other day in which he pointed out that well-maintained pasture land had reserves of plant food on which it would be now possible to draw for the purpose of growing wheat without any artificial manure.  The existence of those reserves is a matter for profound thankfulness.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we should face the fact that, when growing wheat on land without manure, we are drawing on our agricultural reserves, and if we are to minimise the effect of the reduction of that fertility in years to come, it is necessary that the wheat crop this year should be followed by a manured root crop next year.  If the grasslands are to have animal manure to grow roots next year, the owners of those lands will have to have cattle to produce that manure this autumn and winter.  There are cases in which farmers may be able to grow wheat, but owing to lack of capital and credit they may not be able to buy cattle for stall-feeding next year, on which the provision of the manure depends.  It is important that there should be no obstacle to the borrowing of the necessary funds by farmers in order to stock their lands adequately, and enable them to follow up their new tillage operations with that kind of husbandry which will produce animal manure and help to maintain the fertility of the soil in the years to come.</P>
    <P>If we fail to provide our farmers with the additional means necessary to keep up agricultural fertility, we are doing a much more serious thing than merely overdrawing a bank account.  We are overdrawing the account in relation to our agricultural reserves, exhausting the fertility of our soil without replacing it, and nothing can more affect the fertility of the country than drafts on its accumulated reserves, lowering them year after year.  It would be far better for the farmers to acquire the habit of overdrawing their bank <Col N="170" /> accounts than overdrawing on the fertility of the soil.</P>
    <P>In connection with the campaign for increased tillage, there is scope for the use of additional credit.  There is, with reference to our agriculture generally, room for the use of considerably more working capital than we are in the habit of using.  I mentioned that the total capital value of our agricultural assets might be estimated at £300,000,000 or £400,000,000.  That works out at only £500 or £600 per person occupied in Irish agriculture.  If our agricultural production were adequately capitalised, the amount per person occupied in agriculture would be more like £1,000 than £600 per person. Putting it another way, it is surely a matter of general knowledge that we could considerably expand our production of pigs, poultry and dairy products if we had another 500,000 cows, another 1,000,000 pigs, and another 10,000,000 poultry in the country.  Putting that in financial form, it means that we could well expand our supply of cows by an amount equivalent to £10,000,000, and our working capital in respect of poultry and pigs by about £5,000,000 each.  In other words, there is room for an expansion of at least £20,000,000 in the working capital invested in our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>If we take into account in addition the room there is for improved equipment, by way of appliances, buildings, etc., for the maintenance and housing of cows, poultry and pigs, I can well believe that we could easily invest another £10,000,000 on the provision of such improved housing and equipment. That would be a matter of at least £30,000,000 above the amount of capital now invested in agriculture.  All of that capital need not necessarily come from the banking system.  Some of it might come from the savings of individual farmers, but it is in the highest degree desirable that our farmers should be in the mood to consider borrowing for the purpose of acquiring additional working capital from the banking system, and that the banking system, with encouragement from the State, should be willing to agree to provide our farmers with such additional working capital as they can <Col N="171" /> obviously use with profit to themselves and with advantage to the country. There are a few other points with which I might have dealt, but they can perhaps be more fittingly referred to in my reply.  Meanwhile I think I have said enough to go on with.</P>

      <P>In the absence of Senator Counihan, I beg to second the motion.  The motion starts by reciting the fact that the Commission on Agriculture has suspended its inquiries. That is a point to which I should like to have adverted in this House previously, and it is something on which the Minister may be obliged to comment in his reply.  Personally, I should have preferred if the Commission on Agriculture had continued to function and if this question had been referred to it.  I do not know whether I am voicing the views of my colleagues in this House who are members of that commission, but it is my own opinion that, had the commission continued to function, this is one of the questions on which an interim report would have been available by this time.  It may not be in order now to discuss whether or not the commission is going to resume its sittings, but in my judgment these sittings should not have been suspended.  The commission would have been a considerable source of strength to the Minister in dealing with the difficulties with which he is now confronted.  I would go further and say that the problems which are likely to face this country in future will be so urgent, so pressing and so far-reaching in their consequences that a commission should be inquiring into them and devising some plan for meeting them. Even though the plan were a bad plan, it would be better than no plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane, apparently, <Col N="172" /> did not like to be trapped into seconding this motion.  In a sense, I should have preferred to have heard Senator Sir John Keane before making my trifling contribution.  This problem of frozen loans with which Senator Johnston has dealt is an old problem here.  Senator Magennis reminded me this evening of a day very long ago in the other House when he and I and a colleague of mine in the Farmers' Party of those days, joined issue with the then Minister for Agriculture on this question.  The problem of frozen loans has not, therefore, developed suddenly.  It is there and it has been hanging fire for a very long period of years now.  It has had very serious consequences for, not a very large number of people, but for a relatively large number of people, and it has affected the lives of these people to a very marked degree.  Senator Johnston was pleased to say that it was the ill-advised policy of some of the banks which created this problem.  I, perhaps in a way less well informed at that time, had somewhat the same view in former days, but after looking more deeply into the whole question I am quite convinced that the roots of the problem lie in the whole financial and money policy of the world, not of this country alone.  It arises from the methods pursued in the manipulation of money in relation to goods.  At one time the value of goods may be high in relation to money.  At another time, it may be much lower.  It is apparently the feeling at the moment that money is less valuable than goods but if the war were over the contrary would be the fact.  The value of money would appreciate very considerably.  That may not happen after this war, but if we are to have a repetition of what happened after the last war, that is what will happen.  Senator Johnston, I feel, is much more competent to explain these matters than I am, but the fact is that the people who manage and handle money directed things in such a way that the value of goods depreciated to such a level after the last war that there was no payment at all for the people who produced the goods after the interest had been paid on the money that was borrowed to enable these goods to be produced.  That is <Col N="173" /> what happened in the case of farmers throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It should be said that the farmers who got broken after the last war because they had paid too high a price for land were not thriftless, worthless, useless people.  On the contrary, most of these farmers&mdash;and I have had very intimate experience of this problem for a long time as far as a number of people are concerned&mdash;were persons who had been able to put by a few hundred or a few thousand pounds as a result of their labour and their thrift. Buoyed up with high hopes for the future and with confidence in themselves and desiring to better their position in life, they put all they had got in the world into the purchase of more land.  They went in and staked their whole future in the bank and they borrowed to supplement their savings in order to purchase that land.  The war came to an end and then the slump arrived.  The value of money went up and the value of land went down.  The farmers were left to carry on their new farms in many cases under conditions which left these properties practically in the possession of the banks.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the banks were responsible for manipulating the change in values.  Other people who managed the financial policy of the world did that, but individual banks acted, in my judgment, very unwisely. They commenced to press individual borrowers to liquidate their liabilities and, in a falling market, men went to one fair after another, selling off stock that should be kept on the lands if the farms were to continue as a going concern.  The result was that eventually you had bare farms with no capacity for production, and a number of families were left on the road.</P>
    <P>I remember referring in 1926 or 1927 in Dáil Eireann, on the basis of information which I had then got, to a particular case.  It has since become a classic case.  Men have gone into jail and come out of jail because of it.  The people concerned were very industrious, very go-ahead and they belonged to the type known in the country as &ldquo;respectable&rdquo;.  They had many relatives who had saved money and put it into the bank, and on the strength of the deposits of their friends <Col N="174" /> they got a better farm.  Then the slump came and, as happened in some of the cases which Senator Johnston has given the House, there was no effort on the part of the bank to come down to reason or a basis of justice. There was strife, discord and State interference eventually in this particular district.  The results were anything but satisfactory for the bank concerned or for the people involved. One cannot blame people who borrow money from banks, people who have been industrious all their lives, who have saved some money when there were peace and order and when a reasonable, equitable balance was struck between money and goods.  One cannot blame people like that who have lived through such a period and who had confidence enough in themselves to stake their credit with the bank and to borrow to buy a better farm.  When the people who lent the money want to get their &ldquo;pound of flesh&rdquo; 100 per cent., and leave people on the road penniless, with neither credit nor homestead, one cannot blame those people for going to extremes, even for going outside the law.  That is what some men did, when a situation arose which never should have been allowed to develop in this country.  I argued that in 1926 and 1927.  It is between that period and this that certain of those people were driven to those extremes.</P>
    <P>As Senator Johnston has pointed out, practically every other country in the world, in their dealings with farmers, has been pressed to do something that we have not done here.  It may be that the problem affects so few people here that it was not deemed of sufficient magnitude for any sort of State interference.  It may be that the people concerned were so unorganised or so voiceless that they were able to do nothing, and were in a hopeless position, unable to make their case sufficiently heard or understood, or to make the public sufficiently sympathetic. It is true that the whole policy of financing agriculture is so different and the conditions are so different to those in New Zealand, Denmark or elsewhere.  The whole problem of the credit position of our farmers compared <Col N="175" /> with the farmers in those other countries is that we are very much more credit worthy, in as much as we owe far less, relatively to our assets, to banks or mortgage institutions than do the farmers in other countries.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston has pointed out what it was found necessary to do in New Zealand.  I do not know if he referred to Denmark, but practically similar action was and had to be taken in Denmark.  As far as my memory serves me at the moment&mdash;I have the figures elsewhere or have seen and studied them&mdash;they had to write off in Denmark the indebtedness of the &ldquo;broken&rdquo; farmers during that period to the extent of £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 through State subventions of a particular kind and through efforts on the part of lending institutions.  What has been done in every other country, what it has been found necessary to do in every case of that type was done there because it was a huge problem.  The lendings for agriculture in those countries were much greater than those here.  In Denmark, it is said, the borrowings on the part of farmers would be somewhat in the neighbourhood of £200,000,000&mdash;a colossal figure.  When you recognise the extent to which credit facilities have been made available in New Zealand and Denmark, as compared with this country, you find, in my judgment, largely the reason for the immense increase in production in those countries as against ours.  That is another point, but I just wanted to make it here.</P>
    <P>I had the privilege&mdash;and if I may say so, the labour&mdash;of going before the Banking Commission and part of the case which I had to make was in connection with this problem.  The recommendation which was made by the Banking Commission was&mdash;if one may say so, with all respect to that body&mdash; only the type of recommendation one could expect from it.  No doubt, they were all very able men with very wide knowledge, but the commission was not so constituted as to convince you, or to give very considerable grounds for hope, that there was going to be a positive plan for the solution of such a problem as this.  That was the kind of <Col N="176" /> feeling I got when giving my evidence before them.  In my evidence I urged the necessity to set up some sort of judicial body to inquire into the difficulties of those farmers.  It seemed at that time that something like a judicial council&mdash;a lawyer, a banker and a farmer&mdash;would have been the kind of body which could have made a recommendation on this question.  Curiously enough, looking into what has been done in Denmark since then, I find that they did something like that.  While a great many of these cases have been settled, there are still some of them outstanding.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that it is very bad for the body politic to have men who were once strong farmers, whom everybody knew to be industrious, thrifty, intelligent, go ahead men, now side by side with their neighbours, broken farmers.  Anybody who knows this type, knows that you cannot fall from a high estate, suddenly, down very low in the whole social and economic scale and be the same valuable citizen that you had been.  You cannot suddenly change all your standards, point of view, associates and all that.  That is not easily done and, in my opinion, it is something which should never have been done with that type of citizen at all.  Society should have been able to make some plan whereby such hardships, injustices and inequities would not have been imposed upon any of its citizens.  Even now, something should be done about that.  I have said that I think the Agricultural Commission&mdash; if the Government decide to permit it to function&mdash;probably would give some recommendation not only on that aspect of the credit problem but on the whole credit problem.  I have said a great deal on this in the past.</P>
    <P>I am just as convinced as ever that you can do nothing anywhere without money.  You cannot buy a plough or stick it in the ground without money. You have to be able to pay for the plough or for the ploughman. There is no use in ploughing land unless you have got the seed, and the seed will not be harvested for perhaps another eight or nine months and you have to carry on in the meantime. There is demand for money every week, <Col N="177" /> every day.  Irish farmers who have their services to sell, who are of the right stuff, whose families have been known for generations back, who can show the fruits of their labours and of their father's labours on hillsides all round them, have also their horses and ploughs and can show at a time like this that they will do the work, if they are given the means; and the means they require to-day in a great many cases is that which will enable them to produce the fruits of another harvest, and that means cannot be procured without money.</P>
    <P>I saw a rather interesting statement from a Government Deputy down the country the other day, Deputy Childers. Apparently he was prepared&mdash;and it looks like a step forward to me&mdash;to put the whole resources of the State, in so far as credit could be based or built upon them, at the disposal of agriculture in order to enable agriculture to get into vastly increased production.  I think that is the right point of view.  It is not for us here to attempt to work out how that can be done, but at a time like this, when everything has to be thrown into the melting-pot and when none of us know, from day to day or from week to week, what is going to happen next, and when we are all equally convinced, with the Minister for Agriculture and his colleagues, that out of the soil of this country, in the main, is the salvation of our people to be procured, we would be a very foolish nation if, in so far as it is possible for us to find credit that would enable us to work towards our own salvation, that credit cannot be procured.  I see that the Minister has enunciated the inauguration of a scheme for the purchase of farm implements and machinery, and I congratulate him on that.  Personally, I should have liked him to have done that a year or two ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the trouble I see about it is this.  We are going to buy machines now, and they are going to be dearer than they were 12 months or two years ago, and I think, again, that the price we have to pay for the <Col N="178" /> service of money to-day is too high.  I cannot ever understand how it comes about that, above any and everything else, money is the one commodity that can always demand and always get full payment for its service as against everything else.  My view is that 5 per cent. interest on this money to-day is too high.  Go into any bank you like and see what interest they are paying for deposits at the moment.  As far as my memory serves me, they are paying 1 per cent., but the borrower has to pay 5 per cent. for the money he borrows, and the borrower is going to pay 5 per cent. for money now in order to purchase goods, machinery, and so on, that are probably going to appreciate, in our time, and while the war lasts, by 20, 30, 40 or even 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt whatever that the value of machinery is going to increase in price.  It must be remembered that we will have to pay for these goods, and when the war is over we will be repaying this interest.  I do not know whether the 5 per cent. covers interest and sinking fund.  I presume you have to pay off the loan in addition to the 5 per cent., but there is one thing anyhow, and that is when the war is over we will be repaying these loans at 5 per cent., and repaying them, probably, with goods that have considerably depreciated in value.  After the war, if you want to get cash for the machine with which you were turning out these goods, you will probably get no money at all for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In anticipation of such a situation as that, I should like that, in connection with whatever scheme may be inaugurated in order to help the country through this crisis, there should be consideration for the fact that we are undertaking obligations and liabilities on into the future and that we will be carrying out these obligations when the value of our goods, probably, will have fallen very considerably, in relation to money, as against their value to-day.  Accordingly, we would be very unwise, and it would be unfair to expect us, to pay a high rate of interest now.  We might be ready to undertake it now, as men were during the last war when they borrowed, but <Col N="179" /> we might not be able to pay it in the future.  I would urge the Minister to take that into account and I think that the people with money, and the people managing money, are not just as optimistic about the security of money in the future, at least of the security in the future of money that was earned in the past, as they were four or five years ago.  I think they would much prefer to have it in goods&mdash;in any kind of goods, I do not care what they are.</P>
    <P>In times like these I am convinced that it is unsound State policy, and equally unsound farming policy, to undertake to pay a high price for the service of this money, but whatever may be done about that, it is terribly important that credit facilities should be made available to our farmers now. I think I should be <i>flaitheamhlach</i> about it.  At any rate, I would not hold a man up for months before telling him whether he could get a loan to buy a plough or a grubber or any of the machines he wants for spring work, or hold him up until on into the harvest, when it would be too late for him to do the work.  Of course, I do not know what method the Minister has in mind with a view to making a loan operative for farming, but I would be prepared to give <i>carte blanche</i> to the traders to give the machines out to these men, and let them get on with the job at any rate, whatever about payment.  It would be a much better policy and would be a greater encouragement to tillage to hand the machines over to these men immediately rather than have them wait for months or even weeks until, say, the second week of May, when there would not be much use in planting oats or potatoes, whatever about other crops.  But whatever method may be adopted about credit for the future, what we are to do now with regard to the immediate demands of the moment should be done, not from the point of view of making it absolutely certain that nobody should get the money except a man who can repay it, or taking pains to ensure that, whatever happens, the money is safe, but rather I would go all out for attacking the problem the other way, and if there <Col N="180" /> was a reasonable chance that the man would make use of it at all I would give him his plough and let him get on with the job.</P>
    <P>With regard to the future of the land of this country, or the management of the land of this country, there is no doubt that there is never going to be that increased production that would make it profitable unless we increase the production on every farm in this country, and that can only be done by putting much more capital into production than was ever deemed requisite in the past.  I said earlier that, in my opinion, the Agricultural Commission could have performed a very useful function if it had gone on with that policy.  I think that my colleagues will confirm my view that that is one of the first problems that would have been tackled after the first two interim reports.  The commission felt that it was a pressing problem, and it will remain a pressing problem while those of us who have eyes to see have the conviction that the land of this country and the people on the land of this country have possibilities with regard to production that none of us has ever yet attempted to measure, and that that measurement will only come, and come as a revelation, when we have put enough capital into production and enough scientific and technical knowledge into the work of the land to get its full capacity from it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister tells the House that the Agricultural Commission is not to resume its work, my view is that something must be done about it outside the Department.  I do not think any Department can measure this problem or approach it in a way in which it could be solved.  The Department could help and advise, but the extent of the question has to be measured by other people.  I confess that I would not like to have a committee set up consisting largely of bankers and economists.  I would not mind having economists on it like Senator Johnston, who is also a farmer, but what I feel about such a body is similar to what I felt about the Banking Commission: that while it is a grand thing to have a body of technical men who can give answers to technical questions, when people are up <Col N="181" /> against practical questions you must have men with practical experience to show how technique and practice will work out when put together.  I am supporting Senator Johnston's motion.  I am convinced that the Minister is quite cognisant of the difficulties with regard to frozen loans, and the necessity for having better credit facilities.  He should make up his mind to convince his colleagues that farming is a much bigger problem than any Party in the State has realised, and that if we want to make this State strong, it can only be done by giving the people on the land the means of producing to such a maximum as was never reached in the past by any generation of the Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that one with the knowledge, practice and theory of the proposer of this motion should have brought it forward.  Presumably, he has theoretical knowledge, but does he realise what he proposes should be done?  He proposes to tamper with one side of the question, the asset side, but he does not say how he is going to apply that principle to the liability side.  Every man who claims to be a theoretical economist can propound that theory.  Turning to the frozen loans, that question has been, so to speak, tortured to death.  The Banking Commission examined it carefully. Now, Senator Baxter, speaking on behalf of those concerned, says that they were not impressed by some of the decisions of that body, some of whom were technical and some practical people.  Let it not be thought that the personnel of the Banking Commission consisted merely of bankers.  They were in the minority.  There were farmers, general citizens, civil servants, and continental experts on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator can correct me if I am wrong, but I do not think that even the recommendations in the minority reports about frozen loans were challenged. I have had occasion to examine this at close quarters, and I doubt if the term &ldquo;frozen loans&rdquo; is the proper definition.  How will you differentiate between what money was used for buying stock and what money <Col N="182" /> was used for buying land?  Would it not be unfair to discriminate between those who have paid off the debts or made an effort to do so and those who, in some cases by inability or by less hard work, have failed to do so?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>This country has had examples where the State came to the rescue of people who failed to pay their debts.  Look at the whole policy of letting people off payment of the annuities.  The honest men who paid up got no consideration, while the longer other men allowed the annuities to fall into arrears, the greater concessions they received from the State.  I consider that was a very unwise policy, a policy of encouraging, not dishonesty but laziness and thriftlessness, that cuts right into the whole of our social system.  If a man buys stocks and if these stocks fall in value the owner loses.  Why should he not equally get relief from the State by some sort of special machinery? Why should farmers be singled out for relief because of a fall in values?  The thing does not bear examination.  I ask Senator Johnston to consider that aspect.  He gave instances where the banks had been very generous in their dealings with frozen loans.  I could give instances of the generosity of the banks that would be astounding.  I have known where debts representing £3,000 or £4,000 were settled for a few hundred pounds.  What is the principle upon which that was done?  It was done because of inability of the people to pay.  Undoubtedly family circumstances were taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely it is not suggested that a tribunal should be set up to adjust values and to examine the inability of debtors to pay.  On that basis it would have to examine what land was worth, and apart from inability to pay, values would have to be fixed on some such basis.  What would be the effect? People who have got relief in the past would naturally not get it in future. <Col N="183" /> Once a tribunal fixed prices the banks would naturally stand by prices fixed by the State, and if debtors could not pay they would have to say: &ldquo;We will have to have recourse to the full remedy provided by law.&rdquo;  Would that be better for the people concerned?  Of course it would not.  I strongly advise Senator Johnston and Senator Baxter, in the interests of people who it is said are suffering from the effects of frozen loans, to leave things alone.  These loans are being liquidated rapidly, and as the figures will show being liquidated under very generous circumstances. For the one alleged hard case that Senator Johnston brings forward, there are dozens of cases written-off for almost nominal sums.  Such treatment could never be given by any tribunal.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister, on behalf of the Government, knows better than to be led down the avenue that the Senator suggests.  He suggested that these debts should be put on an annuity basis and that the banks should be paid off in stock of some kind, the State to guarantee the obligation.  I think the State has quite enough obligations already in the cases of people who owe annuities, without taking on any more. My view about the whole matter is that the House should leave it alone.  As a result of statements made by the Banking Commission it was shown that it could not be dealt with in a formal or cut-and-dried manner.  If we tried to apply any sort of judicial system, it would only have a prejudicial effect upon further loans, as the banks would have to say: &ldquo;We were dealing with this matter voluntarily, but the State has now come in, and imposed conditions and we will have to reconsider our attitude towards fresh advances&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter talked about high rates of interest.  Does he realise that in some of these cases nothing has been paid off at all, that there are cases where the interest is equal to the debt? People have the idea that the farmer is struggling to pay interest.  He does not pay the interest.  The capital and the interest are frozen.  If the interest were 1 per cent., it would not make any difference.  If the amount were halved, it would not make any difference, <Col N="184" /> because there would be no payment made.  These are facts.  The matter will not be settled in that way. Let it be done on the circumstances of each individual case, and where a genuine effort is made in a case of what we call a frozen loan a settlement will be effected.  What is really wanted is rapid, fresh credit for farmers for tillage, and it was a mistake to mix up the two things.  I should like to put this point to Senator Johnston and Senator Baxter.  I think Senator Johnston said that there was £53,000,000 of farmers' deposits in the banks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I said £37,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum is immaterial for the purpose of my argument. Supposing the Government to-morrow said that they wanted to float a food production loan for the purpose of giving quick advances to agriculture, I wonder how much of that £37,000,000 would find its way into subscriptions to the loan?  Will farmers take that money out of the banks in order to give it to the State for the purpose of advancing it to their more needy fellow countrymen?  I very much doubt it.  Experience in the past has not shown that farmers as a whole are ready to support Government loans even for the benefit of their own industry. There is an acid test which should make people think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, I know for a fact that at the present moment the banks are being as generous as they can be in advances for agriculture.  Where we know that a man is of good character and is likely, from his record, to make an honest attempt to repay his debt, there is no question about his getting the money.  He will get the money much easier than in the past.  But the banks are business people and have to have regard to that.  There is a minority who resort to every possible subterfuge to avoid paying debts.  We know where farms cannot be sold in a free market, where no bids are obtainable owing to local understandings; where, when farms are put up for sale <Col N="185" /> for the annuity, a bid is put up to cover the value of the annuity and all the other creditors, not alone the banks, but shopkeepers and people having charges on the farms are wiped out.  We cannot be blind to these considerations. If the Senators were lending their own money they would be the first to have regard to these considerations. But, making all allowance for the small percentage of people who are dishonest, the large majority of the farmers are making an honest attempt to discharge their obligations, and they are discharging them in an increasing measure, you will be glad to hear, and they are being generously treated in this matter of loans at the present time.</P>
    <P>If the Government want to hasten up this matter, there is nothing easier than, in approved cases, to guarantee loans where the banks are not satisfied. That is very simple.  The machinery for that could be brought into operation almost at once.  Where a bank is not satisfied to make a loan at a certain rate, I have no doubt it might be possible by a Government guarantee to make a loan at a lower rate.  That is a practical step which could be taken almost at once.  Let us get away from the theory of repudiating debts, and away from tribunals. We have too many tribunals.  The whole thing is being cluttered up and slowed down by tribunals.  The frozen loans question is getting on satisfactorily. The question of rapid credit presents no fundamental difficulty if the Government are in earnest about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesParkinson" hpid="Mr. Parkinson Mr. Parkinson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parkinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very glad to hear Senator Sir John Keane elaborate a scheme by which credit can be created for the farmers.  I only wish he had gone a little further and pointed out to the Government that the greatest frozen asset in this country to-day is due to the fact that ownership of the land occupied by 300,000 tenant farmers was passed over to the Land Commission under the 1923 Land Act, with the result that fixity of tenure no longer existed, that in a few years free sale of land was finished, and from a banking point of view the ownership of land was of no collateral value to the <Col N="186" /> banks.  Without any burden on the State, or any extra cost to the taxpayers, the ownership of the land could have been given to the farmers who paid for the tenant right and bought out the landlords at the huge cost of £250,000,000, which is a frozen credit from the agricultural point of view. Whether a farmer is on an uneconomic holding, or whether he is a rancher, it is just as valuable to the little man to have credit as it is to the big man.  To-day the farmer has absolutely no credit.  It is in the interest of the Government to create that credit as soon as they can.  I believe that in one hour's conference between a representative of the Government, a representative of the banks, and a representative of the farmers, that problem could be solved.  We could have fixity of tenure, free sale, and a collateral security which would satisfy the banks.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Corporation have shown a marvellous example which it would pay the Government to follow.  When they want land to improve the amenities of the city, they pay the owners the market value.  Indeed, they go further and pay them a sum for disturbance. Why is it that the farmers, who have paid £250,000,000 for the land of this country, should be put in the position in which they were put under the Land Acts&mdash;that they have to take any price at any time for any land?  Surely we cannot blame the banks for not lending money on a security that does not exist, and which could be restored by a four-line Act of Parliament which would cost the State nothing and cost the taxpayers nothing.  The Minister, as his speeches show, realises how necessary it is that this credit should be created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister, who in his speeches deplored the fact that fertilisers will not be available, has not been able to get an alternative for them.  We could be self-sufficient in this matter of fertilisers.  We need not do without phosphates and superphosphates because we cannot get them from Egypt through the Mediterranean. A geological survey will show that there is plenty of phosphate in County Clare, which is the only Irish county that has it.  It may not be as <Col N="187" /> soluble or as easily mined as the phosphate which we were getting from Egypt and North Africa.  Even though it costs more, and is not quite so soluble, when it is turned into superphosphate it is just as good.  It would produce the crops and restore the fertility of the soil.</P>
    <P>We also want nitrates from Sweden. In the late war, when Chilean nitrates were no longer available in Germany, the farmers there were able to use nitrate of lime for fertilising the land. We have any amount of limestone, we have the anthracite coal, we have the electric power and we have the air. That is the whole composition of nitrate of lime.  If we can get carbide of calcium from limestone, surely we ought to be able to go a step further and make nitrate of lime.  It may cost us a little more to do that than it costs other people who may have better technicians, but it is possible to do it. Between now and next year our land will be still more hungry for fertilisers. If we have to grow the corn crops that have been mentioned, it is vital, I suggest, that we should use our own raw materials to produce the fertilisers we need.  Another thing we want is ammonia of sulphate.  The raw material for it and for potash is the seaweed on our coast.  When we burn that into kelp, we get iodine.  If we can get ammonia of sulphate and potash from seaweed, there is no reason in the world, since many of our people make a living out of gathering seaweed and burning it into kelp, why we should not use that raw material for producing the fertilisers essential for the cultivation of our corn crops.  You can get a solution of sulphate and you can get potash from seaweed.  The two things are byproducts of seaweed, and it is only a question of using enough to get what we want.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter talked about the Agricultural Commission and said it had not thought of investigating something on these lines.  Surely to goodness it is no crime for this country to be self-sufficient.  Why should we have to import all the fertilisers we need? It does not make the bread manufactured from our wheat taste any sweeter <Col N="188" /> simply because the phosphates we use have come from Africa.  There is at present a research chemical factory in Galway.  Why should not the chemists who are working there be asked to give their services on a research committee? We have men of the standing of Professor O'Reilly of Cork, and Dr. Drum of Dublin.  I suggest that men like these, if they are asked to investigate this matter, could solve the problem of supplying us with all the fertilisers we need.  We have all the raw material we want in our own country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, in their agricultural policy, appear to have put the cart before the horse. Since 1932 they have spent most of their time appealing to the farmers to co-operate with them in giving effect to Government policy.  They did that even during the period of the economic war when Government policy was contrary to the interests of the farmers. We know that the wealth of this country has always depended on what the farmers, and the farming community, can produce.  That position has been accentuated by the circumstances of the present war.  Not only do our prosperity and welfare depend on the farming community, but our security depends on the efforts and the success of our farmers.  Therefore, I suggest that the duty of the Government, instead of appealing to the farmers to co-operate with them, is, for once in their lives, to co-operate with the farmers.  In my opinion the Government would be going a long way on the road of national security and national prosperity if they were to adopt the suggestion of Senator Parkinson by restoring to our farmers their fundamental rights, the &ldquo;three F's&rdquo;, which our predecessors fought such a long, weary and exhausting battle to secure for our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit it is relevant in this way: that it would help to restore the credit of our farmers with the banks, and that, therefore, there <Col N="189" /> would be no necessity for a tribunal such as that suggested in the motion. I am speaking against the motion.  I agree with Senator Sir John Keane that the country is already overrun with tribunals and commissions of every kind and description.  This matter could be settled in a very short time by a short Bill such as Senator Parkinson has suggested.  If that were done, the position of our economists, bankers and farmers would be such that, as Senator Sir John Keane has suggested, our farmers would be able to secure rapid and ready credit in a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMacCabe" hpid="Mr. MacCabe Mr. MacCabe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly agree with the remarks made by Senator Johnston in moving the motion.  He stressed the point of frozen loans in the banks.  It is a well known fact that, during the period of the last war, bank managers and the banks were only too anxious to give out money to farmers to buy land.  In fact, they invited the farmers to secure such advances.  At that time the price of land was at its peak point.  Farmers bought land then, and in about a year and a half after it had depreciated in most cases to one-third of its purchase price.  The position, therefore, was that while the land had depreciated in value, the bank claimed that it was due the amount of money it had originally advanced.  Not only did the value of land depreciate, but so did the value of stock, so that the farmer who obtained an advance from a bank to purchase land during the peak period was not able to realise enough on it to meet the interest due on the advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane has made the point that the banks have acted liberally towards farmers and did not penalise those who were not able to meet their liabilities.  That was not my experience.  I was a sufferer myself.  I, with another man, went security for a farmer who obtained an advance from a bank to purchase land, with the result that we had to pay a considerable sum to the bank.  The man who obtained the loan was neither lazy nor dishonest.  He was a hardworking practical farmer.  He was not able to meet his liabilities to the bank because of losses he sustained with <Col N="190" /> cattle and in other ways.  That is only one of many cases.</P>
    <P>On the question of credit for farmers, it is six or eight months ago since I referred in this House to the advantage it would be to farmers if sufficient capital or credit was provided for them to enable them to work their land.  We all know that during the last four or five years the greater part of the land of the country has not been properly stocked, due to the want of capital or credit on the part of farmers.  That has been a serious loss to the State, running into thousands and thousands of pounds, the loss being represented by an insufficiency of stock.  The farmer paid the same amount in rent and taxes, but had not the same return at the end of the year, because neither the capital nor the stock was there.  I say that, even now, if the Government could see their way to devise a scheme whereby honest farmers could get credit at a low rate of interest, it would be of considerable help to them and would be of great advantage to the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene in the debate, but, after listening to Senator Parkinson and Senator Crosbie, I felt that I ought to.  Imagine people at this stage raising the question of going back on legislation passed here in order, in my opinion, to hold up production.  If the farmers of Ireland were to take the advice offered to them by those two Senators, we would torpedo the whole effort to get more food for our people. I submit that this is not the time to encourage the farmers to dwell on the wrongs of the past.  We cannot afford that now.  The enemy is at the gate, and the possibility of hunger and want is immediately in front of us. Consequently, it is our duty to encourage the farmers by every possible means to produce the food essential for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane, representing the capitalists and the banks of the country, seems to dwell in the past also.  He seems to imagine that things are normal and are going to remain normal, when we are told by the Government that it is absolutely impossible, <Col N="191" /> or almost impossible, at present to import essential foodstuffs.  In the face of this, the banks are standing pat for their regular trade and commerce, their regular rates of interest and so on, as if things were quite normal and likely to continue so. Every one here realises that things are not normal and everybody in the country is beginning to realise that things are not normal, that they are going to be much worse in the immediate future and that we have to alter our economic system and plan to meet the new emergency.  Senator Sir John Keane does not seem to realise that, and neither do Senator Crosbie and Senator Parkinson.  They think the time is opportune for the farmer to insist on what he believes to be his rights.  Now is the time, in other words, to remedy the wrongs done him in the past.  This is not the time for the farmer to take the opportunity to strangle the production of the country in order to remedy the wrongs of the past.  This is a time when the farmer should co-operate with the entire community in order to ensure that we shall at least have sustenance while this war continues.  It is with the object of making that point that I enter into this discussion at all.</P>
    <P>I think the motion is timely and one well worthy of the support of the House.  It is one which should certainly appeal to the Minister, so that the farmers may be assisted by every possible means to get cheap money and so that money may be made available for them in order that they may produce the food which is so essential for the people.  I think the Minister ought to take very serious notice of it.  I know nothing about frozen loans. I am not a man of property and, therefore, the banks are not likely to lend me money which may, in time, become frozen.  Senator Sir John Keane made much play with the case of the man who paid his debts in the past, but the man who paid his debts in the past might have been fortunate in his speculations, or in the carrying on of his industry, while his fellow in the same business might have been unfortunate and unable to meet his <Col N="192" /> liabilities.  This is not the time for going back on that kind of argument. The man who did not pay his debts could not pay them, and you cannot get blood out of a turnip.  There is no use in going back on that argument, or in talking about the economic war, or issues of that kind.  The issue is knit now and we want the co-operation of all farmers.  We want the Government and the people to co-operate with the farmers in order that we may get what we hope for, that is, self-sufficiency at least in respect of the foodstuffs essential to the maintenance of the people.</P>
    <P>Senator Parkinson went a little further.  He told us all about the magnificent ores and other assets in the country.  If they are there, we must have been asleep when we were importing from all over the world and failed to realise that around the corner we had all we needed, that we have plenty of phosphates in Clare&mdash; some of us know a little about them&mdash; and that we have all the coal, all the seaweed and all the kelp that we need. He said that three chemists would solve all our problems and that if only these three people could be got together we would not need to worry about fertilisers in the future.  I submit that it is a much more difficult problem than that.  Three chemists coming together are not going to solve our problem, because it is greater than any three chemists can settle for us. Let us get on to a basis of reality; let us deal with the tremendous problem which is immediately in front of us; let us all co-operate; and let no one of us throw in the spanner which will hold up production.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept the motion and put his weight behind the proposal to give the farmers all the encouragement, financial and otherwise, that may be necessary in order to get this increased production which we all hope we can get and which we all believe we can get by co-operation. We shall not get it if the banks are to stand on one side and say: &ldquo;We are owed so much here,&rdquo; and &ldquo;We lost so much there.&rdquo;  If the farmer does not produce food, they will lose much more than their money.  They will lose their <Col N="193" /> lives, along with a great many others in the country, from hunger and starvation. It is a question now of all hands to the ploughs, and anything that can speed the ploughs in the way of finance, help or encouragement, should be given by the Government and by the people generally.</P>

      <P>On a point of personal explanation, I do not know that I said anything which could in any way be taken to mean what Senator Foran says I said.  I said nothing about limiting production, nor did I advise any farmer not to produce all he could.  When I spoke about fertilisers, I spoke about something of which I am absolutely sure, with all due respect to Senator Foran.</P>

      <P>I inferred from what Senator Parkinson said that he could create potash and sulphate of ammonia with very little effort.  If he can do that, and if he can show the powers that be how it is to be done, he will do a very great service to the country, and the discussion of the motion will perhaps not have been altogether in vain.  I agree with the proposer and seconder of the motion that some of the frozen loans are not due to the improvidence or laziness of the farmers, but in many cases to the shortsightedness of the bank managers concerned, but I am not so sure that their method of solving the difficulty is the correct method.  Having heard Senator Sir John Keane putting his side of the case I would be rather inclined to wait and see what developments the immediate future may bring.  I think it would be a good thing if the banks were to wipe out these frozen loans as quickly as possible.  It would be good for the banks; it would be good for the people who hold the loans and it would be good for the community in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Crosbie spoke about the economic war.  He is convinced that war was fought in vain.  He has a lot to learn.  I do not propose to follow him any further, but the opinion of the majority of the people is different from his.  I would ask the Minister, when he is replying, to say what is the position in regard to kerosene, that is, <Col N="194" /> ordinary paraffin oil, which is used in tractors for cultivating the land.</P>

      <P>This question of frozen loans is a very difficult subject.  Of course it might be taken for granted if it was not a difficult subject we would not be talking about it now after 20 years or so. Naturally, the people who had to do with agriculture, whether they were economists, or Ministers, or officials, or farmers themselves, have given a lot of thought to this subject, but apparently no quick or ready method of solving the problem has been found. Sometimes we are inclined to believe with Senator Johnston that the banks were somewhat to blame in the issue of these moneys 20 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I say some of the banks, because they differed considerably in their policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; some of the banks. It may be the banks at the time had a good deal of money on hands and they may have been more willing, as it were, to invest money in land at that time than they would be at another time but, on the other hand, I think where a person accepts a loan from a bank or from anyone else and undertakes to pay it back there is a <i>prima facie</i> obligation on that person to pay, whatever effect subsequent circumstances may have as regards that obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question has been considered on a number of occasions.  Certainly it was considered on many occasions by Departments that were mainly concerned with this question, such as the <Col N="195" /> Department of Agriculture and the Department of Finance, but no ready way of dealing with it was ever found. As a matter of fact, I think the creation of the Agricultural Credit Corporation was considered at the time to be at least one method of dealing with the question of frozen loans and has to some extent solved the question in a number of cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Over 700, which is not bad out of a total of 3,000.  Senator Johnston recommends a judicial commission somewhat on the lines of those set up in other countries, notably in New Zealand.  I do not like the idea of a judicial commission.  When the Banking Commission was set up it did consider this question.  Queries came to me from certain members who, I think, were appointed a sub-committee. I am not sure about that, but at least certain members undertook to investigate this question of the frozen loans and some queries came to me about the subject at the time.  As a result I got whatever advice I could from the officials of the Department, but honestly I could not give any good information. I could give the information, I suppose, to some extent that I was asked for but I certainly could not give advice of any kind to those members towards a solution of the problem. It was impossible, at any rate, to say that every man should pay 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. because, obviously, that would not do.  It would require an investigation of each individual case.  To that extent I agree with Senator Johnston but then, when I come to the individual case, if this judicial commission is set up, and suppose they give an award or, if you like, not even go so far as an award but say what, in their opinion, was a fair settlement without enforcing it, I think there is a good deal in what Sir John Keane says that if the banks are to be treated in that way there is a certain danger that they may be somewhat reluctant to lend money to agriculture again.  I think they would have a certain justification for that because I think every Senator realises that if a thing like that is once <Col N="196" /> done there is a danger of an agitation in five or ten years again, that the then Government, whatever it may be, should do what was done in 1941&mdash;set up a judicial commission and have these debts adjusted.  The banks may justifiably have a fear of such a thing taking place in five or ten years and may, therefore, be very reluctant to lend money at all to agriculture in future if any such thing is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope they will be reluctant to offer money at fancy prices as they did 20 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately they may be reluctant to lend money at all to agriculture.  I think, taking the question on the whole, the 98 per cent. of farmers who are not involved in this frozen loan question have a right to be considered.  I know personally of some cases of frozen loans and I know there is terrible hardship.  I know, as Senator Baxter describes, that there are men who have had to drop their social acquaintances, reduce their standard of living, and descend to the position of being poor farmers from being not only comparatively wealthy farmers in 1920 but thrifty farmers because, as Senator Baxter pointed out, the man with the few hundred or few thousand borrowed the money and put his own money in with what he got from the bank.  I quite admit that that is all true.  But even so we should not, I think, lend ourselves to a solution of a difficult problem of that kind which might make it more difficult for the other 98 per cent. of farmers who may want a temporary loan to expand or to carry on, though again I hope the borrowing will be as low as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is another point.  There have been settlements made in many cases.  We heard some of the cases quoted here where hundreds were paid instead of the thousands that were owed.  The banks accepted that, evidently under the impression that it was as much as the man could reasonably be expected to pay.  There are also hard cases such as that mentioned by Senator MacCabe, where guarantors guaranteed the loan to the farmer which the farmer could not make good and the guarantors were called upon <Col N="197" /> to pay.  I do not think we can help that either.  After all, if a guarantor asks the bank to lend money to a man to buy land, the bank may reasonably contend afterwards&mdash;perhaps not too honestly&mdash;that they would not have granted that loan were it not for the guarantor and were it not for their knowledge of the standing of the guarantor.  If the bank afterwards collected from the guarantor I do not think we could do anything about it. We may deplore it and say it is very hard luck on those men&mdash;it is always hard luck on a man to give a guarantee for his neighbour and lose by it&mdash; but that is the way business is carried on, and we cannot do much about it. I think that any sort of compulsion, as it were, any attempt to make the banks come down to a certain figure, would have undesirable consequences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to misinterpret the Senator.  I know he did not suggest any such thing as a fixed percentage, but I think the idea was that the judicial commission would say: &ldquo;This man owes £4,000 to the bank; we think he should owe, roughly, £800.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that any form of compulsion would, in my opinion any way, have undesirable consequences in regard to agricultural credit in general. I do not think a solution of that kind is desirable, taking all the circumstances into account.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation, as I mentioned already, has dealt with a number of cases&mdash;I believe something like 700&mdash;and, according to an extract which I have here from the Banking Commission Report, that involved loans amounting to £217,000.  The same report also says that 78 per cent. of the frozen loans were due by borrowers of £1,000 and over, but that those made up only 2 per cent. of borrowers in general.  Therefore, a very small percentage of the farmers <Col N="198" /> of this country are involved in this&mdash; the amount is big, it is true&mdash;and that is why I am arguing that we should not let our sympathy run away with us in order to save that very small percentage and perhaps endanger the big majority of the farmers by doing so. The Banking Commission go on to say that they recommend that the matter of frozen loans should be left to the banks.  They thought that some progress had been made by individual settlement, and that the best way to deal with it was to leave it to the banks and to the farmers themselves to make a settlement.  The Banking Commission also bears out somewhat another point made by Senator Sir John Keane.  The report says: &ldquo;A substantial portion of this money is only irrecoverable owing to the abnormal conditions prevailing in the farming industry, and the figure will be modified on any improvement in the agricultural outlook.&rdquo;  That report was drawn up, I think, about 1937.</P>

      <P>In 1938.  That is largely borne out by what Senator Sir John Keane said here&mdash;that loans are now being paid in increasing amounts.  The Banking Commission, therefore, in drawing up their report, had evidently summed up the position rather well when they said that the repayment of loans would increase if conditions were to improve in agriculture.  Senator Baxter referred to the Agricultural Commission.  The sittings of the Agricultural Commission were suspended, along with the sittings of a number of other commissions at the time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There were three or four at least.  I cannot remember them now. That was the only one as far as agriculture is concerned, but there were other Departments which had commissions sitting at the time.  I think that the business which the Agricultural Commission in particular had to deal with was entirely altered when the war came along.  We set up the Agricultural Commission to examine the whole position, and if possible to recommend <Col N="199" /> some sort of long term policy.  That could not be done while the war was on, unless the members of that commission were able to visualise exactly what the position would be when the war was over.  There was, therefore, very little use in carrying on that commission when the war was in progress, and on the whole I think it was better to suspend its sittings until the war is over.  It is possible that they might have considered a question like this, the question of frozen loans, and made some recommendation regarding it. I am very doubtful, however, that they could have made any recommendation other than that made by the Banking Commission or some other suggestion which has already been made.  We were told by Senator Johnston and by Senator Baxter that the farmers of Denmark and New Zealand owe very much more money than do our farmers here.  Senator Johnston has expressed the opinion here in the Seanad on many occasions that it is not an unmixed blessing that our farmers should owe so little, that it might be better if they had more credit and bigger production.  That might be, I think, at certain times, but I believe that when this war is over the less we owe the better.  If the war ends with the relative positions being as they are, that is if the war ends with the New Zealand farmers owing £130,000,000, the Danish farmers owing £200,000,000 and our farmers owing between £15,000,000 and £20,000,000, I think our farmers will have a great advantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, better farming in general.  Senator Baxter talked about the percentage of interest on loans. First of all, I should like to say that we really only drew attention to this scheme for the purchase of implements; <Col N="201" /> the scheme was in being all the time, but we drew attention to it because I found when I was down the country that some farmers did not appear to realise that there was such a scheme in being.  The scheme was always there, and there was always a certain amount of business done under that scheme even before the war. Under the scheme we give loans to farmers for the purchase of implements. Where they themselves put down one-fourth we put down the remainder, and the loan is repayable over a number of years&mdash;usually about three years, or, in some cases, five years; it depends on the size of the loan&mdash;at 5 per cent. interest.</P>
      <P>I cannot say that the interest makes a lot of difference in the case of those small loans.  I know that a pound means a lot to a small farmer, quite a lot, but I think Senator Baxter will agree that perhaps a wet day in May will do a lot more for him than bringing down the interest by £2, or a wet day in August may do a lot more harm than the £2 we are charging.  These things make an enormous difference to the farmer compared to the interest chargeable.  He has no control over the weather, but the things he has control over make all the difference between the £1 or £2 by way of interest.</P>
      <P>Talking of the facilities for credit that we have at the present time, loans for implements are readily available, and they are, perhaps, much more expeditiously given out than Senators would believe.  I looked up cases dealt with last year, and I found that the money was actually posted within five days of the application coming in.  It cannot be said there was delay there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made arrangements <Col N="202" /> to give loans for the purchase of implements, so that any farmer who wants to till land can borrow in order to procure the implements he may need.  You have, in practically every county, schemes for granting loans for seeds and manures.  Apart from that, you have other sources of credit that are always there, and that are there to a greater extent this year than ever they were.  I allude now to the practice of merchants giving credit to farmers for seeds and, I presume, for manures, too, in so far as they can be got.  The farmer who wants to till will not be denied credit facilities so far as I can make out.  The question has been raised in a few places but, strange to say, every speaker who mentioned it said he was not personally aware of any want of credit, but he heard there was a want of it.  I can satisfy any Senator by showing him reports from some of the counties I was in.  I do not think there is as much in this question of want of credit as some people appear to think.</P>
      <P>As Senator Sir John Keane says, there are some people who will not get credit.  What can you do in such cases?  I know there are people who cannot get a reference when they are seeking credit.  If some men go to a county councillor for a loan for seeds and manures, the county councillor may not be prepared to recommend them. A man may go to a merchant seeking credit and the merchant may say: &ldquo;If I give it to him, I will never get it back.&rdquo;  There are some men who cannot get a loan, and what can you do in regard to them?  There is a small minority in the farming community, just as in every trade and occupation.  You cannot provide for everybody and you must leave that small minority alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane said that it was unfair to discriminate between those who paid back frozen loans and those who did not.  That seems to be a very just point, but on examination I think it could be shown, in connection with many forms of business, that there are those people who pay promptly and those who do not pay so promptly, and the latter may sometimes get off better.  That is only <Col N="203" /> human nature, and I do not see anything unusual or unfair about it.  I do not know how the discrimination could be made.</P>
    <P>Senator Parkinson explained to us how easy it would be to get phosphates, potash and nitrogenous manures in this country.  Perhaps it is possible to get them here, but I do not think it would be easy.  I know that phosphates can be got in Clare, but I am told by those who are using them &mdash;the manufacturers&mdash;that the cost per unit would be higher than the cost per unit of phosphates brought in from other countries&mdash;and they are very dear at the present time, as every Senator knows.  We are using them to some extent, and we may have to fall back on them to a greater extent; but it is not such a simple matter as Senator Parkinson would like to make out, to make them suitable for use, nor is it a simple matter from the point of view of price.  It is true, as the Senator indicated, that nitrogenous manure could be made from limestone, anthracite, electricity and air, but I am not sure if it could be made here now; I am not sure that we could get the plant to make it.  The proposition was put up some years ago, and it was under consideration when the war started.  It would involve some sort of undertaking from the Government here that no nitrogenous manures would be imported, and if these things turned out to be higher than anticipated, it would mean a slightly increased price for the farmers for nitrogenous manures in peace time.</P>
    <P>You can get potash from seaweed, but, as far as my investigations go, it would be cheaper for the people to draw in the seaweed and put it on the land.  It would be cheaper to draw it a good many miles into the country, perhaps 30, 40 or 50 miles, and put it on the land rather than have it converted into kelp and have the potash extracted from it on the seashore.  I do not know if it would be economic to get ammonium sulphate from it.  You can get sugar from timber, and clothes from glass, but there is some limit to the economics of these things.  I do not know what the limit of the economics <Col N="204" /> would be to get ammonium sulphate from seaweed.  Senator Crosbie expressed the opinion that, as the Government had been asking the farmers to co-operate with them during the last seven or eight years, we should now co-operate with the farmers.  I suppose we have always endeavoured to co-operate with one another, and we have done so fairly successfully.</P>
    <P>This matter of restoring the three F's to the farmers has come up again. I thought we had disposed of that long ago.  In connection with credit facilities, I do not see how any Senator could make a case for it because, as far as I can learn, when a man has debts to pay and when the Land Commission is likely to take over his land the people pressing the Land Commission most to take the land over are the banks, so that the banks evidently think the Land Commission is a very good vehicle through which to get their money.  If we restore the three F's, the position in relation to the Land Commission may be altered, so there is no use talking at this stage about the three F's.</P>
    <P>I was asked by Senator O'Callaghan to give a few figures and I should like to do so, if the Cathaoirleach has no objection.  The position with regard to kerosene for tractors has been satisfactorily settled by the Minister for Supplies.  He has not made an announcement, but he has notified tractor owners through the suppliers of a decision which will have the effect of giving them a liberal supply of kerosene. I think there will be no further complaint as far as that matter is concerned.</P>
    <P>I cannot estimate what acreage is under cereals at the moment.  The only cereal of any account is winter wheat; there may be a small quantity of oats, but it is almost negligible.  We thought in the Department that if all the winter wheat which was available up to a few weeks ago had been exhausted, we should have at least 300,000 acres sown. Since that more winter wheat has come on the market from another source so that possibly our estimate of 300,000 acres already sown in wheat may be about correct.  I hope it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We had to make a certain allowance for that and we are possibly right in that estimate.  We would want more than that because the proportion of winter wheat to spring wheat in the country in general, as far as I can find out, is about 2 to 1.  If we want 650,000 acres under wheat this year, we should like to see at least 400,000 acres or more under winter wheat in order to get our full acreage of wheat.  I should like to avail of this opportunity also to say that I was reported yesterday as having said that I was satisfied that we had all the wheat we re-required. What I did say was not altogether so optimistic.  I said that I was satisfied that the farmers would answer the call and produce all the wheat we required.  I do not want to create the impression that they have already done so but, from our knowledge of the amount of winter wheat sown up to date, I should say that the chances are that we shall get a good acreage of wheat and that we should be at least near the mark of 100 per cent. of requirements.</P>

      <P>Might I intervene to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that at least in some counties, particularly in the county from which I come, there was a regular ramp by way of increased prices?  I do not know whether that was due to the activities of the Department on the one hand or the accommodation which was offered by my council on the other. We passed a scheme last Saturday to assist farmers in getting the maximum accommodation for the purchase of wheat oats and seed potatoes.  Before the meeting of the council had terminated, it was reported back to us that the price in the city had advanced in the case of wheat to 3/6 a stone, in the case of seed oats to 2/6 a stone, and in the case of seed potatoes to 1/9 a stone.  I immediately raised the matter with the council and I asked that an addendum should be put to the resolution drawing the attention of the Minister to the fact.  Undoubtedly, if that were permitted, it would have very serious reactions on the production of foodstuffs and would tend to <Col N="206" /> dissipate the spirit which has inspired everybody who wishes to see this campaign brought to a successful conclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful to the Senator for raising the point.  There have been some reports of that description but I think in some cases where that was done by some merchants, other merchants who were more sensible, more decent and who took the long view, came along and offered seed wheat at what could be considered a more reasonable price.  That had the result of bringing prices in general down again.  There was somewhat of a panic a few weeks ago&mdash;perhaps it only reached Limerick recently&mdash;and it was thought that seed wheat was running out.  A number of people were making inquiries about seed and were finding it hard to get it.  Since then, we have been able to locate a good deal of wheat that can be used as seed.  I thought that the panic, therefore, had disappeared and that prices would become more normal.  However, I shall have special inquiries made about Limerick as the Senator has raised the matter.</P>

I cannot say that I am surprised at the reception of the motion by the House in general, the Senators who took part in the debate and the Minister.  On the other hand, I have been somewhat intrigued to find the Minister and Senator Sir John Keane expressing the same mid-Victorian sentiments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with reference to financial ethics.  I, too, would approve of an altogether orthodox financial procedure if we were living in a normal world but do the Minister and Senator Sir John Keane realise that we have been faced with a revolutionary situation ever since the last Great War and that consequently procedures and policies which would be quite indefensible if we were living in <Col N="207" /> the peaceful, stable 19th century world, have become the order of the day and are the rule rather than the exception in every country except this one?</P>
      <P>Here, as I tried to point out, the only reason why we have not attempted to deal with the problem of two or three thousand &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; debtors is precisely because the number is only two or three thousand.  At most they command only two or three thousand votes.  Their votes do not matter at election time, and, consequently, they are not of any great interest either to Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil.  If we had 20 or 30 thousand &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; debtors, we would find Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil tumbling over themselves in their efforts to ameliorate the conditions of these people.  Just because they are only a minority, is it creditable to democracy that the Minister should fold his arms and say: &ldquo;After all, it does not matter; it is only a little thing&rdquo;&mdash;the maiden's excuse for her child?  If some people are tempted to try other than democratic methods to call attention to these grievances I think the psychology of their behaviour, though very regrettable, is entirely intelligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite aware that if an adjustment commission proceeds to write down the assets side of a balance sheet by writing off portion of such loans, they are not making any similar reduction on the liability side of the bank's balance sheet.  I need only point out in that connection that when banks of their own free will proceed to write down loans, as they have done in numerous instances, they are not making any reduction on the liability side of their balance sheet either.  In fact, the procedure recommended here would merely regularise a method which the banks have adopted in some instances themselves, but which is not as equitable to their debtors as the procedure which I recommended would have been.  In fact, if a Debt Adjustment Commission had been able to supervise these debt settlements for the last 10 or 15 years, I do not believe the banks would have been any worse off in consequence, and I do believe that the burden of indebtedness would have been distributed as between the <Col N="208" /> different debtors more equitably than it has been because, from my information, the banks have been too much disposed to allow off, perhaps too easily, the debtor from whom they thought they could get nothing and to endeavour to recover their losses from the next debtor who was trying to repay his debts, until they extracted from him everything in the way of working capital that he needed for carrying on his farm, leaving him with nothing but his eyes to weep with.  A Debt Adjustment Commission would have made a more equitable adjustment of the debts and the banks would have been no worse off.  Possibly, under the operations of such a commission, the State would have been willing to undertake part of the burden of the adjustment and some compensation for their losses might have been available to the banks.  However, if they prefer their one-sided methods in making settlements in individual cases, I suppose there is nothing more to be said, but I feel that it is an essentially unjust practice in that it involves the claim that the banks should be, primarily, judges in their own cases and should settle their accounts with each debtor on no principles which are capable of being easily expressed.</P>
    <P>Some play has been made with the difficulty of defining frozen loans.  I offered as a definition&mdash;at all events, as a contribution to a definition&mdash;&ldquo;loans made before 1930, specially for the purpose of buying land, at prices which subsequently proved uneconomically high&rdquo;.  That was the type of loan I specially had in mind.  Some of the banks had very special responsibility for encouraging the issue of such loans 20 years ago and for encouraging the boom in land values that there was at that time.  If such a commission did exist, any farmer who is a victim of a frozen loan could appeal to that commission to have his case investigated. That is the procedure in operation in New Zealand and other countries.  The commission then would look into the matter and see whether, in fact, he had had a raw deal or not.  At present there is a feeling that certain farmers have received a raw deal in their financial settlements, while some of them got off very lightly.  There is a sense <Col N="209" /> of injustice amongst a few hundreds or few thousands of such debtors, and it would be a good thing if there were some responsible body which would give that sense of injustice legitimate and constitutional expression.  I do not think it is good to blanket or drive underground the feelings I have reason to believe exist in some of these cases.</P>
    <P>As for the judicial interference or State interference with the banks, after all, the banks are not merely private institutions functioning with the view to making profit for their shareholders: they are also public institutions exercising functions of the utmost importance for the general welfare of the community and, although they are private in their organisation and ownership, they are in fact public in their responsibilities and functions. It is necessary that this essentially public nature of banking institutions should be emphasised, especially at a time like this when every resource of the State must be mobilised if we are to face a national emergency with all our available powers.  Like everybody else, the banks must regard themselves as part and parcel of a community which must exert itself to the utmost in the common interest, if we are to be saved from the dangers that threaten us.  Therefore, they must not look too narrowly at their financial problems and responsibilities but must take a broad view of them in the present emergency.  And, if they do not take a sufficiently broad view, it is the duty of the Government to give the banks a prod and remind them that in a national emergency of this kind they cannot afford to behave simply as private institutions.</P>
    <P>Finally, I must say that the Minister's general attitude to the function of credit and capital in agriculture is most disappointing.  He wants the farmers to end up this present war period owing as little as possible, and at the same time to extend production as much as possible.  How is a farmer who has got no capital of his own to extend production unless he is put in a position to borrow capital from some outside source?  It is obvious that the best source is that from which so much <Col N="210" /> capital may be borrowed&mdash;the banking system.  Do we want an improved or a better equipped agriculture, or do we not?  If we are prepared to maintain primitive methods of agriculture or to revert to the state of cultivation of 100 years ago, doubtless we could employ considerably more men, but the output per person would be considerably less and the standard of living would decline very much.  If you want increasing output, better agriculture, a better standard of living for those concerned in agricultural production, then there must be more capital.  If that capital is not in the possession of the farmers working the land, that capital must be obtained by borrowing or it will not be obtained at all.</P>

      <P>That, in the opinion of the Seanad:</P>
      <P>(1)  Fundamental constitutional rights ought not to be abrogated more than is necessary for national safety even during war or the threat of war;</P>
      <P>(2)  In particular, the right to express opinion on Government policy and to persuade one's fellow-citizens ought not to be so abrogated as to give excuse for unconstitutional action;</P>

      <P>(a)  disclosure of military secrets;</P>
      <P>(b)  treason, sedition, or incitement to disobey the law;</P>

      <P>On the last occasion that this question of censorship was under discussion, on a motion introduced by Senator Sir John Keane, there were one or two Senators who seemed to think that anybody who criticised the censorship at all was showing a selfish lack of interest in the safety of the country.  I should like to say at once that I am quite sure there is nobody here who is more concerned with the welfare and security of the country than Senator Professor Alton and myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come forward with a motion on the subject of the censorship, it is not because we are forgetful for a single minute of the paramount claims of national security in time of war; but national security is not always obtained by a display of timidity, and is not always obtained by resigning the use of one's own thinking faculties, leaving everything to the Government, and taking for granted that everything they do is right.  National security is not even necessarily identical with neutrality.  A departure from neutrality may sometimes be a way to national security and not a way from it; but, aside from that, it is by no means certain that the strictest censorship is also the sort of censorship that is working in favour of national security.  As a matter of fact, the record of censorship in this war&mdash;censorship in general in this war&mdash;from the point of view of national security is an extraordinarily poor one.  Its performances have been negative or actually worse than negative in the various <Col N="213" /> countries on the Continent that have been overrun.  I remember, about a year ago, when the Minister for Finance was addressing a dinner of the Institute of Journalists in this country, he took a rise out of his audience by reading aloud a list of censorship rules that were so stringent that his audience gasped for breath, and then it turned out that they were not the censorship rules obtaining in this country, but the rules that prevailed in Holland.  Well, did they save Holland? The question answers itself. Accordingly, I would ask Senators not to be too prejudiced in their minds when some of us come forward, inspired, I assure you, Sir, with a genuine sense of duty, and not from a love of filibustering, to raise a question that seems to us of great importance.</P>
    <P>Only a few days ago the Minister for Supplies expressed the view that there were numbers of people in this country who talked and acted as if the war were taking place on another planet.  I am afraid that is true.  In spite of all the recruiting and of the splendid work that is being done for national defence in various fields, I am afraid it is true that there is a tremendous lack of realism, on all sorts of vital questions connected with the war, quite prevalent in this country, and I feel that, for that, the Minister for Supplies may, in large measure, thank his colleague, the Minister for Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures, whose appetite for the suppression of news and opinions seems to grow every day.</P>
    <P>I believe it was an Irish orator, John Philpot Curran, who said&mdash;what has become a platitude&mdash;that eternal vigilance was the price of liberty.  That duty of vigilance in the cause of liberty does not cease even in war time, even though I fully admit that the liberties of the individual in war time must yield to the paramount necessity of securing the honour and the interests of the State.  Now, it is that vigilance in the cause of liberty that I invite the Seanad to display when this question is discussed.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of argument in our days for and against democracy. That is an issue that does not very <Col N="214" /> much appeal to me, when put quite in that form, as a subject for discussion, but what does appeal to me is to distinguish clearly in our minds between the sort of government and constitution that are worthy of free men and the sort that are not, and if I were to lay my finger on one thing more than another that distinguishes the sort of government and constitution that are worthy of free men, it is that citizens should be governed by the rule of law and not by arbitrary power.  Now, nothing was ever more arbitrary than is the censorship in this country at the present time&mdash;nothing more arbitrary, nothing more secret.  Those who fall under the lash of the censor are unable to disclose their wrongs to the general public, if they are wrongs.  They are unable to disclose them.  Secrecy is imposed upon them, secrecy is the condition in which the censorship works, and, as I said on the last time that we discussed one aspect of this subject, I do not believe that the general public at all realises how widespread and severe are the Minister's activities.</P>
    <P>In this motion we have attempted, perhaps, a rather ambitious thing.  We have attempted to lay down a code of principles that should direct the operations of the censorship.  Now, we claim no infallibility or perfection for the particular rules we have suggested.  I had had some faint hope&mdash;I admit only a faint hope&mdash;that the Government might propose a constructive amendment that would have made such alterations as they thought necessary, but they have not done so, and they have not done so, I am afraid, because any sort of restraints in this matter are unpalatable to the Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I put down the best that I could and, as I say, they are open to improvement from other quarters.  I make no claim to infallibility.  In the debate of the 4th December last year&mdash;Senator Sir John <Col N="215" /> Keane's motion&mdash;the Minister said: &ldquo;There is no person in this world who has an unlimited right to do whatever he himself thinks.&rdquo;  On which I asked: &ldquo;Not even a censor?&rdquo;  To which the Minister replied: &ldquo;Not even a censor. The censor is governed by law and by commonsense.&rdquo;  Now, there is not much meaning in saying that the censor is governed by law, because the law, in fact, has given him a free hand, and whether he is governed by commonsense is a question of fact upon which we differ.  I think the Minister is in a considerable minority in this country, among those who are brought into touch with the operations of the censorship, in holding that the censor's decisions are, in fact, governed by commonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, in that debate, he drew a picture of the relations between his Department and the newspapers, which was rather idyllic and rather misleading.  I myself said that, as regards courtesy and intelligence, there was everything good to be said about his staff.  It is the rules and regulations and policy at the top of which I complain, but when the Minister said, as he did say: &ldquo;The censorship staff and the newspapers get on very well indeed, and we have found that on the whole the newspapers are co-operating with the censorship staff to see that nothing gets into the papers that is either going to create internal trouble or trouble between ourselves and other countries,&rdquo; he was giving a rather misleading picture of the situation. Actually, I believe that every editor in the country of every sort of paper, with the exception of the <i>Irish Press</i>, which is a Government organ and has never uttered a whisper of dissent from anything the Government has ever done since it came into power and never will dissent from anything that the Government ever does if it stays in power for a hundred years&mdash;with that exception I think that the editors and staffs of newspapers in this country are reduced to a state of blasphemous irritation whenever the subject of censorship is discussed.  There are four daily papers.  We have mentioned the <i>Irish Press</i>, but the other <Col N="216" /> three, the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, the <i>Irish Times</i>, and the <i>Irish Independent</i>, are all, unless I am much mistaken, extremely dissatisfied with the censorship.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Times</i> published a leading article attacking the censorship the day Senator Sir John Keane's motion came on for discussion. The <i>Irish Independent</i> attempted to publish an article on the censorship one day last week, when it was expected to come up for discussion here.  They did not succeed, but the article has fallen into my hands, not, I may say, direct from the <i>Irish Independent</i> itself.  Perhaps it would be interesting to everybody to hear what they had to say.  I do not propose to read the whole of the article but I will read extracts.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We accepted the censorship on the outbreak of the war; we were, and always have been, extremely desirous of co-operating with the Government in exercising the censorship towards the end&mdash;the only end and object which has been, or could be, justified&mdash;that this State might preserve its neutrality.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I may say, in parenthesis, that I do not agree with them in that account of its object.  If the paper stated that it was to safeguard national security I would agree.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We assumed, as we had a right to assume, that the censorship would be reasonable, intelligent, competent and impartial.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The censorship has shown none of these qualities.  Its powers have on many occasions been exercised in a manner which could not be defended on any reasonable basis; decisions have frequently been made which, in our view, were devoid of any intelligent explanation.  The censorship has shown its incompetence by a lack of the most elementary knowledge of the workings of newspapers, by disregard for the convenience of newspapers and their readers, and by the issuing of contradictory orders.  The censorship has failed to be impartial in that it has on several occasions prohibited the <i>Irish Independent</i><Col N="217" /> from publishing news which other Dublin newspapers were permitted to publish.  The censorship has exceeded its powers by issuing orders which it had, and has, no authority to issue.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These are, in general outline, our complaints against the censorship as we have experienced it for more than 16 months.  We are prepared to support by specific instances every charge which we have briefly summarised above.  We are prepared to place that evidence before any impartial tribunal appointed to inquire into this subject.  What has been the experience of other newspapers we cannot tell.  We are concerned here only with what we know ourselves. We suggest that those members of the Seanad who are jealous to preserve fundamental public rights and to curb the arrogance and incompetence of bureaucracy should demand an immediate inquiry.  If the Government refuses to grant it the public will know the reason.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The feeling of the <i>Cork Examiner</i> was, I think, expressed on Senator Sir John Keane's motion by Senator Crosbie in person, so I do not need to read anything from that newspaper.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion when talking about the censorship I expressed the view that there ought to be a parliamentary committee set up, which would periodically review the operations of the censorship.  It would not have executive powers, but the Minister would be to some degree controlled in what he did by the knowledge that he might have to explain it to a parliamentary committee.  I have not by any means abandoned my belief in the value of that proposal since then; it fits in with what is suggested in the leading article I read in the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  I think even if the principles for guidance of the censor proposed in the motion were adopted, he would need the addition of the committee I propose, to review from time to time his operations, to see whether he was, in fact, consciously or unconsciously straying from the principles laid down by Parliament.  Even if it were decided that no principles could <Col N="218" /> be provided at all and that the power must be left to him without anything to guide him but common sense, then I think the committee would be of value in order to ensure that common sense played the part that it ought to play in his decisions.  In framing this motion we did not want to cover too wide a field or to embark on a very broad and confused discussion, and so we limited ourselves to an attempt to lay down principles for the guidance of the Minister, and possibly the House may have the happiness on some future occasion of discussing the question of the committee.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that really there has been no change, that newspapers have always been subjected to censorship: the only thing is that instead of being censored by their editors they are now censored by him, and that that is more satisfactory, as he is responsible to the Irish people while the editors are not.  There are two answers to that.  One is that the editors have considerably more experience than the Minister in this particular matter.  The other is that if there were only one newspaper existing in the country it might be unsatisfactory to have it edited by a private person, but that that argument does not apply when there are a number of newspapers, holding different views. If the editor of one paper was tempted to shut out items of news that did not coincide with what he liked, he would soon find that those items were appearing elsewhere, and when the public found by degrees that they were being defrauded in their news, they would abandon his newspaper for others that presented the news more fully and more impartially.</P>
    <P>What are the Minister's special qualifications to undertake the editing of the newspapers of the country?  I have never been a harsh critic of the Minister.  I have never had any virulent differences with him either in this House or in the other House but I must candidly say that I think a great many people in both Houses have shown more detachment, moderation, tact and other qualifications that are desirable than he has.  He made one remark the other day for which he <Col N="219" /> has been so much belaboured that I do not really wish to belabour him any more.  In the Dáil, when talking about supplies, he made a remark to the effect that even if every damn ship was sunk, we had the means so that we could improve our standard of living enormously in the course of two years.</P>

      <P>I do not want to take up the time of the House with the enormous number of instances that I have, but I am obliged to mention some of them.  I may be accused of trifling with the subject if I do not mention some, so I will go over a few.  An obvious one is the one mentioned on Senator Sir John Keane's motion, concerning the attempted publication by the <i>Irish Times</i> of a picture of a public meeting outside the Bank of Ireland and the suppression of that picture because there was visible on it a pediment with the lion and the unicorn. The Minister made a most unconvincing defence of that, and nobody who looked at the picture reproduced the following day, with the lion and the unicorn wiped out, could doubt that it was <Col N="220" /> taken at an obviously natural angle and there was not the slightest indication of any <i>malice prepense</i> in having the lion and the unicorn included.</P>
      <P>This morning Mr. Willkie was censored. Mr. Willkie was so full of what, I suppose, the Minister calls &ldquo;flap-doodle and propaganda&rdquo; that he made some comments on the bombing of St. Paul's in London; but I understand the Irish newspapers were forbidden to reproduce those remarks.</P>
      <P>Cardinal Hinsley is, of course, a constant subject for censorship.  Of his broadcast of about a week ago, which I dare say many of us heard, no Irish newspaper was allowed to print a word. Again, I suppose, &ldquo;propaganda and flapdoodle&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the words the Minister used in the last debate as being the sort of thing that he suppressed. I do not exactly know what the word &ldquo;flapdoodle&rdquo; means, but if he has not suppressed Cardinal Hinsley on the score of being a propagandist, I cannot imagine what score he has suppressed him on.</P>
      <P>Mr. MacEntee, Minister for Finance, was so propagandist as to suggest some months ago that there was a danger, the way things were going, that we might find ourselves at the end of the war without any friends.  That remark of his the newspapers were forbidden to publish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A short time ago somebody attempted to put an advertisement in our newspapers for a particular medical product. The advertisement included the sentence: &ldquo;War-time strain tells on even the healthiest chest and lungs.&rdquo; That would seem to be a rather harmless thing to say, but, apparently, it was thought to be dangerous to put in an Irish newspaper, as suggesting, I <Col N="221" /> suppose, that we were or might be at war.  But, in view of the fact that we are constantly being told to consider ourselves in as much of a crisis as if we were actually at war, one would have thought that medicine would be allowed to be advertised in those terms.</P>
    <P>Here is another remark which the Irish newspapers were forbidden to publish: &ldquo;Either Graziani is a very bad general, or he must have been pushed into an unwise action by the Fascist Party.&rdquo;  Can anyone tell me why that should not be published?</P>
    <P>There was a letter in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> yesterday morning, arriving in Ireland this morning, from Sir Hubert Gough, Mr. Maurice Healy, and Mr. Henry Harrison.  Mr. Henry Harrison has been for years a sort of white-headed boy with the Government.  He has defended all their policies, including the economic war policy, and he has been a most ardent advocate of Irish unity and has put the case in various books and articles as blackly against the British Government as anyone has ever put it.  In spite of the fact that he was one of the signatories of the letter, no Irish newspaper was permitted to publish it.  Here it is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We believe that virtually all Irishmen and Anglo-Irishmen resident in this country most earnestly desire that Ireland should be ranged actively on the side of the Commonwealth, and that this should be brought about whilst she is still in a position to render extremely valuable aid to the common cause.  We also believe that this desire is founded on the conviction that Ireland's relinquishment of her neutrality could be made to be not less for her own advantage and safety than for those of Britain and of the Commonwealth, and that Ireland's past and present idealisms must necessarily predispose her towards collaboration with those who are fighting in defence of Christian ethics.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We, from our several standpoints are entirely at one with these views, but it is idle to ignore the difficulties&mdash;or the fact that there are difficulties of which the general public are quite insufficiently informed. Such obstacles as exist will <Col N="222" /> only yield to skilled and tactful treatment.  Mere exhortation or censure addressed to Dublin by the uninstructed are more likely to hinder than to help the solution of the deadlock.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The principal remaining hope, as it appears to us, is that Dominion statesmanship&mdash;by no means for the first time in this generation&mdash;may make its good offices available for a supreme effort to effect an accommodation. The situation has been changing from half-year to half-year, and the occasion is now fully ripe for the aid of a judicious intermediary. One factor of notable weight is the existence of very large Irish and Anglo-Irish populations resident in Britain, in the Commonwealth, in America and elsewhere which look to Dublin as their metropolis and which will not be content that their views and interests should be excluded from all influence on the final decision.  We are confident that skilled handling may prove successful, but the initiative must necessarily lie with the British Government here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to say why that was not allowed to be published.</P>
    <P>A week or ten days ago the Cork Committee of Agriculture passed a resolution, or issued a statement, to the effect that they proposed to ask for a subsidy of £2 per acre for ploughing grass lands, and that the price of wheat should be increased to 50/- per barrel.  I say nothing about the soundness of those views of the Cork Committee of Agriculture, but I should like to know by what right, or for what reason of national interest, the Minister refused to allow that to appear in the newspapers.</P>
    <P>I attended about a week ago a cinema performance in which there was a news reel of the bombs in the South Circular Road.  The commentary started by saying that the bomb or bombs had been dropped from an unidentified aircraft.  The damage done was shown, and the commentary as originally written had gone on to say, what the Government had officially stated before that, that the fragments of the bombs on examination had <Col N="223" /> shown that the bombs were of German origin.  The commentator in the cinema was not allowed to mention that fact. Can anyone tell me where is the common sense in that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>The plane was not identified.  It was correctly stated that the plane itself was unidentified.</P>
      <P>Another case that occurs to my mind is that of the Lord Mayor of Dublin. The Lord Mayor of Dublin, on the day when Messrs.  McGrath and Hart were executed for the murder of police detectives, thought fit to hang the city flag at half mast.  I personally think that is a fact which the public ought to be allowed to know.  After all, the Lord Mayor has to go up for election again&mdash;I am not sure that she has not actually gone up for election since that. But it seems to me that that is an attitude taken by the head of the municipal government of Dublin towards the action of the Government, which is quite intolerable, and of which some official notice should have been taken.  But the fact was that nobody was allowed to mention it.  Mrs. Clarke has since distinguished herself by saying such tactful things as that, if the Red Cross is going to be of any use to the English, or words to that effect, she, of course, would not touch it with a barge pole.  I do not believe that truth should be smothered unless the case for smothering it is quite overwhelming, because I think the nation that is forced to run with blinkers over its eyes is in a very vulnerable position. It certainly has the right to know the doings of the people whom it has put in public positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, there was the play mentioned in the last discussion on censorship, &ldquo;Roly-Poly&rdquo;, which was suppressed at the Gate Theatre.  I did not see it, and it is quite possible that it was right to suppress it, but, when we come to consider the question of consistency and of fair play all round, I wonder whether there was not just as much propagandist atmosphere about <Col N="224" /> another play which has recently been running at the Abbey Theatre called, I think, &ldquo;Trial at Green Street Courthouse&rdquo;. I wonder whether the British authorities would not have had just as much reason for objecting to that in these critical times as the French and German authorities had for objecting to the other play?</P>
    <P>I have found similar inconsistencies in other directions.  Take, for example, the treatment of contributors to a paper called <i>The Standard.</i>  A distinguished writer on <i>The Standard</i> was forbidden to quote words from the Bishop of Waterford's pastoral some little time ago condemning the deeds of illegal organisations in strong terms, but that same newspaper was allowed&mdash;or at any rate it was not in any way punished or interfered with&mdash; to display all over Dublin a poster some months ago which to the casual reader&mdash;in fact, to every reader&mdash; strongly implied that Irish Catholic girls were being conscripted for immoral purposes by the British Army. But when you bought the newspaper and read that particular item, you found that that was a grossly misleading description of what they were writing about.  What they were writing about was the economic necessity of Catholic girls in Northern Ireland having to go to look for work in England. They sometimes had to take positions that were of assistance to the British war effort, but there was no suggestion of immorality about it at all.  Yet you had a poster saying: &ldquo;Irish Catholic Girls Forced to Follow the British Army.&rdquo;  Similarly, there is&mdash;this is not a matter of offending any external Power: it is a matter of internal peace and good feeling&mdash;an advertisement which I have seen appear every week for a considerable time in the same paper, <i>The Standard</i>, referring to an appeal for funds for organisations to prevent the proselytising of Catholics by Protestants. Now, it is no doubt a very proper thing for a Catholic to contribute to, but is it necessary, in appealing for such a purpose, to allege what I believe to be false, what I believe to be a libel, that Irish Protestants are carrying on a vile traffic? That, as I say, has been appearing <Col N="225" /> in that paper.  If we are going to give the censor every sort of power to keep down the temperature and to prevent offensive things being said, then I think that sort of thing ought not to be allowed to be said, especially when a writer in the same newspaper is prohibited from quoting from a pastoral from the Bishop of Waterford which says something which apparently was considered unduly harsh about members of unlawful organisations.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not think it is necessary for me to extend the list beyond that. The Minister has even censored himself. I knew he would censor himself. Otherwise I would not have put the paragraph in.  I may say that in an article I did a week ago, I began by putting the paragraph in the most prominent position so that it could not escape the eye of the censor or slip through unnoticed.  Otherwise I would not have bothered to put it there.  I did not want to get it published at all, but simply to have the amusement of catching the Minister out. I quoted him absolutely verbatim from the Parliamentary Report.  I said that the concluding stage of the debate on supplies in the other House had been enlivened by the following remark by the Minister in charge of censorship. I quoted it verbatim from the Parliamentary Report, and merely added that &ldquo;the tact and economic soundness of his observation had been the subject of general comment.&rdquo;  I need hardly say that the paragraph was not allowed to go, and the actual reason given to me as to why it was not allowed to go was that I had misquoted him.  I did not misquote him. It was a word for word quotation from the Parliamentary Report.</P>
    <P>So much then for illustrations, which could be multiplied indefinitely, of the commonsense and fairness with which these decisions are made in the case of newspapers.  The Minister has put down no amendment to this motion, but one amendment has been put down in the name of Senator MacFhionnlaoich. One part of the Senator's amendment is particularly remarkable for this: that it proposes to prohibit &ldquo;lying propaganda&rdquo; against the Irish language.  Heaven knows if we had <Col N="226" /> some infallible authority&mdash;I am afraid I should not regard the Minister as being an infallible authority&mdash;but if we had some infallible authority who could always distinguish between what was lying and what was not, I would be ready to cut out everything that was lying on every subject.  I would also go further than Senator Mac Fhionnlaoich.  If one is going to cut out lying propaganda against the Irish language and knows how to do it, I should not stop short of cutting out lying propaganda in favour of the Irish language, but it is possible that he considers all propaganda against the Irish language is, by definition, lying, and all propaganda in its favour is of necessity true.  Sometimes, I cannot help wondering whether this &ldquo;for and against&rdquo; business is not rather deceptive anyhow.  I am not at all sure, could we imagine the Irish language personified in a sort of Cathleen Ní Houlihán walking into this Assembly, whether her smiles would fall on Senator Mac Fhionnlaoich and those who think like him, or whether they might not unexpectedly be bestowed in some other direction.</P>

However, that is by the way.  The Irish language amendment is interesting and significant, because it can hardly be supposed, I think, that Senator Mac Fhionnlaoich wishes to limit its effect to war time.  There is no special appropriateness in defending the Irish language against propaganda in war time. I imagine that the Senator has been so seduced from the principles of democracy&mdash;possibly by the spectacle of the arbitrary proceedings of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, or, possibly, it comes natural to him&mdash;that he would gladly see everybody in this country prohibited for all time from questioning the wisdom of the measures he thinks proper to make Irish the universal spoken language of <Col N="227" /> the country.  But the amendment has other parts.  He also proposes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>If you object to it, Sir, I need not refer at all to the specific amendment because I have to deal, in any case, with the issues which the amendment raises.  The Minister himself had a great deal to say on the last occasion on the subject of propaganda. Now, what does all this talk of propaganda come to?  Propaganda has apparently become a term of abuse which we apply to the arguments of our opponents, but not to our own arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know no way of making a distinction between what is propaganda and what is argument&mdash;they are one and the same thing&mdash;except that perhaps arguments become propaganda if they are sufficiently long and earnestly pursued, if they develop into a sort of missionary effort.  That is what the original word &ldquo;propaganda&rdquo; meant.  It came from the Roman College for the Propagation of the Faith.  It was there that the word &ldquo;propaganda&rdquo; originated, and there is nothing in the word that is, in itself, abusive.  It has only become abusive because people have got into the habit in recent years of referring to propaganda in terms of horror and contempt, but actually Senator McGinley, for example, has been a propagandist all his life, and it is nothing against him.  Perhaps many <Col N="228" /> of us have been propagandists for all sorts of things and there is no reason, because we are capable of being called propagandists, why we should be denied freedom of speech or denied the privilege of being reported in the newspapers.  Of course, if it were a question of some organisation financed from abroad for the purpose of distributing particular doctrines or news items in this country, I can understand that the Government might be justified in taking action against such organisations, but that does not arise in this case.</P>
    <P>The question is: is there any reason why the individual private citizen in this country should not express&mdash; always keeping within the terms of reasonable moderation which we agreed on when we were last speaking of this matter in the Seanad and which are provided for in this motion&mdash;moral judgments about one or other of the belligerents?  The Minister talks about the private citizen having no right to embroil the country in war.  He is not going to do so.  The private citizen has no power to embroil the country in war.  After all, the Dáil which has the right to declare war is elected by private citizens, and if private citizens in electing them, or in instructing them after their election, are to be prohibited from expressing their opinions on a subject of vital importance on the ground that to do so in war time is to run the risk of embroiling the country, it makes the actions of the Dáil a farce, artificial and representative of nothing.  I maintain that we should be free, within reason, to express moral judgments upon the participants in the present European war or any other European war.</P>
    <P>In point of fact, such judgments are now suppressed.  About the last of them was, I think, that made in a moment of what was regarded, I suppose, by the Minister for the Co-Ordination of Defensive Measures as great indiscretion by the Taoiseach, last May, when Holland and Belgium were overrun, and he said great injustice had been done by that invasion. But nothing of the sort has occurred since, and we are reduced by the <Col N="229" /> censorship to a state of moral nihilism about international issues in this country to which I do not think we ought to be reduced and which I think is profoundly harmful to both the material and spiritual wellbeing of the people.</P>
    <P>Again, I see no reason why we should be debarred from expressing opinions as to the desirability or otherwise of Irish neutrality.  Senator McGinley thinks that we ought to be free to propagand as much as we like in favour of Irish neutrality, and, in fact, we are so free, and propaganda is going on every day in favour of Irish neutrality. Articles are written; speeches are made; and hundreds of people are praising Irish neutrality; but nobody is allowed to utter a single word of criticism of it, or a single word of doubt about it, and then we boast of the national unity on the subject which is obtained by means so artificial as that. The unity would be impressive if those who were inclined to criticise neutrality were allowed to speak their minds, but when they are not allowed to speak their minds, the unity is very far from being impressive.</P>
    <P>Compare what happens across the Irish Sea.  Quite a short time ago there was a debate in the British House of Commons as to whether or not steps should be taken to give up the struggle and to procure an immediate peace, and I have here before me a copy of a leading article on the subject which appeared, not in an English paper, but in the <i>New York Times.</i>  I propose to read a part of it.  It reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Democracy gave a truly thrilling exhibition in the British House of Commons yesterday.  In the very heart of an Empire that is battling for its survival, in a country whose leaders and people have vowed that they would die rather than surrender, three pacifist Members of Parliament brought forward a motion calling for immediate peace in a spirit of compromise. They were not beheaded for high treason.  They were not flung into a concentration camp....  They were able to argue their case freely and their speeches were reported in the newspapers, because they were <Col N="230" /> simply exercising their rights as the elected representatives of free men. The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Attlee, replied to them, and the House then voted by 341 to 4 against the motion.  That was all.  The four who wanted peace will be back in the House to-morrow, taking part in debates on the conduct of the war.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What now becomes of the fatuous idea that British democracy is dead or dying?  Can any free country do better than this to prove that its freedom still lives?  The British Parliament, it is true, has entrusted the Government with immense wartime powers affecting the life and property of every British subject. Yet the immemorial liberties still remain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the same way Mr. Willkie commented&mdash;and the comment, I think, was allowed to appear in the Irish newspapers&mdash;on the fact that Parliament was free to debate the subject of the suppression of the <i>Daily Worker</i> and had so debated it in his presence.  Now, when that is possible in a country at war, in a country where it is so essential that the efforts of all the citizens should be kept at high tension in order to win that war, do we really have to go to the extremes to which we are going and, in doing so, is it a question of our being merely overcautious? Are not we actually running into dangers that we need not run into? It is really very irritating when we know that some of us do believe that neutrality is not a safe policy, but a dangerous policy, and that we would be securer against invasion if we were not neutral it is very irritating to us, who do really keep quieter than we might. to have a Deputy, such as Deputy Mullen, the other day, telling his constituents that every single Deputy in the Dáil and every single Senator in the Seanad believed that neutrality was the right policy.</P>
    <P>I do not believe for a minute that Deputy Mullen told a deliberate lie. He said that because the operation of the censorship has been so effective that it is generally believed.  The people at large are taught to think <Col N="231" /> that there is no reason for them to exercise their minds on the subject, that there is such complete unanimity it would be absurd for any of them to be so officious and so audacious as to think within himself whether neutrality had been the right policy at the beginning, whether it had continued to be the right policy ever since and whether it must necessarily continue to be the right policy to the very end.</P>
    <P>We never had any formal debates on neutrality either in this House or in the other.  Even if we had had, and even if the decision of neutrality had been reached by a formal vote, no policy of that sort is eternal.  Things may happen to change your views; things may happen that change the interests of the country; and I think it is highly unhealthy that, no matter what happens, everybody should be debarred from expressing his views in any effective way, from expressing his views, so as they will get into print and be read by a considerable number of his fellow-citizens, on the subject of what Irish interests demand in the tremendous crisis through which the world is going.</P>
    <P>The other day the Minister for Supplies talked about the terrific dangers that face us, and it was very plain indeed from what he said and from his allusions to last September what he thought the greatest danger was.  He thought the greatest danger was that if there was a German attempt to invade Great Britain we should not be omitted and that a German force would try to land here, too, whether merely by way of a diversion of British effort or, perhaps, in case of failure in the attack on England, that some lodgment might be obtained in this country which would give the Germans something to show their people as having been accomplished. The question is whether by keeping up, as we have done, the traditional attitude of aloofness, verging upon hostility, to Great Britain we have not so conducted ourselves as to make the necessary co-operation that we should <Col N="232" /> be then driven to, far more difficult to accomplish smoothly, and to reconcile our own people to than need have been the case.</P>
    <P>We have carried to extraordinary extremes this business of suggesting that there is no moral difference between the belligerents.  It is not merely that we are not allowed to make speeches saying one is more wicked or more virtuous than the other, but we do allow speeches to be made and speeches are made and appear in the newspapers which strongly suggest that there is no moral difference between them.  Some of these speeches here come from ecclesiastical quarters, to my deep regret, and others have come from politicians and, although it is some time ago, I think it should be mentioned that the Taoiseach himself made what I regarded as an extraordinarily unfortunate statement, back in May, to the effect that either participant in the European war would attack us without a moment's hesitation if it suited his own interests to do so.  Now, when this agitation, this unfortunate agitation, about the ports started in Great Britain, we were forced to appeal, and we have appealed&mdash;the Taoiseach himself has appealed eloquently&mdash;to the very moral considerations which he had already informed the world at large the British, no more than the Germans, had any use for or paid any attention to.  It seems to me a great mistake that our own people should be misled in that way.  Even the Minister for Supplies, who speaks more realistically about this war than most of his colleagues and most people in this country, talks about Ireland being blockaded in a way that seems to imply that she is equally blockaded by all the belligerents.  What are the facts?  The facts are that it is by the goodwill of the British Government, by the bravery of the British mercantile marine, by the protection the British convoys have been able to give, that we have been getting all our overseas supplies practically since this war started.  It is by the goodwill of the British that we have been arming ourselves, so far as we have armed ourselves. Even in buying arms in America we have had the assistance of <Col N="233" /> the British Ambassador there.  We have been taught to believe that it is quite as likely that the British would commit an act of aggression against us as anybody else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>But for the British we would have no arms to speak of with which to resist that act of aggression if it were committed.  Surely the thing does not make sense.  I suppose anything may happen in war.  By some extraordinary piece of folly or desperation, it may occur some day&mdash;I hope to heavens it does not&mdash;that the British may attack our ports&mdash;I think it is in the highest degree unlikely&mdash;but I do know this, that whatever resistance we are able to put up to that or any other act of aggression, we will be able to put up that resistance because the British have allowed the arms to come in.  That is a thing the people of the country do not realise and that I think they ought to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not merely our physical neutrality that I personally disapprove of&mdash;and this motion is not about neutrality so much as about the right to talk about neutrality&mdash;but what the censorship has produced in particular that I resent is this sort of moral neutrality.  We talk of our own unity, which, as I have said, is, to a large degree, artificial, but in obtaining that we have cut ourselves off from the entire Irish world elsewhere.  The Irish in Australia, the Irish in Canada, even the Irish in America, feel very different about this whole question from ourselves and they do not feel that the belligerents are all on the same plane.  In some of the speeches that we deliver about this war and the issues at stake they find a note that they are quite unaccustomed to find in Irish speeches, and that we have been much more accustomed to find in English speeches in the past, and that is a certain pharisaical note.  We are too much inclined to attribute it to some moral superiority of our own that we are not involved in this war, and we walk along turning our eyes away&mdash; like the pharisee turned his eyes away from the other side of the road&mdash;from <Col N="234" /> the iniquities that have been committed in various parts of Europe.  I think it is a great mistake to insist that all note of criticism or condemnation of manifestly unjust and cruel oppression should be absent from our speeches and should be absent from our newspapers.  I think it is doing us a great wrong throughout the whole of the civilised world and the whole of the free world.</P>
    <P>The only sort of Irish unity that is worth having is that founded not on artificiality but on truth, and that does not lead us widely afield not only from our own material interests but from the ideals which we have always asserted to be dear to us.  It seems to me that, even on the material side, our people should have been brought to realise much more than they have the extent to which our prosperity is bound up with the prosperity of Great Britain, and the appalling poverty that is likely to result here if Great Britain is defeated in this war.  I say that, not as an argument that this country should enter the war, but as an argument that the people of this country should hold a far more sympathetic attitude than they hold at present towards Great Britain and Greece and the countries of the British Commonwealth.</P>

Annsin, moltar dúinn sompla Shasain, an rud a deantar i Sasain do chur annseo mar dheaghshompla agus ghlacfadh an Seanadóir Mac Diarmada leis sin.  Ní raibh mé ró-shásta riamh agus ní bheidh mé chóiche glacadh le somplaí a gheibhmíd ó Shasana.  Deir sé gur ceart dúinn cead bheith againn ceist neodrachta na tíre do scannsáil ós árd. Ní dóigh liom gur ceart.</P>

Cur i gcás i Sasana féin nuair a ceaptar polasaí&mdash;polasaí troda in aghaidh na Gearmáine&mdash;níl cead ag na páipéirí cur in aghaidh an pholasaí sin.  Chonaic mé sompla de pháipéar do rinne cur in aghaidh mar sin agus do briseadh é.  Ní raibh siad sásta agus bhris siad an páipéar ar fad.

He blew in here from some part of the world, not having studied or known anything about Irish history in more recent years, and it is very unwise of him to project himself into certain aspects of Irish life without having some more intimate or personal knowledge of what happened here in the recent past.  Senator Mac Fhionnlaoich, in very restrained language, replied and showed what would be the reaction to some of the proposals that Senator MacDermot thinks would be received and debated peacefully throughout the country.</P>
      <P>We in this State decided at the beginning of the war that the Government should have the power of censorship. That was made the law of the land in the Emergency Powers Act of 1939.  It does not matter what they do in England, in Germany, in Italy, in Greece or in America.  The fact of the matter is that the Dáil and Seanad unanimously passed the Emergency Powers Act and in that Act they gave powers to the Government to impose a censorship.  They did that because in their wisdom and to the best of their judgment they considered it was necessary, in the war that was then upon Europe, that our Government should have those powers for use in time of neutrality or in time of war.  To emphasise the fact that it was the deliberate judgment of the Dáil and Seanad that these powers should be operated in a time of neutrality, I have only to point to the fact that the Consitution was changed in order to make sure that no narrow legalistic mind would interpret &ldquo;in time of war&rdquo; in the Constitution as not also being a time of neutrality in a war in which certain countries in Europe were engaged and in which we were neutral. Therefore, the power of censorship was deliberately given to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The censor acts here under the law of the land and it does not matter what they do in other countries.  They look after their own interests.  We here have to decide our method of approach to the existing situation and to decide what is best for ourselves and <Col N="239" /> we are not going to be guided by what they do in other countries.  Senator MacDermot opened up with a statement which, if followed, would lead to a prolonged and bitter debate, not only here but throughout the country.  That statement was that national security is not identical with neutrality and that nobody was more concerned with the safety and security of the country than he.  Senator MacDermot told us his attitude here to-night, that he quite bluntly was in favour of this State going into the war.  Well, he is practically alone in that attitude.</P>

      <P>If one were really to define neutrality under modern conditions it would be wrong to define it as a state of peace.  It is somewhere rather near a state of belligerency with both parties, while having friendly relations with the Governments.  Neutrals everywhere have to resist the pressure on the part of both belligerents, pressure which is exerted in order to force the neutrals to take up arms on one side or the other.  We are a sovereign, independent State and we have a right to be neutral.  We have declared our neutrality with the full force and consent of all the constitutional authorities in this country.  Propaganda nowadays is regarded by belligerents as one of the most important weapons, one of the most important arms of the fighting services.  As I pointed out here the last day, there are belligerents in this war who are spending a vast amount of brains and energy on propaganda, just as much as they are on some of their fighting services. They examine very carefully every word that is printed in neutral papers and they make the best use of it they can.  One has only to listen to the wireless any night and note some of the propaganda of the belligerents. Half of it is taken up with statements taken, or alleged to be taken, from neutral sources.</P>
      <P>We do not want to be too much in that picture.  If the Dáil decides that we should be in that picture, that we should declare war, then let the Dáil do so, but until that happens, it is the Government's duty to maintain neutrality, and neither to do anything itself nor to allow anyone else to do anything which will endanger our neutrality.  As propaganda is a vital weapon at the moment, we must do nothing here, even in the line of talking or in the line of writing, that would give offence to the belligerents. Senator MacDermot wants to go to war.  He wants the country to go to war, and that is the reason he wants to abolish the censorship.  Having that in view, it is up to him as best he can to try to undermine the censorship as much as he can.</P>

      <P>If that were to be debated, there would be a lot of things said on both sides.  All the people in the country are not like Senator MacDermot.  If we were all Senator MacDermots, with whom one word would only borrow another, it would be all right, but words borrow blows here.  We do not want trouble with outsiders nor do we want internal trouble, particularly on a question on which the vast majority of the people are united.  In the general statement which I made at the beginning of this speech, I have answered many of the minor points which Senator MacDermot made.  However, I shall try to deal with the specific instances that he has given where, in his opinion, the censorship has acted unfairly.  He said that we should be governed by the rule of law, and not by arbitrary power.  I have pointed out that the censorship is acting under the rule of law.</P>
      <P>Senator MacDermot said that the editors of newspapers in the country have been reduced to a state of blasphemous irritation.  I have every sympathy with editors who have been accustomed to working on their own without any authority over them and without having to submit to rules and regulations, but it has been decided by the Dáil that it should be so during this period of emergency and, whether they like it or not, it is up to them to try to co-operate in the best way they can.  The Senator alluded to an editorial from the <i>Independent</i> which was stopped.  If the Senator had been here, at a certain stage in Irish history, he would remember another leading article which the Irish people would have been glad to see stopped in 1916.</P>

He mentioned it in connection with action which he took in 1941.  Surely it is in order, quite proper and even courteous for me to ask, is he punishing the <i>Independent</i> in 1941 for something which was written in 1916?

To talk about something written in 1916, as the Minister did in reply to Senator MacDermot, is hitting at a newspaper which the Minister has it in his power to prevent dealing with him.  I think the Minister's remarks have been most unfair and irrelevant.  I have no doubt that the Minister can make a good case for the suppression of the leading article referred to but the way in which he referred to an article of 25 years ago indicated that he is not able to justify his action and that he is seeking to justify himself by something that occurred 25 years ago.</P>

      <P>We should get back to the leading article of 1941.  This particular leading article alleged unfair discrimination against the censorship&mdash; a completely unjustifiable statement. If we are to have censorship in the country, we cannot allow editors to say things in their leading articles which would lead people to believe that the censorship was acting unfairly. As the Minister responsible for censorship, I am responsible to the Dáil and to this House for the operation of the censorship.  I am prepared to answer any question affecting censorship and to justify any action if it can be justified.  We are not claiming infallibility in the censorship department but if anybody has a legitimate <Col N="244" /> grievance against censorship in the country, he has a right to approach his representative in the Dáil or to approach a Senator and to have the matter raised in debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We have taken a deliberate policy in regard to leading articles in the newspapers on censorship. We allowed the papers a certain amount of freedom on that one occassion, but we are not going to have, day in and day out, leading articles on censorship.  Censorship has been decided by the Dáil and, as in the case of neutrality, if the newspapers want it abolished it will have to be abolished by the Oireachtas, and until then the newspapers, just the same as everybody else in the country, will have to obey the law.  I deny, without fear of contradiction&mdash; and I am satisfied that I would be able to prove my case to any reasonable man&mdash;that there has been any unfair discrimination against the <i>Irish Independent</i> or any other newspaper in this country, and if any half dozen Senators here want to come along, or if any one Senator wants to come along, I can prove to him that the <i>Irish Press</i> not only has a grievance against the censorship but that it has the biggest grievance of any newspaper against the censorship, simply because it is impossible, with the rapidity with which the work is done there in the small hours of the morning, for the censorship to be infallible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every newspaper, no doubt, can make a case and show 100 instances where something has happened which is to its disadvantage, but they are all in the same boat, and, generally speaking, <Col N="245" /> the cases that they have to put forward are not worth talking about&mdash; not really legitimate grievances at all&mdash; and a couple of the biggest grievances, where a newspaper was deprived of a news item that was allowed in other papers, were by the editorial staff of the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>
    <P>The Senator alleged that no word of Cardinal Hinsley was allowed to appear in the Irish newspapers.  Some of his Eminence's material was sent over here, for publication &ldquo;in Ireland only&rdquo;.  Certainly, the Cardinal is a very patriotic Englishman, and, as such, he makes his propaganda in favour of his own country, but if we were to allow some of his statements to appear in our daily papers, we could not cut out similar vigorous statements on the other side, and the result would be that we would have a very bitter controversy arising here, which we decided not to have.  Senator MacDermot also said that a statement was cut out relating to some demand for 50/- per barrel for wheat down in County Cork, or that it was cut out of the <i>Cork Examiner.</i>  I do not doubt that the Senator's statement is correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, some newspaper, at any rate.  Generally speaking, however, I think Senators are aware that the farmers' demand for increased prices has been published.  That news item may have been associated with something else which necessitated its being censored.  If a demand for increased prices was coupled with a threat of strike, for instance, it would be censored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I do not know why it was, but as a general policy there has been no censorship of price requests. Senator MacDermot has gone back to past history over the play in the Abbey and the play in the Gate Theatre.  The play in the Gate Theatre had the date of 1941 on the programme, I think.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think so. At any rate, from one point of view, it would not have been suppressed. The Senator talked about the Henry Harrison-Sir Hubert Gough letter, which was not allowed to appear in our papers here. That letter, generally, was advancing the same argument as Senator MacDermot, and if we allow those arguments in on one side we have to allow them in on the other.  Senator MacDermot criticised things we cut out, and then proceeded to suggest a lot of things which he would cut out if he were censor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, there were some things that appeared which he complained about.  One was in regard to a poster, I think, which we had no power to stop at that particular time. I think we had not power to stop posters at that time, but we did take that power afterwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have been stopped if it had been submitted, whether voluntarily or under compulsion: that is, if it was worded as the Senator described it to-night.  He talked also about some advertisements that the <i>Irish Independent</i> was prevented from publishing.  I do not know <Col N="247" /> whether it was that particular advertisement, but we had a protest from the advertising manager of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, in which he complained about the censor stopping a particular advertisement which contained the words: &ldquo;Gott strafe Hitler&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It is not the Minister's function to conclude in a matter of this sort.  I cannot say that I enjoyed any portion of Senator MacDermot's speech that I listened to. In fact, I thought it was a speech which contained a great deal that I regard as nationally harmful.  I must say that I thought a bit the same about the Minister's statement.  He made a statement&mdash;I do not know that there is any solid foundation for it&mdash;that every neutral is undergoing a form of pressure from both belligerents, trying to force each individual neutral to participate in the war as a belligerent.  If our Government has been submitted to pressure from one or other, or from both of the belligerents, trying to force us to participate in the war, I have not heard of it.  I do not think it is justifiable. Everyone knows that Ministers necessarily have information that is not available to the man in the street.  I do not think the Minister should make a statement like that unless he is prepared to go further, and to give some information as to the form in which this pressure, which he have suffered from both sides in the war, is going to be made known to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <P>I said that the belligerents, not belligerent Governments, and if the Senator only reads the newspapers or listens to broadcasts from the wireless stations of the two belligerents, he would know that they would be highly delighted if we allied ourselves with one or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be highly delighted if some one would give me £5,000,000 to-morrow, but it would make me indignant if there was an attempt to blackmail me to give £5,000,000.  Naturally, any people would be delighted to have any support in moments of grave national crisis, when they are fighting for their lives, but to say that they would be delighted <Col N="249" /> or that they are imposing pressure on other people, is a matter that is almost &mdash;if not a misrepresentation of facts&mdash; certainly not a clear statement.  I think the Minister misunderstands the legal position.  Our Government has a right to impose taxation on the people. The Minister said that, by law, the Government has a right to censor, and his argument, to use his exact words, was that the matter had been settled by the Dáil.  The Dáil has settled the constitutional matter of taxation, and the Government has the right to tax. Does that mean that the whole people have to sit down when the Government imposes taxation that is unjust, inequitable or exorbitant, that they are not to say anything about it?  The law gives the Government power to tax, but the people are not to question the justice of that tax or the particular form it takes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's argument that we gave the Government power to censor is quite right.  I believe in censorship, and I agree that the only proper authority to control that censorship is the Government.  When there is that power they can use it wisely or unwisely; they can use it severely or ineptly, but it does not follow, because the Government is the proper authority that the last word has been said on it. The Minister said that we were not going to have any day in and day out leading articles on the censorship; that the matter had been settled by the Dáil.  That type of argument annoys me.  I did not hear the earlier part of Senator MacDermot's speech.  Apparently he referred to a leading article in a newspaper which was the subject of censorship.  Now the Minister turns round and says that we are not going to have day in and day out leading articles on the censorship.  I do not say so offensively, but to my mind that conveys something which is not true.  Implicit in the Minister's statement was this, that it is only by the constant intervention of the censorship that we are not getting articles daily denouncing censorship.  If that is based on the fact that there was an individual article which the Minister suppressed, it must be taken on its merits.  To say that if he relaxes his grip, we were going to <Col N="250" /> be annoyed and harassed with continued articles about the censorship is, I think, a misrepresentation of the case.</P>
    <P>The Dáil has not settled once and for all whether or not we should criticise concrete acts of the censorship.  It does not follow that the Minister's mind works in a series of <i>non sequitur.</i> That is not proved at all.  That is rather dangerous.  The Minister is responsible for censorship, but somehow, in his words to-day, I think he did himself less than justice in suggesting, in thinking because he is the authority in charge of censorship, that he is the absolute arbiter in the matter, that everything he does must necessarily be proclaimed as good or else we must keep our mouths shut.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">

      <P>Does the Senator agree that newspapers should flout the decisions of the Dáil in order to support their own personal interests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how that question arises.  The decision of the Dáil is that the national interest requires that there be a certain control in the form of censorship.  The ordinary institutions of the State indicate that there should be a Minister responsible for that.  Where does the question of flouting the decisions of the Dáil come in?  As a matter of fact, even though we pass an Act, I as a free person, able to form a judgment according to my reason, have a perfect right, if my judgment indicates that, to decide that that Act was iniquitous and that that Act was shameful nationally. It is not flouting the decision of the Dáil to say that we think the Act is of such a nature that it should be rescinded. That is not so at all.  That is not flouting.  If I say, &ldquo;That is the law of the land and we are right in defeating and disobeying the law,&rdquo; I would call that flouting the decision of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am entirely in favour of censorship and in agreement that it must be in the hands of the Minister.  But there are certain cases put up which make me rather worried.  For instance, on the last occasion here the Minister did the heroic business by saying, &ldquo;Attack me; do not attack the unfortunate <Col N="251" /> civil servant.&rdquo;  If one says that one thinks certain higher officials in charge of the censorship are unsuitable for it, that is not necessarily a criticism of them.  There is nothing which says that, unless a civil servant makes a most perfect censor, he is unsuitable to be a civil servant.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that we have civil servants who are supremely expert both in knowledge and in wide experience of the application of the law relating to local government.  If you take a civil servant who is supremely efficient, competent, widely experienced, and wise in judgment, in the Local Government Department and, say, put him in charge of censorship, am I attacking him if I say that he is not a good man for the job?  I am not attacking him in that case; I am attacking the Minister, because the Minister's business, when work has to be done, is to look out and find&mdash;it is also required of him that his judgment should be good&mdash;a competent and suitable person for that work.</P>
    <P>I am not going to be very critical of the censorship, because one can only do that with concrete cases, and my knowledge of concrete cases is limited. I am, however, a bit suspicious, because I know that the Minister and his colleagues long before the emergency came on had the feeling that any criticism of the Government was itself a form of sedition.  I can remember about eight years ago, when the Taoiseach was President, there was a feeling in the country that freedom of expression was being suppressed, as it was, by brute force.  The President at the time when the use of brute force was suffering a bit from reaction which was equal and opposite, got up and said that he entirely disapproved of any attempt to suppress freedom of speech.  Just that day I had been informed that a journalist of a paper outside this country had received a notice, described to me as from a quarter very near to the President, which was of so minatory a nature that the journalist said he would not like to receive another notice of the same kind.  Just when the President was proclaiming his heartfelt adherence to <Col N="252" /> the policy of freedom of speech, I made reference to this in a veiled way so that the President, if he was aware of what had taken place, would follow it.  I thought I was then going to get from him a statement that anybody who purported to speak in the name of the Government and who sought to control what was written in newspapers in another country was misrepresenting his position and acting without authority. On the contrary, he began talking about sedition; that what was published in a newspaper on the other side of the Atlantic might very well be sedition, and the Government's power would be used for punishing it. That attitude of mind makes me a bit nervous.</P>
    <P>The Minister rather gave his case away, because he said that amongst the daily papers on suffered grievance to a greater extent than others.  If that is a fact, then the censorship is working badly.  He said that one paper, the <i>Irish Press</i>, suffered a greater grievance than any of the others.  If that is so, then his Department is condemned. This is not a scientific thing. There is no way of exactly weighing up and saying &ldquo;that may be published&rdquo; and &ldquo;that may not&rdquo;.  It comes down to a human judgment in the light of the concrete circumstances of the moment for which no general law can be made.  If the Minister says that one newspaper has suffered a disadvantage to its own detriment, which hardship has not been imposed on others, then he has implied that his Department is guilty of injustice.  It seems to me that there have been certain ineptitudes.  In the <i>Sunday Times</i> last Sunday there was a statement by Cardinal Hinsley published in full, a most impressive and beautiful statement.  I gathered from what the Minister said here to-day that that was suppressed in the Irish Papers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the implication. The Minister spoke about Cardinal Hinsley as a very patriotic Englishman.  Cardinal Hinsley is rather more than a patriotic Englishman. He is one of the highest spiritual authorities in the Catholic Church.  The <Col N="253" /> Minister then said that, if that were allowed to be published, then similar statements on the other side should be published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was talking about what Cardinal Hinsley said.  What is in my mind is that most impressive and convincing statement which spoke, to my mind, very directly to the Christian conscience.  The Minister said that a similar statement on the other side would have to be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>What I had in mind was this.  On one occasion his Eminence Cardinal Hinsley said that in this war the forces of his home country were on the side of the angels in the struggle against Lucifer. A night or two after that there was a broadcast from another belligerent country containing a reply to that, which said it was strange that 3,000,000 Catholics in England were on the side of the angels, while 40,000,000 in Germany and Italy were on the side of Lucifer.  We did not want that controversy to appear here.  The rest of the speech was allowed to go, but that particular statement was cut out, simply because we knew other replies would be coming and we did not want to publish them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a slang phrase in which one speaks about one's opposite number.  I am not sure who is my opposite number.  Cardinal Hinsley is a prince of the Catholic Church and an Englishman.  When the Minister says &ldquo;If you allow what he said to be published freely, you will have to do the same with the other side,&rdquo; I am entirely in agreement.  If a German Cardinal makes an important <Col N="254" /> statement, I do not see why it should be suppressed here.  One will read what he states as written by a Prince of the Church with some sense of his responsibility.  One will also read what he states knowing that the natural pietas to his own country must have some influence.  If, say, Cardinal Hinsley is writing on one side and some propagandist or newspaper writer is writing on the other side, and you try to balance these two together, I say there is no parity there.</P>
      <P>I myself necessarily form judgments with regard to this war.  That is why I always try to avoid the use of the word &ldquo;neutral&rdquo;, because there may be subjects on which I am not quite neutral.  I cannot say what they are, because they are questions that I have never heard of.  It is practically impossible for me, in relation to anything that I know anything about, to remain so objective that it means a sort of complete blankness of mind. There is no good in my saying that I view the war with an absolute independence of mind, because the facts of the world situation are necessarily ordered in my mind according to certain values, and I necessarily judge in relation to those values.</P>
      <P>The Minister said, and I thought he stressed the thing badly, that the <i>Irish Press</i> newspaper had suffered an injustice from his Department.  If the <i>Irish Press</i>, or any other newspaper, has suffered an injustice, then his Department is doing its job badly.  I admit that what was behind his mind was that he and his Party are personally closely interested in the <i>Irish Press</i>, and that what he meant to convey was &ldquo;how wonderful and self-denying we are in imposing greater suffering on ourselves than on anybody else.&rdquo;  The <i>Irish Press</i> is a commercial property just as the other newspapers are, and there should be absolute equality between them.  The Minister, I think, made a bad case on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, again, was misleading with regard to Cardinal Hinsley's statement.  The Minister says: &ldquo;If we publish what Cardinal Hinsley says, then we must also publish what comes <Col N="255" /> from the other side.&rdquo;  I do not agree. I agree that if you publish freely all that Cardinal Hinsley says, you must, if the claim is made, give equal prominence to what is said by Cardinals who are Germans in order to put both sides on a parity.  But there is no parity at all between the publication of what is said by Cardinal Hinsley and what is said by a paid propagandist over the wireless.  That is what makes me gravely concerned about censorship. I am not going to found any argument on anything I have heard in newspaper circles about certain things which were not allowed to be published. However, what I did hear seemed to me to indicate ineptitude rather than wise judgment on the part of the censor. I have seen things published which, I think, I should not allow to be published.  I have in front of me some copies of an Irish provincial newspaper in which certain comments appear, not under a news heading, but in what are called pithy paragraphs. These comments are, to my mind, marked by complete dishonesty.  If someone gets up and says that, having weighed up all the rights and wrongs of the war, he is whole-heartedly on the side of one belligerent or the other, and is prepared to make a reasoned case based upon fact for that, then I think one would hesitate to interfere, but here you have things that are markedly tendentious: that, in fact, are definitely untrue as far as we can understand from the Government.  You have here in this local newspaper what I consider to be most dishonest anti-British propaganda.  You have in it this, for instance:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Now I think it must be clear in the minds of everyone where the real imminent danger lies.  The recent demands made by the English Premier for the handing over of Éire's ports and air bases to the English Government and the vile propaganda used by English Ministers....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and so on.  The writer there refers to the recent demand made by the British Government for certain ports in our hands.  That appeared in the issue of <Col N="256" /> that newspaper, dated 28th December last.  That was after the Taoiseach's broadcast in which, I think, he said that no such demands had been made. The censor, presumably, allowed that to go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>May I again interrupt the Senator to say that I think the paper he is referring to is <i>The Nationalist and Leinster Times?</i> It received a very severe rap over the knuckles for that, and the editor was told that if he did not behave himself, and submit articles like that in future, he would be compelled to submit the whole paper every week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, that kind of thing went on for some time. I have been a censor myself, and I do say that you can have no hard and fast rules.  You must judge according to human judgment, but why in the world was not such a thing as that suppressed? I think we have carried censorship a bit too far in some directions, and have been rather slack in others. I can point to that case in this weekly paper which, as I have said, contained this most tendentious statement.  The thing was cleverly done and was calculated to suggest that anyone whose conscience urges him to see the good predominate on one side rather than on the other was only moved by the most venal motives.  There was the dishonest reassurance that his pecuniary position was not going to be incommoded if the war went the way they were afraid it might go.  Anyhow, about neutrality in this war I do not pretend to be neutral.  I am not pretending to be impeccable.  It seems to me that one's human judgment, when not blinded by this historic prejudice, necessarily directs one to hope, in the name of all the marvellous heritage of civilisation and culture and moral order that has come down to us through 2,000 years of European history, that the balance will tend to one side rather than to the other.  That is my view, but I am not trying to push it over on anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the censor's conception of neutrality is not quite mine. I agree that human prudence must <Col N="257" /> come in, and there is no good in trying to be too independent or too truculent about things.  On the other hand.  I find it rather hard to believe that we have always to watch our step and be careful of what we do lest someone should take umbrage.  According to my judgment, censorship very often tends to work in a rather harmful way in this country.  I think that, as far as danger to this country is concerned, it is all from one side, and practically not at all from the other.  That, as I say, is only a personal judgment.  I personally feel that occasionally certain official statements from the Government, and certain action by the Government, might tend to mislead the public as to the more likely source of danger, and in that way might, quite unintentionally, do a very considerable amount of harm.  I agree with the Minister and with the Government that the well-being of this country requires that we remain non-belligerent, and that we should do all we can to remain in that not very happy condition and avoid a possibly more unhappy condition.</P>
    <P>I think that, as regards the censorship, we must expect a certain amount of ineptitude from it.  The Minister appointed a man in charge who, as far as I know&mdash;I do not know that he had any peculiar gifts&mdash;had no particular qualifications for his work.  That indicated bad judgment on the part of the Minister.  We had the Minister's own attitude towards censorship revealed in his speech.  He seems to think that if somebody as distinguished as Cardinal Hinsley makes a statement, that statement should be suppressed if there is the danger that some writer to a newspaper, calling himself <i>&ldquo;Pro Bono Publico&rdquo;,</i> or some paid propagandist, might come along and try to argue with the Cardinal. I say there is a lack of parity there. The Minister would be quite right in suppressing the paid propagandist, &ldquo;<i>Pro Bono Publico</i>&rdquo; or whoever he might be, and in letting the Cardinal speak.</P>
    <P>From certain cases I know, it seems that the Minister and his Department have used their powers to suppress things which were not nationally detrimental, <Col N="258" /> but which were rather critical of his own Party.  I entirely agree that at the present time, when we are all likely to hang singly, it would be wiser for us to hang together, and, in speaking here, I am very much handicapped because there are all sorts of things I want to say, and not fear of the Minister or his censorship gag, but my own feeling that I must do nothing which might conceivably, by any stretch of the imagination, be injurious to my own country makes it rather difficult for me to say what is at the back of my mind; but I do think that the Minister's Department have suppressed things which were going to do no national harm, but which were critical of the policy of his Government. There, I think, they should have been very careful.  What we have to avoid is anything which will be injurious to this country, such as making public military information which would be useful.  Senator MacDermot gives a list of things to which he thinks censorship should be limited, but, to my mind, that motion is just silly.  If the Minister's operations are to be limited to those headings (a), (b), (c) and (d), if I wanted to injure this country, if I wanted to write things which I think should be allowed to be published, I could find a dozen ways of doing so and still keep within the law.</P>
    <P>As to Senator McGinley's amendment, the censorship powers possessed by the Minister are what we call emergency powers, and I want the Minister to understand that I entirely agree with censorship.  I entirely agree that censorship power should be in the Minister's hands, and I fully recognise that if the wisest Minister ever made were put in charge of censorship suddenly, there might easily be grounds for criticism afterwards.  We do not expect to have a sort of infused wisdom with regard to censorship, but this censorship relates to a crisis in which we are all involved.  I judge from Senator McGinley's amendment that he considers the Irish language, and everything relating to it, as being in a permanent condition of emergency.  It is an emergency which is with us, always <Col N="259" /> was with us and is always going to be with us, and, consequently, the censorship is to be a permanent institution so long as the Irish language remains known to anybody.  It is perfectly ridiculous to say that we are not to have propaganda in favour of either belligerent.  The word &ldquo;propaganda&rdquo; is vague and indeterminate, and I am not going to say that I must be absolutely mum and pretend that I see no difference between one belligerent and another, but if I use my judgment and express my views, it does not make me a propagandist.  There is a certain other significance attaching to the word.</P>
    <P>Senator McGinley's amendment would apply the censorship to propagands against the neutrality of Ireland and to lying propaganda against the national language of Ireland.  I am against any lying propaganda at all, but it seems to me that a great number of Senator McGinley's colleagues are wrongly informed about the Irish language&mdash;I referred to one case last week in which they are historically wrongly informed; I hear them going around talking highfaultin' patriotism about the Irish language, but their facts are just wrong&mdash;and I am afraid the people who would suffer under clause (g) of the amendment are these people.  I am wrong in that argument. I thought the phrase was &ldquo;Lying propaganda about the national language of Ireland,&rdquo; but it is &ldquo;Lying propaganda against the national language of Ireland,&rdquo; and I must withdraw what I said.  I see that Senator McGinley is going to leave the field perfectly free for any lying propaganda in favour of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>As I say, I would much prefer if a great deal of that portion of Senator MacDermot's speech which I heard had never been delivered.  I feel that it might easily be construed in a way harmful to our country.  I disapprove of the Minister's speech not so much in respect to what he said as to the point of view which seemed to me to underlie it&mdash;the point of view which suggests that nobody is to criticise his Department in relation to censorship. That is a happy condition in which every Minister and every Department <Col N="260" /> would like to be, but so far as the law of this country is concerned, the Minister is under a misapprehension.  There is no law of this country which says that a Government responsible to the Dáil is to be absolutely immune from any criticism as to the way it administers the work it has undertaken.  That is a misapprehension, and as long as that misapprehension remains in the Minister's mind, he is likely to be a bad guide to the censorship officials.</P>
    <P>I disagree with a great number of other arguments he put forward, but we have to have censorship, and we have to have it in charge of the Minister.  That being so, as we want to interfere as little as possible with the well-being of our people and to have it as wisely administered as possible, it is right that it should come up here, and in the Dáil, for review and criticism.  That is something I want the Minister to accept, because, if he does not accept that, there is only going to be a feeling in the country that the Minister is using arbitrary powers to put across to the people what he wants to put across to them, and to conceal from them what he wants to conceal.</P>

I think that so far as my prayers with regard to the outcome of the war are concerned, they would be identical with those of Senator MacDermot, but at the same time, if he claims the right to make the speech he did make, it is quite possible that somebody, not what I might call the paid propagandist as against the Cardinal Hinsley&mdash;not that other number arrangement, but another Senator&mdash;might make a statement which, I think, would be very harmful.</P>

      <P>I think the Senator said it in a very different way.  I did not make notes of his speech, but I must say that I was very uncomfortable when he was making it.  I disagree with his motion.  As I say, if the operation of the Government were limited, formally and legally, to those heads, I could get up and say all sorts of disastrous things and prove that I was acting within the law.</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply to Senator MacDermot was in the nature of a personal attack on the Senator and that seemed to me to be an entirely wrong way of approaching this matter.  Apparently Senator MacDermot referred to a leading article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> which was suppressed. The Minister may have had, and I am quite prepared to accept that there were, ample grounds for suppressing that article, but when a man begins to talk about something that was in the <i>Irish Independent</i> in 1916 that, to my mind, is a most dishonest red herring. If the article he suppressed should have been suppressed, it is within his competence to show why he suppressed it, or to prove that he was right in doing so; but when he quotes an article written 25 years ago by a man who has long since gone to his Maker and brings that up in evidence, to me it is something which I can only describe as beneath contempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister possibly did not realise what he was doing, but it is the sort of thing that a person, if he wanted to try to cover up a very bad case, might drag in as a very bad red herring.  At the same time it does make one rather anxious as to how censorship is being run.  One is afraid that there may be a lack of justice in the treatment if the Minister feels that way.  When we talk about what <i>The Times</i> said in 1845 the idea to be conveyed is that some human being in 1845 wrote a certain article in <i>The Times.</i>  Presumably the person who wrote that is dead. When somebody quotes what the <i>Independent</i> said in 1916, to my mind it is a dishonest argument altogether. The Minister is not censoring what was published in 1916.  He is censoring what is to be published in the year 1941.  If he can make a good case for <Col N="262" /> it we are ready to listen to him and we are ready to judge everything and to weigh everything in his favour and in the favour of his Department, but if he goes dragging in these other things, I think we will have to be suspicious and feel there is something to be concealed.</P>

      <P>May I point out that Senator Hogan desires his motion to come on to-morrow in order that it may be satisfactorily discussed?  We must adjourn until to-morrow and if that is so we might as well adjourn now instead of later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be well to reach some general understanding as to the hour at which this House should normally adjourn unless it is agreed at the beginning. Personally, I think it should be 10 o'clock.</P>

      <P>I have here an extract from the minutes of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of the 7th February, 1939, which I will read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was the view of the Committe that an hour not later than 9 p.m. should, by general understanding, be adopted for sittings of the House when business warranted sittings to that hour.&rdquo;</P>

      <Col N="263" /> That is the general agreement reached at the Committee.</P>

      <P>If we were not sitting again until next week there would be a case for going on later to-night, but as we are sitting to-morrow anyway, and the programme is by no means overloaded, I think we should adjourn now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion standing in my name is a matter in regard to which time is a very important factor.  I adjourned it last week at the express wish of the Minister and if it is not discussed this week I think its discussion will not be nearly as valuable. That is the reason why I asked the House to decide to meet to-morrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of those people who have 150 miles to travel to attend this House.  After four or five hours' debate it is decided to adjourn until the next day and perhaps the next day it will be decided to adjourn again.  There are many country members in the House and in fairness to them I think this House should sit at least until 11 o'clock when it does meet.  That is ordinary fair play to the country members.  I am quite satisfied that his debate will finish by 11 o'clock to-night if we continue to sit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that if a debate is adjourned in the presence of the Minister the Minister is within his rights in saying that he cannot attend at 3 o'clock and the proposal to attend at half-past four is a reasonable one.  I think, in the circumstances, we ought to meet at 3 o'clock and take Senator Hogan's motion.  It may be concluded by half-past four but, whether it is or not, at half-past four we could resume this motion.</P>
