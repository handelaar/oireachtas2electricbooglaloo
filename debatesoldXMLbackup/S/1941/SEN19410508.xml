    <Title>Removal of Judge from Office&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <P>The following motion appeared on the Order Paper in the name of Senator Quirke:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Seanad Eireann hereby calls for the removal from office of Edward J. McElligott, a Judge of the Circuit Court, on the ground that he is unable owing to physical incapacity to perform the functions of his said office.</P>

      <P>I am not moving the motion, Sir.  This motion was tabled at the instance of the Government, and, as the Minister for Justice has already explained to the Dáil, he has received satisfactory assurance that the resignation of the judge is forthcoming. In the circumstances, there is no necessity to proceed with the motion.</P>

      <P>Does not this illustrate that when a matter of such great gravity as this is put down there should be some consultation beforehand?  It is a rather extraordinary thing that the Seanad is summoned for the purpose of considering a motion of great gravity and then is told that the matter is not being gone on with because something has happened.  I want to suggest that the independence of the judges is a matter of great importance. We may have to pay for it by occasionally listening to things which we do not particularly like.  When the Minister puts down a motion of this kind I am sure he puts it down with the best of motives.  I am not questioning that in any way, but I do suggest that some consultation beforehand should have been taken so that members <Col N="1102" /> of this House and members of the other House would not find themselves in the position of being confronted with this kind of motion on the Order Paper with no knowledge whatever beforehand.  Particularly is this so in the situation which at present exists where the two Houses, owing to the Constitution, have the same majority, and there is no real independence for the judges, with motions of this nature.</P>
      <P>Motion not moved.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it would be convenient to refer to the order covered by this motion, that is to say, the amending Order No. 40 and the order covered by the next motion on the Order Paper, the order amending Quota Order No. 42.  They both arise from the same cause.  The orders are amending orders and the general effect of them is to bring the definitions employed in the original orders into line with the definitions used in the orders made under the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act under which the duties on cotton piece goods were amended.  The amendments in fact are no more than are necessary to correct drafting errors which crept into the original orders.  The importation of cotton towelling is controlled by Quota Order No. 40, which relates to terry towelling, and Quota Order No. 42, which relates to other kinds of towelling.  It is the usual practice in the trade to import towelling in the form of two towels joined together by warp yarns.  The Emergency Imposition of Duties Order made it clear that for the purpose of the duty two or more towels joined together by the warp or weft yarns shall be deemed to be piece goods.  A corresponding provision was <Col N="1103" /> not originally thought to be necessary in fact in Quota Orders Nos. 40 and 42, and the Revenue Commissioners have decided that, for the purpose of the quota, towels joined together in pairs in the manner I have described are not piece goods.  These amending orders are designed to remedy that defect and, as I say, to bring the definitions in the quota orders into conformity with the definitions in the Emergency Imposition of Duties Orders.</P>

      <P>As I have pretty intimate knowledge of both these orders, unless there is any question raised, I would simply say that I entirely approve <Col N="1104" /> of them and agree entirely with what the Minister has said.</P>
      <P>Motion put and agreed to.</P>
