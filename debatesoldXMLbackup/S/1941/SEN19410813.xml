      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, Section 2, sub-section (2), line 52, to delete the word &ldquo;engaged&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;a participant&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a small amendment, possibly not of much importance, though possibly it may be.  In the Constitution it is provided that war shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of Dáil Eireann, but in case of actual invasion the Government may take whatever steps they consider necessary for the protection of the State.  I am not sure whether a court might not hold that, in taking steps to repel an invasion, we were engaging in war, and I think this should not be so until the Oireachtas has declared it.  For that reason, it seemed to be wise to take the words of the Constitution and keep rigidly to them, so I suggest the word &ldquo;participant&rdquo; to keep it in conformity with the wording of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>The intention in the Bill is to limit the obligation to pay compensation under this Bill to the purely neutral position.  The Senator wishes to change that.</P>

      <P>I take it that, if the words were put in as the Senator suggests in his amendment and, in the strictly constitutional sense interpreted as such, compensation would be payable under this Bill until a formal declaration of war, though we might be actually at war.</P>

      <P>I am trying to make the matter clear, and will not press this if there is no doubt in the mind of the Minister.  The Constitution says that war shall not be declared save with the assent of Dáil Eireann.  I do not visualise that happening at all and am not much concerned with it.  Supposing the country were attacked, the Oireachtas would take action.  I do not suggest for a moment that this Bill should last after we participate in a war, as this would not be the kind of Bill I would approve of under those circumstances.  In that I am completely at one with the Minister.  My only fear is that action taken, which might only be for a couple of days, in repelling any invasion or in resisting what was not really an invasion but an accidental attack, might be engaging in a war and the court might so hold.  If you keep to the Constitution there can be no question: it cannot be war unless Dáil Eireann has so decided.  That is the object of my amendment.  Also, there can be no question then as to the date when we engaged in war.  I hope it will not happen, but I can conceive it happening that there may be two days of attack during which we might not know whether it was an invasion or an accident.  I do not want any possible danger of the words &ldquo;engaged in a war&rdquo; meaning other than what I think the Minister has in mind.  My attention was drawn to this by a lawyer in the first instance, and on looking into it I saw that there was some slight danger.</P>

      <P>I have gone into this and have had it considered by various legal authorities, including the draftsman, and their advice to me is to stand by the words in the Bill. It is a moot point whether we would be actually at war in case of an invasion though the Oireachtas might not have declared war.  Lawyers might argue, and the court might decide, that once an invasion took place and we made any attempt to repel it, we were, in fact, at war. My desire with this Bill is that once a position of war was established this Bill would go out of operation and some other Bill would have to come in then for compensation.  Therefore, it is with that intention in mind that that particular section is put into the Bill&mdash;to keep it strictly to the period when we are not at war and when there is no difference of opinion, and no difference can arise either amongst lawyers or others, as to whether we are at war or not.  I would feel happier leaving the phraseology as it is in the Bill at present.</P>

      <P>We had, the House will remember, a long discussion on this matter and we also had, similarly, long and detailed discussion in the Dáil on the same section.  Owing to certain amendments that I agreed to on the Committee Stage with regard to legal expenses and other points that were raised, I think, mainly by Senator Lynch, there is less difficulty on my part, at any rate, in putting a limitation on the Department of Finance with regard to the time they should take in making up their minds. Though I am prepared to accept a limitation of 12 months, I can see there will be difficulties arising departmentally but I have told the Department that the feeling of the House seems to be&mdash;and it was the feeling of a certain section in the Dáil&mdash;that there should be a limitation imposed on the Minister for Finance in this matter.  I propose to meet the opinion expressed here, not to the full extent of making it six months, as was suggested, but to put in 12 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this point on the Committee Stage and the Minister said he would look into it.  The effect of the Bill as I read it, as it stands at the present moment, is that the Minister may make an offer of a payment for compensation and he may attach certain conditions.  It is open to the person to whom the offer is made to accept that offer and accept the conditions, or it is open to him to appeal to the court.  I think it is desirable to limit the matters that might come before the court as far as possible, and I think it should be possible for the recipient of the offer to accept the offer as far as the cash is concerned and appeal against the conditions or to accept the conditions and appeal against the offer.  My reason for that is that it would save the amount of time that would be taken in the court in the latter case, and in the former case it seems to me only just.  If the dispute is only about the conditions and if you have to appeal against both the amount and the conditions you may put the recipient in the position of having to pay costs far in excess of those which he would have to pay if he were to appeal solely against the conditions.  My attention has been drawn to this by several people who are more or less expert in the matter and they feel it does not <Col N="2411" /> really follow the spirit of the Bill, which does provide an appeal for practically every other case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can accept this amendment.  I regard the offer as a whole, whether it be an offer in cash without conditions or an offer with conditions.  You cannot make an offer separating the amount of cash that is offered from the conditions attached thereto.  The conditions might have a very considerable bearing on the amount of the cash offered.  If it were possible that the Minister were to fix, say, some onerous conditions, in order to get acceptance of such conditions he would probably have to make a generous cash offer.  If the conditions were slight, the cash offer would probably be less.  It is difficult, if not impossible, to separate one from the other.  The offer must be taken as a whole.  The conditions are part and parcel of the offer made by the Minister.  I cannot see that it would facilitate matters in any way to allow the applicant for compensation to appeal on conditions alone.  In fact it might be a disadvantage to him.  If he were appealing on the whole he might get a bigger cash award made by a court but if the cash is ruled out and he has to appeal only on conditions attached to the award he might be very much worse off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a point I do not propose to press or to divide the House upon.  I am not fully convinced by the Minister's argument.  It seems to me that his statement that there was a danger in a person appealing only against the conditions&mdash;that that person might come off much worse&mdash; is perfectly correct.  As a matter of <Col N="2412" /> fact, there is a danger in appealing always, even against a cash offer.  So far as I am concerned, I would never advise anybody to go to the court if they can get anything within reason at all.  But there is always the possibility that the court might take a very different view of the conditions. In view of the Minister's statement, I am not going to press the point. There are other matters I feel more strongly on than this.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 11, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, Section 5, sub-section (2), paragraph (d), line 31, at the end of the paragraph to add the words &ldquo;plus interest at 4 per cent. from a date which shall not be later than six months after the receipt of the application&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment raises a matter of very considerable importance.  Like a great many other amendments, this would not be put in if consequential damage were permissible, or even if a limited consequential damage in the case of business were permissible.  I put this amendment down partly because the Minister, without absolutely committing himself, dropped perhaps a foolish word that he was not absolutely against the idea of interest. I am not arguing the amount of interest; I am arguing on the principle of interest.  I had to put some rate down and I put down less than what a bank would charge on overdraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is in my mind can best be illustrated by a case of which I have some knowledge.  I am informed that actually in the damaged area in the North Strand there was one person who owned 22 houses, all of which have been flattened out.  The owner <Col N="2413" /> received rents, not very high rents, but rents that came to somewhat over £300 a year.  There is a liability for ground rent of somewhere between £14 and £15 which has to be met, even though the houses are not there.  If this particular person had had a fire and the 22 houses, which are her source of livelihood, had been destroyed by that fire, a certain time, usually six to nine months, would elapse before a claim could be completed and cash paid. But as soon as the claim was completed the insurance company would pay to this person a sum of money calculated to be necessary to replace the house, or meet the claim in accordance with the terms of the policy&mdash; whether it would be on a reinstatement basis or whether it was on the market value, I am not going to deal with that now.  A certain sum would be paid after six or nine months.</P>
    <P>If, as is very usual in a city, the landlord had an obligation to rebuild, that money would have to be used for rebuilding as soon as that became practicable.  But, if materials were unobtainable, no enforcement of that rebuilding obligation could take place until it was possible to carry it out. Now we are in the position that under this Bill this person who owned the 22 houses that have been destroyed and whose livelihood depended on a rent of a little over £300, will be in this position, that almost certainly there will be a reinstatement clause attached and, if she went to the court, there would have to be a reinstatement clause attached.  But under present circumstances the likelihood of obtaining materials to build 22 houses immediately is extremely small, and I do not believe it will be possible until the war is over, and perhaps some years after that.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill this person cannot receive payment except for reinstatement, and the payment will not be completed until the reinstatement is completed. Consequently the State will hold the money and will be saving interest during a period of one to four years from the time on which the claim is agreed on, which must be within 12 months, and she will have no income from it.  If it was an ordinary fire <Col N="2414" /> policy she would obtain the cash and she would have some income.  As I understand this legislation, she will have no income until the payment is made.  That is not fair.  Where the State is unable to pay because of conditions attached, but where the claim is admitted, it seems perfectly reasonable that there should be some rate of interest allowed.  That is one case.</P>
    <P>Take another case, the case of a business destroyed.  In that case you have not only premises but stock.  Both the premises and stock are, under the Bill, proper matters for claims.  Presumably there would be a reinstatement clause so far as the premises are concerned, and I am assuming that would be the case in a city&mdash;that it would not be Government policy to leave ground in a city vacant.  I am told there will be some land taken over in the North Strand, but although I gave a case from there, we are not dealing with that but with any part of the City of Dublin that may possibly be bombed.  In the case of business premises there will be a claim for the stock and the premises.  Most businesses have an overdraft.  They cannot repay that until they get payment. If there is a reinstatement clause they will not get the payment for a considerable time and yet the owner, there being no consequential damage permitted in a case of this kind, will be liable for the interest on overdraft.</P>
    <P>From the date on which a claim could be examined and reasonably dealt with until it is paid, the State is saving interest and the person entitled to it is losing interest.  Whether he has to pay on an overdraft or not he has the loss of his capital and it seems to me that for the period between the time when the claim is admitted and paid it is only fair to the recipient that there should be some interest paid.  I am not arguing with regard to 4 per cent.  I put that figure down because it is a little over what the State has to pay, but it is at least 1 per cent. less than a person would have to pay on an overdraft in the meantime.  It is not over-generous from that point of view.  It is the principle which I wish <Col N="2415" /> to establish.  If there is to be no interest paid, then there should be some consequential damage to meet the loss to the claimant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept the amendment&mdash;I hope that does not surprise Senator Douglas.  It is true, as he reminded the House, that I did say last week I would not object to the payment of interest, but then there was no limitation on delay that might occur.  Now we have a limitation on the Minister for Finance.  He must make his offer within a specified time and, therefore, for that reason I do not propose to accept the amendment or the idea of the payment of interest at any rate, 4 or 5 per cent. or any other rate.</P>
      <P>If we are to judge by the way Senator Douglas argued in favour of his amendment, he put it as a consequential damage and the House knows what attitude I have felt constrained to adopt with regard to consequential loss or damage except in specific instances where I felt obliged to make amendments.  Senator Douglas referred to the possibility of people in business or people owning property in the North Strand area suffering because of delay in payment of compensation without any payment of interest in the meantime.  The Senator said that he was not arguing with particular reference to the cases in the North Strand.  This Bill, of course, deals with any and every area likely to be involved, but, in the case of the North Strand, there is quite a possibility that the area will be taken over by the Corporation of Dublin, and, if that be so&mdash;I understand that the corporation are contemplating taking it over as a planning area for redistribution and rehousing&mdash;there would be no reinstatement condition.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister's latter argument, but, from my reading of the Bill, it seems to me that the court would have to make an order of reinstatement.  The Minister may waive it afterwards, but it is clearly in the Bill that where there is a claim and where it is in respect of building, the court must insert a reinstatement clause.</P>

      <P>In respect of the amount of the award, but reinstatement would probably not come before the court.  However, we are talking in hypothesis.  It is quite possible that it would not come into court, and that, if the corporation took it over, it is an arbitrator who would have to decide. I am told that the official arbitrator in cases in which property is being acquired compulsorily by the Dublin Corporation, does take into consideration loss of profits and goodwill.  He does ordinarily take these matters into consideration, and assesses them according to his own principles in making awards in cases in which areas are being compulsorily acquired.</P>

      <P>While it may not be strictly relevant, I am very anxious to get any statement that will ease the minds of certain people, and I am sure the House will not mind my putting a point which is not strictly relevant.  Is the Minister satisfied that the corporation, in taking over the property, will take it over as from before the bombing? If they took it over as from now, there could be no profits, but if they <Col N="2417" /> take it over as from before the bombing, it would be an enormous advantage, and the Minister's argument would almost convince me against my claim for interest.  I am afraid, however, that you are asking too much from the corporation and that they will take it over as from now and say that there could be no profits from something which has been razed to the ground.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not give an answer to that point, further than to express an opinion of my own, as Senator Douglas or any other Senator might do, but probably the corporation would try to get it as cheaply as they could&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the last person to blame them should be the Minister for Finance.  The arbitrator, however, is a very independent person with statutory powers and he could, if he cared to do so, give a wide interpretation to his powers and do what he ordinarily does in cases in which an area is being compulsorily acquired, that is, include provision for goodwill and loss of profits, but whether he would do that or not is scarcely for me to say.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made an argument which has a certain amount in it, but not, I think, as much as the Minister put into it, that he has now bound himself in the Bill to give a decision within 12 months, but it should be clear that the Minister's decision does not mean that the money will be available.  The Minister will give a decision within 12 months, but the person who has lost property will not have the money within 12 months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>He will not have the money if there is a reinstatement clause and that is the case which Senator Douglas made.  If it were merely a case of money given to a <Col N="2418" /> person within 12 months, it would not be worth Senator Douglas's or my getting into a state about interest at 4 per cent. for six months on the amount of an award.  I think we may say that the Minister can have that and welcome, that we will make him a present of it.  The question really arises where the Minister makes an offer and the offer is accompanied by a reinstatement clause.  It is quite clear that, in our present circumstances, the position of the person whose property was destroyed would be that he would have an offer from the Minister of a certain amount to reinstate his property and that he could not do it for a year, or perhaps two years, and in that period he ought to get interest on the money.  That is not, as the Minister said, a consequential loss.  The amendment does not contemplate compensation for consequential loss, but if there were compensation for consequential loss, the amendment would not be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this question of the corporation, let me put two different cases to the Minister.  We should not talk too much about the North Strand area because it should never be forgotten that this Bill and all its provisions apply not only to the North Strand, but to all future bombing and to areas entirely different in their nature from the North Strand.  The corporation, I understand, are going to take over part of the bombed area for reconstruction, but not all of it, so that, even taking the North Strand area at the moment, you could easily have these two cases.  If a person had a shop in the area which the corporation is going to take over, his position will be that the corporation will pay him in cash for taking over his premises compulsorily, but I think it is beyond all hope and beyond all reason that the corporation will compensate him on any better terms than he would have got under this Bill.  I think we may take it that any competent City Manager or any common-sense arbitrator will refuse to give a person whose site is being taken over by the corporation any more than he would have got under the Bill, and I think we may be <Col N="2419" /> quite sure that this Bill will be cited before the arbitrator on behalf of the corporation to prevent any applicant from getting more from the corporation than he would have got from the State under the Bill.</P>
    <P>That person will get cash and he will get it within a reasonable time&mdash; if he gets the Minister's decision within 12 months, he ought to be able to get the corporation's decision in a comparatively short space of time after that&mdash;but a person in the same area whose site is not going to be taken over by the corporation may have a reinstatement clause inserted by the Minister which he may accept, or, if he goes to the court, the court must insert a reinstatement clause and he will be out of his money and will get no interest.  I think it is scarcely fair that two people in the same area should be in different positions, but in any event the only people who have a prospect of getting their money are those people upon whom no reinstatement clause is imposed, either by the Minister or by the court.  Those people upon whom a reinstatement clause is imposed, whether in the North Strand area or any other area, are going to be out of their money for a considerable time and are going to have nothing at all in the interval.  They are not being paid for consequential loss, except in a very limited way with regard to removal or storage of furniture or stock, but in this case they may be in the position that they have an award for £100, £1,000, £2,000 or £10,000.  They have no business.  Their means of livelihood is gone, and they cannot even get interest at the rate of 4 per cent. or, in fact, at any rate on money which the Minister, or the court, has determined ought to be eventually theirs.  That is, I think, a very reasonable case.  It only involves the payment of interest on money which the State, either through the Minister or through the court, has decided is due to the person concerned, and which the State does not pay.  If the State pays, that ends it.  If the State does not pay, it surely ought to pay interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not examined this question very closely, but, listening to the statements of Senator Hayes and Senator Douglas, it would seem to be peculiarly hard that the person affected should be left without any means whatever during the interim period.  A person, for example, may have been deriving an income from this property.  It may be that he was solely dependent on that.  It would be very hard if, during the interim period, that person were deprived of any income whatever from the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is not at all unlikely, unless the people who have been in business are able to make other arrangements for the carrying on of their business during the interval which will elapse until the property is rebuilt in whole or in part, that they may be without the income which they normally derived from their property before it was destroyed by bombing.  It is possible that some of them have already gone into business. They may have erected temporary structures or made other arrangements to enable them to carry on, so as to provide themselves with a means of livelihood.  I know that some would probably have a difficulty in raising the necessary credit to enable them to do that.  Such cases are unfortunately typical of the kind of thing that happens when people find themselves in the position of being the occupants of business, or other, premises in a bombed area.  I wonder what about the people who were put out of business in 1922 and 1923? There was no provision made under the 1933 Act, or in any of the previous Acts, for the payment of interest to them.  Some of those people were not paid compensation for 15 and 16 years, and were not allowed any interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but when it was decided that they were entitled to compensation no generous person came along to give them interest as well.  I am informed that as a result <Col N="2421" /> of interest being paid under one Damage to Property Scheme&mdash;in the case of awards made by the Shaw Commission&mdash;it had the effect of encouraging dilatoriness.  People were in no hurry in winding up their affairs or in bringing their claims to a conclusion. That was the experience of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The last remark made by the Minister shows that he does not understand what I am asking.  That may be partly due to my fault.  I may not have made myself clear, or it may be partly due to the fact that I put the period of six months in my amendment. If I had known that the Minister was going to accept 12 months I would have put in that period when drafting my amendment.  What I am asking has no relation to the question of dilatoriness.  I want to secure that once the State undertakes to pay a man £1,000&mdash;I am taking that sum for the sake of argument&mdash;whether that is by agreement with the Minister or through action in the court, from the time that is agreed upon, until the money is paid, interest on it should be paid at the rate set out in the amendment. That, to my mind, is a perfectly clear and reasonable proposal, the kind of thing which, in business, would be regarded as ordinary equity.  If I owe a certain sum of money and I am not able to pay it on the date it becomes due, and if I have to get the period extended by means of a bill or otherwise, I have to pay whatever interest may be agreed upon over the extended period.  If what I am seeking is not as clear as it should be, that is because I did not get the Minister's amendments before I had drafted mine.  If the State says that a man is entitled to £1,000, but that because of the war circumstances he cannot proceed to rebuild, or that for some other reason the claim cannot be paid, he should, in equity, since the State itself is saving interest, be paid ordinary interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not trying to embarrass the Minister.  I feel very strongly about this because I am of the opinion that, since the State saves by delaying in making the payment, there should be interest paid to the person concerned <Col N="2422" /> over the period in question.  This is not at all on a par with the question of consequential damage.  The Minister referred to previous Acts.  I am not familiar with the provisions of the 1933 Act, but it is because a certain amount of injustice did arise in connection with the earlier Acts that I feel so strongly we should not let anything of the kind occur again.  I would remind the Minister that in a very large number of the cases that came before the Shaw Commission a measure of consequential damage had been previously paid by the White Cross, and with this help it was possible for people to make other arrangements for the carrying on of their business.  The loans made to those people by the White Cross had to be paid out of the eventual compensation awarded, but only to the extent to which compensation was given.  We had a substantial amount of money in that national organisation, and, as I have said, loans were made available in certain cases.  There is no such organisation now.  That may be used later as an argument when we come to the question of consequential damage.  But, I think, it applies even in this case of interest that we are discussing. In connection with the claims that came before the Shaw Commission, the sums advanced, in quite a number of cases, were repaid to the White Cross Reconstruction Commission. The people concerned there had money all the time, so that the Minister's references to pre-Truce damage, and the dilatoriness of some of the people concerned, are not at all on a par with the case that we are discussing here.  I am perfectly certain, as a business man, that if I admitted a debt of £1,000, and if for some reason or other I was not able to meet it on the date arranged, and an amicable agreement was made to postpone payment for a further period, I would agree, since I was saving interest, that the man I owed the money to should get the interest.  It would be ordinary fair play, and that is what I am asking in this amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not want to divide the House on many of these amendments, but I feel that on this question of the payment of <Col N="2423" /> interest from the time a claim is admitted until it is paid, I will have to do so, so that Senators may have the opportunity of being recorded as saying that the proposal is a reasonable one. I do not at all regard this as being in any way consequential damage.  It is consequential only in the sense that there may be a reinstatement clause, or some other condition, which delays the making of the payment.  That is all that I am after at the moment.</P>

      <P>The only delay in reinstatement will be due to the war and to the difficulty of getting supplies. If we were assured that, when the court decision was given, the applicant could go ahead with the work, no difficulty would arise.  It is due to the fact that we cannot say that the applicant will be able to go ahead when the compensation is agreed upon that this difficulty arises.  The whole crux is due to our lack of knowledge as to when the war will end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose that, generally speaking, the State does not pay interest in cases of this kind.  If <Col N="2424" /> it does pay interest, under any circumstances, I think it would be only right interest should be paid in this case. However, I fancy the State is fairly conservative regarding the payment of interest on any money which it owes. If the State does allow interest in circumstances similar to those with which we are dealing, the unfortunate people who lost their all should, in this case, be paid interest.  If there is any precedent for the payment of interest, I would ask the Minister to consider the claims of these people.  If there is no precedent, I suppose the Minister will hardly establish one now.  Since the money will be owing these people, it is only fair they should get interest on it if there is any precedent for such action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the question which arises in this case is one of sympathy; it is a question of equity as amongst different claimants.  I know that it is not possible to make everything absolutely fair as amongst people who are bombed in this way.  In the nature of things, some people will suffer more than others and nothing we can devise in legislation will make matters perfectly level.  It is right that we should do whatever we can, particularly when the amount of money involved is comparatively small, to see that people who are bombed and who lose their property will be put in the same position.  For instance, a man who gets money without a reinstatement clause is better off than a person who gets an award accompanied by a reinstatement condition.  Similarly, a person whose property is taken over by the corporation and who has not to rebuild is better off than a person who has to rebuild his premises.  All that is <Col N="2425" /> asked here is that from the time the award is made&mdash;the amendment can, I think, be amended so as to make the period 12 months after the receipt of the application&mdash;the claimant should be paid interest until he is in a position to use the money.</P>
      <P>The point was made by the Minister that to insert this provision might encourage delay.  It could not encourage delay because if the claimant delays in making his claim payment of his compensation and interest will be delayed. Within 12 months from the making of the application, the Minister must give a decision.  All the amendment seeks is that, after application is made and after a decision is given by the Minister, interest should be paid if the money itself is not paid.  I do not think that the amendment would encourage delay of any kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Senator Hayes when he suggests that the amount involved would be very small.  We do not know how much it is likely to be.  It is to be hoped we shall have no more bombings and no more damage to property, but, even to deal with the amount of property which has been damaged in Dublin and elsewhere, will entail very heavy expenditure.  The amount that might be involved in the payment of interest might be small; we do not know.  The payment of interest would, probably, encourage people to be dilatory. That was the office experience in the one type of case with which it had to deal&mdash;what Senator Hayes described as the Shaw Commission cases.  There, interest was paid and it did mean a considerable delay.</P>

      <P>That is so, possibly, at the moment.  Everybody knows that there is a great shortage of building materials at present.  When that position will change will depend on when the war ends, and God only knows that.  There will be no desire on the part of the Minister to withhold payment.  If a reinstatement condition is attached to the award, in all probability that will mean a bigger award.  If there is no reinstatement condition, that will be taken into consideration by the Minister of the court in making the award.  Under Section 9 (1), paragraph (b), the price will be estimated in each case according to normal market conditions &ldquo;as at the date of the award.&rdquo;  That would allow for consideration of the difficulty regarding the cost of building materials.</P>

If there is to be reinstatement, the estimate will be on that basis and if I were responsible for administration in connection with the matter, I should have to bear that part of Section 9 in mind.  Bearing in mind the conditions &ldquo;at the date of the award&rdquo;, if the award is made within six months and there is difficulty in purchasing materials, that will be taken into account.  There is no precedent, so far as I am aware, save the precedent afforded by the Shaw Commission, for payment of interest in the way proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might say as one responsible for some later amendments that the proposals made by the Minister, in so far as sub-paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) are concerned, seem to me perfectly satisfactory.  I think the principle introduced by the Minister that, as far as larger items are concerned, they should have been insured against fire or theft is a perfectly reasonable one.  I do not see how anybody could suggest that the State should compensate for articles of the kind mentioned in these sections, if the owners had not gone to the trouble <Col N="2430" /> of insuring them against fire or theft. This test seems to me a very good idea and it might be extended perhaps to other parts of the Bill.  I am not, however, quite satisfied with the Minister's attitude in regard to sub-paragraph (iv).  Unless I have failed to grasp the meaning of the amendment, he seems to have, in effect, done nothing in regard to paragraph (iv).  I still think that where a business is carrying on a postal trade and obtains almost all its daily receipts from postal orders and post office money orders, it is very unfair to exclude claims in respect of such orders.  I have in mind a big business, not one that has been damaged, which has a specific insurance policy to cover its daily receipts. That policy covers cash, whether coins, notes, postal orders or cheques where they would be lost.  In most cases the cheques would not be lost, but they are specifically covered.  The Minister may have some reason which I cannot see for excluding postal orders.  It seems to me that if the postal orders and the money orders are Irish orders the State is going to gain if such orders disappear or are lost.  The money will then become the property of the State. There may be some difficulties involved, but it seems to me that up to the limit to which cash is permitted in respect of a business, possibly subject to some insurance clause, postal orders should be included within the categories of articles for which compensation may be claimed.</P>

      <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs, as stated before, is prepared to make payment in respect of postal orders or money orders destroyed or burned, in case there is any satisfactory evidence available to prove the loss.  That being so, I did not think it was necessary to cover money orders or postal orders in <Col N="2431" /> the same way as other items have been covered.  The same applies to currency notes and bank notes.  In regard to the Currency Commission, they will, on satisfactory evidence being produced, carry out the policy they have always carried out where evidence is available of loss or destruction of currency notes. If they are satisfied that they were in the possession or ownership of an individual they are prepared to refund.</P>

      <P>Where the claimants are in a position to claim from the Post Office, they are not at a loss and do not come under the Bill at all.  That is the position in regard to insurance companies.  Insurance companies will not pay you for anything you can get refunded elsewhere, because it is not a loss and you cannot get paid twice.  I am only concerned with the cases where they cannot be reclaimed.  There are a limited number of persons here whose business is almost entirely postal and who would depend on the postal orders.  Whereas in a large number of cases they would be able to claim, there may be cases where they would not, and, strange to say, the reason given by the Minister seems to be a reason why they should not be excluded.  It is only in the cases where they would not be refunded that they would be in a position to claim.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that a person who, in the course of his trade, has to keep stamps such as a person carrying on a postal trade, cannot claim for loss of stamps?  If that is so, the State will have gained by what is his loss.  It seems to me that, whereas in the case of a private house there would be the danger that somebody would say that he had a <Col N="2432" /> greater amount of stamps than he had, and it is not reasonable to carry a large stock of stamps in a private house, it is reasonable in the course of trade.  I suggest that the amendment as it stands is very much more fair. There will be only a limited number who carry stamps in the course of trade and, where they do so, it seems to be reasonable to pay compensation.  On the question of proof, it would be difficult for the persons carrying the stamps to give the requisite proof in order to sustain their claim.  They would only be able to do it by producing evidence that they had regularly kept a similar amount.  Otherwise, I am certain an insurance company would not look at them, and I am sure the Department of Finance would behave similarly.</P>

      <P>I must say I am rather on the side of the Minister.  I do not know how the additional words he wants to put in will restrict what he is trying to do.  Senator Douglas wants to give compensation to a person who is a collector or a dealer in strange or foreign postage stamps.  I think if you add after the words &ldquo;stock-in-trade&rdquo; the words &ldquo;as a philatelic dealer&rdquo; you are making assurance doubly sure.</P>

      <P>I will be frank.  If a business has normally got a substantial stock of stamps owing to the fact that the business is a postal one, I suggest that that is just as important and as much part of the business as drapery or some other class of goods and that it is not fair to exclude it.  They will have to prove to the court that it was part of their stock-in-trade.  As the amendment stands, for fear somebody would satisfy the court or possibly satisfy the Minister or his successor that stamps which they held for putting on envelopes in the course of ordinary business were stock-in-trade, the Minister wants to add the words &ldquo;as a philatelic dealer&rdquo;.  It is better as it stands, where as part of the trade it is necessary to carry a stock of stamps.  If the Minister says that he will not do that, well I will not divide the House upon it, and we must agree to his additional amendment. The question of a philatelic collection which I raised in my amendment is met.  The question of a philatelic dealer is also met.</P>

    <P>With regard to this amendment what the Minister said a few minutes ago, I take it, meant that Irish postal orders could be repaid here, but if British or belonging to some other country it was doubtful, as he did not see why he should repay them.  If this applied to an ordinary private house, where it would be a rare occurrence, I would not have raised this matter, because it would be a small one, but in the few cases where you have business carried on by post, and where the daily receipts are postal orders from various <Col N="2435" /> parts, and from Britain and Northern Ireland, it seems to me to be a pity to exclude them.  It is a small point to err on the side of exclusion where we could afford to deal with them.  I will not press the matter if the Minister will not budge, but I think he has not been as reasonable here as in the rest of the sections.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 29:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, before Section 10, to insert a new Section 10 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>10.&mdash;Compensation under this Act (whether awarded by the Minister or by the Court) in respect of an injury to which this Act applies shall be awarded in respect of the actual damage done to property and such consequential loss as in the opinion of the Minister is reasonable having regard to the circumstances of each particular case.  The decision of the Minister in regard to consequential loss shall be final, but before making his decision the Minister shall have reference to the standards applied by insurance companies in assessing claims under consequential loss policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that he has been reasonable about certain amendments. We will have to agree that he has been reasonable.  The Bill as originally introduced made no provision at all to meet consequential loss of any kind whatever.  Then the Minister in the other House inserted a sub-section in Section 10, by which, for housing accommodation, cost of removal of furniture, storage of any movable article, he provided compensation up to a limit of £30.  In the Dáil he made that £50, and on the last occasion here he promised to compensate for that <Col N="2437" /> particular kind of consequential loss at the discretion of the Minister, if the expenditure was reasonably incurred. He brought in an amendment to-day which is a very faithful fulfilment of that promise.  On the question of consequential loss, any person who has been a member of a Government even for a short time and anybody who listened to a Minister for Finance over a long period, as I have done, will appreciate that the Minister does not want to open wide the door for consequential loss and have himself involved in an immense number of claims.  I know that that is what he will tell me would result from the adoption of this amendment.  I am proposing that compensation be given for&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;actual damage done to property and such consequential loss as in the opinion of the Minister is reasonable having regard to the circumstances of each particular case&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am entirely in agreement that consequential loss should not form part of the court proceedings; that consequential loss, if it is to be compensated for at all, should be at the discretion of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Even with the limited amount of damage done already&mdash;and it has been very limited&mdash;an extraordinary variety of consequential loss, some of which everyone will agree ought to be compensated for, has been brought to my notice.  I feel that the Minister ought to take power to give compensation at his discretion, having regard to the circumstances of each particular case. In doing that I am not binding the Minister to make payment for every possible kind of consequential loss.  I am suggesting that he should make compensation in the circumstances of each particular case, and that he should do so having regard to the principle of consequential loss in insurance policies.  There are several examples.  There are people who lose wages owing to destruction of premises. Nobody will suggest that a person who loses wages should, so to speak, automatically go upon the State for his wages, but there are cases where a person will lose employment, and will <Col N="2438" /> find himself for a period without a job or without any other job which he could reasonably take.  He might be entitled to some compensation in that position.  He would certainly be entitled to more than ordinary unemployment insurance.  Take the case of another person working for himself. Assume that a shoemaker, running a small business, having an electric machine from the Electricity Supply Board and customers, now largely removed, in the surrounding area, was able to make £4 or £5 weekly. That man's machine is destroyed and he finds it impossible to get another one, or to secure premises in the area into which the Electricity Supply Board would be prepared to put a machine or into which the corporation would allow it.  His loss would be pretty substantial. When a person loses property or a house he gets fairly full compensation, but the man who loses a machine by which he made his livelihood gets no compensation for the loss he experiences while adjusting himself to new conditions.</P>
    <P>Take the case of people who own a certain amount of property from which they get rents.  They are proved to the satisfaction of the Minister to have had a certain amount of property but are comparatively poor people, with a profit of £3 or £4 a week to live on. They would get compensation for the property, which may be reinstated.  In the kind of case I am thinking of it is unlikely that the house would ever be rebuilt in the original form but it would be taken over by the local authorities.  The people may get compensation after a certain period, but in the intervening period some of them are in the position of the man who lost his job, as they would have lost their livelihood.  The Minister should have discretion to make a payment in that case without binding himself to meet the entire loss.  There are cases of that kind which might involve considerable hardship, but not the hardship which would accrue to a person owning a considerable amount of property, who will be awarded compensation for the portion destroyed. There are great inequalities in this <Col N="2439" /> matter.  Take the case of a person who lives in a house which he owns.  He would get compensation, under Section 10, as redrafted, for furniture removal, and for rent in the interim before reconstruction.  Take a different type of house-owner of which there are numbers in the city who lives in a house and rents rooms or a flat.  That person is in the same position as the shoemaker and his machine and under this Bill has no chance of getting any kind of compensation.  He loses the house and also loses his livelihood, as well as a certain amount of goodwill which can never be restored to him, whereas the ordinary occupier, the person earning a wage or a salary will in the end be put in much the same position as he was before.  A widow who made a living that way and who lost a house would be left without compensation. There are cases of people living in houses rent-free and tax-free, but at the same time making some profit out of them.  When the house is destroyed they find themselves in the position of having to secure alternative accommodation, and to pay for it, with no compensation for the property beyond the provision in the Bill.  I am aware of the difficulty in framing any kind of section which would enable the court to decide these matters.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, suggesting to the Minister to take it entirely out of the purview of the court and entirely into the discretion of the Minister, just as, in another matter, he mentioned that the Minister's award should be final. I am not bound to my own wording, but wish to make some arrangements whereby he could make payment where it appears to him that, in the circumstances of a particular case, payment should be made for consequential loss. I merely put down this wording for the purpose of raising this matter and having it discussed, and in an endeavour to persuade the Minister that, even without going so far as this amendment indicates, he might do something to enable him to meet the very hard kind of case I have mentioned&mdash;the case of a man who loses his living and that of a man or woman <Col N="2440" /> whose house was their living.  Our experience up to the present has led us to the certainty that there are very difficult and harsh cases.  I suggest that something should be done to meet these, without opening wide the door and allowing everybody who thinks he has a claim for consequential loss to come before a court to vindicate it.</P>

I thought I was going a long distance to meet Senator Hayes and others who spoke the last day in favour of more generous treatment for certain consequential losses covered by Section 10, in introducing the amendment in my name on the Order Paper to-day.

      <P>I hope that as far as the finances of the State are concerned, I will not be accused of being soft-hearted.  I do not think any Minister for Finance could face the barrage to which he would be subjected to open the door wider and wider.  At any rate, the Bill, as brought in originally and still as regards 99 per cent. of its provisions, maintains the principle of not involving payment for consequential losses.  Certainly, I did admit that there were hardships in cases brought specially to my notice as T.D. for part of the district concerned and officially as Minister for Finance; and I had to agree that it was necessary in justice and equity to make provision for them.  I cannot see my way to go further than I have agreed to go in accepting a certain wording by Senator Hayes in the course of the discussion on the last day here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2441" /> I know that there have been hardships, and that there are hardships existing now.  I am quite satisfied that the types of cases that Senator Hayes has in mind&mdash;perhaps individual cases which have been brought to his notice &mdash;probably do exist, but, if we once open the door to further payments for consequential loss, then it is hard to know where it will land us.  I cannot face what that probably would mean, as I see matters at present, even with the restrictions suggested by Senator Hayes himself, and even leaving the Minister as the final arbiter in the matter.  No Minister&mdash;least of all, myself&mdash;would like to be put in that position. As I have said over and over again, I hate the idea of its being suggested to me that I am acting unjustly. I would not like that to be thought in the House, but in all the circumstances, considering all the consequences that would flow from the widening of the door already opened to a certain extent as regards compensation for consequential loss, I believe it would mean such difficulties that I dare not face the consequences.</P>

      <P>Nobody on any side of the House accuses the Minister of being deliberately unjust, and if we have to argue with regard to certain matters in this Bill that seem to us to be unjust, we are not making anything in the nature of a personal attack on the Minister.  I would like to say I am satisfied that, from no side of the House, is this being debated in the sense of a Party measure, and I do not think anyone has tried to make capital or obtain publicity out of it.  Secondly, the Minister has met criticisms and has tried to meet them.  If some of us still feel that he is making a genuine mistake in not going further, and that he will regret it afterwards, that is not meant in the nature of bad faith, and is not a suggestion that he is not anxious to prevent hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would go further than Senator Hayes, as I do not think his amendment goes far enough.  Nevertheless, I do appreciate that the Minister must have certain limits.  I never have agreed that those limits would be difficult to frame in an Act of Parliament. <Col N="2442" /> Anyone who examines an ordinary fire (loss of profits) policy for a business will find in a comparatively short space&mdash;not in a few words, but certainly in a space which could easily fit into an Act of Parliament&mdash;that there are very definite limits to the consequential loss which can be paid under such policies.  It seems to me that it is not only not fair but not in the public interest to exclude completely such loss simply and solely because it is consequential or because it does not come within the very narrow limits of Section 10, sub-section (2), even as amended by the Minister.  The Minister's amendment to sub-section (2) goes a long way to meet the private individual who is living in the area or who may live in another area and who has to move to another place.</P>
    <P>There is every reasonable chance that that private individual will be fairly treated under the Bill as it is being amended to-day by the acceptance of the Minister's proposals.</P>
    <P>It completely excludes other types which seem to me of real importance. Let us take the case of businesses in the area that was bombed or in areas which may be bombed in future.  I accept definitely that you could not agree that if they simply sat there and did nothing they were to have unlimited compensation until such time as somebody would put a house for them, but what I do suggest is that if you are giving compensation at all you should give such compensation as will make it possible for these people to start again and, as far as is possible, to make them as well off though no better off than they were before the bombing.  I mean financially.  Unfortunately, we cannot deal with the mental and physical strain on people who had the misfortune to be in the bombed areas.</P>
    <P>If my business is destroyed by fire I am not entitled, under the policy I have, to unlimited compensation against loss of profits, but I am entitled to compensation against loss of profits for a short period to enable me to start somewhere else.  It is not a sufficient period to enable me to completely rebuild, but it enables me to carry on in the meantime, and as is <Col N="2443" /> usual under a loss of profits policy, it enables me to maintain a considerable portion of my staff and to pay their salaries while they are assisting me in finding alternative or temporary premises, so that the business will be maintained.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that if this Bill is passed as it stands now, in two or three years' time we will be ashamed of the fact that in this particular area in Dublin, assuming we have no more bombing, people who had trades were left there until the place could be rebuilt, with nothing whatever but the hope of compensation to rebuild their premises and to replace their stock at some future date&mdash;with nothing whatever to enable them to carry on.  The individual who resided there will have some compensation under sub-section (2) and I have no doubt the Minister will be just and reasonable as far as the operation of that section is concerned. His attitude here shows that that is his intention.  But the people who have business premises can get nothing.  I do not for a moment suggest that they should get compensation for loss of profits for a long period, but I do suggest that they should get the equivalent of profits to enable them to get started and to carry on the business in some other place, if they are willing to do it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take a lot of instances but in connection with this question of consequential loss I want to tell the Minister that since the last meeting of the Seanad I have been given a definite case of a lady who owns property which has been destroyed. This lady has been told by the rates officer of the Dublin Corporation that she must pay the rates because whoever dropped the bombs did not drop them before April 5th, that if they had been dropped before April 5th she would not be liable but because it was after April 5th she must pay the rates for this year.  Is it just to ask that person to pay the rates, which go to another public body, and to give her no compensation whatever for it? This happens to be a lady to whom I referred before, who has lost a very <Col N="2444" /> substantial number of houses.  It is her livelihood.  She is faced now with a demand that she must pay and if she does not pay now she will have to pay arrears later on.  When she can rebuild these houses, I do not know, but in consultation with architects and others, I think three or four years is the best we can reasonably hope for. Why should not the Minister take such powers as would be given, at any rate, under Senator Hayes's amendment to deal with a case of that kind?</P>
    <P>Take a completely different case&mdash;the case briefly referred to by Senator Hayes, but about which, it seems to me, he might have said a lot more, and about which I propose to say something. He referred to a boot repairer. As a result of damage to the premises where he worked he had to move elsewhere. He succeeded in getting another premises which would enable him to go on with his job, but the work he did depended on the operation of a three-phase machine.  The wiring in the new premises would not work the three-phase machine, and the Electricity Supply Board refused, under present conditions, to put in the stronger wiring if the corporation operate the machine.  This is a man who has been bombed out.  As I understand, the reason they gave was that he could buy a one-phase machine from them.  According to my information they said that they would put in the stronger wiring if the Corporation agreed, but they could not get that consent.  This unfortunate man tried to buy a one-phase machine on the hire purchase, and because of the circumstances and the fact that he had been bombed out, the only thing he could offer as security was the three-phase machine which he was operating.</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board would not give him a one-phase machine on hire purchase, and so, instead of earning £4 a week, this man is now earning barely 25/- a week for himself and his family.  There is loss consequential on the bombing, and also consequential on the strict interpretation of by laws by the Electricity Supply Board and the corporation.  I believe that that is the kind of thing the Minister would like to deal with.  I cannot see that he can <Col N="2445" /> deal with it under sub-section (2).  I think that is a completely different case, which is more or less a scandal.</P>
    <P>If these people are going to be left there just for fear we may open a door too wide, I say that I believe some day the Oireachtas of this State will be ashamed of the fact that after one serious bombing, they allowed these people to be left for two or three years without a way of earning a decent livelihood.  I have much sympathy with the Minister and I assure him I do appreciate the way he has met us, and I would like him to believe that I am speaking as I am now partly because of my previous experience, partly because I did see what people suffered from previous destruction and because I feel there is a matter which I would call justice, but if we leave out the word &ldquo;justice&rdquo; for fear of being misunderstood, I feel it is a reasonable duty of the State.  I do not believe it is beyond the wit of the draftsman to provide for a kind of consequential damage which would be limited and which would be such as could have been insured under a loss of profits policy or such as would be covered under an ordinary fire policy, which does not cover a great deal of consequential damage but usually covers a certain amount.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is too late now to make an appeal to the Minister, but I would appeal to the House.  Is the Seanad really satisfied that we should cut this out?  Is the Seanad satisfied that we should not send back, with full respect to the Minister, a message to the Dáil that we think there should be some consequential damage put in this Bill? I believe there ought to be.  I believe a genuine mistake is being made.  I believe it is being made in good faith; I believe it is due to unnecessary fear, but I believe this is just one of the cases where we cannot afford, simply for fear it might involve too much expenditure, to treat people in a way which they will feel is unfair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not previously intervened in this debate but I must say that I fully appreciate the industry displayed by Senator Douglas and Senator Hayes and the manner in <Col N="2446" /> which the Minister has met every case which has been raised. The tone and temper of the discussion has been pleasing to every Senator, whether he has been taking part in it or is merely a listener, as I have been.  I should like the Minister to accept the amendment, to reconsider the decision which apparently he has taken.</P>
      <P>I think Senator Douglas has made a case which is unanswerable.  The Minister argues, not on the basis of the justice or the right of claimants to consequential loss, but rather because of the fear that the burden for the State is going to be too heavy.  There is a question of morality involved in this, and, if we are to take a decision on such a question, we have to ask ourselves on whom are we going to impose the greater burden.  Pursuing the Minister's line, you will definitely impose a burden on a number of people, the consequences of which you cannot see at the moment.  It may mean the breaking of some families or the health of responsible members of families.  I do not think the acceptance of this amendment will break the State.  It would take much more than that to break the State.  It is a decision that the Minister could take with the full support of the House and, I believe, of the Dáil as well.</P>
      <P>I am convinced of the justice of the plea made by Senator Hayes, and supported by Senator Douglas.  I suggest that it is merely a question of expediency that the Minister is going to decide against.  He feels he is going to open the door too widely, and that he will have a flood of claims that the State can hardly bear.  If you are going to rule out people whose claims are so just that you could not turn them down, if you are going to prevent their claims being heard, and adequate compensation being paid, simply because other people may make claims which are not sustainable, that is scarcely reasonable. In my opinion, you should leave the door open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder what would happen in case a bomb fell on some extensive farming premises.  Has there been any consideration of the consequential loss <Col N="2447" /> which might be involved in an occurrence of that sort?  In an agricultural paper issued recently I read a very interesting letter from a County Dublin farmer who has 120 dairy cows.  He talks of the cows yielding five gallons each a day.  I know that farmer, and I know his premises.  I assume that he is selling the highest grade milk at not less than 2/- a gallon.  One bomb might destroy that premises and 120 valuable cows, and do away with an immense income.  So far as I know, there is no provision for any consequential loss which that farmer would suffer if his premises were bombed.  Has any consideration been given to a case of that type?  Quite conceivably such a case might arise.</P>
    <P>I know this problem is a very troublesome one for people who have had to destroy cattle because of foot-and-mouth disease.  It is really a matter of major importance.  In many cases the result will be that the value put on stock and paid to the farmer will be eaten up before the farmer is able to get back again to business.  That would be disastrous for farming generally if it were to be in any sense widespread. I do not know if such an occurrence as that has been brought to the Minister's notice.  Has he given any consideration to the possibility of a bomb destroying a cowshed in which there are cows capable of yielding 800 gallons of milk a year, milk which could be sold at 2/- a gallon?  The consequential loss in such a case would be very serious.  The Minister should undoubtedly make some provision for an incident of that type.</P>
    <P>Let us hope that the State will not have to meet so many of those claims as would make it quite impossible for the Minister to deal adequately with them.  But if he has to decide between turning down cases where obviously, by so doing, he would not be dealing fairly with the claimant, or leaving the door open to people making unlimited claims, claims that he will have an opportunity of turning down, then I suggest he ought to leave the door open.  One can appreciate the Minister's rather conservative attitude because of what <Col N="2448" /> he thinks the State can carry in future. The State can carry just as much as its citizens collectively are able to carry, and they will carry what we make it possible for them to carry.  If we put them out of production and do not give them a chance of getting back again into production, the total capacity of the State to carry burdens is reduced to the extent to which the capacity of each individual is reduced.</P>

      <P>I should like the people who are supporting this amendment to visualise the position if it were accepted.  I cannot imagine what would be an adequate description of consequential loss.  As soon as a case would come to be decided by the Minister, would he be approached by various Deputies and Senators anxious to point out to him what a very serious case it was and the terrible hardship imposed on the individual concerned? It would be very hard to decide where to draw the line.  Are you to compensate people who have lost members of their families?  If you are to be consistent, you must do that.</P>

      <P>That is a different matter.  If we were to follow this to its logical conclusion, we could put up an argument in support of consequential loss in connection with foot and mouth disease.  We could argue that where people lose a herd of dairy cows they are compensated for the standard value of the cows, and I should like to know from Senator Baxter what value he would put on a herd of dairy cows from the point of view of consequential loss. Would he put the matter in the hands of the Minister for Agriculture, who would be the sole authority?  I suggest the people supporting this amendment ought not to press it.  I think the Minister's attitude is reasonable.</P>

      <P>I have great difficulty on this point.  The only thing I can see, looking at it in a rather rough way, is that no man should be put on the rates or deprived of his bare livelihood <Col N="2449" /> by reason of bomb damage.  I do not see why the Minister should not, in his own discretion, work within the reasonable limits of that test.  It is not so much what a person loses as what a person really needs for a livelihood. Senator Douglas mentioned the case of a man earning so much a week, but even the Minister might say: &ldquo;I cannot give you all you earned before.  I think you were earning more than was necessary for your livelihood, but so far as your livelihood is concerned, I feel that you should be met,&rdquo; the principle being that nobody should be made to go to the public assistance officer by reason of any damage he suffered owing to bombing.</P>

      <P>I have in mind the case of the bombing at Campile.  That creamery was bombed and lives, unfortunately, were lost, but some hands there were not killed, and these have had to leave the place because there was no work for them.  The assistant manager is still idle and has lost his livelihood.  He has made every effort to get a position, but has failed, and I think he should be considered as a case for compensation because, through no fault of his own, he has lost his position. He was a first-class qualified man and, as I have said, has since failed to get a position.  Cases of that kind&mdash; and there are probably similar cases in Dublin&mdash;of men who were working hard and getting on, and who have lost their position, should be considered. As Senator Sir John Keane says, they should not be put on the rates.  The Government should be manly enough to compensate them, at least for the present, until they get some means of livelihood.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment.  It does not propose to open wide the door, but only that it should be left slightly ajar, and that the Minister should stand as a kind of Cerberus or watch-dog at the door. The Minister, I think, has not enough confidence in himself, if he doubts his ability to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; if the public in-interest requires that &ldquo;no&rdquo; should be said.  We all have the greatest respect for the Minister and for his capacity to fight, and to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; if &ldquo;no&rdquo; is <Col N="2450" /> the right thing to say, and I think he might easily share that confidence which we have in him and accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>The subject matter of this amendment is certainly very wide.  We would all like the Minister, or rather the State, to make some provision for consequential losses, but if I were Minister for Finance, which I never will be, I would not accept the amendment as it is proposed because it would open the door for everybody to use brow-beating methods to get an <i>ex-gratia</i> grant from the Minister.  I should not like to see the Minister in that position at all.  I would rather have set down in black and white in the Act what the system of estimation of consequential losses should be.  To leave it to the Minister himself, I think would put the Minister in the position that everyone of us could afterwards say: &ldquo;You paid compensation to So-and-so and you did not pay it to somebody else&rdquo;, and we would have people mean enough to say that, for political reasons, one applicant got compensation, while another did not. I think that would be a wrong position for the Minister to be in.</P>
      <P>Everyone of us feels that there have been great hardships and the possibility stares us in the face that there may be greater, or as great, hardships in the future.  I was glad that Senator Baxter brought this matter into the country because we do not know where similar incidents may occur in the future.  The outlook of the man in the country as well as the man in the city is involved, though it is assumed that the cities and coastal towns are the more likely to suffer damage.  The fact remains, however, that any portion of the country may suffer from one of these incidents.  Senator Baxter may be glad to know that the highest grade milk producers who lost their stock through the foot and mouth disease are back in business again, but there is this difference, that they got their money straight away, and, as soon as the restrictions were removed, were able to get back into business.</P>

      <P>And they are delivering in the City of Dublin.  The fact is, however, that they got compensation&mdash;there was no allowance for consequential losses in respect of foot and mouth compensation&mdash;and got their money immediately.  The moment the restrictions were withdrawn, they were able to get back into business. In the case we are discussing, a person who gets compensation might not be able to start immediately to rebuild his premises in order to enable him to get back into business.  There is that difference certainly.</P>
      <P>Senator Douglas mentioned consequential losses from the trader's or businessman's point of view and other speakers have mentioned the consequential losses of employers and others.  We should all like to satisfy everybody and I regret that the State, as represented by the Minister, cannot go any further.  On the other hand, we on this side are here to help and support the Minister.  We should like to convince him, with the people on the opposite side, of the necessity for doing as well as he can, but, if this amendment is put to a division, I must support the Minister.  I do not think we can go any further in inducing him to be more soft-hearted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all realise that there have been hardships and we should all like to see difficulties rectified.  We are all prepared to talk about it, and, I assume, to pay for it, but the man with the purse insists that we are going too far in trying to provide for these payments. The victims of the bombing incidents are people to whom our hearts went out in generosity of action and generosity of subscription, and our hope is that we shall not have any more of these incidents.  I think we are all quite satisfied that we want to be as generous as we can to those who <Col N="2452" /> have suffered damage and to those people who have suffered in their persons, but if the Minister says: &ldquo;So far shall I go and no further&rdquo;, I am afraid that I shall have to decide to support his point of view, but more or less unwillingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Magennis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan says that if this amendment goes to a division he must vote against it.  It prompts me to ask both him and others: Why should the amendment go to a division?  Whatever may be urged in the way of meticulous criticism of the wording of the amendment, every reasonable man, it seems to me, must say that the speech with which Senator Hayes recommended it was thoroughly convincing, and the conviction was deepened, in my case, by the speech of Senator Douglas.  The Minister, as is quite proper in view of his high responsibility, is acting very strictly, even rigorously, and indeed as sternly as it is possible for a man of his temperament, but I would ask him&mdash;what is the principle that rules in the case of compensation to dependents for the loss of their breadwinner?  Consider that fairly and squarely, and then take the incident that Senator Hayes put before us in outline, and that Senator Douglas gave us in detail. What has the man lost?  He has lost the instrument they referred to, not merely a piece of property, but the instrument with which he had been making his living.  Senators remember the famous passage: &ldquo;You take my life when you take the means by which I live.&rdquo;  A widow who has a house over her head maintains the home by having the remainder of the premises let in flats.  If that fabric is destroyed by a bomb, does she lose the house, or lose the instrument whereby she maintains the home?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite easy, I think, for anybody who approaches the matter sympathetically&mdash;and that is exactly what the Minister would do in the case of these applications&mdash;to distinguish between what is really consequential damage. Consequential damage, in the eyes of a lawyer, is either direct or remote.  I have myself heard applications dismissed in court on the grounds that the <Col N="2453" /> damage was too remote.  &ldquo;Too remote&rdquo; is an accepted legal formula, but here the damage is not remote. I cannot see that there is a separation possible, in point of fact, between the damage and what we have to speak of as its result&mdash;what the man loses, something in the absence of which he is not a wage-earner or a profit-earner as he had been heretofore.  If, as Senator Hayes indicated, the instrument that he had was one that was irrecoverable, one that could not be provided, or, if it could be provided in the circumstances that Senator Douglas referred to, but could not be used, then I think any judge of the High Court&mdash; and in this case the Minister&mdash;would have to decide that it really was not a case coming under the ordinary head of consequential damage, but was a direct injury.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is willing to apply the same sympathetic judgment that he did on the last day, I do not see why he should not accept the principle that lies not merely behind Senator Hayes's amendment but beneath it which, I contend, is the very principle on which compensation is made to those who have lost their breadwinner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCampbell" hpid="Mr. Campbell Mr. Campbell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators, I do not wish to accuse the Minister of being unjust in regard to the matters raised in these amendments.  Senator Hayes, I think, made an excellent case for this amendment.  I have no complaint to make with regard to the discussion of details that has taken place. I am, however, not satisfied with regard to the attitude of mind manifested towards the problem that has arisen out of the bombings in Dublin. Our attitude ought to be to restore those people to the position they occupied before the bombings took place.  As citizens they are entitled to that.  This State and this Parliament, I think, ought to see that they are restored to that position.  Senator Hayes quoted the example of the shoemaker who has been deprived of his living. Several cases of that kind have been brought to my notice.  As I have said, my opinion is that all those people ought to be restored to the position in which they were before the bombings took place.  The same thing should <Col N="2454" /> apply to people living out of the rentals of houses.  They have suffered considerable consequential loss.  They have had to pay their rates and taxes.  We have been told of the woman who was compelled to pay her rates because the bombing took place on a certain date.  I have no desire to minimise or decry in any way the efforts of voluntary bodies like the Red Cross or other associations for the help they have given.  But I do think it is a bit degrading to the people who have suffered to find certain organisations advertising for cast-off and second-hand clothes so that they might get them cleaned to dole out to the sufferers of the bombing.  The latter were not accustomed to attire themselves in second-hand clothes.  I think it is the primary responsibility of the State to see that proper provision is made for those who have suffered or who may suffer in the future, though we all hope we will not have any more bombing.  At any rate, I think the State should see to it that, if anything of the kind should happen again, proper arrangements will be made to feed, clothe and house the sufferers.  They should not be left to depend on charity. I do not care to see Mr. Bumble or Lady Bountiful too prominent in matters of this kind.  As I have said, I do not want to minimise or decry in any way the efforts of voluntary bodies.  I would appeal to the Minister to be as sympathetic as possible in dealing with this question.  May I say that I do not think we could have a more sympathetic Minister to deal with it?  He has been very reasonable so far.  Hence, I would urge on him to pay attention to the strong representations made by Senator Baxter, Senator Douglas, Senator Hayes and others to approach this problem from the point of view of restoring these people to as good a position as that which they occupied before the bombing took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say, before the Minister concludes, that this is not a political matter.  I was asked to attend a meeting which was held on Monday night in the North Strand, and to be quite frank I did not go because I felt that if some extreme <Col N="2455" /> speeches were made I might find myself in the position of having to defend the Ministerial attitude, or if, on the other hand, any kind of a political wrangle took place as between representatives the people it would really not help in the object which we have in view.  Now, who are the people who have suffered from this bombing, or who may suffer in the future?  They are citizens of ours.  Nothing whatever that they can do, no step of any kind that a business man or a householder can take, will prevent damage if an aeroplane drops a bomb.  So that the people who have been injured, as well as those we contemplate providing compensation for under this Bill, are people who can do nothing whatever to help themselves.  They are in no degree blameable.  Suppose they had an insurance policy, any and every insurance policy is void.  No insurance policy that any of us may have, or might conceivably have, will cover damage done by foreign bombers.  So much having been said, the question is: Can we put them back in the position in which they were?  We should like to do that, but I think we cannot do so. I do not think that it is possible for us to put the people back in the position in which they were, though, in the case of some classes of people, this Bill goes a considerable distance in that direction&mdash;as far as a reasonable person could expect any Government or any Minister to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there are things we can do. I explained, when speaking before on this amendment, that I did not want, by any means, to open the door wide to consequential damage.  Senator Johnston put the matter very neatly when he said that we wanted to have the door ajar, with the Minister inside awatch.  Apart from keeping watch himself, the Minister has a plentiful supply of good watchdogs in the Department of Finance, without using the word &ldquo;watchdog&rdquo; in any offensive sense.  It is open to the Minister to tell me&mdash;and I should accept it&mdash;that nobody charged with governmental administration could make himself responsible for an amendment which would open the door wide to consequential <Col N="2456" /> damage.  I accept that fully and at once.  I do not want to do that but, while I do not want to do that, I think we should not cripple the people concerned.  I do not think that the amendment as it appears on the paper is satisfactorily drafted and, if the Minister were to accept the principle of the amendment, or part of the principle, I should almost give him a promise in advance that I should accept his drafting.  I am sufficiently experienced to know that no Minister for Finance in any Government will accept the drafting of a member of either House in a matter in which public money is involved.  I did not think that this Bill would go through all its stages in the two Houses before the Recess, and I did not take steps to find out all that it was possible to find out about it, but from what I have ascertained since this Bill was published, I am genuinely convinced, by information given me, that there are cases of consequential damage not met by Section 10, as now amended, which really ought to be met and which could be met in a limited way by the Minister.</P>
    <P>For example, there is no compensation for loss of profits either in business or by way of rents but a property owner or householder is, under this legislation, still left with his original liabilities.  In other words, the Bill says &ldquo;We are sorry we cannot do anything about your liabilities.  You will have to pay your ground rent and rates but we cannot compensate you for the loss you suffer during the period before your business is restarted.&rdquo;  I have been genuinely convinced that a case can be made for small people or working people and for business people.  I suggest that the Minister could devise rules&mdash;they are not set out in this amendment&mdash;or he could take power to make regulations under which he could make an attempt to meet these reasonable cases.  Senator MacCabe referred to the case of a creamery manager. That creamery manager is in a much worse position, if I am not greatly mistaken, than a creamery manager whose creamery was amalgamated under the Creamery Act.  I do not recollect the precise terms of <Col N="2457" /> that legislation, although I heard a great deal about it, but I think that, in the case of a redundant creamery which was discontinued by State action for particular purposes, the manager had to be found alternative employment or, if he was not found alternative employment, he had to get compensation on some particular basis.</P>

      <P>That particular treatment was not regarded as generous and the Minister for Finance of the day was badgered to make it better. Surely, that was a much better position for the creamery manager than the position occupied by the man who was managing the Campile creamery. Surely, that particular employee should be in as good position as the manager of a redundant creamery whose employment was taken from him by the State for special purposes.  That is an example of a precedent for certain types of compensation.  I think the Minister should devise some rules in this connection.  Take my own case. At the moment&mdash;God between us and all harm&mdash;if my private house were destroyed by a bomb, I should be fairly covered by this Bill as it now stands. I should get compensation, eventually, for the building and for the furniture. I have an insurance policy which would make my position clear.  I should get compensation for watches, jewellery and personal ornaments, within the limits of my insurance policy, and I should get compensation for removal and for reasonable expenditure incurred until I should get back into my own house or a similar house.  I should not get compensation&mdash;this answers the point raised by Senator Quirke&mdash; for any suffering or anguish on the part of myself, my wife or family arising out of the bombing.  Senator Quirke is mistaken when he thinks that there is any provision in any Act, or in any law of this kind, to compensate people for the anguish which the loss of relatives involves.</P>

      <P>One cannot get compensation for loss of a child, although it is an immense loss to a parent.  The only loss contemplated is loss calculable in terms of cash.  The Minister has said that he proposes to make provision for personal injuries but, if the father of a family is killed by a bomb, the compensation will be paid according to the degree of dependency.  It will not depend on the amount of anguish suffered.  To continue my own case, that case is quite well met by the Bill.  The other case I mentioned&mdash; that of a woman who is left by her husband to carry on with a house and furniture&mdash;is not so fully met by the Bill. She does not get anything like the compensation that a married man in employment would get for the loss of his house.</P>
      <P>As between different kinds of people, there are certain inequalities.  I do not say that the Minister, with the best will in the world, could remove all these inequalities.  I do not think he could but I think he could frame an amendment and devise rules to meet the kind of cases we have mentioned here which are not met by the Bill and which involve serious inequalities between citizens who have suffered a disaster which no precaution of theirs could have avoided.  The Minister has until next week if he desires to consider this matter and frame an amendment. He could bring in the amendment next week, on the Fourth Stage of the Bill, and I am sure the House would be quite willing to give him then not only the Fourth Stage but the Final Stage.  He could do this, too, in case he fears any technical difficulty in the matter: bring in a form of words, tell us&mdash;I shall accept it from him&mdash;that he is not quite satisfied with the words and will not guarantee that he will move for their acceptance by the Dáil. When the Bill goes back to the Dáil, the Minister could re-amend it&mdash;I know he could also reject the amendment completely&mdash;so as to tighten it up.  I am not arguing for a loose regulation under which compensation could be dealt with.  I am arguing for tight regulation.  That is why I have used the phrase &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister, is reasonable having regard to the circumstances of each particular case.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Nature&rdquo; might be better than &ldquo;circumstances.&rdquo;  I understand the Minister's difficulty.  Senator O'Donovan alluded to it, too.  If the Minister gets power to do anything in this way, what he does will be an administrative act and he can be challenged in the Dáil about it.  I appreciate too&mdash;I have every reason to do so&mdash;that when a Minister has power to make certain grants, he may be challenged as to why he makes a grant in a particular case and does not do so in another.  It should not be beyond the wit of the Minister, his Department and draftsmen, to frame a form of words which would give him a principle to work upon and, at the same time, allow him some discretion.  Without delaying the Bill one day or one hour and without subjecting himself to any barrage of questions, he could before next week frame an amendment and, within a period of a month, he could frame another amendment or other regulations which could be put into the Bill in the Dáil.  I would appeal to the Minister to recognise that, while certain types of persons are being met, there is another type of person who is not being met at all.  I do not want to raise any false hopes in the hearts of anybody who suffered loss under these bombings.  Some people are doing their best to amend the Bill, and it is being done from several parts of this House, but whatever the Minister may agree to, it will not amount to what people want, and I am afraid that he cannot give them what they want.  I think, however, that he could take a step which would go a certain distance to make more general and more equitable the compensation for consequential loss, and, for my part, I would not be critical in any way of any amendment, which the Minister would draft, which was restrictive and which made it difficult to get compensation for consequential loss, if you like, so long as it did, at any rate, leave it open that where there was a difficult case the case could be met.  For example, the <Col N="2460" /> case of the creamery manager is one, and there is another case in which, I am sure, something could be devised by way of restriction in point of time. If you were going to compensate the shoemaker who has been mentioned, he would not be so badly off if, within a certain period of months&mdash;six months, let us say&mdash;he was able to get back to the position in which he was.  I do not want these particular occurrences, or any future occurrences of their type, to be made the excuse for thrusting people on State funds, but I would ask the Minister to consider the matter on that basis, and to realise that he has another week here and another month, between then and the time the Bill goes to the Dáil, before he finally binds himself.  If he would do that, I am sure he would get a very favourable and sympathetic consideration from the House.  If this amendment is defeated, Sir, we shall have disposed of Senator Douglas's amendment and my own, No. 34.</P>

      <P>When speaking last week on this measure I said that I was in favour of reasonable compensation in respect of consequential losses.  I still am, but I must say that the Minister's amendment to Section 10 has somewhat met what I had in my mind, and I think it probable that the Minister may deem it advisable to open the door still another inch or two.  The way in which, I think, the Minister could do the greatest service to those who have been affected in this matter would be to have his staff devise a really expeditious way of reconstructing the damaged premises.  We can all realise, and do realise, that every month that will elapse will mean that the consequential losses will be getting greater, especially in the case of business premises.  The greatest loss that any man, who is living by a business, can sustain is the loss of his business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I would impress on the Minister, from past experience, that the greatest help he can give to these people would be by having things so <Col N="2461" /> organised, by the time the Bill becomes an Act, that the work of reconstruction could be started immediately.  I believe that it would be well for him to have three or four expert assessors ready, and they could have a preliminary report on the possible damage and on the cost of reconstruction within a few months.  I remember that in the case of the White Cross Organisation, with which my friend, Senator Douglas, was very closely associated, in about six months the amateur investigators concerned had ready a report of the possible loss and the possible cost of reconstruction in the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties, and when the final assessment came, under the Shaw Commission, it was found that they were not so far out at all, although they were really only amateurs.  I suggest, therefore, that if the Minister has experienced assessors ready to proceed with the work the moment this Bill becomes an Act, that will be the greatest means which the Minister could devise of seeing that the consequential loss is kept small.</P>
    <P>We must realise that payment under this Bill is really, in a sense, an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment.  We understand, from the Minister, that there will be another Bill dealing with this matter of consequential loss.  There is also the possibility of compensation from another quarter, and I am sure that the Minister will treat the cases generously and will not want to make any profit out of the transaction.  Therefore, the people affected will have a reasonable hope that the award now made will be increased to a greater extent, if this case is made by the State.  There is a possibility that a full and proper compensation will be given, and, if there is, I am sure the Minister is not going to make any profit out of the transaction, and will only deduct what the State has already subscribed, from the amount which will be received.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can press the Minister any further.  He seems to be very reasonably disposed, and, as far as I am concerned, I am quite satisfied to leave the matter in his hands. Listening to the remarks of my friends on the Front Bench, I was wondering <Col N="2462" /> how the findings of the Shaw Commission, for instance, were ever accepted. In the case of the Shaw Commission, most of the people whose business houses had been affected were out of business for seven or eight years, living on their friends and on the amount that might be awarded for their stock and furniture.  They had to live on that, and there was never one penny provided, although we were dealing with the wealthiest country in the world, by way of compensation for consequential loss.  Not one single penny was paid, and those people had to wait seven or eight years without compensation for consequential loss.  I do not propose that that should happen again, but we must be reasonable.  The misfortune came, and we must bear some portion of it, and if another State is good enough to bear another portion of it, I think we must be thankful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of what Senator Honan said, except the matter of the reinstatement clause.  It is not a question of the money that should be put up by the Minister or by any other Minister.  The fact is that, because of the lack of materials, it would be impossible in my opinion to carry on any extensive building scheme at the present time.  In connection with Senator Johnston's speech, he suggested that he doubted the Minister's ability to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I do not think that is a fair statement to make.  Anybody who has had any contact with the Minister for a number of years will have no doubt of his ability to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; when he feels it is necessary to do so.  It would appear to me that his difficulty here is that he cannot say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  If he were in a different position, I am sure that, like the rest of us, he would be as anxious as anybody to do what he could for everybody, provided he had no responsibility in the matter.  I wonder what would be Senator Hayes's attitude if he were in the Minister's position?  I would ask the Senator to be reasonable and not press the Minister on this matter.  Nobody knows better than Senator Hayes what the difficulties are, and I believe that the Minister would go as far as any other man in <Col N="2463" /> the country to meet the amendment or any similar amendment.</P>

      <P>The reply of Senator Quirke, if taken seriously, amounts to a condemnation of the Minister in bringing in this Bill at all, because, why bring in what has been rightly described, a moment ago, as an <i>ex-gratia</i> measure if the Minister is to be asked to be so vigorous and relentless in his custody of the public purse?  I could understand what Senator Quirke has said, if it were said as against a demand for some extraordinary expenditure on the part of the State, but the cases put forward here by the supporters of the amendment must be from their very nature very few in number.  If the cases are dealt with in respect to their peculiar nature, then the Minister is in the position of judge and jury and he can decide.  There are all sorts of legal decisions to guide him.  Those unfamiliar with the law are apparently unaware that judgments are reached by reference to previous decisions, that there are leading cases.</P>
      <P>We are not asking the Minister to be generous.  I refuse to ask any Minister to be generous with the public purse, but I want him to do the right thing.  The arguments of the supporters of the amendment draw attention to peculiar cases which are not covered and which to my mind should be covered.  There is damage and consequential damage.  There is consequential damage, approximate and remote, and there are degrees of remoteness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious to anybody who examines this matter without being guided by mere clichés and the usual kind of talk which one hears when there is a question of spending money, that there is room for favourable consideration of losses that the amendment has in contemplation.  The loss may be one which is not directly a consequence of the harm done, but is nevertheless an integral part of the harm done.  Compensation is not compensation at all unless this integral element is covered.  That is the case I make for the amendment.  If I were to <Col N="2464" /> talk of the Minister's present attitude, I could say there is no Minister with regard to whom we might feel more assured that he will do what he deems right.  The only question is whether he is clear as to what is the right thing to do.  We seek to guide him as far as we feel we are capable.  We are not resisting a monster of iniquity who is such a custodian of the public purse that he will do wrong things in order to save money.  We are not taking up that silly attitude.</P>

      <P>I hate, on a matter of this kind, this talk of <i>ex-gratia</i> payments. It suggests that a person is getting something which he should not get.  It does not mean that I know, but to certain people's minds that is the idea which is conveyed.  Here we are in a neutral State in which the property of any of us might have been damaged by this series of bombings. I am convinced that in these circumstances we have got to share the losses which have been incurred by the people whose homes and businesses were actually destroyed.  Any other course would be contrary to the national morale and to the national spirit.  That I think was the view of the Government in introducing this Bill; otherwise it would not have been introduced at all.  I support Senator Hayes' amendment, although it does not go so far as I should like it to go.  I want to suggest to the Minister that the amendment, in effect, means that to him is left the responsibility, after he has seen the kind of claims that will be made and the kind of hardship that has been suffered, of making for his own Department certain regulations that will apply to all cases up to the present.  If there are further bombings he will have to examine the claims made in respect of damage inflicted by these bombings and make other regulations for them.  It is not intended that he should personally attend to each case.  What to my mind is envisaged in the amendment, when it suggests that compensation should include such consequential loss as in the opinion of the Minister is reasonable having regard to the circumstances of each particular case, is that <Col N="2465" /> having examined some of these cases he could set down for his Department certain limits within which consequential damage might be allowed.  I believe that a good deal of the present controversy about the Bill is due to the fact that these matters were not dealt with when the Bill was being drafted.  I would urge the House to say to the Dáil that there should be some provision for consequential damage in specific cases.  If the Dáil and the Minister, after further consideration, still refuse to provide for such compensation, I would not press the matter any further or try to alter the Bill.</P>

If we adjourned consideration of the amendment to Report Stage, the Minister might be able to bring in an amendment which would meet the wishes of all Parties.</P>

      <P>I think that, on the whole, the Minister must be convinced that on all sides of the House there has been a genuine desire to help him in this very difficult task.  He is the guardian of the public purse and has to be careful of it, but the public who fill that purse have already shown that they would like to share the burden of those people who, through no fault of their own, suffered great losses in the recent bombings.  The Minister himself brings forward this Bill as an acknowledgment of that desire of the Irish people.  At the same time, the Bill even if the amendment which the Minister has opposed were inserted, does not, as I think has been shown conclusively, cover every case of direct hardship and direct suffering caused by the bombing. I would join with those who pleaded with the Minister to give further consideration to such cases as have been brought before his notice.  They cannot <Col N="2466" /> be very great in number, and I think the people whose money we are spending will not feel that the Minister is imposing any undue hardship upon them if he spends a little more in helping these cases.</P>

      <P>I think those Senators who addressed their appeals to the Minister are directing them to the wrong quarter.  I think it is to Senator Quirke we should appeal.  If the Whips were taken off there is no doubt what the fate of this amendment would be. The Minister must see that 90 per cent. of the members of this House are absolutely in favour of it.  It is a just and reasonable amendment.  We are making arrangements under which compensation will be paid, and surely this is one case that has a greater claim than most others.  The Minister's own Party has made a much better case for the amendment than Senator Hayes.  I think Senator O'Donovan certainly made an excellent case for it when he concluded by saying that he would be reluctantly compelled to vote against the amendment.  To my mind, that is the view of Senators generally on that side of the House.  Our interest in the amendment is to ensure that working people who lost their employment and who suffered damage, people who are least able to bear this suffering and loss, should get consideration in this matter.  If the Minister feels that there is any possible hope of meeting the amendment, surely it is not unreasonable to ask him to defer a decision on the matter until Report Stage, or even to the subsequent stage.  If the Minister feels that a decision of this kind would entail too much responsibility for him, surely some tribunal or committee, in lieu of the Minister, might be set up to deal with the matter.  That would relieve him of what might be alleged against him in the future.  I think that this amendment is certainly one of the most important, if not the most important one which has been put forward.  I earnestly appeal to the Minister to look into this matter further, and see if there is any possibility of meeting the amendment put forward by Senator <Col N="2467" /> Hayes.  If he is not prepared to do that, I appeal to Senator Quirke to take the Whips off and let us have a free vote.</P>

There must, however, be hundreds of cases such as those quoted by Senator Hayes of the workman who was deprived of his means of living and of the widow who was left a house and furniture and whose house was bombed.  The Bill, as I say, is an excellent one and the Minister should not stultify himself by allowing this Section 10 to stand as it is.  He should at least keep the door open.  I believe that the Government will much regret later on that they have closed the door and stultified themselves by putting an Act on the Statute Book that will have to be amended in time so great will the hardship be in many cases.  I am sure that the Minister can, in his own sympathetic way, find ways and means of <Col N="2468" /> dealing with this and not close the door on the matter of consequential loss.</P>

      <P>I wish to join in the appeal that has been made not alone from this side, but the other side of the House.  The considered opinions and the reasoned arguments put forward and the convincing demands that have been made I am sure will ultimately find a kindly and sympathetic response in the heart of the Minister. Some writer on constitutional government has told us that amongst the primary functions of government the first is to maintain law and order and the second to give to the majority of the people the maximum of comfort, peace and prosperity with the minimum of taxation and irritation.  Now if that has been regarded as a kind of constitutional philosophy in regard to democratic institutions and if governments have to accept it, here then is a case where a very considerable section of the people have suffered dire consequences through no fault of their own, and the Government, who are the responsible authority, should meet the consequences resulting from this disaster, I do not say in a generous way, but in the equitable, just and reasonable way that is due to the people. Cases of hardships have been cited to-day. I heard of quite a number of cases during the last month that have not been cited, cases of people who, even before the award of the Minister may have been determined, may have to pass through the bankruptcy court and then start in such an atmosphere as would mean the ruin of a business that may have taken half a century to build up.  I join in the appeal which has been made to the Minister, and I am in perfect agreement with Senator Campbell, that, if a free vote of the House were taken, the preponderating majority of the House would be in favour of that appeal to the Minister.  I think, as Senator Hayes put it, the Minister ought to consider the question a new and submit to the Dáil amendments that will at least meet the case in a reasonable manner.</P>

      <P>This has been a very interesting discussion on a matter <Col N="2469" /> of principle and a matter of importance; certainly a matter of vital importance not alone to the Bill, but to the individuals primarily concerned. The Bill, as agreed to by the Government and as later introduced in the Dáil, did not include any provision for consequential loss or damage.  I took it upon myself on behalf of the Government to agree to a modification of the principle upon which the Bill was drafted of not including consequential loss or damage.  I did agree to a modification during the Committee Stage in the Dáil and I agreed to a further modification here.  I would put forward as one argument that, if I agreed to the amendment of Senator Hayes, the Bill would be an entirely different Bill when it goes back to the Dáil.  I cannot claim now that it would be a different Bill in principle, because, as I have already stated, I gave way on the principle of consequential damage to some extent in the Dáil, and enlarged on that considerably during the last stage of the Bill here and even to-day. But it would be a different Bill, a materially different Bill, if I were to accept the amendment of Senator Hayes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment which Senator Hayes has on the Order Paper does not put any limit to consequential loss with regard to category or kind or the extent of a particular consequential loss. Undoubtedly Senator Hayes has stated that he is not bound by the words in his amendment and requested that I should consider the matter of bringing in an amendment of my own at a later stage; that if I agree to the principle enshrined in the amendment it would satisfy him and those with him who support the amendment.  I do not think I could do that.  We have gone a certain measure of the road to meet claims for consequential loss and damage.  I believe we cannot go further.  I am not without heart, and I am not without interest in these people.  Certainly I have feelings which make me agree with Senator Hayes that the poor boot repairer who lost his machine and implements is in a very difficult position, and is deserving of consideration as is also the woman who kept a boarding house and made a living for herself and, perhaps, <Col N="2470" /> for her family by keeping lodgers, and also the owner of one or two houses who made a living out of the rents derived from them.  I could go further and mention persons who own ground rents in the area, who might be widows or delicate persons who could not work, but made a living in that way. I am not without feeling and I would like to be able to help these people, but there is no precedent for dealing with consequential loss or damage in any similar legislation that we have had here.  In itself that would not stop me&mdash;though it is wise to look to precedents&mdash;but I cannot let myself be swayed entirely by my heart.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Finance I have to use my head.  If I am soft hearted I hope I cannot be accused of being soft headed.  I am Minister for Finance and there is a suggestion made to pay people, whose places have been bombed, and whose business has been lost, consequential damages with the Minister as sole arbiter.  That would be placing the Minister for Finance in practically an impossible position.  If there was any intention in the Government originally to include payment for consequential loss or damage, strict rules, regulations and conditions would be necessary. Otherwise any Minister for Finance would find himself in an unenviable position; in a most difficult position in deciding between Tom and James, or on claims from any part of Ireland or to satisfy them.  He would be put in the position of having the final word, or the only say in the matter, and that is bound to create the greatest possible dissatisfaction.  Senator Magennis would not ask that I should be generous.  I do not think there is any great fear of a Minister for Finance being generous.  That is very unlikely.  I would like to be just so far as I can, but I really cannot contemplate involving the State in an unknown burden for the payment of consequential loss and damage.  There would be no limit to it.  Nobody could define it.  The Minister for Finance would find it most difficult to define where consequential loss would end.</P>

      <P>I would find it very difficult to do so.  I am impressed by the obvious honesty and sincerity of everyone who took part in the discussion to do justice to these people. I am quite satisfied that there was no intention of using it from the partisan or Party point of view.  That was obvious to everyone and I certainly accept that view.  I am satisfied that Senator Johnston meant to be complimentary in saying that he had confidence that the Minister would do the right thing, but it would be impossible, without strict rules, regulations and conditions, for any Minister for Finance to do what would be regarded by those primarily concerned as the right thing.  Unless the Oireachtas in its wisdom laid down such rules, regulations and conditions as would bind it, it would otherwise be impossible to administer payment for consequential loss or damage.  This amendment certainly does leave the door wide open.  It is not, as Senator Johnston said, ajar, but the door is left wide open to such consequential loss &ldquo;as in the opinion of the Minister is reasonable having regard to the circumstances in each particular case&rdquo;. There is no limit and nothing is set down that would be any guide to the Minister.  Last week, after considerable discussion, and after listening to the speech of Senator Hayes which, like several speeches that he made to-day, was quite reasonable, I accepted the idea he put forward, and even the words he used, and embodied them in the amendment on the Order Paper as a Government amendment. I thought I had gone far to meet the desire of those who were anxious to meet, to some extent, consequential loss or damage and to pay compensation for it.  I do not see that it would be possible as things stand to accept the amendment or the idea of unlimited consequential loss being compensated for under this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Compensation under this Act (whether awarded by the Minister or by the court) in respect of an injury to which this Act applies, shall be <Col N="2472" /> awarded in respect of the actual damage done to property and such consequential loss as may be determined by regulations made under this Act.  The Minister may make regulations for the award of compensation for consequential loss of such kinds and to such an extent as he may determine.  Any decision of the Minister arising out of the regulations shall be final in all cases, and shall not be the subject of or included in any application to or award by the court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The concluding words are taken from a later amendment of the Minister's. They would allow regulations to be made, and would leave the Minister free from the charge that he was giving compensation to X and not to Y. They would also enable him to say what he proposed to do in the circumstances when cases arose.  He could be as strong in defending the regulations as, for example, he was in objecting to the amendment.  Would the Minister agree to postpone this matter and to reconsider it?</P>

It was on that basis it was debated there as it was debated here, and sometimes with more heat, and it was passed on that basis.  As Minister for Finance, I probably could take a chance and make amendments and alterations, and then face the Government with the consequences.  I would not like that, and I do not think it would be fair to my colleagues to make any fundamental change without consultation with them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners advise that such a provision as that suggested by the Senator would be proper to a Finance Bill.  Apart from that consideration, relief from income-tax under Schedule A in respect of premises which are unoccupied or are not in existence&mdash;as in the case of bombing&mdash;is granted in the existing law.

I had experience of a place which was destroyed, and I thought it was the duty of the authorities to deal with it.  There was nothing there except some walls, and there was no way in which it could be removed, so I had to pay.  I do not wish to go back on the past, but that makes me a little sceptical.  The statement means that that is his intention and, if it is not so, he will have to try to cover it in the Finance Act.</P>

      <P>In page 8, before Section 11, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>11.&mdash;In the case of any premises to which an excise licence was attached, and which have suffered injuries to which this Act applies, such licence shall not be payable for the period during which the premises remain incapable of their previous use for trading purposes, but nevertheless shall be deemed to continue in force <Col N="2476" /> up to the time of the reinstatement of the said premises.</P>
    <P>I put this down in order to find out the Minister's intention in regard to the matter.  After the 1923 Compensation (Damage to Property) Act, a Dublin Reconstruction Act was passed in 1924, and it contains provisions very similar to those in the amendments Nos. 36 to 39.  Frankly, these four amendments are taken, with some adjustments, from that Act.  In the case of a publican, a tobacconist or a chemist whose premises are destroyed, two questions are involved.  Must he keep on paying for a licence to the Revenue Commissioners?  Then, there are legal provisions in the case of a publican, that a licence must be exercised, and he has to make certain applications in court.  I would like to know what the position is of such licensees in the case of damaged property, not only in Dublin, but in other parts of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>We consulted the Revenue Commissioners on that matter and they said that, in so far as liquor licences are concerned, the purpose of the amendment has been provided for already in Section 8 of the Finance Act of 1917, which authorises repayment or remission of excise duty in respect of destroyed premises, and makes provision for the revival of licences on the reconstruction of the premises.  In relation to this amendment and the previous one, they say that it was not thought necessary that this principle should be brought in in the Dublin Reconstruction Act of 1924.  I am told the commissioners thought they were unnecessary, but the Government of the day apparently decided to go ahead with them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>11.&mdash;No building or house which has suffered an injury to which this <Col N="2477" /> Act applies nor any such building or house when rebuilt shall be liable to be valued under the Irish Valuation Acts at a sum larger than the valuation in force on the 26th day of August, 1940, in any valuation coming into force before the 31st day of March, 1940.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The draftsman advises that the amendments and the previous one are entirely outside the scope of the Bill, which is primarily a Bill to provide for compensation, that is, monetary compensation, to persons whose property was damaged or destroyed. The immediate objective is to provide the machinery for the assessment and payment of compensation for definite physical injury to property. The matters the Senator raises in the amendments should be dealt with otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is far from being the business of the draftsman to define what is relevant to the Bill.  Generally he wishes to put in as little as possible &mdash;and more power to him.  I remember being told by one Minister for Finance that the Attorney-General had advised him that something was relevant, but the Attorney-General came to see the Ceann Comhairle afterwards to say that he never said any such thing, being an intelligent Attorney-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that certain damage to property has taken place and more may take place.  If this Bill that we are now considering is the only Bill to deal with it then we ought to put all this in and, with all respect to the draftsman's opinion, we actually have drafted this Bill in such a way as to contain, not only provision for the giving of compensation, but provision for town planning.  The draftsman must have been asleep when they slipped the schedule into the Bill or the Minister must not have consulted him in time but this Bill appears to be an omnibus Bill about damage to property and, if it is, I think that either this provision suggested in amendment No. 37 should be made or else we should have it from the Minister <Col N="2478" /> that another Bill will be brought in.  Certainly, if a person's house is damaged, it was provided in the Dublin Reconstruction Act that he should have a period of years on the old valuation.  I am suggesting a similar period of years here but I have no opinion as to the dates.  Certainly, a person who reconstructs his house should not find that at once, when he is endeavouring to get on his feet, the valuation of the house is raised.  There is a case in the North Strand of a very valuable licensed premises which may or may not be reconstructed.  We do not know.  But, if it is reconstructed, certainly the licensee should get an opportunity of getting back his custom and getting on his feet, after he has suffered loss of profits over a period of years, before his valuation is raised on a new building.  That is the point I am making here and I think it is reasonable.  The Minister should either make that provision here or we should have some other Bill dealing with it. I think it would be much preferable to make it here.</P>

      <P>I promised in the Dáil to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Local Government. I believe it is proper to a Local Government Bill.  I understand that there is a Bill dealing with remission of rates that will fall due for reconsideration at an early date.  I cannot say yet whether the Minister proposes to bring in a Bill to extend the period of that Bill or not.  In any case I intend to bring this matter, and two or three other matters of a similar kind in regard to which Senator Hayes has amendments down&mdash;which were not in the Compensation Act of 1923, but which were in the Dublin Reconstruction Act of 1924&mdash;to the attention of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>

      <P>But I am informed by what I regard as sound legal authority that not only are the rates due upon a building which was in existence <Col N="2479" /> on the 5th April, 1941, but that the corporation must collect them.  Of course, I know the resources of civilisation are pretty wide; the corporation can go slow on the collection and probably will, but I understand there is a legal obligation on them to go ahead with the collection and they may find themselves dealt with in a report of an auditor or somebody about it. amendment No. 39 deals with leases.  A person who has, say, five or seven or ten years to go on the 1st June, 1941, may not get his premises reinstated until 1944.  Have the intervening three years elapsed out of his lease or does he start in 1944 with the lease as it stood on the date of the bombing? The allusion in this to the Act of 1931 is an adjustment of the Dublin Reconstruction Act and it simply wants to put the tenant of a new premises, after reinstatement, in the same position as he would be under the Landlord and Tenant Act if he had carried out repairs and was going to be disturbed.</P>

We had difficulty in getting him to accept the idea of Section 20, about town planning.  It was at the urgent request of the Dublin City Manager that that was put in.  The draftsman pressed very hard not to be asked to agree that it was appropriate to the Bill but we pressed upon him that the corporation desired it, that there was great opportunity for clearing up an area that they thought ought to be cleared up.  He gave way to our pressure but I am certain that he would be strongly of opinion that any of the three or four matters dealt with by Senator Hayes with regard to rates and valuation and the Landlord and Tenant Act could not reasonably be brought within the scope of this Bill.</P>

The question of what is the scope of the Bill is a matter for the Chair.  It is not a matter for the Minister; it is not a matter for the <Col N="2480" /> Attorney-General; it is not a matter for the Parliamentary draftsman.  It is a matter for the Chair.  It seems to me quite clear that all these matters need to be dealt with and they are comparatively simple.  I think there is no doubt whatever that when they are being dealt with they will be dealt with on the basis of these amendments. What I am wondering is, if they are not going to be dealt with now&mdash;and I cannot make the Minister accept them if he does not want to&mdash;will they be dealt with before reinstatement conditions come to be applied?  I presume they will.  It is the Minister for Justice, is it not, who is concerned under the Landlord and Tenant Act?</P>

      <P>There is a certain amount of misunderstanding abroad with regard to what I think are inaccurate newspaper reports in regard to the Minister's intention to bring in another Bill.  As far as I understand it, the Minister, as far as compensation is concerned, has no intention of bringing in a further Bill at present. He may find it necessary under new circumstances to do so but he has no intention at the moment.  I would like him to say so if that is correct because some people have false hopes.  They think that they are not met now but that they are going to be met in another Bill.  That is a tragedy.  I know that is the case.  I have been telephoned to by people who say, &ldquo;Perhaps in the next Bill I will be met.&rdquo;  I said I did not think there was going to be a Bill but I think it should be made clear.  Surely anything that has relation to war damage while we are neutral and which adjusts normal Acts only for that purpose is relevant to this Bill.  Anything which makes permanent changes, I agree, would not be relevant.</P>

Even the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad is, I think, quite <Col N="2481" /> willing to accept advice that he is confident is expert and competent on the particular matter.  I have no hesitation in saying that, so far as present circumstances are concerned, I think this is the Bill to deal with compensation for war damage while we are neutral.  If circumstances change it might be necessary to bring in other Bills, amending Bills or otherwise, but there is at present nothing further in contemplation in the way of a Bill to deal with compensation for damage to property.</P>

I do not propose to move No. 42, if you will allow me to say that I do not like the section at all, and I am sorry it is in the Bill, because, to my mind, it is like hitting a man when he is down.

German or some other bombers came along and destroyed this property. Now is our chance to get our money.&rdquo; I do not think this is the kind of opportunity we should take.  At any rate, if they must take power to seize this opportunity, I hope they will not seize it too often because, after all, this does not make it obligatory on the Minister to do it.

      <P>May I point out that I do not think there is anything wrong with the word &ldquo;habitually,&rdquo; or even with &ldquo;constantly&rdquo;?  However, I can see the point the Senator is anxious should be cleared up, that is, that &ldquo;constantly&rdquo; sometimes has the meaning of &ldquo;continuing without intermission.&rdquo; It was not the intention that that should be so.  &ldquo;Constantly&rdquo; is not exactly the same as &ldquo;continuously.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It was to meet the point I have made, that &ldquo;Constantly&rdquo; might be interpreted as meaning &ldquo;continuously,&rdquo; being employed without any intermission or cessation, such as might arise in the case of hands who were &ldquo;stood off&rdquo;, temporarily disemployed, and then brought on again.  I am following in this matter the Oxford dictionary, and &ldquo;usually&rdquo; means that a person is employed in the usual or wonted manner, that he is usually employed by a particular firm and that his employment there is customary.  It could be said that he was in his usual employment because, as a general rule and as a regular practice, he is employed there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it apply in the case of seasonal workers such as men employed by maltsters, or, more notably &mdash;and Senator Quirke would be aware of this&mdash;in connection with the sugar factories, where men are taken on for seasonal employment of a rather casual and temporary nature?  Would &ldquo;usually&rdquo; cover the class of person who may be taken on for a campaign one year, and who may not be taken on in the next year, and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would cover the case of men taken on in one year and not taken on again, but, as the Senator is aware, the general practice in regard to the beet factories is that men taken on for one campaign are re-employed for the next and so on, because they are experienced in the operations of the factory. So that, I think, we could say that these people were &ldquo;usually&rdquo; employed there during the period of the campaign.</P>

      <P>The only thing is that the section refers to a &ldquo;body of persons.&rdquo;  It would seem to me that the word &ldquo;constantly&rdquo; is a better word to employ, having regard to the fact that the section is for the purpose of dealing with a &ldquo;body of persons.&rdquo; If the word &ldquo;usually&rdquo; is to be substituted for &ldquo;constantly&rdquo;, it indicates a more fluid personnel to deal with.  It does not seem to be quite as good a word as &ldquo;constantly,&rdquo; which would connote a more constant body.  Has that point occurred to the Minister?</P>

      <P>The only thing in that connection is, that these people have to fulfil two conditions.  They, first of all, have to be &ldquo;usually&rdquo; or &ldquo;habitually&rdquo; employed in a particular firm or by the same employer.  When these two conditions are taken into consideration, I think that the use of the word &ldquo;usually&rdquo; safeguards their position, because they could not be said to be &ldquo;usually&rdquo; employed by the same employer if, in fact, when work of a particular type was available to them, they were employed by somebody else. There would have to be regular and recurring employment of the same man by the same employer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection was not so much to &ldquo;habitually&rdquo; as to &ldquo;constantly.&rdquo; What was in my mind was this.  A man is with an employer, and has every reason to believe that his employment will continue with him. But it may happen that for a month, or for a week or two, his employer may have nothing for him to do.  I do not want to have that man upset simply because in that short interval he took a job from somebody else.  I think there is not a whole lot of difference between &ldquo;habitually&rdquo;, &ldquo;normally&rdquo; and &ldquo;usually,&rdquo; but I am definitely uneasy about the use of the word &ldquo;constantly.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the matter is of such great importance as Senator Foran and Senator Lynch would appear to suggest, because these are bodies of persons who would have to conform to a general rule, and in regard to that I think the Minister would have to be satisfied of this fact that, so far as the bulk of the personnel in organisations of this sort are concerned, they would be continuously employed by the same person: that is, that the general corpus of the organisation would be in constant employment with the same employer.  There would, of course, be men who would be floating in and out of employment for the reason already mentioned, that some could only be engaged in seasonal occupations, and that some might have to be &ldquo;stood off&rdquo; from time to time according to the requirements of the production schedule.  In any event, <Col N="2488" /> when we consider the way in which this provision is now hedged round with safeguards, and when we consider the disqualifying effect of Section 11, I do not think the matter is of very great practical importance.</P>

      <P>On this amendment, I would like to know from the Minister what is to be the position of trades councils under this Bill and in connection with this section.  The Minister, of course, knows what the constitution of a trades council is.  It is not a trade union.  It consists of representatives of trade unions.  It has very little funds of its own, merely the fees paid by the various unions affiliated to it.  You have trades councils established in a great many towns throughout the country which occasionally interfere, and in a useful way, in trade disputes.  What will their function be in the future? Let us suppose that there is a trades council in the town of Tullamore.  If there is a dispute there between a trade union affiliated to it and a body of employers, and it proposes to act as an intermediary&mdash;to help to bring the parties together and to see what it can do to settle the dispute&mdash;will it be precluded from rendering a useful service of that sort in the future?  I would like to know that from the Minister because I do not think it would be covered by this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the word &ldquo;disinterested&rdquo; would rule it out.  I was anxious to meet the point made in the other House&mdash;and which has been raised by Senator Douglas in his amendment, though I am not sure there is very much in it.  As the Bill stands now, the person who proposes to act as an intermediary, to bring together the parties to a dispute, might be thought, if he were sitting at the council table, to be participating in the negotiations.  If he were a single person, perhaps it could be argued that he was not covered by the Bill in so far as a single person is not a &ldquo;body of persons&rdquo;, but if it were, for instance, a committee of citizens, a committee of a charitable organisation or of some other public organisation of that sort which was acting in the matter, they, possibly, would come within the terms of the Bill, and if they were actually sitting and participating in the negotiations for a <Col N="2490" /> settlement of the dispute, in so far as the dispute related to the fixing of wages or the conditions of employment, then, I think, they would be covered by the Bill.  My purpose here was to meet that case, to ensure that public spirited people could act in this way as mediators.  It becomes more difficult when we begin to consider members of trade unions or officials of trade unions, particularly if those bodies are neither registered as trade unions nor excepted under the terms of Section 6, because, then, we might have a coach-and-four driven through the main principle of the Bill, which is that organisations which propose to negotiate on questions of wages or conditions of employment shall be either authorised trade unions or excepted bodies.  In order to preserve the fundamental principle of the Bill, it was necessary for me, in accepting the principle of Senator Douglas' amendment, to add this qualification&mdash; that those who do act as intermediaries should be disinterested persons who have no immediate association or connection with the dispute in question.  I do not see how I can put a trades council into that category, and it is a case of accepting the amendment with the qualification I have inserted or allowing the Bill to go through as it stands.  There may be a possibility of dealing with this matter by making trades councils excepted bodies, but I have not fully considered the implications of that course, and I should not be prepared to say, at this stage, that I would regard trades councils as coming within the category of organisations which should be excepted bodies under Section 6.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that trades councils should be debarred from continuing the useful public service they have been rendering in settling disputes.  I am thinking only of their interference when a dispute has actually arisen.  I know that they have very often persuaded a trade union involved in a dispute to accept terms, or to agree to negotiation, which they might not otherwise have done. It would be a pity if the Minister could not devise some means whereby <Col N="2491" /> a council of that kind could intervene for the purpose of bringing about a settlement of a dispute which had actually occurred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>With great respect to the Minister, it seems to me that a trades council is not completely debarred from intervention by his amendment.  The trades council as a trades council would probably not be disinterested, but the only persons in the council who would be at all likely to be useful for the purpose would be individuals who would be disinterested. It seems to me that there is nothing in this amendment to prevent an official of a trades council who is in every way disinterested from trying to bring the parties to a dispute together, and that there is nothing to prevent even two officials of a trades council from doing so, provided they are disinterested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>I was asked whether there was anything in the amendment to debar a trades council, as a body, from intervening, and not whether there was anything to prevent a member of a trades council from doing so. I gather that what Senator O'Connell has in mind is the sort of influence which a trades council would bring to bear upon a trade union, affiliated to the trades council, which was engaged in a dispute, with a view to bringing about a settlement.  In that case, it would not be discharging the functions of intermediary or mediator.  My experience is somewhat limited, but I have never heard of a case where a trades council acted as intermediary between parties to a dispute.</P>

A trade union which has not got a negotiation licence cannot, of itself, negotiate, but an individual belonging to that union can, I take it, act as mediator.  I do not know what a disinterested person is.  Is the chairman of a parish council who supplies milk to a dairy in which there is a labour dispute disinterested?  Is the chairman of a parish council who supplies beet to a beet factory disinterested if a dispute occurs in that factory?  He is, I take it, a responsible person because he is chairman of the parish council.  He might also be chairman of the local branch of a political Party, which would make him far more responsible in the eyes of certain people.</P>

      <P>I raised this matter primarily for the purpose of getting information. Everybody in the community is, directly or indirectly, interested in every dispute that occurs. Arising out of what the Minister has said, I have known cases where trades councils were successful in bringing bodies of employers and trades unions <Col N="2493" /> together when neither would approach the other.  I have known a case where a body of employers would not receive members of the union or discuss the dispute further with them.  They were approached by the local trades council and, as a result, the dispute was settled.  Can that form of activity continue under this Bill?  If the Bill prevents that kind of activity on the part of a trades council, something should be done before it becomes an Act to allow a trades council to continue these useful operations.  That is all I am anxious about.  I do not ask that the trades council be a negotiating body.  I am thinking entirely of circumstances in which a trade dispute has arisen and in which a trades council may act as a means of bringing the parties together or as a means of making representations to them when the <i>amour propre</i> of one party or the other will not allow them to come together.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to tell me under what paragraph of this section any person of goodwill is prevented from mediating in a trade dispute, whether actual or pending. My experience is that, when there is a difference of opinion between an employer and his workers, or between a body of employers and their workers, persons of goodwill, of whom there are great numbers in the country&mdash;some of them very helpful and some of them not&mdash;come in and offer their services as mediators.  Are these people, in the event of a dispute or pending dispute, in the future, to be prevented from offering their services and helping to prevent an extension or development of a dispute or the occurrence of a dispute?  I cannot see, in any paragraph of that section, where these people are prevented from so doing.  This amendment will reserve or preserve that function for a certain section of the community.  I should like the Minister to explain that.  Supposing Senator O'Neill were back again in the position he held 20 years ago, when he was very active in that kind of work, what would be his position in connection with this Bill? If we had another Senator O'Neill to-day, <Col N="2494" /> ready at all times and at all hours, and under all difficulties, to offer his services to help to end a dispute or to prevent a dispute, would he be prevented, under this Bill, from using his good offices in that direction?  I cannot see it in the Bill, and hence I do not see any need for any amendment reserving this function to certain people as being eligible to interfere. Would the Minister explain what the position is?</P>

      <P>Surely, this is a case of much ado about nothing.  There is nothing here to prevent any individual at all, who is acceptable to both parties in the dispute, intervening. Should both parties agree that a certain individual or body of individuals is or are likely to settle the dispute, and if they agree to accept these people as arbitrators, I do not see that there is anything in this to prevent their doing so.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that my own opinion coincides with that of Senator Foran.  I held in the other House&mdash;and I am not fully convinced that I am wrong; certainly, I am not convinced that I am wrong in regard to single persons&mdash;that so far as single individuals are concerned there is nothing here to prevent them acting in the capacity of mediator.  The suggestion is that because, in sub-section (1) of the section, we use the word &ldquo;body&rdquo;, there might be two or more persons engaged, and if their active mediation went to the extent that they sat down at the council table and, perhaps, acted as the honest broker between the parties, then they might be held to be acting in negotiations or taking part in negotiations, which is slightly different from acting solely as a mediator.  It is to make it quite clear that the people who, first of all, bring the parties to the dispute together, and then actually sit down in conference with them, will not be acting contrary to the provisions of sub-section (1) of the section, that I was disposed, and am still disposed, to accept in principle Senator Douglas's amendment.  I can see the difficulty which the use of the word &ldquo;disinterested&rdquo; might create, and, with the <Col N="2495" /> permission of the House, I am satisfied not to have either amendment moved to-day, but to take the matter back and see whether we cannot get over that difficulty, and, at the same time, prevent a provision of this sort, if inserted in the Bill, being availed of to drive a coach and four through the main principle of the Act.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied with the Minister's statement.  When I read this first, I did not think there was anything at all in the section to debar one person or one or two persons from acting as mediators.  Some Senator, however, referred to it, and when I read sub-section (1) together with sub-section (2) I saw that there was a danger in proving that, say, two persons&mdash;possibly, one, but certainly two&mdash; were not officers of a body.  I do not know whether two clergymen together would be officers of the Church&mdash;I hardly think so&mdash;but I can see that two persons, who held any position, might be, under sub-section (2).  Therefore, it seemed to me that no harm would be done by making it clear that that was not the intention.</P>

      <P>I should like to know what is the position of an excepted body that applies for a negotiation licence.  May such a body apply for a negotiation licence?  In Section 10, it says that where application is made for a negotiation licence, and the applicant is shown to be an authorised trade union, the Minister shall grant such licence, and it would appear, therefore, that the Minister would be mandated to give the licence.  Would that be applied in the case of a body under Section 6?</P>

      <P>Yes, it would.  I tried to make it clear in the Dáil that any body, which is an excepted body, can, if it chooses, convert itself into an authorised trade union and secure a negotiation licence on complying with the provisions of Section 7 of the Bill: that is, register as a trade union and pay the appropriate deposit.  In fact, the only purpose of the provisions relating to these excepted bodies is that there may be cases where they would not wish to be registered as a trade union and would not pay the necessary deposit, but any body which wishes to become an authorised trade union, and thus get the benefits of Section 11, can do so by fulfilling the conditions of Section 7.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, not even as a rule.  There are three main bodies of teachers in the country.  The national teachers, of whom there are 13,000 or 14,000, are in a very anomalous position. <Col N="2497" /> The Government is not their employer. It pays them, but it does not employ them and it cannot appoint them or dismiss them.  They are appointed by local managers and their services can be dispensed with by local managers, and many of the negotiations with regard to conditions of service are carried on between the National Teachers' Organisation and the Central Council of Managers. Quite recently a very important condition of service was agreed upon in that way.  The Minister may be familiar with the facts.  At any rate an arrangement was carried as a result of negotiations with the Catholic managers, and possibly one of the most important conditions governing the tenure of teachers has resulted from negotiations with the Bishops.  I am wondering whether we can have further negotiations with the Bishops or whether they can carry on further negotiations with us unless they apply for a negotiation licence.  The Minister can except them if they apply for exception, but I can hardly fancy their Lordships making such application.</P>
      <P>Again we have the vocational teachers, a substantial body, whose employers are the local vocational committees. They must carry on negotiations with the individual local committees. The teachers in each county will carry on negotiations with the committee. The Government have a say in some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It has the most important say.  It has the last word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>They have a very big say in so far as the money is concerned but they have not all the say.  They say what may be done, but the council may not always do what they would be allowed to do.  I remember a case was mentioned at a conference of vocational teachers quite recently in which it was shown that a particular council did not grant a bonus or some other concession to the extent the Government allowed.  Protracted negotiations were carried on between the vocational teachers' organisation and that particular county committee.  Then you have <Col N="2498" /> secondary teachers whose employers are private corporations or sometimes private individuals.  The Government are not entirely the employers of the teachers, and negotiations have to be carried on with bodies other than the Government.  That is why I am wondering why the Minister thought it necessary to exclude teachers' organisations. I think what he had in mind was that they were Government employees or servants, and were in the same position as civil servants.  As I have pointed out they are not&mdash;far from it.</P>
      <P>On the question of an organisation recognised by the Minister for Education, does that mean that they have to apply for this recognition, and that recognition may be withheld?  I cannot fancy recognition being withheld from any responsible body of teachers, but there are very small unions of teachers.  There must be 13 or 14 different bodies of teachers&mdash;small unions.  I mentioned the three big bodies, but there are small unions of teachers which negotiate from time to time with their own employers&mdash;not very often with the Government, but mainly with their own employers.  I take it that any union that wants to be in a position to negotiate must apply for recognition to the Government in the first instance. Our particular union has been negotiating for the last 80 years; at least we were never refused recognition.  I do not suppose we shall be refused it now, but we never had to ask for recognition either.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I add to what Senator O'Connell has said in explanation of the position of secondary teachers?  Assuming that Senator O'Connell is correct, his remarks apply with great force to secondary teachers. There are at least two, and perhaps more bodies of lay teachers.  There is no official recognition formally, but I know that the Association of Secondary Teachers has been recognised in fact over a long period of years.  It was recognised by the British Chief Secretary when he was here.  It was recognised by the Minister for Education constantly as representatives <Col N="2499" /> of the association frequently saw his officials and saw the Ministers on deputations.  These teachers are paid partly by their employers and partly, in so far as increments are concerned, by the State.  They have a superannuation fund, and have negotiations with the Minister for Education as regards these matters.  In regard to another very important matter, tenure, they are constantly in negotiation with the Association of Catholic Headmasters, and the Association of Protestant Headmasters.  So that they have constant negotiation not only with the Government but with one or more other bodies.</P>

      <P>Sometimes with the Bishops.  They have to go sometimes to the Bishop of the Diocese.  The Minister might consider that matter. Like the national teachers, they are in a peculiar and anomalous position. They get the basic part of their salaries from the school and their increments from the State, but the employer is the school.  The Minister understands the position fairly well in that regard.  I wonder how they stand in regard to this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me the position is quite clear.  Bodies which are recognised, to be recognised, <i>de facto</i>, by the Department of Education are <i>ipso facto</i> exempt, by the very fact that the Department of Education is prepared to carry on negotiations with them.  That will except these bodies from the penal provisions of sub-section (2) and from the prohibition contained in sub-section (1).  There is nothing in sub-section (3) which makes it necessary for any one of these bodies to apply for exception.  By reason of the fact that the Minister is prepared to carry on negotiations with them, they are <i>ipso facto</i> excepted bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to other difficulties which Senators have mentioned, they can be dealt with under sub-section (6).  That is one of the reasons why sub-section (6) has been inserted.  We simply say, in regard to organisations of headmasters and organisations of clerical <Col N="2500" /> managers to which Senators have referred, that they are excepted bodies, and there is no need for them to make application.  The only case in which it is necessary for an application to be made is a case where what would be, known as a group or a house union would be concerned.  That is under sub-section (4), where application must be made, and where the name of the group must be inscribed on the register and a fee must be paid.  So far as the bodies in sub-section (3) are concerned, these are excluded by the Minister under sub-section (6), and application to the Minister is not essential.  If there is any difficulty in the way of such an application being made, the Minister can of his own act overcome that difficulty. Of course, so far as the great majority of bodies which would fail to be considered under sub-section (6) are concerned, they would have to make application, because they would be unknown to the Minister and unknown to any Government Department.  If there was an obscure professional association which wished to be accepted under this section, it would have to make application. In the case of bodies of recognised standing, whose status is beyond question, that application is not necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister how is it proposed to administer the Bill.  Who will be responsible for the administration of the Bill? How is it proposed to discover whether negotiations are actually in progress, or what is meant by &ldquo;to carry on negotiations&rdquo;? I take it from what the Minister said this evening that, while it is not lawful for a body to carry on negotiations, it is lawful for a member of that body to carry on negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said that. We were dealing with the question of a member of a body acting as intermediary. I made the reservation quite clearly, that if this intermediary were to sit down at the table and actually to take part in the bargaining, then I felt his position would be rather doubtful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If a member of a body, which has not a negotiation licence and is engaged in a dispute, is a member of a trades council, that individual is entitled to bring the parties together; he is a mediator, he is not doing anything unlawful; but, if he sits down to negotiate, it becomes unlawful for him?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an anomalous position.  The Minister disagrees that a member of an organisation can negotiate, but it is stated here distinctly in the section that it shall not be lawful for any body to negotiate. Does that mean that an individual member of the body cannot negotiate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Not if he is representing the body; not if the body is not qualified to negotiate.  Let us be clear.  If he negotiates as representing a body which has a negotiation licence or is an excepted body, then he is doing nothing unlawful.  If he negotiates as representing a body <Col N="2502" /> which is neither an authorised trade union nor an excepted body, then I think he would be contravening the terms of the section and would leave himself as a member of this body and leave the body itself open to whatever penalties there are in sub-section (2). But I find it very difficult to see how a person who is neither a member of an an excepted body nor a member of an authorised trade union could sit down and propose to negotiate on behalf of a body of organised workers.  It seems to me that we are dealing with a situation which would never arise in practice.  If the workers are organised, they will probably be one thing or the other; they will be an excepted body, or they will be an authorised trade union.  I do not think that, with the growth of trade unionism in this country, we are likely to get very many bodies of organised workers who are neither one thing nor the other.</P>

There will be many bodies who will not be either authorised or excepted and the point is, will these not be allowed to negotiate?  Is it sufficiently clear to the Minister that an individual member of a body cannot negotiate?</P>

The principle itself is based on the maxim of Roman law, adopted by all civilised peoples: <i>qui facit per alium facit per se.</i>  Consequently a person who is negotiating on behalf of a body which possesses a negotiating licence is acting legally.</P>

      <P>This section deals with deposits, and is a very strange feature in this Bill.  There are many trade unions that have not the amount of money selected as a deposit by the Government, because many of them pay friendly society benefits, unemployment and otherwise, and consequently their reserves are limited.  To ask these unions to deposit £1,000 is asking the impossible, and serves no useful purpose.  I cannot understand what was in the Minister's mind when he introduced the question of deposits at all, seeing that he has the right to refuse a licence to a trade union.  Is not that so?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain-what he hopes to achieve by insisting on such a rather large deposit from trade unions?  If he has in mind the closing down of small unions this section will certainly have the effect of driving them out of existence as well as putting very drastic penalties upon them.  These unions have a long history, and at this stage it is rather a severe penalty to ask them to make this deposit.  I believe there is not power under the Bill to reduce the amount.  Had the Minister in mind the provision of some security by what he called foreign unions operating here?  Is that the reason for the deposit? If that is so, that could be done without penalising small Irish unions, whose funds are never very large on account of the amount of benefits they pay out.  This provision will be a tremendous handicap on these unions in future.  I believe the Bill would be just as effective if the Minister did away with the proposal regarding deposits. To ask these unions to put down £1,000 is asking the impossible. Other unions, and particularly the foreign ones, can make the deposit on behalf of their members here.  It will be no hardship on them to do so.  I should like to know what object will be <Col N="2506" /> attained by insisting on deposits from trade unions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the purpose which this section seeks to serve is quite clear, if we bear in mind the important place that trade unions have come to occupy in our productive economy. It is quite clear that they have become so powerful, that they can do so much good, or so much harm if conducted in an irresponsible way, that only responsible organisations should be permitted to continue to exist.  I do not know of any general principle by which you could test the responsibility of such organisations, without a specific inquisition into the affairs of every individual organisation, except by applying some test of this sort.  There is a great deal to be said for a test of this kind.  If organisations that have been in existence for some time have been managed with any sort of prudence, particularly if they have been undertaking the business of a provident society, by providing burial benefits, unemployment benefit, and pensions for members, it is quite clear that they should have built up substantial finances.  Unless they have built up these finances they ultimately will not be in a position to meet their commitments to the members.  Accordingly, the fact that they have these finances is an indication of the general efficiency, business capacity, and sense of responsibility with which the affairs of these unions have been administered. On that account there is a great deal to be said for insisting on deposits of this sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the case is unanswerable, when you come to consider the prominent position which trade unions now occupy in our industrial economy. Obviously we cannot permit our industrial development to be hampered, or to become the sport, as it sometimes has been, of irresponsible individuals who, under the existing law, can have themselves registered as trade unions. It is an indication of irresponsibility if you have trade unions purporting to be able to defend the interests of hundreds and, in some cases of thousands, of members, and not have £1,000 in their funds.  I think you could not regard <Col N="2507" /> a body in that position as being a responsible organisation and personally I do not think it should be regarded as having the right to speak for or to negotiate on behalf of any body of people.  Certainly I do not think it should have the right to dislocate an essential service in this country, as under the existing law it has done.</P>
    <P>It is in order to clear up that position that we are imposing this condition henceforward on trade unions.  We are also imposing it because we feel that there should be some substantial guarantee asked from those who henceforward propose to organise trade unions in this country.  We think if this condition had been in existence&mdash; not 20 years ago, but in later years&mdash;a great deal of the trouble and of the difficulties which have manifested themselves in our industrial life would have been avoided.  The imposition of this condition will ensure that henceforward there will not be the same temptation to break away from a union and to start an inter-union feud.  After all, those who are tempted to break away or who are not prepared to compose their difficulties inside their own trade organisation will be faced with this position, that they will not be able to go out and to negotiate for any body of men unless they are able to make a deposit of this sort.  I think the deposit when made will be an earnest of the responsibility of those who have been conducting trade unions.  As a preventative against the formation of splinter unions or breakaway unions and to prevent further disputes in industrial life, this deposit is desirable and, in fact, essential.</P>

      <P>I understand the Minister's attitude in this matter and sympathise with his desire to prevent what one may call mushroom unions, but I think Senator Foran had in his mind quite a different type of union. Perhaps the Minister has power to make it an excepted body.  There are old craft unions in Dublin whose respectability, probity and prudence hardly can be judged by the amount of money they could put up.  That kind of union has a tradition and very often as a negotiating body it is quite reasonable, <Col N="2508" /> led by people who have plenty of experience of that kind.  Has the Minister power under this Bill to except that type of union from the provisions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have, but if they are excepted they fall under the disqualification of Section 11.  They cannot have it both ways.  I can except a craft union if the craft union makes application.  In regard to these old-established craft unions, which we have heard of here and elsewhere, I am as sympathetic as anybody else with them, and pay them the same sort of tribute as everybody else.  They do represent a tradition, but if they have been long established, if, as we are told, their activities are very largely provident activities, then I do not think that, being small unions, having been long established and having carried on these provident activities, in the majority of cases, they should have any difficulty whatsoever in paying the £1,000 asked for as the minimum deposit under this Bill.</P>
      <P>If, by reason of special circumstances of this time, or by reason of increased unemployment, or anything like that, they are not in that position, I am prepared to consider their cases sympathetically under Section 8, but I can do that only as long as the emergency lasts.  That gives them the duration of the war and a year afterwards to put their house in order.  It also gives them time to consider, in conjunction with other bodies in a like position, whether they cannot federate, or even amalgamate, for the purpose of making the necessary deposit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister has no conception of how many of the older trade unions exist.  At no time have they a reserve fund of £1,000.  I have in mind a very old union in the building trade.  This union pays a lot of friendly benefits, and at some periods, when trade is brisk and all the members are working, they are fairly well off in funds.  At other periods, when there is a lot of unemployment in the trade, they are very low in funds. They meet that by a levy on the members who are working, in order to meet their commitments to the unemployed members.  The Minister is asking <Col N="2509" /> them to levy themselves £2 per head in order to qualify for a negotiation licence.  Men may be prepared to pay a levy to support their unemployed members, but it is very doubtful if they ever will pay a levy in order to deposit £1,000 in the High Court.</P>
      <P>My suggestion is that the Minister look into this matter and consider unions who have, as he says, his sympathy, and take into account their traditions and their long record, with a view to recognising their difficulties and making some provision to reduce the amount or to take it in instalments. I am afraid he will do considerable harm to a number of these unions in the building trade who are subject to many spells of unemployment and who normally find it difficult to carry on.  If their funds are depleted to the extent of £1,000, it may mean hardships that they cannot possibly stand.  As I said on an earlier stage of the Bill, it may do more harm than good.  I am sure that Senator Campbell knows a number of unions in the printing trade more or less similarly affected.</P>

In some of the unions in the building trade&mdash;I think Senator Foran had one in mind I was thinking about&mdash; the employment is not regular, and they are rarely in funds.  They have a feeling that they are somebody, that they have a craft, a tradition, and so on.  They may not be very up-to-date, and may not be the best kind of union for several purposes, but there they are, and they are entirely worthy of respect. I would like to support Senator Foran's suggestion that the Minister should take into consideration whether, within the terms of the Bill, he can do anything to preserve them as unions without subjecting them to a deposit which, in their particular circumstances, would be unreasonable.</P>

      <P>Senator Hayes has suggested that he is a tradesman, and I suggest that he is a professor.  I wish to refer to some other crafts in this city which have been dwindling owing to certain circumstances.  In horse-shoeing there is a certain amount of activity now because of the scarcity of petrol, but that is an old craft which has become very small indeed, and I do not see how they would be able to put up the money required under this Bill.  There is also the trade I am in myself&mdash;the harness-making trade&mdash;in which there are very few left in the City of Dublin.  There is also the old handcraft tailoring trade.  Probably very few members of this House pattonise handcraft tailors.  I do not see how these unfortunate craftsmen would be able to put up the money, as they are suffering greatly for some time past owing to the division of labour.  There are other craft trades which, unless amalgamated into some larger body, cannot possibly put up the money specified in this Bill.  There are also a few handcraft bootmakers operating in the City of Dublin just now.  As I said of the tailors, possibly there are very few in this House who patronise the old handcraft bootmakers.  All these trades are now dwindling, not through any fault of their own but because of changed circumstances.  On their behalf I would appeal to the Minister to give these old handcraft trades some consideration in their diminished numbers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice in asking the Minister to reconsider this section.  There is a large number of small unions, called local unions, in the country, and they will be incapable of making anything like the deposit which is asked from them. To put them out of existence would, in my opinion, cause a good deal of <Col N="2511" /> disturbance because they are performing, and have been performing, very essential services for their members. Looking over the official list of trade unions affiliated to the Trade Union Congress it seems to me, at a general glance, that there would be somewhere about 50 per cent. of these organisations who, on the number of their members, will be incapable of putting down this deposit.  What will become of them is a very important question. With regard to crafts, the crafts have their traditions, their customs, habits and ways of procedure and so on, and there will be great difficulty in getting such bodies, highly individualised as they are, to fuse or to federate.  Then there are small sections of amalgamated unions in this country, and it is difficult to see how they will be able to lay down this deposit, because of the very small size of the section in this country.  It is difficult to see also what will ultimately become of them if they are incapable&mdash;as they will be incapable&mdash;of laying down the deposit. Great difficulty indeed will be found in getting them to associate.  I would like the Minister to say that he would be prepared to give that section further consideration, in view of the extraordinary difficulties that will be found the moment you attempt to amalgamate these small bodies.</P>

      <P>I would like to support what Senator Lynch has just said.  I have in mind a small union of the printing industry, a branch of a well-organised British union.  I do not think that there are more than 40 members in it, and these people will be compelled under this Bill to pay a deposit of £1,000.  I think that is going to be a constant hardship on these people.  While I am on the question of the deposit I would like to ask the Minister, if all reference to the deposit were omitted from the Bill, would not the Minister still have the right to refuse a negotiating licence to any union applying for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In fact, if the Senator will consider the position, I think he will see it would be an impossible one, and it would be one which would perhaps justify all the hard <Col N="2512" /> things that have been said against this Bill if the Minister were to have the power to refuse to issue a licence to any trade union. I mean, the only way in which we can really ensure that the Minister will intervene to the minimum extent possible in trade union activities and in the work of reorganising the trade union movement is by imposing some condition like this&mdash;some impersonal rule.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I cannot think of any other one.  I cannot think of any other one against which even stronger objections could not be urged. If we were to impose a membership condition, if we were going to regulate the formation of unions by the number of their members, we would have the same sort of outcry; we would be told that there were unions a long time in existence which could not possibly fulfil that condition.  If we were to say that only unions which had been established, say, for a period of years would be recognised, then we would be asked, what about the trade unions which have been formed more recently to meet the changing conditions of industry?  It does not matter what condition you impose, you will find objections of the same type being raised against it as are being raised against the present proposal. The present proposal, at any rate, has the merit that the Minister or the Minister's Department does not directly yet every trade union.  If we had not a condition of this sort, the only way in which I could see the problem being solved would be that the Minister would have to set up some sort of investigation&mdash;or inquisition, as it would then be termed&mdash;into the affairs of every trade union and to decide as a result of that investigation which of them was fit to survive and which of them ought to be compelled to go out of existence or to merge their identity with some other trade union. The proposal which we have in the Bill, at any rate, has not that objection to it.  It only means this, that the right of every trade union to continue as an <Col N="2513" /> independent entity will be determined merely by its past history, by the prudence with which it has managed its affairs.</P>
      <P>I would like to say too in regard to some of the bodies which have been mentioned here that some of them are not to be found in the register of trade unions, and I do not think some of them are affiliated to the Irish Trade Union Congress, so their existence must be very obscure, and I doubt whether they are as effective organisations as is contended.  However, for unions of this sort, which are neither registered as trade unions nor affiliated to the Trade Union Congress, it seems to me that they must face up to the new position.  They can do that by federating or amalgamating or attaching themselves in some way to some of the stronger unions, if they wish to survive in that way, or else they can apply to be made excepted bodies.</P>
      <P>In regard to any applications which are made by unions to become excepted bodies, they will, of course, be very carefully considered, but my general disposition will be, I must say, not to grant these exceptions easily.  If there is a good historical case, if, in fact, the union has a long tradition behind it, then for the sake of that tradition the exception may be granted, but it must be clearly understood that, if it is granted, it will carry with it the disqualification of Section 11.</P>

I am not a bit afraid to face any impartial body who will examine their history, both as a social organism and as a national organism. I said here, and I repeat, that these bodies were a vital force in the community and that they did immense work for the workers in those areas, and I might say, as a national entity, when they made the town of Ennis and the county of Clare as tight as a drum in order to release the prisoners from <Col N="2514" /> Mountjoy.

Employment is casual in these towns and these people cannot afford to pay 6d. or a 1/- weekly into a large union, which is the only way in which they will be accepted by one of these large unions.  They are doing very valuable work and I think that is a point which should be considered.  Is the test going to be that if you have a certain amount of money you are entitled to negotiate or to picket, but if you have not that certain amount of money you are an outlaw?  We have heard of &ldquo;Tents with love and thrones without,&rdquo; but are we now going to hear of trade unions with money and outlaws without?  The Minister should seriously consider that position, because it is going to express itself in a serious fashion.  I am merely indicating to the Minister the minds of the people for whom I am speaking.  There are other Senators here who could say exactly the same.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfMichaelTierney" hpid="Professor Tierney Professor Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Professor Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in the appeal to the Minister to reconsider, if it is at all possible, even at this late hour, this whole question of making the deposit for trade unions compulsory.  I was greatly struck by the case made in regard to this part of the Bill by Senator Hogan and the more I think over it the more I am convinced that the introduction of this principle into our trade union legislation is an unfortunate thing and a thing that will not in the end be productive of any good.  It is introducing a sort of oligarchic principle into a region that is supposed to represent the finest form of democracy and it is making distinctions between bodies <Col N="2515" /> representing the most defenceless element in the community on a money basis.  That is the part of the Bill that has produced the worst effect on the minds of impartial people outside the Oireachtas.  I have heard the Bill strongly criticised on that one point alone, the introduction of a money distinction between bodies representing the workers.</P>
      <P>If that point could be got over, it would be the greatest possible improvement. Unfortunately, as the Bill stands, that represents the kernel of the whole matter.  The Bill is built up around the question of the deposit. The Minister said he could find no other means of dealing with the question. I suggest this means has come into his mind largely because he has sought along the wrong lines.  When you are dealing with a big number of particular cases, if you try to find some machinery by which you can deal with them all you are almost inevitably driven back to the money principle; there is no other way in which you can get at them.  Why is it necessary that the Minister should be the judge in this matter?  If you have a situation where you have a large number of bodies, and where you have decisions to be taken in particular cases about all these bodies, whether they are entitled to get negotiation licences, why not have that decided in a judicial fashion?  Why not set up some body which will be outside politics and trade disputes and which will have the judicial function of deciding to what trade union a negotiation licence can be given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You are setting up a tribunal under another part of the Bill which is to decide whether one or two trade unions are to represent all the workers in a particular industry or trade.  Why not set up that same body or a similar body to decide whether such-and-such a trade union should get a negotiation licence, and do away with this objectionable financial distinction?  What is wrong is that the Minister is assuming this enormously onerous and difficult task of reaching what amounts to a judicial decision on a whole series of <Col N="2516" /> particular cases.  It is as good an instance as you could find of the State arrogating to itself a whole multitude of powers and duties which it is not able, in fact, to undertake, and, when it tries to undertake it, it is inevitably driven back on some crude and often brutal expedient like this financial expedient in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is, perhaps, too late now to suggest that the whole thing might be recast on different lines, but I feel that as long as this provision making a financial distinction between one trade union and another and giving privileges to trade unions on the basis of their financial power&mdash;as long as that is enshrined in the Trade Union Bill, that Bill is not likely to have much success.</P>

I cannot see any alternative to some property test for responsibility.  I think you must realise the position has to be faced where you have these mushroom unions into which people suddenly flock when they are discontented with their previous family arrangements.  I am very much in sympathy with the Minister's anxiety to ensure responsibility in connection with these negotiating bodies.  No doubt Senator Tierney is aware that a property test is applied to persons who wish to enter elected assemblies.  For instance, every person who stands for the Dáil has to pay a deposit, which is forfeited if that person does not get a certain number of votes.</P>

They need not lose their individuality in a case of that kind. Through that federation they can negotiate and I do not see why that federation need interfere in any way with their internal arrangements.

      <P>I am afraid Senator Sir John Keane's knowledge of the trade union movement is very limited.  He should think of a bricklayer joining the same union as a plasterer.  I am not at all opposed to this question of making a deposit.  I think it is right and proper that a deposit should be made. I suggest that Irish unions of 10 years' standing or more&mdash;that goes back beyond the period when break-aways became the fashion&mdash;should get a licence without any deposit, or with a comparatively small deposit.  There is there all the security you want, because a union which has been in existence for 10 years, and which is still functioning, has proved itself in respect of its members and justified its position in the country.  To ask them to pay a small deposit is only right and just, but it is not fair to ask them to pay a levy of £2 per head in order to secure a negotiation licence.  I know another union which will have to deposit something in the neighbourhood of £10,000 which represents a levy of only 4/- per head on the members, so that the big union gets away with a comparatively light deposit, while the small union, which is perhaps more effective in its own way, is penalised to the extent of £2 per head.  The bricklayers' union in Dublin represents all the available bricklayers in Dublin and I think the same applies to Cork, where they have a local union catering for all the bricklayers there.  You have £1,000 from the Dublin bricklayers and £1,000 from the Cork bricklayers and so on.  I suggest that a modification on the lines I suggest be made and that unions of 10 years' standing or more, which are native unions, should get a licence without any deposit, or with only a small deposit.  To me, it is a matter of indifference.  I should like to see consideration in a practical way given <Col N="2518" /> to these unions.  You can deal with the non-native unions by the deposit method.  It will not be any great hardship on them, but I think it would be more equitable if the suggestion I make were adopted.</P>

      <P>There is another aspect of some importance in connection with this matter.  We have been speaking up to the present of the point of view of the workers, but I gather from this that a body of employers may not get a negotiation licence, unless they are registered as a trade union in this or another country.  That is the first condition with which they must comply.  There are important industries in this country where they may not be able to muster up the seven people necessary to form a trade union.  Some of the biggest industries in the country are run by individual firms, as the Minister knows.  Suppose one of these employers had to negotiate with his workers&mdash;and each employs a very large number&mdash;what would be his position? Can a firm in itself register as a trade union?</P>

      <P>I have not any example in mind at the moment, but I can quite conceive a new industry starting here and two or three employers employing a number of workers.  They could not negotiate with their workers without a negotiation licence, and they would not be in a <Col N="2519" /> position to put down £1,000.  We have discussed this up to the present from the point of view of the workers, but I think the other side should be given some consideration.</P>

      <P>I think that the use of the word &ldquo;deposit&rdquo; without any reference to the provisions of Section 14 gives rather an erroneous impression. If you read Section 14, &ldquo;deposit&rdquo; seems to resolve itself into an investment, and it is really for the safety of a union to have such investment. I think we ought to take that into consideration.  If you talk of a deposit as a mere sum of money which becomes useless to the organisation, it would be a great hardship, but if you think of it in its new terms as determined by Section 14, it assumes another aspect.  It really becomes an investment, a safe investment, and that is for the good of a union.</P>

      <P>I should have no objection whatever to investing money, if I had it to invest.  As a matter of fact, it would be very useful to me if I could buy £20,000 worth of Guinness' shares, but what is the good of telling the Ennis United Labourers' Association that they ought to give £1,000 to the High Court, that it will be invested and that they will get the dividend that accrues?  This position must be met fairly and squarely, and it must be realised that these people cannot, and never could, afford it, but yet that they have a right.  I object to some of the titles given to these unions.  Senator Sir John Keane referred to mushroom unions but the mushroom does not take 30 or 40 years to grow.  I believe the Irish term for it is &ldquo;fás an oidhche&rdquo;&mdash;it grows in one night&mdash;and therefore &ldquo;mushroom&rdquo; is not the title to apply to these unions.  To ask them for money for investment, however, is asking them to achieve the impossible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>To give concrete examples of the difficulty that will arise on re-association, or something in the nature of federation between bodies unable to put down a deposit, <Col N="2520" /> take for instance, an organisation in this country&mdash;and when I speak of this country, I mean the whole country, North and South&mdash;the Association of Engineering and Shipbuilding Draughtsmen.  There are 470 members in this country and they are a highly technical professional body, affiliated to the Trade Union Congress. That body may not agree to put down a deposit of £1,000 on behalf of a mere 470 members, and a difficulty arises immediately owing to the technical nature of the occupations of the members of this organisation.  Into what fold would they ultimately go?  I suggest, and I have some experience in the matter, that there is scarcely an analogous organisation in the country which would be putting down a deposit into which they could go.  That is a typical example.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made of the building trades.  Each of the organisations in the building industry is an extremely old organisation.  Some of them possess charters going back to the time of Charles II, and they are quite proud of these charters, which gave them their initial rights.  There is the organisation mentioned by Senator Foran, representing the bricklayers, operating in the City of Dublin.  He referred to a small body of similar character in Cork, and there are several other numerically small organisations in that industry, and, while, at first blush, it would seem quite easy for these bodies to federate and to fuse their organisations, while it seems that there should be no difficulty about their doing so, it must be realised that the rules of these organisations have to be completely uprooted and traversed, their benefits have to be re-associated and their officials have to be re-arranged, involving enormous difficulties for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then you have small organisations in this country like the National Union of Packing Case Makers.  They are a branch of an English organisation.  I suggest that a body with 219 members would hardly be able to make this financial deposit.  That is an organisation of a technical character also.  It is difficult to see where you would get several other bodies of that character <Col N="2521" /> to come together so as to be sufficiently financially strong to be able to provide this deposit.  There is no use in our thinking of a federation in the technical sense in which federations are usually talked of.  You have to think of a complete homogeneity in regard to this new organisation, and such a task as that would be fairly formidable. These are some of the results which are bound to arise out of the working of this legislation.  The method of making a deposit proposed in the Bill will act like a guillotine, chopping off heads large and semi-large.  Is there no other method which might be thought of, one of a more flexible character which would take into consideration the various anomalies, difficulties and complexities, so that it might be adopted rather than the method of deposit outlined in the Bill?  If the method of deposit is adhered to, the resultant difficulties will be extremely great.</P>

      <P>Listening to Senator Lynch, I fail to see how some clever lawyer, and not even a very clever lawyer, could not devise some form of federation for the purpose of enabling a number of these smaller unions to get a negotiation licence. There must be a number of these smaller unions which are not troubled with rivalry of any kind.  Let them federate for the purpose of negotiating. I am not at all convinced that some simple form of federation, devised by a lawyer, would not be quite feasible. In that way these smaller unions, out of their joint resources, could make the necessary deposit.</P>

      <P>The suggestion that Senator Sir John Keane has made is that these bodies might federate for the purpose of negotiating on the question of wages and conditions of employment, but that for all other purposes they should have a separate existence. I do not know that that is the purpose of the Bill.  I doubt very much whether if you were to take from an organisation the principal function which brought it into existence, it would still continue to carry out its minor or subsidiary functions such as the provision of friendly benefits.  I am afraid it would not, and anyhow I do not think <Col N="2522" /> that is what is contemplated in the Bill.</P>

      <P>There is nothing contrary to the Bill in the proposal which Senator Sir John Keane has mentioned. In fact, when some of these organisations have come to see me and made representations in regard to the Bill, I have indicated to them that, in my view, a way out of their difficulties would be for the craft unions in the building trade to federate for the purpose of negotiating for the fixing of wages and conditions of employment as, in fact, they do.  When there is a dispute in the building trade here, all the unions are, as a rule, in it and they all negotiate as one body.  I cannot see any objection, therefore, to them formally federating themselves and continuing in a permanent form of federation in that way.  That indeed is one of the results which this Bill seeks to achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  But I say that because of suggestions that have been <Col N="2523" /> made elsewhere.  It is important, in connection with the whole of this matter, to bear in mind the aspect of it to which Senator Mrs. Concannon has directed the attention of the House, and that is, that this deposit does not cease to become the property of those who make it simply by reason of the fact that it is lodged in the High Court any more than a deposit which is lodged in a bank ceases to become the property of those who make it.  This deposit, by reason of the fact that it may be made in the form of approved income earning securities, is perhaps even better than a deposit which would be made in a bank, and, accordingly, the financial difficulties which have been stressed so greatly in the course of this debate immediately are minimised.  If there are these old established organisations which we have been told about which, by reason of the fact that they never had to raise substantial sums of money, have not got them now, but if they are of such ancient lineage that they are worthy of all this respect in which it is stated they are held, surely there will be no difficulty in the officers of these organisations going and raising the money either from the wealthier organisations within the trade union movement which would be prepared, I am sure, to help them out in a difficulty of this sort, or else from the regular sources from which such funds can be raised.</P>

      <P>We are told that they have been responsibly managed. I do not think banks would have any objection to deal with organisations <Col N="2524" /> of that sort, particularly when they know that their advances would be secure by this collateral which would be deposited in the High Court.  The provision in the Bill does not create the hardships which, it has been alleged, it will create for these old, responsible and well managed organisations, if they are, in fact, what they are described to be.  It seems to me they will have no difficulty in raising the money.  Again, we have heard of the ancient craft of the bricklayer and of the ancient craft of the plasterer. We have been told that every bricklayer in Dublin is in the Bricklayers' Guild and that every plasterer in Dublin is in the Operative Plasterers' Trade Society but we have been told nothing about the financial position of these bodies.  According to the latest returns to which I have had access, neither of these bodies would have the slightest difficulty in putting down £1,000.  They could put that sum down many times over if they were so minded.  It may be that the position has altered since these returns were submitted.  If it is altered, we know that the deterioration in their financial position will probably be only of short duration.  But if it is altered to any considerable extent, I have taken powers to deal with the situation under Section 8, by which I can reduce the minimum deposit to the nominal sums, in the case of these two organisations, of, probably, £250 or £500.  Bearing in mind the history of these organisations, it seems to me that they would have no difficulty in raising £250 or £500 in order to make the deposit.  If they had difficulty with their bankers, surely there is enough comradeship in the trade union movement, as a whole, for wealthier organisations to come along and help them out.  I think we have had built up here an entirely fictitious case against this section of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Let me revert to some of the questions put by Senator O'Connell, who changed sides in this matter.  As a rule, the Senator speaks&mdash;and quite properly speaks&mdash;for the workers, but, in the debate here to-day, he made himself the champion of the masters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator would like me to be more precise, I should say that, as a rule, he speaks on behalf of the employees.  This evening he has made himself the champion of the employers.  He spoke of an industry in which there was only one employer and hundreds or, perhaps, thousands of employees.  What, he asked, was to be the position of that employer?  His position is fully covered by paragraph (a) of sub-section (3) of Section 6.  There is nothing to prevent this single employer from negotiating with his hundreds or thousands of employees, or, as he would presumably do, with the authorised trade union representing these employees.  He goes on to ask: &ldquo;Suppose you had only two or three employers in a particular industry, what are they to do?&rdquo;  I have suggested that individual unions within one industry, such as the building trade, should federate for the purpose of conducting these negotiations.  I think it is equally open to the three, four or five employers operating in a particular industry, as Senator O'Connell has suggested, to act similarly.  I cannot see any reason why, if these employers are conducting these substantial undertakings, they should not be able to raise £1,000 between them.  But if this very unlikely hypothesis be granted, what is to prevent their joining one of the federations of employers, forming a group inside that employers' association and, through the agency of that federated association, conducting those negotiations which they find it necessary to enter into with the organisation representing their employees?  I do not think that the employers will be put in any more difficult position than that in which the employees will find themselves.  It will be just as easy for employers to federate as it will be for the employees' organisations to federate.  The main factor is that we must get some kind of impelling cause behind these two elements in industry to induce them to consider the question of rational organisation of industry.  I cannot see that we can get that impelling cause in any other way than we propose to do under sub-section <Col N="2526" /> (7)&mdash;by imposing upon them a condition which they will have to fulfil, and which many of them may have to fulfil in co-operation with other similar organisations.  I quite admit that this may be a rough-and-ready way of dealing with the matter.  We could not frame legislation upon any practical basis which would deal with particular cases, or with particular trade unions, whether of employers or employees, or which would deal with every hard case. It is an old saying that &ldquo;hard cases make bad law,&rdquo; and the only thing we can do is to find some general rule, some norm, to which the mass of individuals in the community will have to conform.  We have done that here. I do not say that it will not inflict hardship in some cases.  That is, unfortunately, almost an inevitable characteristic of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Tierney has suggested that this provision is only another example of the way the State is arrogating to itself certain functions.  The State is not arrogating to itself any function in this case.  The State has the duty to ensure that the general interest of the community will be protected and that the productive interests of the community, as a whole, will not be upset or jeopardised by irresponsible individuals.  In my view, the State has, accordingly, the obligation of trying to devise some expedient which will prevent that sort of evil from persisting.  We could perhaps, set up some sort of judicial tribunal, as Senator Tierney has suggested, which would call every organisation before it and ask it to justify its right to act on behalf of one class or the other in regard to the fixing of wages or the regulation of conditions of employment. But, surely, to set up a tribunal of that sort would be to interfere very much more and in a more objectionable way with the rights and liberties of individuals.  Not only would we be interfering in a more objectionable way but it would be found, I think, that we were interfering in a way which was impractical and impossible.  I suppose there would be about 150 organisations &mdash;some of them are not known to our law&mdash;of one sort and another which negotiate for the fixing of wages and <Col N="2527" /> the regulation of conditions of employment. Will Senators consider how long it would take a tribunal such as has been suggested to consider every one of these cases and to bring the order out of chaos which, we hope, this Bill will do something to effect?  If we were to set up the tribunal, we would have all the expense&mdash;why, I think that a tribunal of that sort might quite easily cost the Ennis Labourers' Society, for whom Senator Hogan is concerned and, undoubtedly, rightly concerned, very much more than they would be able to afford: perhaps, even more than they might be called on, under this Bill, to deposit, or to raise for purposes of depositing; and they might not be any better off.  They might not, at the end of it all, get their negotiation licence, and might be compelled by this tribunal to go out of existence, but in the meantime they would have lost their money trying to substantiate, before the tribunal, their right to survive.  It would mean that we could have these proceedings spread out over a number of years, and what would be the position with regard to Irish industry in the meantime, when you would have all those unions, which saw themselves at one time or another having to justify their existence before the tribunal, going out and competing with each other for membership and trying to ensure that, whoever else would be refused a negotiation licence, they would not be refused, trying to ensure that their dangerous rivals and competitors would be put out of existence? Would not a tribunal, such as Senator Tierney suggested, be more likely to aggravate this industrial problem than to cure it?</P>
    <P>And, again, what is going to happen in the meantime with all these unions, even if it did work?  This is a problem which is urgent.  I submit to the House that the failure of the efforts which the Irish trade union movement has made to deal with this problem is an indication that it is not the sort of problem that can be dealt with by a tribunal: that, again, it is a sort of problem with which you can deal only by imposing a general <Col N="2528" /> condition and saying to the trade union: &ldquo;If you do not conform to that general condition, arbitrary and all as it may be, and empirically applied as it may be, you have got to consider merging your identity with other organisations, or go out of business.&rdquo;  I think that the history of this problem, the domestic history of this problem, in the Irish trade union movement, is an indication that it is not the sort of thing that you can solve by tribunals.  Once you can secure preliminary reorganisation of the movement, in the way in which I think this deposit will compel that reorganisation to be undertaken, you can then set up a tribunal which will deal with the wider aspects of the question, which will not have to concern itself with whether an organisation is going to be allowed to exist in this town or that, but in what way the existing large organisations should be restricted to particular fields for the sake of peace in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>Now, I think I have dealt, as reasonably as I can, with all the points that were raised.  Senator Lynch mentioned the case of the Association of Engineering and Shipbuilding Draughtsmen.  Well, of course, that association is not a registered trade union in this country; it is one of these English trade unions, and its problem is, perhaps, more difficult on that account, but if the organisation, to which these 450 members belong, is not prepared to put up this £1,000 for them, I presume they will have to become a trade union on their own account, registered under the laws of this country, and as these are generally people in fairly well-paid jobs, again, I do not see that they are going to have any great difficulty in raising the £1,000 and making the deposit, bearing in mind that it will be in the form of interest-bearing securities and that the income arising therefrom will go to meet any bank charges that might be incurred by the organisation raising the money.  I do not wish to detain the House any longer.</P>
