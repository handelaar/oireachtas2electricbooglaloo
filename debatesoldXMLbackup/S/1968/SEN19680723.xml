      <P>This section deals with relief under Schedule E. I would again appeal to the Minister to look at this question of an allowance for fees for evening students. This is something which has been pleaded in the House year after year. I would like to express the hope that it is something on which we would be able to congratulate the Minister on the occasion of next year's Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>We have had a number of reforms in education within recent years. For the future it is fairly well established that those who reach a certain standard will be able, due to the payment of maintenance allowances, to go to the university where they are well qualified to benefit from university studies. But we have got to consider those who have been left out, those for whom this came too late. Naturally, when the higher education grants legislation was going through, pleas were made in this House on behalf of these people. There were pleas that this legislation should have been retrospective. Quite rightly, the Minister for Education said to make this retrospective to any appreciable extent would have involved a great deal of expenditure. This is a reasonable attitude to take. The present Minister might well, through the medium of the income tax code, be able to make some allowance here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we recognise we must start from this year on in regard to full-time university training, we must also recognise that many of the people now taking degrees at evening classes are doing so because, due to financial circumstances, they were not able to attend the university full-time, although <Col N="2095" /> they had the academic ability to do so with profit. A recognition of this fact should be made in the near future by giving an allowance under Schedule E in respect of fees and other necessary expenses. When we are making provision for education in the future, we should not forget these people who have been passed by owing to the fact that the new legislation, the new departure, has to start at a certain point in time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has very cleverly hung that suggestion on to section 3, which is really only concerned with exempting from income tax payments made in respect of a reduction of income because of a reorganisation of an industrial enterprise. This is a far cry from allowing for fees paid for university education. This is a case which has been argued many times, and it is a case not without attraction for many of us. However, it is not simple; it has precedent implications, and if one opened the door for these payments, it would be difficult to know when to close it. As the Senator says, it is perhaps something that could be looked at again in connection with next year's Finance Bill, because I think he himself would agree it is too late in the day to do anything about it in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised on the Second Reading the whole question of wear and tear allowances and replacement costs. It is an old chestnut, but it is a question I should like to press on the Minister. We seem to be involved in all kinds of ways of getting around the problems created by inflation because we insist on telling ourselves that the value of money is unchanged, that we are dealing with a constant, with something which is not a constant. This means that any firm which does what, in fact, the Revenue Commissioners encourage <Col N="2096" /> them to do by the stringency of their regulations, to set aside out of their profits only such sum as will enable them to write off the historical cost of their assets, will in real terms be paying profits out of the real capital of the firm. Any branch of the tax code which encourages firms to adopt such an anti-economic approach, and which penalises them if they fail to do so, is something which surely any sensible Government must try to get rid of.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there have been arguments against this, on the grounds of uncertainty, the difficulty of assessing what the replacement cost of assets would be. However, there exist price series for various types of equipment designed to enable firms to do this in their set of accounts in order to protect their capital, in order to ensure that they are not treating as profits what is money required to maintain their capital. This series is used by firms, but the firm that wants to adopt this practice has to get a second set of books for the Revenue Commissioners because of their requirement to operate these out-of-date historical cost prices. There are ways around that, investment allowances, for example, which enable the firm to write off the original sum by an arbitrary provision, but this is a devious way of handling it, and this simply represents a refusal to face up to the fact that the value of money is changing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister as an accountant, even though I know his profession has set its face so far against this&mdash;the less progressive elements in the profession&mdash;to do what I think he knows is the right thing to do economically and in an accountancy sense, and to encourage the adoption of this approach in the tax code. This would have a very beneficial effect, because many firms are very unconscious of this, and many accountants who are perfectly right to set aside a sum on an historical cost basis may or may not set aside an additional reserve to cover the change in the value of money and the increased cost of the replacement of assets; in most cases they do not bother to do so, but simply set aside enough to write off the historical cost of the assets. In doing so, they are <Col N="2097" /> acting in a manner contrary to the interests of their firm and of the economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister should encourage firms to think again on this matter. Firms should be entitled under the tax code to recover a sum on the basis of the estimated replacement cost having given evidence of the replacement cost based on a relevant series established independently by some appropriate agency. If firms were enabled to do this, they could preserve the real capital of the firm and not just the capital of the firm in out-of-date pounds. I do not think there is any more effective way of making industry conscious of the reality that lies behind the superficial figures in their accounts. There is no more effective way of encouraging them to preserve assets and build up funds for replacements and also, one would hope, for the expansion of assets.</P>
    <P>I think the case is a very strong one. The objections are well known but are, I think, of diminishing force in so far as they are strongly held to because of that innate conservatism which is to be found both in the ranks of accountants and Ministries of Finance and Revenue Commissioners. I think the Minister would want to adopt modern practices wherever possible and get away from traditions of this kind that are irrelevant and contrary to the economic interests of the country. I hope he will consider this suggestion, not, of course, in this Finance Bill because it does require thought and in any event there are other reasons why it might be difficult to amend the Bill at this time of the year, but in relation to the Finance Bill next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an argument that has been put forward on many occasions. I am not sure that the Senator is right in thinking that the arguments against it, which are well known, are diminishing. Perhaps, due to the complexity of modern technology development, there will be an increase in the element of uncertainty. It may become greater and may make it much more difficult to decide what is a replacement of a machine. In other <Col N="2098" /> words, machines, particularly in the industrial sphere, improve so much all the time that it is often difficult to relate the new machine in many ways to its predecessor. Another point in this connection is that now we are going over more and more towards the system of outright cash grants to help industry become more efficient and keep up to date with technological change. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has recently announced the introduction of a new system of adaptation grants which, I think, will act as a very real incentive to industrialists to change over, to re-equip and provide themselves with the most up-to-date machinery and plant.</P>
      <P>One of the ways in which I think Senators could look at this matter is this: when the management of a firm sit down to consider the purchase of a new machine, one of the things that will influence them in deciding to buy or not is the rate at which costs can be written off against their future profits. That is a very relevant consideration. It is perhaps the right way to look at it rather than the somewhat more academic way that Senator FitzGerald is looking at it, that is to say, when one comes to replace a machine, the amount one has been allowed for wear and tear was probably completely inadequate. What matters is the factor influencing the management at the time of the decision to purchase or not, and surely the predominant factor in the mind of management at that point of time is whether they may be able to recoup the cost of this machine out of their future profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From that point of view, we are taking a very considerable step forward here. We are rationalising the whole situation, reducing the number of rates to three. The new rates will be ten per cent, 12½ per cent and 25 per cent, so that I think we are making real progress in this section by this piece of rationalisation of the rates. I suggest that perhaps the more appropriate way of looking at it is that the particular management would be influenced in their decision by the writing off provisions available to them during the lifetime of the machine rather than <Col N="2099" /> some speculative look ahead to know whether the wear and tear allowance will enable them to put so much aside that they will be able to replace that machine at the end of its life with some much more advanced one.</P>
    <P>I do not think we are being altogether antiquated or out of date in our approach to this matter, particularly when one bears in mind the fact that this problem of adaptation and reorganisation of industry is being approached from another direction also, that is, the system of outright cash grants which are being made available on an ever-increasing scale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to intervene in a discussion on replacement to which there have been contributions by an economist and an accountant, and I hope both of them will be merciful if I show ignorance in regard to this particular matter. The Minister has said that there is a great deal of difficulty in regard to making decisions, particularly decisions regarding the future in matters of this sort. That, of course, is true because we are no longer dealing with physical wear and tear but also dealing with a technological and process obsolescence. This becomes very difficult to predict.</P>
      <P>A point of view that I should like to put forward is whether there is not a case to be made for leaving industry completely free regarding the writing off provisions. The Minister now allows three rates of writing off. Is there not a case for leaving this decision about writing off to the industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have done that in the west of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a case that this should now be part of the income tax code completely and that we allow the industry to make its decisions year by year as regards the proper rate of write off? As the Minister has said, this may well vary during the life of a machine. Some technical advance may indicate that if the costs and accounts are to be realistic, a certain machine which is perfectly healthy <Col N="2100" /> from a mechanical point of view is no longer competitive and needs to be written off as quickly as possible. There is now a pretty fair case to be made that there should be no prescribed rates of writing off such as are laid down in this Finance Bill, provided that there is no evasion or avoidance and that the industry be allowed to make its decision in accordance with certain general overall rules and that this would then be allowed by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Senator is talking about is known as free depreciation and last year we did, in fact, introduce free depreciation for the western region. Any industrial establishment there now has the right to write off its capital expenditure on plant and equipment at its discretion. Perhaps the only reason we did not extend it to the country as a whole is the consideration of cost. It would be quite expensive in the initial year. Even then, we are still going a fair distance because the initial allowance is now 60 per cent, and if a piece of equipment attracts one of these new rates of, say, 25 per cent, you can write off 85 per cent of the cost in the first year. That is getting as near free depreciation as does not make any great difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister quite took my point because while free depreciation or what Senator Dooge has referred to and which is effectively free depreciation, will get over the difficulty that firms are in fact being taxed on capital, in a sense, but it does not meet the point I made. My suggestion is that if, in fact, firms were able to get tax relief on the basis of replacement costs, they should have some objective criteria as to what would be a fair figure. This would encourage every firm in the country to be conscious of replacement costs and the reality of its capital structure. If there is free depreciation, that means that any inequity in the present system is removed&mdash;not removed; that is too strong a word&mdash;alleviated to some degree, but you do not draw the attention of firms to this issue. Some <Col N="2101" /> Irish firms need to be educated in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that the Government make a contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that focuses their attention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, because it makes it easier for them. The Government present them with certain additional capital but I want to direct the attention of these firms to this issue. I had experience myself many years ago with a State body, Aer Lingus. I raised this issue and this industry with a high degree of sophistication were not thinking about it with a sufficient degree of realism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Income tax is not a major factor in the thinking of Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that the thinking of a firm with the sophistication of Aer Lingus was not as accurate on this issue as it might have been, and therefore firms with less sophistication are not likely to appreciate the relevance of the problem. Such experience as I have had in the private and public sector suggests that that is the case. My suggestion still has merit even if the Minister is meeting the tax inequity in a different way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The inspector of taxes might be satisfied with a cash account basis but the income of a professional man, such as a doctor, is not only what he receives in cash. He may have a lot of bills for which he has not got cash and which have to be taken into account in computing his income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am right in pressing this. If a professional person can produce his actual cash accounts, I do not think he should be pressed to keep accounts in which every receipt is identifiable. We are concerned to ensure that people pay their full tax on their full revenue, having deducted expenses legitimately incurred.</P>

      <P>The inspector of taxes might say: &ldquo;We will deal with you on a cash basis, knowing that taking one year with another, it will even itself out.&rdquo; On the other hand, he may insist on having it on the narrow income basis. Strictly speaking, the inspector will be entitled to have a record of what was receivable. He can <Col N="2103" /> say: &ldquo;I know that, one year with another, it will balance out&rdquo;, and accept a cash basis.</P>

      <P>If the Minister would give enough money to the Minister for Local Government, Senator Dooge might be paid. I too had an experience with a public body who welshed on their obligation, to the embarrassment of their adviser with whom I dealt on the matter. I still think there is a valid point here. My concern is to ensure that this legislation does not require people to go to more trouble than is necessary for the purposes of this Bill, and keep records which they do not need because of what I must regard as a finicky accountancy approach. I am worried lest this phraseology will be interpreted in an onerous manner. On the question of income tax and surtax I am forced back on the Income Tax Acts. I have not got them with me as they are rather heavy to carry around.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in thinking that true returns for income tax purposes mean tax on income rather than on receipts? I think I am. Therefore, we are now requiring people, under this, to keep records of their income, with all the complications that entails. I regard this as unnecessary. If you are getting from a <Col N="2104" /> man the actual amount of cash he receives year after year, this should be sufficient. You can fiddle an income account but you cannot fiddle a cash account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>You can: it works both ways. It might happen, if you work entirely on a cash basis, that a man might get an exceptional payment in one year and that that might throw him into a much higher income tax bracket range. The purely cash basis has a lot of danger from his point of view and also from the point of view of the income tax inspector. If the man is prepared to spend enough of his money, then the cash basis need not convey at all the full range of his income.</P>
      <P>There are other complications. For instance, if the man ceases to practise a profession, the cash basis might not make any allowance for a whole lot of liabilities for expenses which are due. I think this is a matter that must be left to the discretion &mdash; if you like, to negotiation between the taxpayer and the inspector of taxes in each case. Normally, the inspector of taxes is entitled to insist on the income tax for any year being assessed on the basis of the full income for that year and not just on the cash received in respect of the year. It can happen &mdash; and very often it has happened &mdash; that the inspector of taxes, for convenience all round, in many cases will settle for returns made on a cash basis. This section is concerned that adequate records must be kept to enable one or the other basis to be adopted by the inspector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to give the impression that, in the past, there has been any difficulty in these matters. The concern is that this section when enacted might create difficulties that are not there already. Normally, the inspector of taxes has always been most reasonable in this regard. There is the difficulty of fees not being paid for a very long length of time and also of retainers not being paid in regard to services not yet rendered. The present practice&mdash;which has been satisfactory as far as the experience of anyone who has spoken <Col N="2105" /> to me on the matter is concerned and as far as my experience goes&mdash;has been quite satisfactory and there is every hope that that will continue.</P>

      <P>This is the provision in relation to marriage which is designed&mdash;if I understand it correctly&mdash;to give some benefit to people in the year in which they are married. I must make my favourite point at this stage. Provisions of this kind, while <Col N="2107" /> very welcome in the tax code&mdash;and we thank the Minister for it&mdash;should not be unaccompanied by provisions for people who are not well-off enough to pay income tax and who cannot get a similar benefit when they get married. We have to draw a line at some point to the practice of continuing to extend benefit to payers of income tax in this country&mdash;which, in itself, is desirable &mdash;unaccompanied by similar benefits to people who are not in a position to pay income tax at such a rate as to receive full benefit.</P>
      <P>I think we should ask that the Minister, in this case and in other future cases, should parallel any increases in benefits with similar increases by way of direct grant to people not paying income tax. It would be better to build the whole of this mechanism into the social welfare code, which may take time. It is desirable that social benefits, including the benefits to people getting married&mdash;at that point &mdash;should be extended to all members of the community and this can best and most effectively and simply be done through the social welfare code. When it is done under the income tax code, it is discriminating in favour of the better-off members of the community and is but an addition to a whole series of discriminations in relation to children's allowances and interest on house mortgages. This is a welcome concession but it goes only halfway: I suggest the Minister has started at the wrong half.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will continue to provide assistance to people when they are getting married. I consider he ought to start with those who are less well-off. If he has enough money, he should extend the concession to the less well-off. I look on this provision as an earnest of his intention to provide this concession to the whole community. It is being operated through the income tax code at this point. I trust the Minister will extend it on a non-discriminatory basis to all our citizens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always making the point that the way of the reformer is hard. As soon as you bring in some <Col N="2108" /> desirable improvement, invariably somebody else says you are not going far enough and that you should do this or do that. This is something well worthwhile doing on this occasion, when I had not a great deal of money to spare to give in concessions in regard to income tax.</P>
      <P>I want to make the point that Senator FitzGerald's colleagues in the other House spoke at great length on how iniquitous income tax was at the moment and they waxed eloquent on the fact that nowadays everybody is paying income tax. Senator FitzGerald's colleagues must not be right in all their speeches because they were talking exactly the opposite on this very Bill in the other House. It is a bit unreal to suggest that this is a concession to the wealthy. There is a great deal of validity in what was said in the other House, that a great many people come within the income tax net but the man starting off and who is getting married is very rarely in the wealthier section of the community. If this were something which we had given to the income tax payers at the other end of the scale, there might be some justification in the Senator's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of taxpayers at the marrying stage cannot very legitimately be described as the wealthier section of the community. This seemed to me to be a small concession which was well worth doing at this point of time: at least it was an indication of our sympathy with the problems which confront young people who are getting married today, an earnest of our wish to give some small assistance to them. I think it will be welcomed in very many cases. The vast bulk of our working population today pays income tax. I did mention in the Budget speech and elsewhere that I looked at this problem very long and earnestly on this occasion. I should have liked to do something about children's allowances because this is a mechanism which could be used to give assistance to families where it is really needed but, unfortunately, the machine as it is administered today does not make it possible to do that. It is more or less an across-the-board system at the <Col N="2109" /> moment and we will have to introduce some measure of selectivity into it to enable us to direct assistance to the families who really need assistance most. Pending that, this small concession is something that is worth doing on this occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If I used the word &ldquo;wealthy&rdquo; in the sense of relatively wealthy, I misled the House. The concession as applied excludes many people who are less well-off and it extends to the wealthy, the reasonably well-off and the not terribly well-off who are liable for income tax. I should like to know how many income tax payers there are in the country. I have not looked up the figures lately but it used to be in the region of 200,000 to 300,000.</P>

      <P>This provision which extends the allowance for scientific research to sponsored research in the universities and other bodies, which is not directly related to the actual productivity process of an industry, is to be heartily welcomed. The position is that from observation of what is occurring in other countries one finds that the firms which are freest in the direction of their research, whether it is carried out within the organisation or outside, are also those which ultimately prove the most profitable both from the private and the public point of view. In this country where industry is not organised in large units as it is in other countries it is particularly welcome that there should be every encouragement for the sponsoring of research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original provisions in this regard which were very welcome at the time have not, perhaps, had the effect one might have hoped from them. I do not know if the Minister is in a position to give us any idea of the extent to which advantage is being taken of these particular provisions but my understanding is that it has not been as wide as it might have been and that, indeed, we are still lagging very much behind in regard to sponsored research and contract research. Even if the Minister cannot give any indication about this, I wonder if he would bring the matter to the attention of the newly-formed Council on National Scientific Policy who might perhaps take it on themselves to make industry aware of this particular provision and might perhaps do some publicity in regard to the benefits both to industry and the <Col N="2111" /> general economy of such sponsored research. I should be glad if the Minister could give us any information about the extent to which this has been availed of.</P>

I accept gladly the suggestion that this is something of which the National Scientific Council should take note.</P>
      <P>I know that they are already advised on this matter and I will make sure that any proposals they put forward in this vital area will be favourably and sympathetically considered. I do regard it as a vital area. This question of science and scientific research and the application of the results of the research to industry and manufacturing industry generally are really of great importance to our development.</P>

      <P>There is just one matter of detail here. I took the trouble of looking back to the original section, seeking to discover the scope of the term &ldquo;scientific research&rdquo;, and I found it is there referred to as being any activity in the fields of natural or applied science.

      <P>On section 18, there is a class of taxpayer in this community who helps the Minister for Finance to a considerable extent. I should like to think this class of taxpayer is also a patriotic section of our community and likes to drink home-produced beer, the drinking of which helps to provide employment for Irish workers in Irish factories. But, as I said here on a few occasions in the past, many of the supervisors, who are members of ade unions, in these particular hostelries in which this beautiful drink can be got, do not seem to think it is any business of theirs to encourage the drinking of Irish-made beer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister to enlighten me now&mdash;I speak for quite a number of people who are as puzzled as I am about this&mdash;how and why it is that foreign beers, in spite of their drawbacks, in spite of tax and in spite of <Col N="2113" /> everything, are being sold in our public houses and hotels as cheaply as the beer made on the Liffey and in Dundalk. Why is it that beer can be brought from Scandinavia, Holland and Germany and put on the market here as cheaply as Harp Lager, which comes by rail from Dundalk, and the beer produced beside the River Liffey here in Dublin? Is there scope for tax dodging? Is there scope for excess profit? I think our brewers are certainly doing their share, as far as that is possible, to enable the publicans to get a fair profit out of the article they are selling, but there seems to be some bottleneck somewhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Perhaps I should put it the other way round: why is it Irish beer is as dear as foreign beer? Can the Minister throw any light on that? Is there any way in which that situation can be remedied, either by Government action or a voluntary campaign, in order to deal with those who make undue profits out of it, jeopardising the Irish industry in the process?</P>

      <P>In this connection I have no ministerial or personal expertise. I am just an ordinary beer drinker like Senator Ó Maoláin and it seems to me this question should be directed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It is not really a taxation matter at all. I have, however, heard it said that the reason this happens is that the Irish publican is anxious to maintain the status of the home-produced article and therefore charges the same price for it as he does for the imported article.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that everybody appreciates the view in medical circles that there is a connection between cigarette smoking and the incidence of lung cancer. I am wondering if the Government have ever given much consideration to the desirability of fixing the tax on tobacco with a view to the impact on the health of the population. I know quite well, of course, that if the tax is increased, that increase will be highly unpopular, but it seems to me that it is highly irresponsible for us as a community, if all the evidence points in one direction &mdash;and all the evidence seems to point in the direction of a direct connection between cigarette smoking and cancer &mdash;that we continue to make it easy and feasible for people to continue to <Col N="2115" /> smoke cigarettes. It seems to me to be absurd&mdash;and future ages may judge us as lunatics in our time&mdash;that we continue to permit people to smoke cigarettes and at the same time, we devise different kinds of health services in order to remedy the damage which people are doing.</P>
      <P>There is a way of controlling it and the way of controlling it is, of course, by making tobacco and cigarettes so dear that fewer people will smoke. There is no doubt that every time there has been the steeper increases than we have had of late in the price of cigarettes, some people said that they were finished smoking and they were. That may be only a small number of people who have ceased to smoke but one knows and meets people who, because of a very steep increase in the price of cigarettes, say that they are finished smoking and that they will be damned if they will pay the Minister for Finance that price.</P>

Of course, some people will say that this is an absurd idea but it seems to me that if the Government were satisfied or if the Minister for Health were satisfied that there is a direct connection between cancer and cigarette smoking, it is quite absurd to say that we do nothing actively to discourage it.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the manufacturer should be encouraged to increase the price but it is quite obvious that the present taxation on cigarettes has not effectively discouraged cigarette smoking. I do not know whether the Government have ever studied this problem or not but if the Government were satisfied that there was this direct connection, it seems to me that, notwithstanding temporary unpopularity, the Government certainly &mdash; and we should encourage them &mdash; should so increase taxation on cigarettes as substantially to discourage the incidence of cigarette smoking in this country. This Government, we are often told, never fear to face unpopular decisions.</P>

      <Col N="2116" /> I do not know whether the Minister has any indication as to whether the volume of tobacco used in cigarettes or pipe smoking has increased or decreased. It is quite clear that large numbers of the population appear to be affluent by reasons of the fact that they smoke cheroots and things that look like cigars. There is no doubt that the public have this feeling that cigarettes are not the thing but I would be encouraged to hear, at least, that the volume of tobacco used in cigarette smoking was being reduced. In this connection I should like to see a shift in emphasis in the taxation system, to have relatively higher increases for cigarette tobacco and cigarettes and, in fact, to encourage people to go over to cheroots and cigars.</P>
    <P>I rather think, on the basis of present knowledge in connection with the detrimental effect of cigarette smoking, that is the kind of system we should aim at&mdash;progressively higher taxation on cigarettes and a less high taxation on cigars.</P>

      <P>I must confess, I do not quite know how to answer the Senator on this one. There are many and varied points of view about it and many different aspects, indeed. I can only say, in a very broad way, that our taxation policy in regard to tobacco is not such as would encourage its increased consumption.</P>

As the Senator may realise, the Minister for Health from time to time makes different proposals, some of which have found favour with the Government and been put into practice with regard to advertising and, indeed, as I say, the desirability of preventing an increase in cigarette smoking is always something that we keep in mind in fixing the level of duty as a factor.</P>

      <P>Again, there is the usual plaint of the manner in which the taxation on wine has been placed under this Finance Bill. It has been said from time to time in connection with the recent levies on wine that these are bearing unduly on the lower-priced wines. Until recent years, we in this country were not at all a wine-drinking people but a number of years ago, perhaps due to more continental travel, our people began the practice recommended by St. Paul of taking a little wine for their stomachs' sake. This was a good thing and, indeed, in this case, the Minister for Health might well be on the side of increased consumption in contrast to his stand in regard to cigarette tobacco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had the position under this and under previous Finance Bills that rather than have an <i>ad valorem</i> duty on wines, we have a certain tax, I think it is on the bottle. This means, of course, that this bears far more <Col N="2118" /> heavily on the cheaper wines and far lighter on the more expensive wines, the expensive blends and the vintage wines, so much so, indeed, that the really good wine in this country is remarkably cheap by international standards for a non-wine-producing country. This is a tendency which I personally deplore. It may be that we should ultimately encourage our people to drink the best of wine but before we do that, we have to encourage them to drink wine at all.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that, once again, we have had this taxation in this particular form rather than as an <i>ad valorem</i> tax, which I know it would be more difficult to frame, and perhaps more difficult to administer, but it is a pity and I would hate to think that at any time in the future the Government or the Minister would go still further in this direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">

      <P>I am one of those simple people who have watched the increasing number of camp followers of St. Paul, of whom Senator Dooge spoke, imbibing this wine from the continent and I am deriving some considerable amusement from attempts to pose as experts in the choice of the said wines. Being a peasant myself and not knowing very much about this type of stuff, I have to rely on people who are supposed to know better. I was quite happy to do that until quite recently when I read some of the scandalous revelations which have created so much consternation on the continent in regard to the production of wine by some famous firms in continental countries in which everything from pyjamas to bicycle springs went into the wines which were exported.</P>
      <P>What interests me in view of that and in view of the lack of knowledge of the people of this country as to what is a good wine and what is not is whether there is any standard by which wines are judged at the point of import, whether there is any test made by excise or customs people or whoever handles this thing, to ensure that this wine is good wine. If so, have they got wine experts on the job and where did they get them? I have no objection at all to wine. I think it is very nice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2119" /> As I said, I am no judge of it myself but I would like to think, if we are, as Senator Dooge says, becoming a wine-drinking people and the best wines are comparatively cheap here that we know what these best wines are and what steps are being taken to ensure that this camouflaged bicycle grease is not imported here from some of the great centres of wine production on the continent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator Dooge, first of all, I should like to point out that alcoholic beverages have traditionally been charged duty by reference to their strength and in fact this is the socially desirable thing to do because it does develop a tendency towards a reduction in the alcoholic strength of drinks. In fact, to switch from a flat to an <i>ad valorem</i> duty, would have the opposite effect, so that although it may seem more equitable to have an <i>ad valorem</i> duty, I think it would not work towards socially desirable aims in the long run. In fact, the present duty does tend to make the dearer wines dearer and the cheaper wines cheaper because there is a higher rate of duty applicable to wine imported in bottle as compared with wine imported in casks.</P>
      <P>In answer to Senator Ó Maoláin, in so far as we are concerned in Finance and in the Revenue Commissioners, we are only concerned with the alcoholic content. We charge duty by reference to the strength. I am afraid I cannot help Senator Ó Maoláin. The only thing I can suggest is that when he goes out to dine, he bring some reasonably sophisticated member of the community with him to select the wines and, if at all possible, to pay the bill as well.</P>

      <P>The reliefs being granted in this section are highly desirable and I think it right and proper that due credit should be given to the former Minister for Finance who is <Col N="2120" /> now a Member of this House, Senator Dr. Ryan, who first initiated this particular form of relief way back in the early years of his term of office as Minister for Finance. One can only wish that it could be extended in some direction. I have no doubt that there are cases apart from widows and children where there are persons who are equally deserving of the kind of relief provided in this particular section&mdash;people with an ailing brother or sister or persons of that kind who should be entitled equally to benefit. However, I have no doubt that this will be a progressive concession which Ministers for Finance will provide in future Budgets.</P>
      <P>I often wonder whether much consideration has been given to the abolition of death duties as a means of raising tax. Of course, the question that always arises is: &ldquo;What do you substitute for it?&rdquo; Ultimately it is a question of balancing one good against the other. It does seem to me at the present time there are the beginnings of a movement of people into this country from America and England. It has been going on for some time. These are elderly, retired people, settling down here, people who are afraid of changes in their own countries and want to invest some money in this country. Indeed, one finds now by reason of disturbances both in South Africa and in the United States, more people from those countries wanting to buy up properties here and to acquire an Irish domicile. They want this because of the racial tensions in the US and in South Africa. It may well be, of course, that the attitude of the Minister for Finance and of the Revenue Commissioners would be that it would be a very good thing for the Exchequer if they acquired an Irish domicile, difficult though that is to do in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other question arises of the number of people who are discouraged from taking up permanent residence here simply because of the uncertainty which exists in regard to death duties and in relation to the rate payable in Britain which is considerably less. This is a subject on which I should like to hear the Minister for Finance&mdash;as to whether even preliminary investigations <Col N="2121" /> have been made into the question of abolishing death duty for the people who come in here with permanent incomes, build houses, perhaps get interested in industry and provide in many parts of rural Ireland, where many of those people prefer to take up residence, as fine an income and employment for many people as perhaps the smaller type of industry which is the only possible kind in the case of many counties.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister for Finance will say: &ldquo;What do you substitute for death duties?&rdquo; There are other sources of revenue. The added value tax might or might not be used in partial substitution for death duties, if they were abolished. No doubt the added value tax would be used to replace other forms of existing taxation. It seems to me to be something that is well worth thinking about at this stage in the light of what I understand from both auctioneers and solicitors in rural Ireland to be this increased tempo of people from other disturbed parts of the world coming in to live here. It might be seriously considered by the Government, perhaps over a period of years, so as to lay the groundwork at any rate for taking a decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can welcome the concessions made here and I think we can feel that Seanad Éireann over the past four years played a considerable part in advancing the case for the improvements we now have in this Bill. I think it shows that even though our work at the time did not bear fruit, it seems to have borne fruit subsequently and, indeed, quite speedily. For that we are all very thankful. The only point that remains is the question of annuities, since, in calculating death duties, annuities are reckoned at their present worth. As I pointed out several times, and I think we might return to it now, it is the last improvement that requires to be made in this section. That is one of the major improvements still outstanding. Under it an elderly widow, say, aged 70 who is left an annuity, in her case it could be reckoned that her expectation of life at that age is six to seven years. Therefore, the present worth of the annuity would be only seven times the amount, <Col N="2122" /> where as if she were an unfortunate widow left at the age of 40 with many young children, at that stage it would be reckoned that her expectation of life was somewhere around 28 to 30 years and, therefore, the full present worth of the annuity would be reckoned, at present rate of interest, at possibly 16 years purchase.</P>
      <P>It is obviously unfair to the more deserving case and I think the only tidy solution to the whole thing is that such annuities should be exempted from death duties altogether. If the Government are anxious to get something corresponding to what they get in this Bill why not take it on a yearly basis as it comes payable.</P>
      <P>I admit a very large section of widows have been relieved from this fear because the Bill provides that they will be paying little or no death duties and it is only in the somewhat higher capital range that it comes in. Nevertheless I would ask that we should have any desired tax paid on a yearly basis, as the annuity falls due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to support Senator O'Quigley's recommendation that perhaps through the medium of death duties something might be done to attract retired people to live the latter part of their lives here. I think it was first advocated by the late Father Coyne who was a very distinguished president of the IAOS in his time. He had a pet scheme which he advocated many times that certain regions of our coasts, the more holiday-type regions in west Cork, Kerry or portions of Connemara, might be declared as regions that carried very special exemptions from death duties, or light rates of death duties, so as to attract retired people to retire to these areas. The areas mentioned are ones that enjoy quite a considerable summer holiday tourist trade, and which are in need of some boost during the off period, and perhaps a boost could be achieved by availing of this. The climate in these regions is quite good and we could avail of the death duty differential to attract retired people there. It would be something along the lines of the concessions already made to try to attract industries to Shannon. Death duties could be similarly reckoned in <Col N="2123" /> attracting retired people to certain regions where, worthwhile winter boosting is required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The question, of course, of abolishing estate duty with a view to attracting capital is one that has been commented on many times. The first question arising in regard to any such proposition or proposal is the one that has been mentioned, that is, where would we get, or from what alternative source would we raise, the same amount of revenue. Estate duty brings in £6 million a year at present. That is a fairly substantial sum. A justification for estate duty is that it is a tax which falls on nobody in particular. You tax on the estate when it is in a state of suspension, as it were. The person who is dead has not an estate and the person who inherits has not yet got it and, therefore, theoretically, the tax falls lightly because it does not fall on anybody in particular. I do not know whether that is philosophically sustainable or not. I would be inclined to deal with the matter in more practical and realistic terms.</P>
      <P>The first question is, from what source would we get the money? The other question is whether the abolition of the duty to attract capital in here is really necessary. In recent years we have been attracting a substantial capital inflow. There have been a couple of minor interruptions but there has been a satisfactory and steady inflow. It is the sort of capital we want. It is productive capital, the capital which comes in and is put to practical work. I am not sure there is a great advantage in having old retired people coming in here even though they may be wealthy, if they are not prepared to put their money to work in this country. It is a broad question and I think at the moment at any rate we are doing as much as we need, that is, we are maintaining this tax and trying to make sure that it does not cause hardship to widows and children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two proposals in this Bill will to a large extent ensure that. In fact, from now on, from 1st April this year, if you take a widow with three children, the estate will not become liable until it <Col N="2124" /> exceeds £20,100, a widow with four children, when it exceeds £21,428 and a widow with five children £25,000. We are taking care of hardship with these proposals. Then it is a matter for great economic and philosophic debate whether or not estate duty is a good form of tax. I must say I have never been satisfied that in our circumstances it worked in any significant way against economic development. Figures seem to bear that out and they show that we have been getting a substantial inflow of capital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that point. The Senator made the point that people left other countries because of unsafe conditions, racial tensions and so on. I think a far more important factor in our case is that people may be attracted because of our way of life, the political stability and the prevailing conditions. They will be attracted to come and live here more for those reasons than for any other. I myself have a predilection towards getting our own people back here. We have to try to facilitate that in a number of ways. As Senators know, we provided that certain types of pension will be free of income tax if a person comes back to reside here. In that case we are thinking primarily of our own people, people who emigrate and spend their lifetime working abroad and who might perhaps like to come back and live here during their declining years.</P>
      <P>I do not say the last word has been said on all this question of estate duty. Indeed, if we are examining the whole structure of our taxation system in connection with the possible introduction of added value tax, then estate duty is something which would have to be looked at in that overall context. This is the only fundamental way in which it could be considered because at the present time estate duty is a very important budgetary consideration. I was nearly going to use the phrase &ldquo;at this point in time&rdquo; but the Leader of the House objects to that as a cliché.</P>

      <P>That is certainly encouraging. The Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Finance, took the great sting and the real objection there was to estate duty and to succession duty out of the code. It is quite true to say, after that, that death duty as a system of taxation is a very fairly worked out system in which people are giving to the State portion of what they were never entitled to but for the disposition made by some other person. I have always thought it a very fair code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister says at the present time there is not any lack of capital inflow into the country, there is more to the abolition of death duty than the mere inflow of capital. I think in addition to the inflow of capital&mdash; this is important in any estate&mdash;we would have people spending their incomes here whereas what happens at the present time in relation to the capital which comes in, I rather think, is that the profits or dividends on it leave the country and you would have <Col N="2126" /> much more advantage from the inflow of capital from the abolition of death duty.</P>
    <P>You would have capital coming in here in any event and a much higher proportion of income being spent in this country and in places where no factories will ever be established because people who want to leave cities like Chicago and the suburbs of Boston prefer to live in out of the way places in this country. It is remarkable even in the last year that in certain places people are coming over to this country and they are prepared to pay two prices for properties, mainly in towns, because they are enabled to acquire agricultural land without the consent of the Land Commission by virtue of the Land Act, 1965.</P>
    <P>Another thing, which is something on which the Minister for Finance should do some research and perhaps some propaganda, is the benefits for people who come over, live here for the rest of their lives and die here. Those people may have property situated abroad as well as other property, but it is still advantageous to them from the point of view of death duty to come here. However, some of those people feel they would pay double death duty, notwithstanding all the double taxation agreements we have with a number of countries. The provisions of those double taxation agreements are not fully understood even by those whose duty it would be to advise persons who ask them about what their benefits are in regard to death duty. There is not readily available any handbook for any prospective returned Irishman working in America or in England which he can get hold of to find out what the position is.</P>
    <P>I rather think the system of taxation in this country is so complex nowadays that there are very few people who are not consulted daily in relation to the kind of taxation that has to be paid by foreigners, either in relation to income tax or in relation to death duty. People find it so complex that they are not able to give the kind of on the spot assurance which they should be able to give to those people to enable them to make up their minds immediately. The Revenue Commissioners, <Col N="2127" /> the Minister for Finance or some such agency, should do something about clarifying the position of foreigners who want to come here and settle down.</P>
    <P>I should say, in that context, the foreigners I have in mind, and know of, are people who have gone from this country or whose parents went from this country and have done fairly well in America or Canada. While it is desirable to bring back as many of our own people as possible, and as I said here in relation to another matter the other day, there are still small farmers who come back and settle down, invest large sums of money in small holdings, we ought not to forget the better off and more well to do of our kith and kin who emigrated 30 or 40 years ago and who might retire, come back and live out their last days in this country. We should do everything possible to attract those people to settle down in increasing numbers in rural Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Garret FitzGerald advocated something of that nature when speaking on the Second Reading. I would be very much against that. That would be what the French call a wealth tax. The idea is, you find out the net worth of the capital for each year or over two years or three years, and then you pay a percentage of that as a tax. I can see a variety of arguments against it, not the least being administrative difficulty and great temptation to evasion. The fact is that it would almost certainly act as a disincentive to enterprise. Many such arguments can be adduced against anything in the nature of a <Col N="2128" /> wealth tax. I am not sure that the present system, if we have to have some tax of this nature, is not the best one, that is, giving those reliefs which we are now introducing. The trouble about what the Senator suggests is that any such relief immediately opens the door to all sorts of devices which enable people to effectively avoid paying duty at all.</P>

      <P>That is precisely the problem we are trying to deal with here, that is, the fact that annuities left to widows and children are capitalised and brought into the estate at that capital value. The widow and children receive reliefs here. In fact, as I mentioned, if there is a widow and two children, there would need to be a very large annuity to cause any trouble. The typical case is a widow left with a house, which is very often the family house, and an annuity or a pension. The annuity is capitalised and added to the value of the house. I think we are catering here for the average case.</P>

The tax on that would probably work out at 3/- on £20,000 or, in other words, £3,000 to £4,000, which is not a healthy bill for a widow to get at such a distressing time. Perhaps if there were a means of spreading the payment over <Col N="2129" /> a year or so, this would relieve hardship. I admit the Bill has gone a very long way towards relieving those deserving cases but there are still those above that, if it were spread over a year or more, who would get some relief.</P>

      <P>I am not sure if this is appropriate on this section. I remember raising this point before on the Succession Bill and it is as a result of that that this might arise. Before the Succession Bill, quite a lot of estates were left partly to the wife. Possibly after the Succession Act and possibly by reason of the fact that the spouse did not feel like renouncing the estate that came from the other spouse, you would find cases where the husband and wife, normally being about the one age, when the estate came to the husband or wife, as the case might be, in a very short time he or she would also pass away. The result is in the space of a very few years perhaps duty would be taken twice off an estate which normally would not have happened because there would not have been an estate for the other spouse. I wonder perhaps, in some future Finance Bill, if the Minister would not give consideration to this.</P>

      <P>This section deals with turnover tax. Turnover tax in its time has been blamed for many things. It seems to me that is has been blamed for things for which it could not possibly be the cause. There are lot of prices which shopkeepers at one time attributed to the turnover tax which have risen very steeply. I merely give an instance. The threepenny bar of chocolate shot up to fourpence in recent times. Whereas some increase was to be expected when the turnover tax came in originally, this increase in 1968 can hardly be attributable to it. The Minister will say that this is not a matter for him but for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The case made for this Bill has been made on several grounds but the issue on which the Minister appears to rely most heavily is the issue of the relationship between the population and the electorate. He has said, and there is, of course, some force in his argument, that the distribution of constituencies carried out on the basis of population would tend to some degree to weight the distribution of seats in the Dáil in favour of the urban areas. <Col N="2136" /> He has overstated his case but there is a case on this matter, and on the Second Stage, I dealt with it and I accepted that there was a case. My calculations show that as between the west of Ireland, the area to which he referred, and Dublin, there is a disparity on this account of two seats and the rest of the country in between pretty well balances out, there being fractional differences between the number of seats to which constituencies might be entitled up or down from area to area but the greatest difference arises between Dublin and the west. I listed the constituencies in the west in respect of which the discrepancies were significant ranging from about .2 or .3 of a seat up to a maximum of .55, if I recall correctly. I said also that I could see the arguments in favour of either basis of distribution.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that one can make a very good case for the present system on the grounds that it is the people of Ireland who are represented in Parliament, and if there are people in some parts of Ireland with perhaps large families, a system based on population may give legitimately more representation as there are more people with large families in such areas. Strict political theoreticians would hold, perhaps, that the purpose of Parliament is to represent the views of the electorate and that it should reflect the views of the electorate rather than those of the population. I think a good case can be made for either basis. If between these two bases, there is one which tends to favour the west and the other which tends to favour Dublin, then in that case, if people share my view that there is not much between the two systems in terms of abstract theory, I would look towards the one that favours the west. This is what the Minister has not done. He has introduced a Bill which not alone makes no reference to this matter, which not alone fails to amend the Constitution to substitute electorate for population as the basis of distribution, but which in providing a tolerance in respect of the distribution of the constituencies on a basis of population fails to permit as one of the reasons for employing such a tolerance the use of those electoral <Col N="2137" /> criteria. It is true that coincidentally the application of some of the criteria which the Bill includes may have this effect in some constituencies, although not in all relevant cases, of helping to restore the balance, or perhaps even going beyond restoring the balance, between the electorate and the population bases. But the Bill neither bases the distribution of constituencies on the electorate nor does it permit variations to be made with a view to achieving these things, although it does not prevent variations being made for other purposes so that it may incidentally have this effect. This exposes the dishonesty&mdash;which is not too strong a word to use&mdash;of the Minister's case, because if he felt strongly on this matter, if the sound and fury were accompanied by a comparable degree of genuine conviction, then he would have brought in a Bill which would have substituted &ldquo;electorate&rdquo; for &ldquo;population&rdquo;, or, alternatively&mdash;and this is the less advantageous of the two, the less proper of the two for the purpose he pretends to want to achieve &mdash;he would have brought in a Bill which would have permitted the tolerance to be employed for the purpose of adjusting the constituencies to an electorate basis and away from the population basis. He has done neither but has come in here to justify a Bill which proposes to do quite different things, much more extensive things and in that way to get over what he tells us is an injustice.</P>
    <P>There is no need to adopt such a roundabout way of achieving his objectives. There is no need to bring in a Bill which lays down that you can have 16 per cent tolerance on a population basis and that you can have this for the purpose of improving representation in dispersed areas. There is no need to adopt that subterfuge in order to achieve the results which he claims he wishes to achieve. It can be achieved by the simple amendment I now propose, and in putting down this amendment, I am calling his bluff and calling on him to stand by the words he used&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The proposal I make, therefore, is that we substitute &ldquo;electorate&rdquo; for &ldquo;population&rdquo;, and that we substitute &ldquo;register of electors&rdquo; for &ldquo;census of population&rdquo;. I also propose the deletion of the last paragraph because while I believe it is necessary so long as you work on the basis of the census of population, when we would have a long interval before the publication of the final figures, this paragraph will not be necessary, of course, if you are working on the basis of the register of electors. This is the amendment I propose. I also propose that the tolerance should be increased from the five per cent, which is the present level arising out of the Supreme Court decision of 1961, to one-twelfth or eight per cent. This is approximately half the tolerance which the Minister proposes. The reason is that I believe, and I think I can show, that with the electorate basis and with the eight per cent tolerance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to preclude myself from discussing them. The combination of the electorate basis and the tolerance of one-twelfth would have the effect of reducing to a small number of cases the cases where county boundaries would have to be crossed, and I think <Col N="2139" /> I can show there are only three cases where parts of constituencies would have to be allocatd to other constituencies in order to work within this tolerance using the electorate basis. That being the case, the argument about chopping up constituencies is diminished to the point where it is no longer important. The Minister himself has not claimed his amendment will eliminate the need for such allocation of parts of constituencies to other constituencies in all cases. Even in earlier periods when we allowed ourselves a wider tolerance with large constituencies, there were cases where parts of one county had to be attached to another. The Minister has not claimed his scheme will prevent this; he has said this will continue to happen and has said that 30 per cent tolerance would be needed in order to avoid some combination of counties. I am taking him at his word and proposing that we divide the constituency on an electorate basis with an eight per cent tolerance, and thus avoid more than a handful of county boundaries being crossed, a handful of cases in which the Minister must contemplate breaching the boundaries.</P>

      <P>I propose, therefore, to show that on the electorate basis it will be possible to avoid the crossing of county boundaries in more than three instances, only three <Col N="2141" /> cases where parts of the county have to be detached and attached to another county, so long as one has an eight per cent tolerance, and to my mind an eight per cent tolerance is acceptable if it can be used only for the purpose of preserving county boundaries when there is no alternative; it is not permissible as a means of securing high representation for certain areas of the country as a matter of policy as distinct from a matter of accident. That is why I tied up my two proposals closely.</P>
      <P>I am suggesting now that the distribution of the constituencies on an electoral basis can show the result which I claim it can achieve. I do this because I think it is not sufficient for me to assert it can be done. If I am wrong&mdash; and I may well be in error on some points&mdash;the Minister can show I am wrong, and if necessary I can make an adjustment. The following therefore is the way I would propose to divide the constituencies. I should explain that in my calculations I have had regard to figures given by the Minister in respect of the constituencies in reply to a question in the Dáil last March. It is necessary to make a slight estimation where boundaries are crossed but the margin of error is slight. If my estimation is in error I am sure the Minister will draw my attention to it and the appropriate adjustment can be made.</P>
      <P>The electorate in the county and city of Dublin including Dún Laoghaire, is 447,000, giving an entitlement of 37.55 seats. I propose to give Dublin 37 seats. The entitlement on the basis of population is 39.7 seats. On an electorate basis instead of a population basis Dublin loses an entitlement to two seats but my proposal is that Dublin would lose three seats. So much for the allegation that we are concerned in some way to bolster up representation in Dublin at the expense of the West. That is contrary to our intention and can be achieved within the limits imposed by the Constitution and without contravening the considerations of natural justice appropriate to the method of election to Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wicklow has an electorate of 36,700 and an entitlement of 3.1 seats which I would round down to three seats. Wexford has a population of 50,000 and <Col N="2142" /> an entitlement of 4.2 seats rounded down to four seats. That is five per cent tolerance and it is well within the eight per cent I propose. Carlow-Kilkenny has a population of 55,700 an entitlement to 4.7 seats and a tolerance of between seven and eight per cent would give five seats. Waterford&mdash;and this is the one case where crossing the boundary is involved&mdash;has an electorate of 43,200 and 3.6 seats due, a number which even allowing eight per cent tolerance cannot be rounded up to a sufficient number. Consequently it becomes necessary to allocate to Waterford a small section of Tipperary perhaps of the order of 3,000 electorate, giving Waterford an entitlement to 3.9 seats which I round up to four.</P>

      <P>Tipperary has an electorate of 74,800 and an entitlement to 6.3 seats having transferred 3,000 to Waterford. There would be two three-seat constituencies and a possibility of having to cross the North-South Ridings boundaries. Longford has an electorate of 17,300 and Westmeath has an electorate of 37,900, a total electorate of 55,200, giving an entitlement to 4.05 seats, rounded down to four seats. Kildare has an electorate of 37,900 and an <Col N="2143" /> entitlement to 3.2 seats rounded down to three seats, with a 2½ per cent tolerance.</P>
      <P>Meath is another case where we have to cross the boundaries. Here we have an electorate of 39,700 and an entitlement to 3.3 seats. I have transferred part of Meath to Louth. I have made all these transfers in the direction which involves the minimum disturbance. Taking 3,600 from Meath would leave an electorate of 36,100 and an entitlement to three seats. Louth and Leitrim with an electorate of 41,800 are entitled to 3.5 seats and with the addition of 3,600 electors from Meath that brings it up to 3.8, rounded up to four seats with a tolerance of about five per cent.</P>
      <P>Monaghan has an electorate of 28,300 and Cavan has an electorate of 34,300, a total of 62,600 and an entitlement to 5.3 seats rounded down to five with a tolerance of about six per cent. Laois has an electorate of 26,000 and Offaly has an electorate of 30,200, a total of 56,200, and an entitlement to 4.75 seats rounded up to five with a tolerance of five per cent. The Cork electorate is 204,400 and there is an entitlement to 17.2 seats rounded down to 17. Kerry has an electorate of 70,100 and an entitlement to 5.9 seats rounded up to six.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Limerick has an electorate of 79,450 and an entitlement to 6.7 seats&mdash;just under 6.7 seats&mdash;rounded up by a tolerance of about five per cent to seven seats. There would be three-and four-seat constituencies as at present. Clare has an electorate of 48,200 and an entitlement to 4.05 seats rounded to four. Galway with an electorate of 87,600 is entitled to 7.35 seats rounded down to seven with a tolerance of about five per cent. Mayo has an electorate of 71,300 and is entitled to six seats. There would be two three-seat constituencies. Sligo with an electorate of 32,400 is entitled to 2.72 seats. With a ten per cent tolerance we could avoid a boundary shift here but I have opted for a lower tolerance. The people of Leitrim are so accustomed to the constituency being chopped up that another adjustment probably may not perhaps worry them unduly. I propose <Col N="2144" /> to add in part of Leitrim. There are various ways of doing this, and this is only one solution. I do not claim it is the best.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking generally. My solution of the whole question is one only of a number of solutions. I made a general interpolation which was bad oratory. If we add part of Leitrim to Sligo this brings Sligo to an entitlement of 3.7 seats with a tolerance of eight per cent rounded up to four seats. I would call the constituency Sligo-Leitrim. Roscommon has an electorate of 36,400 and an entitlement to 3.06 seats. When we add in the remainder of Leitrim, 7,650, that brings the entitlement to 3.7 again, rounded up to four with eight per cent tolerance. This means that the Sligo-Leitrim-Roscommon area would get an extra seat. One could take a more stringent view and round it down, but I have rounded it up in each case and the result is that there is this extra seat in this area. My note dealing with Donegal seems to have disappeared but the figure here works out almost exactly at 5.93 seats rounded up by one per cent tolerance of these seats&mdash;subject to correction because the piece of paper I handed to a colleague has disappeared. I shall take any correction the Minister gives me if I am wrong there but I think it is 5.9 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a distribution which accepts the Minister's basis of the electorate. It gives Dublin three fewer seats than it is entitled to. It gives the West an extra two seats more than it is entitled to on a population basis and the extra seat is distributed somewhere around the country in bits and pieces. It has a bias towards rural areas. It has an eight per cent tolerance. It avoids any undue distortion and, by minimising the crossing of county boundaries, it does not entirely cut across the local loyalties anywhere. However, I may have gone wrong somewhere. My calculations had to be estimated. I have neither the staff nor the information available to me which the Minister has. I was not able to do this calculation on the basis of precise county electorate <Col N="2145" /> figures. I have made the best possible estimates. If I am in error in any of these estimates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, of course, the first part of Senator FitzGerald's speech in favour of his amendment consisted in ascribing to me a lot of things that neither I nor anybody else on this side of the House ever said. They were merely what Senator FitzGerald would have liked me to say but, as he and everybody in the House knows, these things were, in fact, never said.</P>
      <P>I did not make the case that any part of the purpose of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill was to attempt the ridiculous operation of trying to equate exactly the value of every vote in every part of the country. I should expect Senator FitzGerald to engage in such type of operation. Neither I nor any Member of the Government intended to do any such thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment, as was explained to the House both in introducing the Second Stage of the Bill and in reply, is to give reasonable scope to avoid the injustice that was done to large sections of the population in numbers of counties. The last revision required by the decision of the High Court on the 1959 revision was strongly objected to by a number of Deputies from the Opposition Parties who represented the areas concerned and, I may say, was objected to quite as strongly by Members of the Fianna Fáil Party as well. Because of this type of injustice, described by Opposition Members as &ldquo;disfranchising&rdquo; of the people concerned, described as the &ldquo;butchering&rdquo; of counties and of constituencies, described as the &ldquo;ruthless dismemberment&rdquo; of them&mdash;because this would have to happen all over the <Col N="2147" /> country on this occasion&mdash;the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill was, in the main, decided upon. Senator FitzGerald knows that as well as everybody else. He will not be able to find any instance where it was stated that anything else was the objective.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, a fact that I countered the opposition to the Bill by pointing out that the resultant position from the enactment of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill would be that the rural vote in general would, for the first time, more nearly approximate to the value of the urban vote in general but that was quite obviously merely a by-product of the Bill. There was never any suggestion that it was part of my objective, or of the Government's objective, to attempt anything so ridiculous as trying to equate exactly the value of every vote in every part of the country. It was because we agreed with the majority view and, as I believe, with the unanimous view of all Deputies&mdash;I think all Deputies in the House but certainly all Deputies whose constituencies were in any way affected&mdash;that what happened in 1961 was unjust to the people concerned, we decided to comply with the demands that were made at that time for an amendment of the Constitution to provide a limited amount of scope for avoiding such injustices in the future.</P>
    <P>The Opposition&mdash;who, apparently, purely and simply because this was proposed by Fianna Fáil, decided to oppose it&mdash;adopted the unscrupulous and obviously unjustifiable argument that this breached the sacred principle of one man, one vote although they must have known, because the figures were available to them, that this was not so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out that, <Col N="2148" /> in fact, the present position which the Opposition want to retain resulted in conferring on the vote in the built-up areas in general a greater differential in regard to electing a Deputy than would the proposal and that while the situation resulting from that would be that votes in all parts of the country and in every constituency would not immediately be equal, still the overall result would certainly do no more than to equate the value of a rural vote in general with the urban vote in general. But I never conceded that there was any democratic requirement to ensure that every vote in every constituency would be of equal effect with every other vote. The whole basis of my argument was that far from it having been just on the last occasion to require that a part of the electorate of County Louth, for instance, should vote in Monaghan, it was inflicting an injustice on them. Deputies for County Louth, and Senator Donegan, as he then was, endorsed that view. It was quite clear that so far as the public representatives were concerned, they believed there was no gain for democracy in doing this and the people of the Ardee area who were transferred to Monaghan would not have felt in any way discriminated against if it took fractionally more Louth votes to elect a Deputy than it would Monaghan votes to elect a Deputy in the constituency of Monaghan.</P>
      <P>That was no part of the objective of the Bill which was to avoid doing these unjust things both to the people, to their public representatives and to Party organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald has argued that there is something to be said for giving a differential voting power to people with families. There may be, but there is not any way of identifying people with families and allocating some fractionally increased value to the votes of these people. There are single people in the cities as well as in the rural areas; there are married people with and without families both in rural and in urban areas; and apparently Senator FitzGerald thinks that this voting power should be given on the basis of the total population as ascertained by the census which is taken on one particular <Col N="2149" /> day of the year. Of course, the difference in the percentage of the total population that the electorate comprises in different areas does not arise solely from the proportion of children in the population in these areas. It also arises from other reasons such as the fact that there may be temporary residents on the night of the census in different areas. I pointed out that it is not just the fact that families in general may be larger in urban areas that gives rise to this. There is the question also of residents in hotels, patients in regional hospitals, children and their mothers in maternity hospitals in Dublin, and so on, and Senator FitzGerald thinks that all these should contribute&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He assumed that the only factor operating was that families were larger in the urban areas and in accordance with that, he sees it as something desirable that every vote in the urban area should have more effect in electing a Deputy than every vote in a rural area. I do not agree with that, and as I said, I think, and the Government think, that it should be sufficient to have reasonable equality in this matter and that there should be a certain amount of scope allowed in order to avoid such anomalies as the breaching of county boundaries and so on. I want to refute the suggestion that it was ever part of the objective that this should be achieved but it does so happen that in the application of the proposed maximum divergence for the purposes laid down in the Bill, the overall result will be that it is much nearer to equating the overall value of the rural vote in general with the urban vote in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the position in that regard, if the Amendment is passed, will be much nearer to this alleged principle of one man, one vote than <Col N="2150" /> the position the Opposition have been trying to hang on to. Nobody disputes that if you base the scheme of constituencies on strict parity of the number of electors per Deputy, you will, in fact, achieve equality in the value of a vote in every part of the country, but you will not avoid doing these unjust and anomalous things that had to be done in 1961. A certain permitted divergence from the national average will also be necessary. Senator FitzGerald apparently concedes that and is prepared to agree to half the maximum divergence we proposed. I do not know where he got his figures and as far as I could see he admitted that he guessed them, but quite a number of county boundaries would have to be breached if the revision were to be based on the electorate and unless there was a divergence of almost the same as we have suggested as the divergence for a revision based on the census figures.</P>
    <P>In my reply to the Second Stage debate, I pointed out that there were a number of other reasons why it was not considered desirable to change from the census as a basis for the revision of constituencies. The Government considered this question of basing it on the electorate rather than on the population, but we came to the conclusion that it was preferable not to amend the Constitution in that way because even if representation were based on the electorate, a tolerance of much the same order would be required, and there did not seem to be much to be gained in that way. As well as that, there is the fact that the census is compiled on a national basis by the Central Statistics Office and in a much more scientific way, with a much more elaborate organisation, than is the register of electors. It carries much greater authority. The census figures are generally accepted as being both accurate and reliable, whereas anybody who has any connection with political activity knows that there are many complaints with regard to the compilation of the register of electors. It is quite clear that the standard of accuracy in compiling the register of electors varies considerably from place to place. The same elaborate organisation <Col N="2151" /> for compiling the register of electors which operates in the census of population is not available.</P>

      <P>I was pointing out that I had not, at any stage, said that any part of the objective of this Bill was to ensure that every vote in every constituency would count exactly the same towards electing a Deputy and that it was not in fact in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill that we were dealing with the principle of one man, one vote, that that principle was not in fact relevant to the Third Amendment Bill but that it was very much involved in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill. It may be that that was what was confusing Senators on the opposite benches. They may have mistaken my insistence on the importance of the <Col N="2152" /> principle of every vote being treated the same but that was in connection with the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill. What I did explain in regard to this particular Bill was that even if that is accepted, it is quite clear that the position after this amendment is passed will be that the value of a rural vote in general will more nearly approach the value of a vote in an urban area.</P>
      <P>I noticed in Senator FitzGerald's approach here today that he is tacitly assuming that the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill will be passed and assuming that the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill will not be passed. As I understand it&mdash;I admit it is not an easy thing to understand the minds of the Opposition Parties&mdash; but as far as I can understand, they are in fact opposing both of these electoral reforms and we are recommending both. The Opposition obviously realise or are admitting that one at least of these will be passed. I think it must be obvious to them and it will become increasingly obvious that both will, in fact, be passed. After all, that is what they are advising, that neither should be passed. We are advising that both should be passed and I think it is reasonable to assume that it will be either both or neither. The Opposition apparently have now come round to assuming that the Third Amendment Bill will be passed and I think it will not be very long until they also appreciate that the Fourth Amendment will be passed with it.</P>
      <P>However, for the purposes of his argument on this particular amendment, Senator FitzGerald has been assuming that the Third Amendment will be passed but that we will still have multi-member constituencies and on that basis, he contends, I think, that only seven counties will be affected if his amendment is accepted. On the other hand, in the more likely event of both amendments being passed, 11 counties would be directly affected. There would be 11 counties in which it would not be possible to avoid breaching county boundaries and of course in many of these cases another county would also be affected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that in some cases the two might be counted because what I am doing is dealing with each county separately, and I am saying that on the basis of treating each county separately, there would be 11 counties in which the allocation of seats could not completely respect county boundaries. Most of those cases anyway would be involved in adjustments with another county. Senator FitzGerald found a smaller number of counties was affected because he was dealing with the improbable situation of one amendment being passed and the other not, and he was assuming the traditional grouping of parts of counties and he avoided it in that way. I want to point out that there is no reason for assuming this. It is much more reasonable to assume that either both amendments will be lost or both passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2154" /> There is obviously no advantage to be gained by changing from the traditional basis for deciding constituencies on the basis of the census. Senator FitzGerald's proposal is to start out by basing it on equality of votes and then deliberately moving away from that, whereas our proposal is to base the actual revision on the present basis of the census which has always been used, and, as I have shown, the operation of the maximum divergence that we propose would, in fact, move more towards equality of voters.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the actual manner in which Senator FitzGerald approached the allocation of seats in accordance with what would be the position if his amendments were accepted. To the Dublin area he proposes to allocate 37 seats and to the western area, the counties of Donegal and Clare and the Province of Connacht, he proposes to allocate 31 seats. In other words, he proposes an increase of three seats in the Dublin area and a decrease of two seats in the western area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>A reduction of three in Dublin by comparison with its entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>An increase of three on the present representation in Dublin. Even on the present basis if no change were to be made and on the basis of the assumption that we make, that the High Court decision indicated that a divergence of five per cent was permissible, if that were applied to the electorate in the Dublin area the minimum number to be allocated would be 36. If it were applied to the western area, the western area could retain 32 seats as against the present 33. The absolute minimum that could be allocated to the Dublin area under the proposals in the present Bill, if it were enacted, would be 35, so that Dublin must get an increase of one seat at any rate and the increase would, in fact, probably be more. Therefore, it is quite clear, or it is likely at any rate, that the absolute number the western area would get under the present Bill would be 32 and they would be entitled to 32 if the present conditions <Col N="2155" /> were applied to the electorate rather than population, so there is no need for going to the less accurate and less reliable register of electors rather than the census.</P>
      <P>I think then that there is no need for this and that, in fact, what we are proposing is more desirable and will be more effective in avoiding the breach of county boundaries either in the unlikely event of the present system of multi-member constituencies being maintained or in the more likely event of the single-seat system being introduced. In either case under what we propose it would be possible to avoid the breach of county boundaries. Under Senator FitzGeralds's proposal, he himself admits that in the multi-member constituencies, I think, seven counties would be affected and at least 11 would be affected under a system of single-seat constituencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the amendment, the reason for which was summed up very well by Senator E. Ryan in column 1591 of volume No. 65, No. 15 of the Official Debates of Wednesday, 17th July, 1968:</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, it is quite legitimate and only proper and just to try to have some difference between city constituencies and county constituencies to redress this balance and to provide that it will require something in or about the same number of electors to elect a Teachta Dála in a city constituency as in a remote rural constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all in agreement on that and what we are asking the Minister and the Government is to put it down in the Bill. In other words, if the Government insist that in the basis of representation one large determining factor will be the number of electors per Deputy and if it is the desire to have this the same, then why not make that change in the Bill? It is obviously wrong to write into the Bill a scheme based on population and then to go round with all the various and nefarious suggestions that were quoted trying to show that, in effect, tolerance <Col N="2156" /> would only succeed in redressing the balance and you would have the same number of electors per Deputy in Donegal as in Dublin. It seems totally wrong, if that is to be the basis, to play around with population figures and not to deal with the figure concerned, that is, the number of electors.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if the Government wish to say that all in the population are equal when it comes to representation and that the child counts just the same as the adult, if they hold that viewpoint, the representation should be based on population as given in the Bill. But the Government seem to be trying to get away from that and I suggest that just as the figures quoted by the Minister show that by applying the tolerance he would have roughly the same representation of electors in Donegal as in Dublin, he should do that for all the other counties as well and then the muddle that is created will be self-evident.</P>
    <P>In the amendment which I am sponsoring at a later stage, I am seeking to make the basis of representation slightly lower than that produced by Senator FitzGerald and to make it based on those over 18 and then, of course, based on figures that have come from the population statistics and, due to the fact that these population statistics are taken only every five years, then it seems reasonable that a slightly lower limit of 18 would mean that at some stage you would have the vote going down to 18&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As Senator Quinlan was good enough to cite me in support of his proposals, I want to make it clear that a study of the ratio between electorate and population in all of the constituencies shows quite clearly that in almost all cases it takes more of the electorate to elect a Deputy in the rural areas than in the city areas. Consequently, I would support any proposal that would redress this in a general way.</P>

For that reason, I think the Third Amendment as it stands is a much better way of dealing with it because it deals both with the question of the ratio between electorate and population and with the question of suitable areas of representation. Consequently, I think that, as it stands, it is a much better way of dealing with both than trying to segregate two or three problems and trying to deal with them separately.</P>

      <P>It has been referred to, certainly. Are we to take it, therefore, that all these columns that I have here of the Minister dealing with the electorate and county boundaries are to be disregarded, that this was just a smokescreen by which we were supposed to be blinded and that behind all this what is wanted is not, in the Minister's words, to make it possible to keep the rural Deputy, in general, equal in value to the Deputy in the bigger cities but, instead, to do far beyond that and to give far bigger representation in order to provide convenient areas of representation? Either it is the intention that the Deputies should be equal, in which case the areas of representation will be more inconvenient in rural than in urban areas&mdash;and that is what is implied in everything the Minister has said&mdash;or, in fact, the intention is to provide a different ratio of representation, even on an electorate basis, in the west. That is what the Bill makes possible. It is what the Minister has throughout tried to persuade us is not the intention. He said most specifically, at column 1204:</P>
      <P>...mentioned in the Bill, will do no more than in general equate the value of a rural vote to that of an urban vote&mdash;if it even does that.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;In general&rdquo;&mdash;that is global&mdash;for the country as a whole, not for the west <i>versus</i> the east or the east <i>versus</i> the west. The Bill, in fact, entitles him to go far beyond that. It entitles him to transfer five seats from Dublin to the west, whereas all that is needed to achieve the objective stated is to transfer two seats. If we are to give convenient areas of representation which means giving to the west or rural areas more seats in relation to population than the rest of the country, that would do very much more than &ldquo;in general, <Col N="2159" /> equate the value of a rural vote to that of an urban vote&mdash;if it even does that.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The fact is, the Minister has throughout tried to cover up the fact that the purpose of this Bill is to eliminate the principle of one man one vote and he has introduced this red herring of the electorate, which we have now exposed totally, and this red herring of county boundaries, in order to cover up the fact that his intention is not simply to give fair representation on an electorate basis, on which we are all agreed and which he is now rejecting when I propose it, not simply to prevent, and I quote him I think, &ldquo;wholesale breaching of county boundaries&rdquo; but, beyond either of those two objectives, which are reasonable objectives with which we sympathise and would entirely support him in achieving, he wants to distort the representation in order to give extra representation to some parts of the country against others on the grounds of the character of the areas and regardless of the number of people living there.</P>
      <P>That is what the Bill enables him to do. It is stated in the Bill that that is the criterion to be applied in determining constituencies. Throughout this debate and the debate in the other House the Minister tried to throw up a smokescreen when talking about the electorate.</P>

The Minister seeks to go beyond that to enable him to gerrymander the whole country so that people in some areas will have 40 per cent more representation than people in other areas.

      <P>That is the power the Bill gives to the Commission. It requires them to achieve convenient areas of representation related to the population contrast and the ratio of population per square mile of the constituency. It gives them the power and, by implication, the encouragement to exercise it&mdash;it is, perhaps, <Col N="2161" /> even a legal requirement&mdash;to give up to 40 per cent more representation in some parts of the country than others, to give representation two and a half times as great as that required on a population basis in order to equate the electorate, which the Minister said was the objective, in order to equate the value of a vote in the city to a rural vote.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said:</P>
      <P>I trust that Senators will endorse the principle of one man, one vote of equal value which is inherent in the proposals in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Our amendment, if adopted, would make one man, one vote on an electorate basis inherent in the proposals in the Bill. It is not inherent now because the Bill requires the Commission to go far beyond that, giving perhaps two and a half times as much representation to people in some areas as in others, giving people because of their place of residence, 40 times more representation than people in other areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister throughout laid great stress on this electorate principle, until exposed, until smoked out, until I presented him with the figures which I challenged him to deny, which was that this principle can be implemented within a tolerance of eight per cent, which I think is acceptable, that this can be achieved, breaching county boundaries in only three cases. There were only three cases where parts of counties would have to be put on to other counties, those three counties being Meath, Tipperary and Leitrim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made no reply to my point. I have given him the figures, constituency by constituency, but he has sedulously avoided dealing with them. All he has to say is that this is a guess on my part. It is not a guess, any more than any projection on solid material is a guess, any more than the Government's own work in relation to the economic programmes, in relation to their capital programme and in relation to any other calculation of that kind is a guess. In fact, it is less so here because I am concerned not with projecting into the future but simply using data in respect of the constituencies <Col N="2162" /> in calculating the variation between population and electorate.</P>
    <P>The number of cases where there is divergence between county and constituency is relatively small. There are only at present seven cases where portion of one county attaches to another county. The number of population concerned is small. Therefore, the degree of error possible in such a calculation &mdash;even one carried out thoughtlessly&mdash; would necessarily be small. In any event, as the divergence between those ratios is in most cases between neighbouring counties very small, even if the job were done crudely, the degree of error would necessarily be small. I am quite prepared to be corrected. The Minister has in his Department information on the electorate in every county. If I am wrong to any degree, he will not hesitate to challenge me. If he does not do so, I can take it that my point is proven.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that I said the only factor affecting this distortion was the question of the number of children in a family. I did not say anything of the kind. This is the main factor. There are other factors, such as people in hospitals, but as between constituencies this is not a major factor. Nevertheless, what I was saying &mdash; the Minister misquoted me here&mdash;was that a case could be made for the population basis on the ground that it gave effective extra representation for families. I did not endorse such a case. In fact, I opposed it by putting down this amendment to say it should be on an electorate basis, accepting the Minister's theory which he does not believe himself. The Minister accuses me of favouring extra votes for families and proposing this. I merely said such a case is arguable: I do not argue it. I accept the Minister's theories about electorate, but he will not accept them when they are proposed. He dodges away from his theories because this does not give him an excuse for this distortion of the population which he thought, if he got away with it, it would give him. He did admit in his remarks that my proposal is much nearer to one man, one vote. It is not much nearer to it: it is one man, one vote.</P>

      <P>The Minister said the proposal was much nearer to one man, one vote. I think the record will confirm that. If the Minister doubts me, I will not press this. As regards his arguments for not accepting the electorate, I never heard anything less convincing. He said this was considered by the Government&mdash;the first time we have been told that&mdash;but that the census was more scientific and carried more authority than the electoral register figures. This is indeed true to some degree. But I would not have thought that the difference is of any significance, as the electorate who vote are the electorate on the register. It seems odd that the register is good enough for people to vote on but not good enough to distribute seats on. It is a remarkably illogical <i>non sequitur.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have no difficulty in modifying my amendment if the Minister does not like the electoral register for this purpose&mdash;the register his Department is responsible for drawing up&mdash; and taking instead the census of the population over 21 or, and I will endorse Senator Quinlan's amendment, of the population over 18. If the Minister has this confidence in the census, as distinct from the figures prepared in his own Department, I am prepared to accept that. The argument that you cannot use the electorate on the ground that the electoral register figures are not reliable does not stand. Let us take the census figures for people over 21, or preferably over 18, if Fianna Fáil are not afraid of the 18 to 21 age group, and we certainly are not. We would wholeheartedly support any proposal to franchise them because we know who would benefit at this time. The argument that the data are not available for this purpose is spurious and untrue. The data are available here from the electoral register or if the Minister <Col N="2164" /> prefers, from the census. I suggest the electoral register because it seems convenient and more relevant to an election because it is the people on the register who can vote. The fact that there may be more people entitled to vote if they are registered&mdash;the marginal error is small&mdash;is irrelevant for this purpose but if the Minister thinks it is important it can be done on the basis of population.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister tell me on what grounds he is rejecting the electoral basis we propose? He gave no grounds in the course of his remarks and I can recall no other statement that he made relevant to this point at all. He has said that this principle of the electorate is an important one and he has asked us to endorse the principle of one man, one vote, of equal value, based on this concept of the electorate in a constituency. Then, once we accept that, he says: &ldquo;No, that is not what I mean; I meant something else, something quite different on this issue.&rdquo; I think we should vote with the Minister on this and give him what he asked for. If members of his Party go the other way&mdash;they do not always agree with him&mdash;then the country can see who is in favour of an equitable system of election, one man, one vote, and to give a different ratio of electorate to population, and see who wants to rig the constituencies to their own advantage and who is not prepared to stand over his own statement, his own speech, his own endorsement of the system.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that our calculations are based on the assumption that the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill will be rejected. I must admit that is an assumption that I tend to favour and the most realistic one to work on in the light of the present state of public opinion, but in fact our calculations do not depend on this, because within the county area, the figures I have given for three, four, or five seat constituencies are within the Minister's tolerances and I have checked carefully to make sure that is so. The Minister, in the course of his speech the other day, named precise figures for the tolerances in three, four and five seat constituencies and I think he will find all my proposals fall within these limits. There is no quarrel between <Col N="2165" /> us on that. Therefore, if the constituency I propose is within these limits and it is divided up <i>pro rata,</i> we can see that there will be no problem about boundaries within the constituency being broken up by electoral divisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has frequently used electoral divisions, especially in city areas, and broken them into units in which there may not be a population of more than 200 and has departed from traditional boundaries and established new boundaries arbitrarily which bore no relation to any past or present administrative division. There is therefore no significant problem and all the figures I have put forward are within the tolerance limits imposed and there should be no problem about subdivisions of this kind. In nearly every case, the tolerance involved gives ample leeway so that it should be possible to break up an electoral division if the Minister decides to do so. The Minister's statement that my calculations are based on the assumption that the Tolerance Bill would be rejected is as untrue as the rest of his arguments which I have refuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To recapitulate some of the things the Minister said: he said that if the widespread breaching of county boundaries was to be avoided it was obviously necessary to allow the population per member in constituencies to deviate to some degree from the national average. I have made a proposal which meets his point of view on the electorate and the breaching of county boundaries, since I do not think anybody could reasonably hold that three small pieces of three small counties being involved could be regarded as widespread breaching of county boundaries when it relates to less than ten per cent of the whole. Clearly the <Col N="2166" /> Minister is thinking of more than that. I have met him on that since my proposal would avoid it. The proposal also meets him on the question of the electorate which is a valid point on which he has now turned turtle and it would ensure that the balance throughout the country would in fact favour rural areas because my proposal gives Dublin less than it is entitled to on an electorate basis and gives the rest of the country more than it is entitled to on that basis.</P>
    <P>Having met the Minister on every point other than his desire to have freedom to introduce a major distortion of his representations between the different parts of the country and totally undermine the principle of one man, one vote, I now propose that he accept the amendment, and if he does not do so, I think it will be our duty to vote for this amendment which meets all the Minister's wishes, but from which he has now run away like a frightened rabbit when he finds that he has been caught out in his attempted confidence trick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the newspapers have also tried to promulgate this agitation to the effect that this is in some way for the purpose of giving unjustified representation to the west of <Col N="2169" /> Ireland. As I said, it is not for any such purpose, and I do not believe that the people of Dublin can be induced by either the Fine Gael or the Labour Party to covet this extra representation to which they would not be entitled on the basis of voters even under what we believe to be the present permitted divergence from the national average of five per cent.</P>
      <P>As I showed here before, if what we believe to be the permitted divergence of five per cent were applied to the voters in the Dublin area and applied to the voters in the western area, the most that would be required in the western area would be a reduction from 33 Deputies to 32, and in the Dublin area the increase would be from 34 to 36, instead of, as the Opposition want to insist, the increase in the Dublin area being from 34 to 38 and the decrease in the area west of the Shannon being from 33 to 30. Even though Senator FitzGerald in his allocation of seats that he has described here today pretends to be operating a divergence of eight per cent, it is significant that he has allocated 37 seats to Dublin and only 31 to the west, whereas if you apply five per cent to the number of voters in the west, the reduction will be only from 33 to 32; and if you apply five per cent to the number of voters in the Dublin area the increase will only be from 34 to 36, but Senator FitzGerald, pretending to apply 8? per cent, allocates an increase of three seats to the Dublin area and a decrease of two to the western area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I do not think the Dublin people covet that extra representation at all. In fact, I would not be surprised if quite a number of people in Dublin would not see anything wrong if the representation was left as it is at present, that is, 34 for the Dublin area and 33 for the western area, even though the population in the western area is only 81.8 per cent of the population in the Dublin area, and the present representation is 33 in the west and 34 here. Admittedly, that is a little bit out of line, but I believe the ordinary decent Dublin man would not think it completely unjustifiable, to say the least, that some account might be <Col N="2170" /> taken of the fact that the area of the western area is 27.3 times as great as the area of the Dublin area; in other words, the area in which there is at present 33 Deputies is 2,730 per cent of the area in which there are at present 34 Deputies. The attitude of Senator FitzGerald's Party is that this must be increased to at least 38 for the smaller area and reduced to 30 for the larger area, and even with this alleged 8½ per cent tolerance as against the present five per cent, as we believe, applied to the electorate, Senator FitzGerald's allocation of seats would be 37 for the Dublin area and 31 for the western area. As I pointed out you need only a five per cent divergence applied to voters in order to retain the 32 seats in the west and to give 36 to the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator FitzGerald's guessed figures, based as they are on the figures I gave, they are not seriously out except in a couple of cases where the divergence from the actual figures amounts, in one case, to a maximum of 1,500 and, in another case, to about 1,000. They are not completely accurate but in any case the actual figures are available for counties if he is interested. I have stated that even operating the divergence that Senator FitzGerald proposes on the basis of the electorate and on the basis of single-seat constituencies, there would be 11 cases of counties in which seats could not be allocated without breaching the county boundaries, and that is not taking into account the other counties that would be affected by the adjustments that would be called for.</P>
    <P>I have shown that there is no purpose whatever to be served by this suggested change, that what we propose will not do any more than make the rural vote, in general, equally effective as the urban vote, in general. That is absolutely clear, and it is not so convincingly clear, at any rate, that what Senator FitzGerald suggests will result in a similar approach to equality in the value of votes. What he proposes is that you start off on the basis of the actual number of voters, and that you apply a divergence directly to that, but, as I have shown, by applying <Col N="2171" /> the divergence that we suggest to the total population the result over the country as a whole is a rough equalisation of the value of urban and rural votes.</P>
    <P>Although all these arguments were made in the Dáil as well as here, it is significant that it was only here that this suggestion was made, and it is quite obvious that the putting forward of this bogus amendment today is simply part and parcel of the campaign that the Opposition Parties have been conducting in the two Houses of the Oireachtas to delay the passage of these Bills.</P>

It is a fact that the register of electors is an annual compilation and that the organisation for taking it up is not as elaborate or expensive as the census machinery and it does not carry the same weight or authority as the figures in the census. It would also change from year to year and instead of being required by the Constitution to revise the constituencies after the publication of the result of each census, if this were accepted, we would have pressures for a revision of the constituencies annually, possibly, every time the register of electors disclosed that some constituencies had moved outside the constitutional requirements, as they would if this amendment were accepted.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these amendments were put down purely and simply for the purpose of delay. I can see no advantage in accepting them. As I said, the Government considered this matter and, as we saw from the result of our examination, far from what we are proposing doing any violence to this alleged principle of one man, one vote, in fact it moves closer to it. There is no reason to believe that Senator FitzGerald's series of amendments would achieve any more substantial equality in the value of the vote in other parts of the country than what we propose. It is clear that they would not be effective in enabling the injustice of breaching the county boundaries to be avoided. For that reason I reject these amendments.</P>

      <P>Tairgim leasú 2:</P>
      <P>I gCuid I, leathanach 5, &ldquo;ós cionn ocht mbliadhna déag d'aois&rdquo; a chur isteach i ndiaidh &ldquo;dhaonraidh&rdquo; i líne 28 agus i ndiaidh &ldquo;iomlán&rdquo; i líne 31; agus</P>
      <P>I gCuid II, leathanach 7, línte 14 agus 17, &ldquo;over the age of eighteen&rdquo; a chur isteach i ndiaidh &ldquo;population&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I move amendment 2:</P>
      <P>In Part I, page 4, line 28, after &ldquo;dhaonraidh&rdquo; and in line 31 after &ldquo;iomlán&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;ós cionn ocht mbliadhna déag d'aois&rdquo;; and</P>
      <P>In Part II, page 6, lines 14 and 17, after &ldquo;population&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;over the age of eighteen&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is an effort to get precision on what the Government have in mind and the basis on which they wish to reckon the numbers to be served by a Deputy. Over and above these, there would, of course, be a tolerance that would account for other factors. While the Government have given in the Bill that population is the basis, they have spent most of their speeches here endeavouring to get away from the idea of population and to say, as Senator Eoin Ryan has said, that what they want is that the number of electors per Deputy should substantially be the same whether in Donegal or in Dublin. Indeed, that is a principle on which we readily agree. We should feel happier if we saw that written into the Bill rather than having to go through some rather very abstract calculations, such as the Minister has gone into on the Second Reading speech and again today, in trying to prove that 13,000 population in Dublin is only the same as 10,000 population in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose there is not very much point in delaying on this at length because the Minister does not seem, <Col N="2175" /> in his replies to Senator FitzGerald, to give any indication that he is likely to look any more favourably on our amendment. The idea of over 18 is not in any way tied, as some newspapers have suggested, to the idea of giving the vote over the age of 18 because, irrespective of whatever opinion we may have on that issue, the present Bill has no connection with that. Therefore, there is no suggestion that, on this Stage, we are in any way proposing that the vote should be given to those over 18: I should certainly agree with this if this were the time and place to do so but this is not the time. In my view, people over 18 are fully entitled to a vote. They are entitled to and are prepared to serve in the Armed Forces. They are entitled to get married. They have completed their pre-university education. All of this means that they should be entitled to all the privileges and the rights and duties of citizenship, and in this amendment we are asking that they should be counted as full units served by a Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this amendment. I have always felt that there was something strange in the system by which constituencies were determined by numbers, including infants and young children as part of the interested population. I believe that an effective interest in political matters begins to develop about the mid-teens and can generally be counted on, on average, by about 18, that some people may develop a little earlier and perhaps some a little later and some perhaps never at all. However, at 18 as a reasonable average, people can understand what is being put up to them by politicians and weigh the question. Between the ages of 18 and 21, there is a trial period which gives them an opportunity for reflection on the responsibility they will assume when they do get the vote. By the time they have reached 18, you will have a politically interested population and that should be the basis for determining the constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This idea of an interval between the stage at which a person becomes eligible to be counted in the determination <Col N="2176" /> of the constituencies, and therefore is a target, as it were, for the representatives of political Parties, and the time when he actually gets the vote, is something which I believe might be thought about in itself as possibly a politically desirable thing to have in any case. If the vote were introduced at 18, as it might easily be, and I agree with Senator Quinlan about that, you could then move the age at which the numbers for the determination of the constituency were taken back to say 14 or 15 but there should be a period between the two. On that account I should like to support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support this amendment because like a lot of other things, we have not updated our views having regard to modern developments. The law in relation to many things is 50 or 100 years out of date. For a long time we have been trying to get rid of the unfair position in which women were. Because of the medieval idea that a married woman was her husband's chattel she was regarded by law as being in the same position as his furniture. There were the various married women's relief Acts and the crowning event was the Married Women's Status Act which was passed some time in the 1950s which put a married woman on the same basis as her husband. The curious thing through this whole period of reform was that the single woman, or as she is called, the <i>femme sole</i>, was always in as strong a position legally as a man. She was capable of making contracts and holding property but when a woman happened to have the status of being married, she lost her independence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly in relation to young people it is permissible under our law for a girl to get married at 16, or indeed I think it is permissible to get married even at 14, and for a boy to get married at 16 and found a family and then they are entitled to reliefs in income tax as married people. However, under our system we will not allow a boy or girl of 18, 19 or 20 to vote and neither will we allow them to make a contract, except for necessaries. A contract made by an infant to buy, say, a motor cycle <Col N="2177" /> on hire purchase is a contract he can refute on the grounds that a motor cycle is not a necessary.</P>
    <P>In modern times our laws relating to road traffic and licensing appeals permit a person of 18 to ride a motor cycle and, mark, you, to ride a motor cycle carrying a person without any insurance; yet we do not permit a man who is earning and paying income tax at the age of 18 to have a vote. We do not allow him to make contracts and he cannot institute proceedings in his own name. Even if in particular circumstances in an ordinary running-down accident in a case for the recovery of damages, a lodgment is made in his name, we do not permit him to say whether he will accept that sum of money. That has to be determined by the courts. Even if he is advised by lawyers, he has to go to court.</P>
    <P>In modern times the young person is far more mature, better educated and much better able to make up his mind than was perhaps his father of 20, 30 or 40 years ago. The standard of literacy and education and the standard of appreciation of public affairs is much greater among the youth today than it was of people of 20, 21 to 30, or 30 to 40, 30 or 40 years ago and signs on it, we see the manifestations sometimes in an undesirable fashion, perhaps, in England, France, America and elsewhere around the globe. Although it is not relevant to this country, young people in England, America and France can be conscripted at the age of 18, 19 or 20 and can be praised in the way they carry arms, for the way they fought and died for democratic principles, but yet we are not prepared to give the same people the vote.</P>

      <P>I accept that ruling, but, as I say, people at the age of 18 have views and they form a not unreasonable and a very important section of the community and, in any computation of the number of seats to be filled in Dáil Éireann at any particular time, we ought to have regard to the number of people aged 18 and upwards. That fits in with what Senator Garret FitzGerald was arguing here today in regard to taking into account the electorate rather than mere population figures. One valuable consequence of taking into account those aged 18 and upwards would be the stimulation in these people of an interest that they probably otherwise might not have in political affairs.</P>
      <P>If this proposal is not acceptable to the Minister, then taking into account the population over 21 would go nearer to providing the desired equality of voting strength, giving votes the same value that the Minister regarded as a principle to be endorsed in his Second Reading speech on the Third Amendment to the Constitution Bill. There are compelling reasons, I think, for accepting this amendment for the purpose of writing into the Constitution a provision to enable to a greater extent possible than under the law as it stands equality of voting strength throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. It is suggested that a responsible number of citizens, those aged 18 and upwards, should be taken into consideration. For the purpose of regulating constituencies, the Minister is taking into consideration children and infants. Surely an even more responsible body of citizens, those aged 18 and upwards to 21, should be considered in order to balance out representation in the various constituencies? I think the case is a very sound one. There is a stronger case in favour of taking this group into <Col N="2179" /> consideration for the purpose of regulating constituencies than there is for taking children and infants into consideration. I know a few young couples of 18 who are actually married and have children. They are liable for income tax. I know even younger people who have to pay income tax. Like all citizens, old and young, they have to contribute towards indirect taxation. Young men of 18 are liable for Army service; perhaps &ldquo;liable&rdquo; is not the correct word but, when they serve in the Army at that age, they shoulder the responsibilities of Army life. In addition, these young people have had the advantage of a better education than the generations who preceded them, generations who were considered when the last Constitution was being imposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>These young people <Col N="2180" /> are educated. They have the advantage of television. The programmes on television are designed to make an impact and young people learn from television because it does make a direct impact. It makes an impression. It helps them to form opinions. It creates a challenge which enables them to make decisions on various issues. The young person today of 18 years of age is more mature than previous generations at the same age.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is to Part II of the Bill which includes the infamous tolerance issue, which we oppose so violently. If we are to have a provision including this tolerance of one-sixth, then I would much prefer that all the population should be counted in rather than the population of 18 years and over. This is not on the issue as to whether or not people of 18 and over should be given the vote. The Labour Party view is that they should. This does not give these young people the vote. It is not giving them, though other Senators argued this, any special right. The amendment proposes to exclude from the count those under the age of 18. That seems to me to be the correct interpretation of the amendment. If that is so, then I would prefer including all the population, if this infamous tolerance issue is included. To simply count those of 18 and over would only make the position more unbalanced. We could not, therefore, support the amendment. This is not a question of giving the vote, or any special concession, to people aged 18 and over; it is, in effect, an amendment to take out from the count those under 18.</P>

      <P>I would not be surprised to find that Senator O'Quigley and Senator Quinlan&mdash;particularly the latter&mdash;would derive their inspiration from Franco or Salazar, but to find them getting inspiration from Ho Chi Minh and Mao Tse Tung certainly surprises me quite a lot. This left-handed attempt to bring in the question of votes at 18 was rather surprising when one recalls that the arguments <Col N="2181" /> put forward repeatedly during the debate on the Second Stage of the Constitution Amendment Bill in regard to the Government's proposals were: (1) that there was no demand for them; and (2) that the Committee on the Constitution did not recommend them. It can be said quite clearly that there was no demand either for anything connected with votes at 18 or having anything to do with that situation.</P>
      <P>In view of the slant which Senator O'Quigley attempted to give, that we were sort of backward and not forward looking in this country, that we were more or less isolated from the main stream of what was happening in the world in regard to this question of the age of 18, it is well to realise that no democratic country in Europe has a voting system at 18 years of age. Senator Quinlan's favourite country which he so often quotes&mdash;Denmark&mdash; is a democratic country all right, but it thinks so little of the value of its citizens up to the age of 23 that it does not allow them to vote. The only countries in Europe where there is anything connected with voting at that age&mdash;and it is well that we should realise it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The only area in Europe which is doing that and recognises it is the area east of what is known as the Iron Curtain, whereas west of the Iron Curtain recognition is not given or considered until people have reached the age of 21.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be well, before jumping to conclusions in regard to giving responsibility to young people at the age of 18, that the Government should carefully consider the company in which they would be marching if such a thing happened. It is not that I have any objection whatever to any direction in which they marched, providing they kept their heads above water and kept out of trouble. I do not think we should be deluded or that the people <Col N="2182" /> of the country should be deluded into believing that not giving responsibility to people of that age group means that we are backward and not in the main stream of progress as we understand it in the democratic world today. I think the amendment should certainly be rejected.</P>

A few years ago the Minister for Education in Northern Ireland introduced the 11-plus and in the following year, Dr. Hillery, when Minister for Education, reduced the scholarship age and it became the 12-plus. Any average child at the present time will be in sixth class at 12 years of age and will go to secondary school and come out at 17 and go to university. On Friday evening, if you are leaving Dublin, you will get a number of these students thumbing lifts home. One knows them and picks them up and chats with them. They are very mature people at 18 years of the age. It is for that reason that I would not like to support the amendment when it is not an all-out amendment to give votes at 18.</P>

        <i>(Longford):</i> What I see wrong with the amendment is that since it is proposed to have a tolerance factor as between sparsely populated rural areas and densely populated urban areas, when the shift of population takes place from Mayo, Leitrim, Galway, Sligo, Clare and Kerry, many of the people born in the areas I have mentioned will, in fact, have moved to Dublin, Dundalk, Drogheda, Cork or Waterford, and the result will be that people from these areas will be resident in the east and then the amendment would prevent their being counted for constituency arrangement purposes. If this amendment were carried, the result would be that children and adolescents <Col N="2184" /> under 18 in Kerry, Donegal and Leitrim would not be counted at all, whereas those over 18 who came from Leitrim to Dublin would be counted. That is my very good reason for saying that this amendment should not be considered.</P>
      <P>It would have the effect to some degree of counterbalancing the tolerance factor and I think the tolerance factor is very important indeed. It is the part of these measures that appeals to me, despite the fact that Senator Murphy is intolerant of tolerance&mdash;that is the way he put it. I do say that if you were not to count people under 18 in Leitrim, Donegal and Kerry&mdash;and that is what this amendment would mean&mdash;and if those in Dublin who had reached 18 were counted, it would to some degree defeat the purpose of tolerance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the fact that, as far as I could see, every Opposition speaker who spoke here today spoke on the basis that this amendment related in some way to a reduction of the voting age and despite the fact that An Seanadóir Ó Maoláin felt called upon to comment on some of their arguments, I believe the question of the voting age is not relevant to this Bill at all and that, in spite of what Senator Quinlan said, this amendment does not propose that the voting age be lowered. I cannot see any point in discussing this and I appreciate that the references to the voting age are put in purely and simply for the purpose of confusing the issue once again. Obviously, there is a case for and against that which could be put appropriately on some other occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that an argument that could have been used against the previous amendments was that the proposed change to electorate as a basis for the allocation of seats as between constituencies would logically imply that the same figures should be utilised for deciding the total number of seats in the country as a <Col N="2185" /> whole. If this were to be changed, as would be required by consistency, then any future reduction of the voting age would automatically result in an increase in the total number of Deputies. But, as I said, I do not think that the question of voting age is relevant to this amendment at all.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the amendment is apparently intended to be an effort to narrow the gap between the value of a vote in the cities and elsewhere by eliminating from the number of population some of the factors on which representation is based at present. But the amendment does not in fact succeed to any significant extent in correcting the injustice inherent in the present system because of course it does not take into account all the factors which give rise to the high number of the voting population in the cities.</P>
    <P>I have made out the figures for each country and for the country as a whole of the population over the age of 18. The total comes to 1,819,908. This is quite close to the number of the electorate, which is 1,713,466. But it would make little or no difference in regard to the pattern of the allocation of seats. Obviously, this indicates that it is the transient residents in the urban areas generally which make the greatest contribution to the weighting of the urban vote as against the rural vote rather than the number of children. Even, if in addition to basing the allocation of seats on the population over the age of 18, the Bill permitted a divergence of five per cent, that is the present divergence, and if this were applied, the maximum number of seats that could be allocated to the western area &mdash;Donegal, Clare and the Province of Connacht&mdash;would be 31 as against 30 if the present system remains and 32 if this divergence of five per cent was applied to the actual number of voters. In other words, there would be one less under this proposal than the number to which the area would be entitled on the basis of voters as against two less if the present system remains.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, with regard to the Dublin area, the minimum number that could be allocated on the basis of <Col N="2186" /> the population over 18 and applying a divergence of five per cent would be 38. That is exactly the minimum number that could be allocated to the Dublin area if no change at all is made, that is, if it is based on the population as at present. Therefore, this proposal would make no change at all in the Dublin area and it would make a change of only one in the western area. The difference is in fact negligible. As I pointed out, as far as the Dublin area is concerned, if the present divergence of five per cent is applied to the number of voters there, the minimum for the area would be 36 rather than 38 and the maximum to the western area would be 32 rather than 30.</P>
    <P>All this amendment does is to disclose the fact that the most effective contribution to the weighting of the urban vote as against the rural vote is the transient population which is not considered at all in this amendment. These are people such as university students and other college students, people temporarly resident in hospitals and institutions, foreigners, tourists and so on&mdash;the many other groups who go to make up the relatively large number of the voting population in the city. I can see no point whatever in accepting this amendment. It does not improve the situation in any significant degree, if indeed on closer examination it is not found to disimprove the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wondering where the Minister gets his idea that foreigners in our cities are included in the population census. I did not think that was the case. I stand subject to correction in that. As for university students and so on and the distortion they produce, it is only reasonable to hold that if university students spend a considerable amount of their time in the capital city, they are residents of the capital. You cannot lay claim to students as being rural population members when in fact they spend the greater part of their time at the university. The same applies to attendance at secondary schools and colleges. All this type of reasoning is purely an <i>ad hoc</i> effort to try to justify the leaving of <Col N="2187" /> far too much discriminatory power to the Minister.</P>
      <P>We endeavoured to pinpoint what the Minister and the Government considered should be the unit for assessment in this. We wanted the unit as the population above 18 so as to narrow the region of flexibility that would be allowed to the Minister. By all means we would allow a certain modest tolerance, but not the wild extravagant tolerance of plus or minus one-sixth asked for in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not see there is any hope at this stage of converting the Minister to this. Perhaps he may sleep on it between now and the next Stage. To give him a chance of sleeping on it, thinking over it and coming back with a Government amendment on it, my only course is to withdraw the amendment at this stage.</P>

      <P>I shall deal with two points made by Senator Quinlan. If the Senator looks at the Census of Population, 1966, Volume 1, he will find in the second paragraph of the explanatory notes under the heading &ldquo;Coverage of the Census&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>The Census figures relate to the <i>de facto</i> population, that is to say the population recorded for each area represents the total of all persons present within its boundaries on the night of 17th April, 1966, together with all persons who arrived in that area on the morning of Monday, 18th April, 1966, not having been enumerated elsewhere. Persons on board ships in port are included with the population of adjacent areas. The figures, therefore, include visitors present on Census Night as well as residents, but Irish persons temporarily absent from the State are excluded.</P>

      <P>The second point that Senator Quinlan made dealt with what he described as &ldquo;the wild, extravagant tolerance of one-sixth&rdquo;. In fact, as I showed on the Second Stage, this maximum divergence which we propose to allow&mdash;I emphasise that it is a maximum divergence which can only be operated in certain clearly defined circumstances&mdash;is substantially less than in every other known democracy. I do not know if there are any cases in which a greater degree of rigidity is insisted on than what we are proposing.</P>

    <P>3. 1º A Constituency Commission shall be established from time to time, but not less frequently than once in every twelve years.</P>
    <P>2º A Constituency Commission shall consist of seven members appointed by Dáil Éireann, of whom one (who shall be the Chairman of the Commission) shall be appointed from the judges of the Supreme Court and High Court on the nomination of the Chief Justice, three shall be appointed from the members of Dáil Éireann on the nomination of the Taoiseach and three shall be appointed, from such members of Dáil Éireann as are determined in accordance with law to be in opposition, on nomination provided for by law by members so determined.</P>
    <P>3º Any member of a Constituency Commission may resign from office by placing his resignation in the hands of the Chairman of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>4º Dáil Éireann may, for reasons which to it seem sufficient, terminate the appointment of any member of a Constituency Commission.</P>
    <P>5º The quorum of a Constituency Commission shall be four, and a <Col N="2197" /> Commission may act notwithstanding vacancies in their membership.</P>
    <P>4. As soon as may be after the establishment of a Constituency Commission, the Commission shall proceed to determine the constituencies.</P>
    <P>5. 1º A Constituency Commission shall within three months of their establishment, present to the Chairman of Dáil Éireann a report setting out the constituencies as determined by the Commission either with the unanimous agreement of their members or by a majority, but if, because of failure to secure unanimous agreement or agreement by a majority, no report is so presented, the Chairman of the Commission shall, not later than four months after the date of the establishment of the Commission, present to the Chairman of Dáil Éireann a report setting out the constituencies as determined by the Chairman of the Commission, and that report shall be taken as the report of the Commission.</P>
    <P>2º The Commission's report shall be signed by the Chairman or other member so directed by the Commission, and no minority report shall be presented.</P>
    <P>3º Immediately after the Commission's report has been presented, the Commission shall stand dissolved.</P>
    <P>6. 1º As soon as may be after the receipt by him of the Commission's report, the Chairman of Dáil Éireann shall cause the report to be laid before Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>2º If, within the next fourteen days on which Dáil Éireann has sat after the report is laid before it, a resolution amending the report is passed by a two-thirds majority by Dáil Éireann, the report shall be amended accordingly.</P>
    <P>3º Immediately after the last of the next fourteen days on which Dáil Éireann has sat after the Commission's report is laid before it, the constituencies set out in the report, or, where the report has been amended by Dáil Éireann, in the report as so amended, shall become <Col N="2198" /> and be the constituencies, provided that any alteration in the constituencies shall not take effect during the life of Dáil Éireann then sitting.</P>
    <P>7. Subject to the provisions of this Article, any matter whatsover relating to Constituency Commissions or constituencies may be provided for by law.</P>
    <P>8. 1º Until the date of the dissolution of Dáil Éireann occurring next after the 15th day of April, 1970, or occurring next after such earlier date as may be determined by a resolution passed by Dáil Éireann, Dáil Éireann shall be composed of members who represent the constituencies determined by the law in force on the 1st day of January, 1968, and all elections for membership of Dáil Éireann, including the filling of casual vacancies, shall take place in accordance with that law.</P>
    <P>2º In the case of the member of Dáil Éireann who is the Chairman immediately before a dissolution of Dáil Éireann, the law referred to in section 12 of this Article may, notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, enable him to be deemed to be elected as a second member for a constituency chosen by him, being a constituency which consists of, or includes a part of, the constituency he represented before that dissolution, but a member deemed to be elected as a second member shall not be reckoned for the purposes of sub-section 3º of section 2 of this Article.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Things are becoming somewhat confused and I want to make one or two points clear in introducing this amendment. The duty of the House and of the Opposition at any time is to try to improve any Bill or measure before it and the fact that one puts down amendments to a measure with which one totally disagrees in no way implies that one supports the particular measure. I want to make it quite clear that any of the amendments we have put down to this Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill and to the Fourth Amendment Bill are put down from a sense of obligation to mitigate as far as possible the worst effects which <Col N="2199" /> these measures would have if presented to the people and passed by them. The people must take either Bill as it stands.</P>
    <P>In the case of this Bill, we are proceeding on the assumption&mdash;it is merely an assumption&mdash;that the Bill might be passed by the people. All the indications now are, as the Minister says, that either both will be accepted or both rejected. I think the Minister is right in that and I think all the indications are that both will be rejected. Here and in the Dáil the Minister&mdash; and here last Friday night, with his speaking at great length, continuing to talk and talk&mdash;is displaying that symptom which is known to the medical profession as an anxiety neurosis.</P>

      <P>I trust this anxiety neurosis is not contagious. I want to make clear that in proposing this amendment to the Bill, that this Commission should be provided, we are not in any sense accepting or supposing that this Bill will be accepted by the people. All the indications are otherwise. Even the Minister himself must be dissatisfied and unhappy in his mind in the knowledge that the Fourth Amendment Bill is gone, that it will not be passed, that it is lost before it is put to the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Our political prophecies have been correct but I am not prophesying. I am merely looking at the facts as they are and interpreting them. Senators must accept on a hypothetical basis that the Fourth Amendment <Col N="2200" /> Bill will be defeated and it seems to us right and proper that the provision that is in that Bill, on the assumption that both the Third and Fourth Amendments Bills are going to be passed by this House, which relates to the determination and delimitation of boundaries should be written into the Third Amendment Bill. What we want to ensure is that if it is right and proper, in the context of both Bills being accepted by the people, to have a Commission to determine the constituencies, it is equally right and proper, if the Fourth Amendment Bill is defeated, to have in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill the Commission for the determination of constituency boundaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difficulty at all, if one is anyway adept as a draftsman, in avoiding consequences of that kind. Let it not be forgotten&mdash;I have a good memory for some matters and an accurate memory for most matters&mdash;that when the 1937 Constitution was enacted, there were extensive transitory provisions contained in it, running as far as Article 78. Whether there are ten, 15 or 20 such Articles makes no difference to the principle, and there was a directive contained in the Constitution as enacted by the people in 1937, that as soon as these transitory provisions were spent they would be dropped from the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time we have a Constitution limited to 50 Articles. If the Government want to go about the business of producing proper legislation for enactment by the people in a referendum and if they want to take account of the contingencies which may arise, foreseeable possibilities such as that the PR Bill might be accepted and that the Tolerance Bill might not, and <i>vice versa,</i> it is right and proper to put in each Bill the provisions relating to the delimitation of constituency boundaries by a Commission, with the provision written in that in the event of one Bill being passed, the provision relating to the constituencies in the <Col N="2201" /> other Bill shall be deleted from future copies of the Constitution, with no difficulty at all arising. It is for that reason we have put in this amendment.</P>
    <P>I want to make another thing clear. In this amendment we have taken the provisions relating to the Commission almost word for word as they are in the PR Bill, and we are trying simply to get the Minister and the House to accept the general principle of putting in this Commission. We are not parliamentary draftsmen, and we do not have the hierarchy of civil servants the Minister has available to him to draft these matters in the manner in which they ought to be drafted. If the House is disposed to accept in principle this amendment, and I think it is a reasonable one, then a transitory provision can be incorporated which would enable one of the Commissions to be dropped in the event of the Fourth Amendment Bill being adopted. There are other matters which perhaps ought to be attended to and which the Minister's legal advisers and his parliamentary draftsman can decide are proper to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>It is as simple as that. I think it is a fair approach to the possibility that one Bill may be accepted and another may not. If the PR Bill were defeated and the Tolerance Bill, which though not a new concept is new in the way it is spelt out in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, is to be implemented for the first time, it is highly desirable that this should be done by a Commission which is quite independent or which at least would be presided over by a chairman who would be independent of the Dáil and who would, with the persons nominated to it, work out a scheme for constituencies which would command the support of all the electorate. I think there is everything to be said for putting the provision in both Bills, and I cannot see any argument against including it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley has stated correctly enough that he had not got the assistance of the parliamentary draftsman in drafting this amendment. I appreciate there are difficulties involved, but a little commonsense would help. This amendment is simply <Col N="2202" /> ridiculous on the face of it. There are two possibilities: first, that both amendments would be passed, which seems the more likely one. In this event what happens? I just do not know. On the one hand, we have the Commission inserted in the Fourth Amendment Bill and, on the other hand, we have Senator O'Quigley's version in the Third Amendment, and since the two are different, it is impossible to conceive what the situation would be. In the Fourth Amendment Bill proposed by the Government, the Dáil has power to amend the report of the Commission; in Senator O'Quigley's version, the Dáil has power to do so but only by a two-thirds majority. I certainly would be interested to see how Senator O'Quigley would argue this situation before the Supreme Court as to which of these, or whether either, should become law.</P>
      <P>Take the other possibility, that one of these amendments is rejected by the people and the other accepted. What is the position then? Do we have the Commission or do we not?&mdash;because on the same day the people have accepted a Commission and rejected one. It seems to me that, whichever way we look at it, this amendment is meaningless, and I cannot imagine what Senator O'Quigley thinks he is going to gain by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that, in the event of the Fourth Amendment being defeated, of which many of us are convinced, and the Third Amendment being passed, which one must concede is a possibility, we must not then find ourselves in the position that the constituencies could be adjusted within a very wide range of flexibility politically and without any guarantee that this would be done fairly. The position is that the Government are prepared to have a Commission if they get the Fourth Amendment; in other words&mdash;and this is not an unfair way of putting it; it has been put to me this way by people who have no connection with Party politics&mdash;if the Government get the Fourth Amendment and see they can be guaranteed, with their 41, 44 or 45 per cent of the votes, majorities ranging up to 98 seats <Col N="2203" /> or higher if they improve on the present level of their poll, they are prepared to give up the power to gerrymander constituencies and have a Commission; but if they do not get that and if the present electoral system is maintained, in which case they are likely to be in a minority after the next election, they want to retain the power to fix the constituencies with the extra assistance of a tolerance which would give them much more freedom in doing this to their advantage than has been the case certainly up to 1961. The Commission will be needed, is needed now, because even with the present tight tolerance, there is still some room for manoeuvring. However, in the electoral distribution at present, the solution to meet any given population census pattern is more or less automatic, in the sense that the counties which have to be put together or have to be removed and added to others more or less stand out, and there is not that much room for manoeuvre. However, with the high tolerance proposed, the room for this manoeuvring would be quite considerable. As against that the Minister has claimed&mdash;and there is some force in this&mdash;the room for manoeuvre is reduced in that, because of the requirement to stick to county boundaries, there will not be the same freedom to detach an area from one county and add it to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might point out that there are 17 seats within Cork and there will be 35 to 40 seats within Dublin, depending on how this exercise is carried out. These 52 seats are over one-third of the seats in the Dáil and they are within two countries where there is freedom to adjust the boundaries according to the political predilections of the Party in power. Gerrymandering is the word which has been used but I try to avoid ugly words if possible. Within those counties there will be reasonable room to manoeuvre. It is a fact that over one-third of the seats in the Dáil are within two counties where there is complete freedom to manoeuvre and any assiduous Minister for Local Government could secure the necessary advantage. Under an equitable system, the next general election could yield the result that Fianna Fáil would have <Col N="2204" /> 65 or 67 seats if they do not slip much further. On the basis of their performance to date and discounting the swing in the by-elections and the results of the local elections, 65 or 67 would be an assessment of the likely result. That is the position at this point in time but some miracle may happen and they may come back with about 40 seats or something in that range. With the maintenance of the present system this room to manoeuvre in the constituencies could be sufficient to bring about the extra few seats needed in that difficult situation.</P>
    <P>The purpose of not putting a Commission in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill is quite clearly to leave this room for manoeuvre. The Government are prepared to have a Commission if they have a large majority, but if the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill is defeated, they want to have this room to manoeuvre. That is what we object to. That is what our amendment is about. It is merely trying to be clever to say that you cannot have a Commission in both Bills. This is something which could be dealt with in a transitional manner. The Government want to back the horse both ways. Much as we admire Fianna Fáil, we do not like them backing horses both ways. Senator Sheehy Skeffington is not here to continue the analogy but we do not like horses being backed both ways against us.</P>
    <P>The correct and honest thing to do would be to adopt the same practice here as was adopted in the first instance, in the package deal which was got rid of by popular pressure. There should have been a separate amendment in relation to the Commission and we could happily have voted for it. We could have said to the people: &ldquo;Vote No, No, Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;Vote No, Yes, No.&rdquo; It is easier for us to say: &ldquo;Vote No, No.&rdquo; We are grateful to the Government for having facilitated us by giving us an easy slogan. Nevertheless the correct thing&mdash;and I might say the clever thing&mdash;would have been to have a separate amendment. This proposal in regard to the Commission is desirable. It is valid under any system of election and perhaps it is more <Col N="2205" /> important in a system which is likely to yield marginal results. Therefore it should not be confined to the single-seat arrangement. It should have been brought before us in a separate Bill. The original package deal was broken &mdash;it was a try-on&mdash;because of the reaction from the people. Perhaps we should have attacked this with similar vigour and success. We should have been more effective in this respect. We plead guilty on that account. We should have attacked this provision and forced the Government to put it into the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill. The original package-deal was objectionable and it was eliminated in response to popular pressure.</P>
    <P>We must now face the fact that there appears to be some problem under the rules of order and that we are prevented from deleting it from the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill. We can propose to include it in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill. There is no case against it except the clever, clever remark: &ldquo;What would happen if both Amendments were passed?&rdquo; It would be a matter for drafting.</P>

      <P>If one were passed, they would have accepted a Commission in it. I appreciate the dilemma of Fianna Fáil. It is a fact that the Commission is in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill and it cannot be deleted because an amendment is in some way out of order. It could be put in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill and the problem of what would happen if both were passed could then be dealt with. Resistance to this proposal is a clear-cut advertisement to the country that Fianna Fáil want to be able to continue gerrymandering unless they get the straight vote. This proposal for a Commission is a good idea. It would take the electoral gymnastics <Col N="2206" /> out of politics. There are some difficulties about it but they could be dealt with. They want to have the situation that if one Bill is passed without the other there could be gerrymandering. We want to expose that. We want to confront the people with Fianna Fáil's intentions. That is the purpose of this amendment and the Government will either have to accept or reject it. If they reject this amendment, it will be clear that they want a Commission only when they have such a majority that gerrymandering will be unnecessary. They are against gerrymandering in a situation in which it is unnecessary. We want to nail this intention. That is what we are doing in this amendment.</P>

      <P>Senator FitzGerald in dealing with this question of gerrymandering has more or less conceded that outside Dublin and Cork the tolerance in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill is such that it would be possible to confine the constituencies to within the county boundaries. Consequently it will be not only possible but obligatory to keep the constituencies within the county boundaries. That being so, there will be little or no room for gerrymandering outside Dublin or Cork. I am not going to deal with Cork because I am not familiar enough with it.

      <P>Consequently, as far as Dublin is concerned, any attempt to gerrymander would not be a practical proposition. Senator FitzGerald knows that. He should be honest, for a change, and admit it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1959, the proposal at that time, which is similar to the proposals at this time, was in the one Bill and that Bill provided for a Commission, practically the same as this Commission, the only substantial difference being that under that Bill, it would take a two-thirds majority to alter the Commission's decision. The protest the Fine Gael and the Labour Party made on that occasion was that there should not be a Commission at all. An amendment was moved by Deputies T.F. O'Higgins and Declan Costello to remove the provision for a Commission from the Bill.</P>
      <P>Apparently one of the tests of honesty on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party is to agree with the views of the Fine Gael Party. If so, surely if we wanted to agree with what could only be believed to be the view of the Fine Gael Party, we would not have put a proposal for a Commission into either Bill on this occasion? It is just not possible to interpret the mind of the Fine Gael Party or, indeed, the Labour Party on any matter under the sun because, in fact, they have not any mind on these matters. They purely and simply decide on the basis that, if a proposal is made by Fianna Fáil, whether or not it is clearly in response to their previously-expressed opinions, they must oppose it whether or not they are able to put forward any reasons for their opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this occasion, as I said, when we could only have expected another proposal to remove the Commission from the Bill, we find that, instead of being satisfied with one Commission on this occasion, Fine Gael want two separate <Col N="2208" /> and distinct Commissions. It was not the decision of the Fianna Fáil Party to separate the proposal for electoral reform into two separate proposals. It was not our wish to confuse the people by giving them two separate ballot papers, two differently-coloured ballot papers. That was done in response to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;public demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the wails of the Opposition Parties that they were confused, that they could not understand this whole business. Indeed, it could be assumed by any reasonable person that the intention was, when there was this demand to separate the two proposals, to support one of the proposals and to oppose the other. Obviously, however, that element in the Opposition Parties which bases all its reasoning on uncompromising opposition to anything proposed by Fianna Fáil had its way and the decision is to oppose both of these proposals.</P>
      <P>But, when a decision had to be made to separate the two proposals, obviously some choice had to be exercised. A decision had to be made as to which Bill the proposals for a Constituency Commission would be put into. I think I explained why we decided to put it into the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill rather than into the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill. The proposal in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill is to revert to the position that obtained here from 1922 to 1959&mdash;until the decision so interpreting the present constitutional provision was extracted from the High Court by the Fine Gael Party. It is quite obvious that the effect of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill will largely be to require the Government to return to a scheme of constituencies which would be very similar to that which was accepted unanimously by the Dáil and almost unanimously by the Seanad in 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Ryan pointed out, there is practically no scope for what the Opposition term &ldquo;gerrymandering&rdquo; under the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill. If the information were available and if the Minister making <Col N="2209" /> the revision were as evilly-intentioned as the Opposition allege, it is obvious that it is in the present circumstances, that require additions of part of one county to another county, that the scope for gerrymandering exists whereas, in the conditions that require a Minister, in order to comply with the Constitution, to utilise the maximum proposed divergence of one-sixth from the national average for the purpose of avoiding the breaching of county boundaries, obviously the scope for gerrymandering would considerably be reduced. Even Senator FitzGerald could not avoid admitting that that was so but he still maintained there would be a great deal of scope for gerrymandering within the confines of the boundaries of County Dublin and County Cork.</P>
    <P>Even Senator FitzGerald must know, if he were sufficiently interested and sufficiently objective to consider the matter, that, if the maximum divergence of one-sixth is operated as the Constitution would direct if this amendment is accepted by the people, if it is operated in order to avoid the breaching of county boundaries, it will result in the average population per Deputy in the Dublin area, and certainly in the Cork Borough area as well, approaching the maximum that would be permissible. In those circumstances, obviously there would have to be very near equality of population per Deputy within the confines of the boundary of County Dublin and certainly within the Borough of Cork, if not indeed within the county boundary of Cork. That being so, there would be very little scope indeed for gerrymandering even there.</P>
    <P>Anybody with any practical knowledge of politics would agree with Senator Ryan that there is not any Party organisation that could tell how different areas in the city of Dublin voted last time, much less tell how they will vote in the future. It is an indication of the contempt the Opposition Parties have for the intelligence of the people that they assume that the manner in which people voted in the past is an indication of the manner in which they will vote in the future and that they assume that the people are <Col N="2210" /> not capable of assessing the issues that are put before them. In any case, I do not believe that anybody has any reliable idea as to the voting patterns of the people in different parts of the city of Dublin. But this amendment proposes to duplicate in the Third Amendment Bill the provisions concerning the Constituency Commission which are already contained in the Fourth Amendment Bill. It was, I agree, the unanimous view of the Committee on the Constitution that in the event of any constitutional change a Commission should be set up to determine the delimitation of constituencies. It was our intention originally to have one single Bill and to provide in it that there should be a Constituency Commission but when in order to comply with the Opposition's complaints, we decided to subdivide the proposal, we had to choose the Bill into which the provision should go. We decided it was more justifiable and more necessary that there should be an impartial Constituency Commission in the proposal that would require the more fundamental change in the system of constituencies because surely if all this detailed knowledge of voting patterns is available in circumstances in which a completely new system of constituencies has to be laid out, this knowledge can be more effectively used by an unscrupulous Minister.</P>
    <P>That situation would apply if the Fourth Amendment Bill is passed and therefore when a choice had to be made, we decided that it was into that Bill that the provisions for the Commission should be inserted. I gather that the Opposition do not want to actually suggest that at this stage we should revert to a single Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but apparently they do suggest that we should further complicate the issue by having three Bills but possibly if you gave them three, they would want four or five&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and we would run out of colours for ballot papers and we would succeed in confusing the <Col N="2211" /> issue for the people. In fact, it has been apparent for some considerable time that the only hope the Opposition have is to succeed in confusing the issues because they are becoming more and more aware that these proposals are going to be accepted by the people. Senator FitzGerald argues that this detailed information about voting patterns is available but on the Second Stage of this Bill, Senator Dooge made the point that this was not the case, that there were not these definite areas which traditionally voted one way or another and could be counted upon to do so in the future. He argued that the circumstances that exist in the neighbouring island in that regard do not exist here. There is no way in which we can legally insert this Commission into the two Bills. I am legally advised that the Constitution would not permit of the submission of alternative or hypothetical proposals to the people, that when there is a referendum there must be definite proposals in the form of a Bill passed by the Oireachtas and that the proposal must be put to the people for their approval. If it is approved then it becomes part of the Constitution. There is no way in which the people can be asked to say &ldquo;put this into the Constitution in a certain eventuality and keep it out in the event of something else happening&rdquo;. Therefore the proposal to have the Commission in both Bills would just not be possible and the situation that might arise if, as it is likely, both Bills are passed, has been already described. We would have two Commissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Dáil at least an attempt was made to insert a proviso that the provision of a Constituency Commission in the Third Amendment Bill would be effective only if the Fourth Amendment was not enacted but here Senators did not even consider doing that. This whole thing is in fact very academic. As far as I understand it the Opposition intend to oppose both Bills. They claim to be equally opposed to both of them and as far as we are concerned we intend to campaign for both Bills. It is highly probable then that both Bills will be either approved or rejected. I think it seems certain that both will be approved. The Opposition <Col N="2212" /> have to all intents and purposes conceded that the Third Amendment will be enacted by the people and I think it is quite clear that since those campaigning for the enactment of the Third Amendment are also campaigning for the Fourth Amendment and those campaigning against the Third Amendment are also campaigning against the Fourth Amendment, it is reasonable to assume that since it is agreed that the Third Amendment is likely to be passed that the Fourth will also be passed. In any case in the extremely unlikely event of the Third Amendment being passed and the Fourth Amendment not being passed, there is nothing to prevent the provision of a Commission to draw up a scheme to be incorporated in a Bill to be brought before the Oireachtas but, as I said, we had no reason to believe that the Fine Gael Party had changed their minds since 1959.</P>
    <P>In 1959 as I said, Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Costello put down an amendment to remove the provision for a Constituency Commission and I quoted a statement in support of the amendment from both sections of the Coalition, Labour and Fine Gael. They are already on record in the Seanad debates but I think I will just give one quotation from Deputy O'Higgins when he was moving his amendment and it is:</P>
    <P>We think that this Constituency Commission should not be inserted into the Constitution... Let any law revising constituencies be passed here through the Dáil... ...allow Oireachtas Éireann, at the instance of whatever Government may happen to be in power, to bring in a Constituencies Revision Bill which if it offends constitutional principles, can subsequently be declared unconstitutional by the courts of this land.</P>
    <P>He also said that the Minister at the time should take responsibility, bring forward his proposals and defend them in the open in the Dáil with the Press reporting and so on. Even allowing for the inconsistency that it always associated with Fine Gael, we had no reason to believe that they would have <Col N="2213" /> changed their minds so completely with regard to the desirability, or otherwise, of having a Constituency Commission. After all, their whole argument about this proposal is that it is unreasonable to assume that 1½ per cent of the electorate could conceivably have changed their minds on this issue in the short space of nine years, despite the fact that they have had so much more experience of the system and, indeed, despite the fact that there has been such a turnover in the electorate since 1959. Here we find, however, that Fine Gael have turned a complete somersault in regard to this question of a Constituency Commission within the short space of nine years. The fact that a so-called responsible political Party, purporting to be in a position to form a government on its own, so far as we know, can change their minds so diametrically within such a short space of time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
