      <P>When the debate was adjourned last night I was considering the Government's proposals on the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution. Before proceeding along these lines, I should like to clarify a point that arose and was the subject of an interjection by the Minister during my discussion of the Third Amendment. I made the comment that the Minister had suggested in his opening speech that the Committee on the Constitution had recommended as a committee a tolerance of 12½ per cent between one constituency and another. The Minister interjected to say that he had not said any such thing. I said that what he had said at the time appeared to me to have that interpretation. It is as well in the interests of clarity in regard to the debate here, and clarity in the debate throughout the country, that the misunderstanding that has arisen in this particular regard should be cleared up because it is a misunderstanding which has already occurred in other instances.</P>
      <P>In the course of his Second Stage speech the Minister&mdash;he was talking in regard to the amount of tolerance which would be necessary in order to respect county boundaries&mdash;said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would not be possible within <Col N="1241" /> the deviation of 12½ per cent suggested by the informal Committee on the Constitution in their arguments adduced in favour of the change in the relevant constitutional provisions.</P>
    <P>The ambiguity here is that to me it was suggested, listening to the Minister, that he was talking of a deviation of 12½ per cent suggested by the informal committee. It was not a suggestion of the committee as a whole. This question of tolerance between constituencies was a question on which the committee were divided on this and on pages 19, 20 and 21 of the Report of the Constitutional Committee, the arguments for and against are given. It does give rise to ambiguity if the Minister quotes as if suggested by the Committee even if he adds that it was in the arguments adduced in favour. If he quotes it in this fashion it gives rise to a suggestion that this is the view of the committee as a whole.</P>
    <P>This misunderstanding has arisen also in the public discussion of these matters. We have had quotations in newspapers which have been taken from one side or other of the arguments, which have been quoted on points on which the committee have been divided, have been quoted in such a way that people will be led to believe that these were the views of the committee as a whole rather than the expression in the committee's report on one or other side of a question on which the committee was divided.</P>
    <P>I think it is necessary to be quite clear in this regard and I think the talk of the deviation of 12½ per cent being suggested by the committee is misleading even though there is tagged on to the end of it that it is suggested in their arguments in favour of a change. The committee made no arguments about a change. They quoted arguments in favour of a change and arguments against a change.</P>
    <P>In our discussion here and in the discussion throughout the country care should be taken in regard to this question of possible misinterpretation of the way in which this particular report was drafted. The committee was quite aware that there was a danger of misunderstanding but the <Col N="1242" /> Minister and the Members of the House can help the public debate by giving a lead in being careful in this particular matter.</P>
    <P>To resume the discussion on the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, I spoke last night to the effect that we should be able to get a certain measure of agreement as to the objectives of any electoral system. We should be able to compare the system we have here now with the system it is proposed to substitute by measuring these systems against the objectives on which we are generally agreed. In this way we could avoid a debate of the Government's proposals which would be little more than a swapping of slogans across the floor of the House.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Fourth Amendment Bill in the Dáil the Taoiseach cited as the countries to which we might look to see the operation of the new system, the United States, Canada, Australia and Britain. The Taoiseach was so hard up for countries to cite that he was obliged to include Australia in his list and he said that Australia had what is virtually a two-Party system. Australia has not got a two-Party system; Australia has got a multi-Party system in the nomenclature of these things, and Australia is governed by a Coalition Government. It is not true to say that in the present Coalition the Liberals and the Country Party are one united Party. In the tragic circumstances of the death of the late Prime Minister, it was made clear that the Country Party was no mere appendage of the Government of Australia.</P>
    <P>These are the examples which we are asked to examine. How good are these systems as models of forecasting what is likely to happen in Ireland? It is not enough to say that something happens in Britain as a result of the adoption there of the relative majority system. It must also be made clear that the circumstances in Britain are reasonably close to the circumstances here so that the consequences of adopting the relative majority system would be much the same.</P>
    <P>If we look at Britain, we see that the circumstances which affect the electoral <Col N="1243" /> system there are very different from what they are here. Britain has had for many years the relative majority system of election but the consequences of that system have been modified by the circumstance that there is in Britain a substantial concentration of votes in various regions of the country in favour of one or other of the two big Parties. The position in Britain is that the constituencies under the single seat relative majority system can be divided into three&mdash;the seats which are safe for the Labour Party no matter how unpopular the Labour Party may become, the seats that are safe for the Conservative Party no matter how unpopular the Conservatives may become and there is also the third group of marginal seats which will determine every election.</P>
    <P>Because both the Labour Party and the Conservative Party have these traditional seats in which their majorities are so great that they cannot be eroded by a landslide, under British conditions the consequences of the operation of the relative majority system are modified by the existence of these traditional strongholds. Even with a landslide against the Conservative Party in Britain there is still enough strength left in that Party to act as a vigorous Opposition, to give experience to new Members and to give a sufficiently wide choice so that there is a firm base from which an alternative Government may be found if the people at a later election decide that they wish to give the Conservatives another chance.</P>
    <P>It is so also with the Labour Party. If they lose heavily and there is a landslide Conservative victory, the industrial midlands and the Welsh valleys will send sufficient members of the Labour Party back to Parliament so that they will be able to survive as a Party large enough to provide a balanced opposition. This indeed is what happens under the relative majority system in Britain&mdash;it saves the system from its own inherent absurdities. It is these concentrations that allow the Opposition to survive a landslide defeat and it has been responsible for the fact that this system has been tolerated by the British Parliament <Col N="1244" /> and indeed by all those of the British people who do not happen to belong or wish to belong to the Liberal Party.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach or the Minister for Local Government or Government supporters wish us to look to Britain for an example as to what would happen here, they must convince us that the situation which would follow in this country would be the same as now happens in Britain. It does not follow because we do not have similar traditional strongholds for one or other major Parties in the same sense as there are strongholds for the Conservatives in the south-east of England or in the English Midlands for Labour. The British system operates on the basis that these strongholds are there but that there are sufficient marginal seats to allow the people to change the Government when they wish and it is this balance in Britain that has allowed the system to work.</P>
    <P>What happens if we do not have these? What happens if we do not have sufficient traditional strongholds for a single Party and sufficient marginal seats for a change? We can examine the latter by looking to Northern Ireland. There we have again the relative majority system. What else have we got in Northern Ireland? Again we have concentrations of huge majorities for the Unionists in certain parts and almost equally big majorities for the Nationalists in others. What about marginal seats which would allow this to operate in the way in which the British political system has operated? We have West Belfast but beyond that marginal seat there are no marginal constituencies in Northern Ireland. The result is that we have had the one Government in power, the one Party who have a traditional majority and have been sustained in power. There is virtually no possibility of a change.</P>
    <P>This has another important consequence. Because of the presence of these substantial majorities in Northern Ireland, the effect of the abolition of PR had a far lesser effect in Northern Ireland than it would have if PR were now to be abolished in this State. When PR was abolished in Northern Ireland it strengthened the hands of <Col N="1245" /> the Unionist Party. It increased the majority of the Unionist Party because the abolition of PR always favours the major Party over the smaller Party.</P>
    <P>Was this a very large effect? Whatever we might like to think about the Unionists and their machinations in abolishing PR, in fact the effect was not that large. People might say we can look to Northern Ireland where PR has been abolished and that we can say that there was not a tremendous increase in the number of seats of the Unionists because of the abolition of PR and that therefore the abolition of PR in this State will not lead to a large increase in the number of seats for Fianna Fáil; but it does not follow because in Northern Ireland this concentration allowed the Nationalists in their own stronghold areas to be still represented as an Opposition. If, indeed, the position were in Northern Ireland that the Nationalist minority had been spread more evenly through the Six County area, then indeed there would have been a complete and utter landslide in favour of the Unionists.</P>
    <P>Therefore, whether we look to Britain where the operation of this political system gives an alternation of Governments or to Northern Ireland where we find no alternation of Government, we find that in both instances the situation is not necessarily the same as it is here. Why? Because if we look at the results of any general election in this country we find no strongholds for any one Party in the sense that there are strongholds in Britain or Northern Ireland. Our people throughout the country are more uniformly divided in regard to political allegiances and therefore we cannot say from the British experience that the relative majority system will work here as well as it has worked in Britain. Neither can we say from the experience of Northern Ireland that in the event of the abolition of PR the representation of the largest Party will be only of the same order here as in Northern Ireland. We cannot make these assumptions.</P>
    <P>When we look at the United Kingdom, as the Taoiseach has asked us to look, we must look at the differences. If we do so honestly we should <Col N="1246" /> come to the conclusion that we cannot automatically transfer what happens in Britain to what may happen here. This is the reason why those interested in trying to predict the effect of the introduction of the relative majority system here have had to seek other ways of finding the answer. The Minister in his speech recommending the Fourth Amendment has dismissed as completely unrealistic all the forecasts which have been made as to the effect of the abolition of PR on the representation of the Parties in the Dáil and particularly on the strength of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Let me say immediately that I agree with the Minister when he says that he, I or anybody else cannot predict with any certainty the outcome of the next general election, whether held under PR or under the relative majority system. We cannot predict what would happen but we are not trying to predict the outcome of the next general election here: what we are concerned with in this debate is the comparison of two systems of election and if we can find a basis of comparison that will be reasonable, then we should make that comparison and draw the deductions that appear obvious from that comparison, when made. If we had sufficient data on the outcome of a past election under both systems then we would have something to go on. It is not possible to compare the outcome of a past general election under both systems because the voting which has occurred here has been under our present system and in multi-seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, those who have been interested in this have asked themselves whether it would be possible to use the results of the local elections, which are much more detailed, as a basis of an ordinary prediction of the results of the next general election as a basis of comparison of the two systems of election. The Minister has indicated that this is unrealistic and ridiculous. I do not think he should dismiss it quite so readily. I acknowledge that if anybody wishes to compare those two systems which are to be applied to Parliamentary elections on the basis of <Col N="1247" /> local elections then in fact the onus is on this person to show that this is a reasonably reliable basis on which to act. Just as I feel the onus is on the Minister and the Government in this general debate to prove that a change, for which there has been no public demand, should be made, so in this minor instance the onus is on those to say that those particular results have been used.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said there are two grounds on which those estimates are completely unreliable. Since I am one of those who made such an estimate, one of those who was responsible for a quantitative comparison on the two systems of election the onus is on me to justify what has been done. If we wish to make such a comparison, we must use the elections in which data are detailed enough so that we can get some sort of estimate of what would happen in this country if it were divided up into single member constituencies.</P>
    <P>The only data I know which are suitable for this are the local election returns, the local elections in which returns are given for wards and county electoral areas. The Minister has said it is utterly ridiculous to base an estimate on the county electoral areas because in fact the size of county electoral areas varies so tremendously throughout the country. The fact that the size of county electoral areas varies so much throughout the country has no relation to the question whether this data can be used. I trust the size of county electoral areas throughout a single county does not vary from 3,000 to 15,000, or whatever the figures were, which the Minister used.</P>
    <P>I do not know how other estimates which can be quoted have been built up but certainly in the estimate I made I did not do anything so stupid as merely to say that every county electoral area could be taken as a single-member constituency under re-distribution. In the estimate which I made, and I feel sure in the other estimates which were made, there was no attempt at taking a one for one relationship between the county electoral areas and <Col N="1248" /> the seats which would be available to be filled in single-member constituencies. Adjustments have to be made, I suggest, to make this calculation. There will be instances in which county electoral areas will have to be added together to give a reasonable approximation to single-member constituencies. In other cases the county electoral areas will have to be split and this is a matter of difficulty and a possible source of error, though one of minor error.</P>
    <P>My estimate of what would happen under single-member constituencies was particularly difficult in regard to Dublin city because here it is extremely difficult to get a correspondence between the wards and what might be the single-member constituencies, if we were to operate on the relative majority system. Nevertheless, the effort, though difficult, is one that is worthwhile. The Minister has said there can be no possible co-relation. Of course, there is not a direct co-relation but it is possible to get a correspondence.</P>
    <P>The second objection which the Minister has made is that all such projections, all such estimates, are completely invalid because there are wider panels of candidates in local elections than there are in a general election. I can speak only for the way in which I made the particular estimate which I made and I cannot speak for any other estimates, to which greater publicity was given, but in the estimate I made I may say that rather than take all the votes which were cast in the local elections in any electoral area, in the vast majority of cases I only took the votes cast for the three major Parties.</P>
    <P>This is an assumption, and it is an assumption which I think was justified. In certain cases where we had Independents who were likely to be candidates under a single-member system those were also taken into account. The Minister may think it is quite impossible for anybody to do a calculation of this sort to determine what might be the effect of an Independent candidate who is elected as an independent county councillor, on a general election. I can assure the Minister any person who is elected from a panel to this House has a pretty good idea of <Col N="1249" /> the position in the political spectrum occupied by the vast majority of Independent county councillors throughout this country. The estimate in this regard is not such a difficult one.</P>
    <P>It is of course admitted that the results of local elections will not be quite what would happen in a general election but they are a reasonably reliable guide on which we can make comparison between the present system of proportional representation and the proposed relative majority system. The fact that they will not be exact does not invalidate them as the basis of comparison. We would like, of course, to have some confirmation of this. I would like to have some confirmation about this contention of mine that they are a reliable guide.</P>
    <P>I was reluctant, being trained in the same distinguished engineering school as the Minister, to go ahead with this prediction without testing the assumptions which I had made, without as it were taking a pilot scheme on which I could base these comparisons. In this regard I was extremely lucky because there occurred within a few months the local authority elections and the by-election in the city of Cork. It was, therefore, possible, having decided how I would attempt to predict what would happen in a single-member constituency, to check this prediction by comparing it with the results which were available for the by-election, results which were available, as they always are, after by-elections, in regard to each of the wards of Cork city.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable enough to say that by and large the five wards which make up the city constituency of Cork are a fair approximation to the five single-member constituencies which would be set up under a relative majority system for Cork city. So, I was able to test out the manner in which the estimate was made for the whole country against the result for the by-election by comparing voting in one instance for city councillors and the voting in the Parliamentary by-election. When I attempted to predict the results in the five wards in the by-election from the result in the local election, <Col N="1250" /> the results were as follows: In the first ward I was one per cent too high; in the second ward, I was one per cent too high; in the third ward, I was one per cent too low; in the fourth ward, I was two per cent too high; in the fifth ward, I was three per cent too low. Taken overall, that is a fairly good confirmation of the method which had been applied, and accordingly it gave me grounds to believe that any estimate which was made for the whole country in the same way in which this sample system had been made for Cork was one which, though not exact, would certainly not be completely unreasonable.</P>
    <P>It is possible to make this calculation by making estimates, based on past experience, as to what the net gain will be to one particular party of two parties contesting a final seat when a third party has been eliminated, and, as I say, there is reasonable confidence that in fact we can use this not as a basis of prediction but as a basis of comparison. One can take the counties as they stand with their 1966 populations and work out what the result would be under proportional representation. One can, again, take those counties and their county electoral areas, modified of course to take account of variations in size, and work out what the result would be under the relative majority system. Any dispute as regards the estimates made has been in regard to what would be the position of representation of the Fianna Fáil Party under these two systems. I want to emphasise again that I am not predicting absolute values, merely making a comparison. The result of this comparison is that I estimate that under the proportional representation system the Fianna Fáil Party out of a Dáil of 144 would secure 64 seats, and that under the single-member constituency with the single non-transferable vote the Fianna Fáil Party out of a Dáil of 144 seats would secure 98 seats. This is the result of the prediction and I have given to the Minister and to the Seanad, an outline of the basis on which it is made.</P>
    <P>No talk about winning six out of seven by-elections invalidates this comparison. The Minister has in his <Col N="1251" /> speech indicated that these predictions that have been made, which I prefer to call comparisons, are on an unrealistic basis. I think the most unrealistic prediction made has been that of the Minister, who has predicted that because the Government have gained six out of seven by-elections, he is therefore quite confident of securing an overall majority at the end of the next election under the proportional representation system. The sample of seven by-elections which have taken place are not a representative sample of the strength of Dáil Éireann. Indeed the easy predictions of confident overall success under proportional representation are based on a method of prediction which any objective person would consider as far less reliable than the particular prediction which I have made here. As I say, it may be looked upon as a prediction but in inverted commas. It is in fact a comparison. The indications of this comparison are that the abolition of our present system of proportional representation would give a bonus of 30 or more seats to the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>Now it is open to the Minister to argue that this is a good thing, and if he does this, well and good, but I say this&mdash;this is an exercise done not in order to prove a point. This was done by the objective techniques which can be used not merely in regard to elections but are used in many walks of life. The indication is that there will be under the abolition of the present system a bonus of 30 seats to the Fianna Fáil Party. The Minister has said that in fact these predictions are completely unwarranted because the county electoral areas do not correspond to what would be the constituencies. The position is that the notional constituencies used for this prediction were made up from the county electoral areas but did not correspond one for one to them, so the Minister's first objection is an objection to something which, in fact, was not done.</P>
    <P>The Minister's second objection that there are a wider range of candidates in local elections is certainly not a valid objection against the prediction <Col N="1252" /> by me, because in this instance I did not take this wider range of county electoral areas into account. What constitutes the great difference between the operation of the relative majority system as operated in Britain and as it would operate here is the spread of the political allegiances of the people throughout the country. This would mean that whereas in Britain with its built-in majorities and its strongholds for the two major parties a small swing will leave a party seriously diminished but still a substantial Opposition, the application of the same system to this country would indeed leave the Opposition Parties very seriously diminished indeed.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that perhaps this is something that should not be worried about unduly, that if the system does have this effect nevertheless it also has the effect that a relatively small swing will put those Opposition Parties into the same position of overwhelming strength. The suggestion has been made that it may be a temporary disadvantage to the Opposition Parties. I take it that the Minister, who is quite confident that Fianna Fáil will have an overall majority under proportional representation, does not think that the Fianna Fáil Party will get less seats under the new system than under proportional representation, and so I take it that the Minister is confident that if the Fourth Amendment is passed the Fianna Fáil Party will be in a majority at the next election.</P>
    <P>Many people have said that the Opposition should not worry unduly about the effects of this system because it has the great merit that their time will come. I personally doubt this. I personally doubt their time will come. In view of the way in which politics has been operated in this country the job of winkling out a Government Deputy from a single-member constituency is something which it would take a political Hercules to do. I think indeed that the position is that it is unrealistic, unfair, even if it is not dishonest, to say that all the Opposition has to do is to take the bruises of the first election under this system and wait for their time to come. An <Col N="1253" /> Opposition in Dáil Éireann reduced to 40 living in the hope that some day they will be 80 or 100&mdash;is this what we want from an electoral system?</P>
    <P>Do we want this continuous oscillation. Do we want to put in a Government in a position which is not a position of strength and then say &ldquo;When we get tired of them let us bring back 100 Opposition Members into the Dáil and let them form the Government?&rdquo; We will find that less than half of them will have any parliamentary experience. This indeed may be a good thing from the point of view of a Government that is getting out. If the Government are really sincere in their belief that we want to have in this country a parliamentary system in which there is a real alternative then this is not the way to do it. It is unrealistic to think that the Opposition Parties can accept the blows of the first election and come back again.</P>
    <P>This, quite frankly, is one of the reasons why I as a member of one of the Opposition Parties am determinedly opposed to this system, because I do not believe, because of the particular nature of our structure in this country, that the chance will come again.</P>
    <P>There are many other points which could be made. There are many other considerations which should be the subject for debate in this House but I do not wish to go into them now. I feel sure other Members will debate them adequately. The Taoiseach has asked us to look to other countries. He has asked us to look at the United States so that we can follow their system and avoid coalitions. Is there a greater coalition in the world than the Democratic Party of the USA? Is there a coalition government in Europe which has a wider range than the Republican Party in the US? It is unrealistic to say &ldquo;Let us look to the USA and avoid the evils of coalition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The US is founded on two coalitions and so thoroughly are they wedded to the idea of coalition that they have one coalition before the election and another after it. In the US, elections are fought between the coalition known as the Democratic Party and <Col N="1254" /> the coalition known as the Republican Party and when the elections are over, legislation is debated and voted on by a coalition of Southern Democrats and Conservative Republicans on the one hand and the liberals of the Democratic and Republican Parties on the other.</P>
    <P>When the Government asks us to look at what is happening in other countries let them look at it closely themselves. Due to the rigidity of the two-Party system, the US had to adopt these subterfuges in order to get around the rigidity of the system which moulds their legislature. We are told that the emergence of the multiplicity of Parties is a bad thing for the country. The US would perhaps be a better place today if its political system had allowed for the emergence of a third party.</P>
    <P>We see in the US today the protestors taking to the streets and taking to violence because they cannot find expression in the two political Parties into which the US has allowed itself to be moulded. In the United States, which has managed, through this electoral system now recommended to us, to harden its system into a choice between A and B I think the US as a nation has done itself great damage. We have in the US today people who genuinely wish to reform the society of the US through constitutional methods and they are finding themselves without an outlet.</P>
    <P>It is not for us here to comment on the present electoral contest in the US but I think we can say that when next November comes, many citizens of the US will find themselves in utter frustration because they cannot exercise the choice they want to exercise in the election for the President of the United States. The system prevents them from making the decision they want to make. All they can do is make a choice between A and B as proposed to them. There will be some of them, of course, in the happy position of being able to vote for Governor Wallace but I should hesitate to put forward the existence of the Dixiecrat movement as an argument for the multi-party system.</P>
    <P>We have been told that PR is a <Col N="1255" /> divisory force. I say this country is less divided than Britain, is less divided than France, is less divided today than the USA. PR has not been a divisory force in this country. If we look to the countries that the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Government ask us to look at we find they are countries in which divisory forces have been at work.</P>
    <P>I do not want to do what the Government are doing and say that the divisions in the US, Britain or France are all due to their electoral systems. It makes me hesitate, however, when I am asked to look there for a healthy political system. When I look I see something I do not like and which I do not want in this country. We are told that PR leads to instability, and the Taoiseach asks us to look at Canada and to look at how they fare under the relative majority system. The present Government in Canada has got an absolute majority. Is this an indication that Canada has been stable? The recent election in Canada was their fourth in six years. Is this the stability that the relative majority system leads to? I do not think it can be. What do we mean by stability? We can have the stability of Northern Ireland where they did not have a change in Government, or are we to have the relative majority system which gives us strong Government and quick turn-over? This is not stability either. This continual oscillation from one Government to another is not stability. True stability is a gradual shifting of emphasis from one point of view to another.</P>
    <P>The other question to be considered on this measure is the question as to the degree of freedom of choice which our people want in their electons. Here I should like to quote with approval something which the Minister said in Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P>The fundamental concept of democracy is that the views of the majority are those which should prevail.</P>
    <P>The views of the majority, not of the largest minority, but the Government are proposing to us here that the views of the largest minority should prevail. <Col N="1256" /> This is not indeed what we want. The Minister has said that in other countries those that top the poll usually have an overall majority so that we have the situation that it is the will of the majority that is prevailing.</P>
    <P>This is only true if we have these concentrations of strength which I spoke of before. Only then do you get the position that those who top the poll in the relative majority system will, in nearly all cases, have an overall majority. Our system of PR gives a freedom of choice between Parties, gives a freedom of choice within Parties, and allows our voters to vote across Parties, something which PR systems of the Continent of Europe do not do. Our people have used it well here.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which may be part of this debate is the question of the Members of Parliament. This is one of the objectives of an electoral system, not only to elect government but to elect a Parliament, This is a matter which we must consider. I have talked sufficiently on this matter. I do not wish to weary the House any more. I am sure that other Members will bring up this point. In this regard I should like to say that the argument has been used by the Government that certain disadvantages in regard to internal matters in constituencies would be overcome if we had single-Member constituencies. In particular it has been argued that trouble arises in constituencies between Deputies from the same Party and because we have difficulties between Deputies of the same Party we should change our electoral system.</P>
    <P>I say here what was said in the report of the Constitutional Committee &mdash;in the report, not by the committee&mdash; on behalf of one side: &ldquo;While it may be inconvenient to have more than one Deputy representing a particular Party in a constituency this is not a sufficient reason for altering the Constitution.&rdquo; We could carry these things too far. We had the Minister in his opening statement arguing on this matter and the arguments he put forward were quotations from political correspondents. Here we had the Minister quoting the political scriptures of the political correspondents to suit his own <Col N="1257" /> purposes, to prove his own case. I indicated that our approach in the Seanad to this question is to try to get agreement on what we are trying to do when we elect a Government and a Parliament. Having done that, we should be able to compare these two systems. We must recognise that what we are concerned with here is a means to an end, not a dogma or an ideology. We should realise that in regard to these matters there has been no demand for a change and, therefore, the onus is not on us who object to a change but on those who seek a change.</P>
    <P>In my opinion there is not sufficient need for a change. There is no demand for a change and in my opinion there will be no change. In the Third Amendment the Minister has proposed an in-built tolerance which is to be laid down not by a commission, as recommended unanimously by the Committee on the Constitution but laid down politically, and this in-built tolerance is one that will grow over the 12-year period until the initial distortion has approached something like three times its size. The change is not one on which the Government have proved their point. The system which has served us well is to be thrown out the window. In regard to the Fourth Amendment as well as in regard to the Third Amendment I see no reason for a change and I have heard no case for a change and I am confident that when the people vote in a referendum there will be no change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I really marvel at the Minister coming here to the Seanad <Col N="1258" /> last evening with a straight face&mdash;if I may say it without hurt to his feelings with a typical Fianna Fáil face&mdash;and imagining that what he was saying was believed by him, or asking us to accept that what he was saying in his speech was believed by himself. I give more credit to the intelligence of the Minister than to accept that situation.</P>
      <P>We in the Seanad are for the second time in my experience debating the abolition of PR and substituting for PR the British voting system. Even though we debate it, the decision will have to be taken by the people. Unlike the previous speaker, I am very confident that if the people are sufficiently alert in defence of their rights they will overwhelmingly reject the proposals to amend the Constitution. I am tempted to say that there is not much point in trying to answer the Minister's vapourings or much point in going over the arguments which were debated in 1959 on the same issue.</P>
      <P>I am tempted to say that we are wasting out time and that the quicker this goes to the people for a decision the better, because parliamentary time for nearly six months has been wasted. I think it was referred to in the Dáil yesterday as a filibuster on the part of the Government to avoid dealing with legislation that should be dealt with and that it has occupied the time of the Dáil and is now occupying the time of the Seanad on something which many supporters of Fianna Fáil do not believe themselves.</P>
      <P>In our motion, Sir, we refer to the second attempt to abolish PR and substitute the British system as being dictatorial and undemocratic. Some people have said to me that, after all, that is rather strong language. What is dictatorial and undemocratic in promoting legislation or amending the Constitution and then having the people vote and decide the issue? We are basing our charge on dictatorship and undemocratic behaviour because this issue was decided already. There was a clear-cut decision by the electorate. They decided that, first of all, when they adopted the original Constitution and they decided it, secondly, as a separate issue in 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no call or demand for a second decision or a second bite <Col N="1259" /> of the cherry on this issue. There may be demands in Fianna Fáil by power-hungry people who see the prospect of power slipping from their grasp to change the rules before they lose that power. This is an indication of a dictatorial attitude and an undemocratic approach to the problem. The second reason I say this is undemocratic is the very obvious one, that if by any chance in a low poll this amendment to the Constitution slips through, the electorate of the country would never get another chance to change its mind, to rectify the position. It is inconceivable that any government elected on the British vote system with the weighing that system gives in favour of the majority Party would again promote legislation and ask the electorate to think again on the problem of changing the system of election to Dáil Éireann. We can all accept and agree that that is the situation.</P>
    <P>This is a plot by a Government who see looming before them the prospect of losing power and it is a plot promoted at this time in order to annihilate the Labour Party at a particular time in the growth of the Labour Party. I think Fine Gael are to be complimented on resisting the temptation to enter into this plot to abolish the Labour Party, which might possibly be to the benefit of Fine Gael. They have resisted the blandishments of the Minister to change the system of election so as to eliminate the Labour Party and so to put Fine Gael in the position of being represented on the Constituency Council, if that is the appropriate term, to draw the lines of the constituencies from there on. We all know that in such a situation there is no prospect or very little prospect of a third Party emerging or eventually gaining power.</P>
    <P>We are told about the stability which is produced by the British system of election to Parliament and perhaps it would not be amiss if we recalled a little history. Even though in more recent times the British system has resulted in either a Labour Government with an overall majority or a Conservative Government with an overall majority, that has not always <Col N="1260" /> been the case and there is no guarantee that it will always produce that result, even if anybody supposed that that was necessarily a good result. In general elections in Britain under the system we have been asked to adopt in this country, there have been four minority Governments and three Coalition Governments since 1910.</P>
    <P>The 1910 general election in Britain resulted in a Liberal Government, with a minority of seats in the House of Commons, 275 seats as against 395 seats for all the other Parties. That was the general election held in January, 1910. There was another general election in December of the same year which also resulted in the election of a minority Government, a Liberal Government, with 270 seats as against 400 for all other Parties. In 1918, there was a Coalition Government; in 1922 there was a Conservative majority Government; and in the following year there was a minority Labour Government with 191 seats as against 424 for all other Parties. In 1924&mdash;these are a succession of general elections one year after the other&mdash; there was a majority Conservative Government. In 1929 there was a minority Labour Government with 288 seats as against 327 for all other Parties. In 1931, there was a Coalition Government; in 1935, a Coalition Government; and in 1945, there was a Labour majority Government, and again in 1950. Since then we have had the swing in majority Governments, either Labour or Conservative, and the Liberals have virtually disappeared off the map.</P>
    <P>We know as a matter of history that in the early part of this century, under the British system which we are now being asked to adopt, there was in Britain in many instances a plot against the electorate. The Liberal and Conservative Parties entered into bargains behind the backs of the electorate not to contest seats in marginal constituencies. That is one of the defects of this system of election.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the fact that a decision was taken by the electorate on the clear-cut, definite issue of the abolition or otherwise of PR in 1959. It might be no harm to remind ourselves of the situation which then obtained. <Col N="1261" /> At that time the President was leaving active politics; he was retiring as Taoiseach and was going forward for election as President. There was at least some doubt in the minds of many people that with the passing of personalities who were strongly associated with the Civil War and other issues referred to in the Minister's speech, the Economic War and the Second World War, PR would be unlikely to work effectively in this country, that it would lead to instability, that it would lead to indecisive general elections, that it would lead to the growth of small Parties.</P>
    <P>I give credit to some people in Fianna Fáil that that was a generally held opinion at that time&mdash;that they were convinced that it was in the national interest, that they were fearful of grave results from the circumstances that would develop after the retirement from active politics of Mr. de Valera who was going forward for the Presidency. However, if there were people with these genuine views at that time, it is fair to ask them now to look at what has happened since. Have there been indecisive general elections? Have we had instability of government? Has there been a growth in the number of small Parties? Have there been set up small Parties securing some representation in Dáil Éireann?</P>
    <P>In fact the opposite has been the case. There are now fewer Parties represented in Dáil Éireann than I think there have been in the history of the State: there are Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, and there is one representative of Clann na Poblachta. Has there been an increase in the number of Independents? The last general election resulted in the election of two Independent Deputies and looking back over the history of general elections since 1923, I find that this is the lowest number ever. Before the last general election, there was never a Dáil with fewer Independents. Therefore, we can say that the passing of personalities strongly identified with stirring times, for want of a better word, has not meant that there has been an ineffective or a bad method of electing representatives to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I have questioned why we are asked <Col N="1262" /> to waste so much parliamentary time, at such expense eventually to the country, to hold another referendum on this subject, and nothing I have heard has given me any evidence that the reason is other than simply a burst by the Fianna Fáil Party to change the rules before power slips from their hands. Quite frankly, I am doubtful whether the majority of the people in Fianna Fáil are convinced of the rightness or justice of this attempt. I think it has been pushed through by a certain clique in Fianna Fáil and that other people simply have to row along. We know that Fianna Fáil have largely fallen into the hands of the Taca people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>And I know, too, that the ordinary supporters of Fianna Fáil throughout the country&mdash;I know many of them&mdash;decent people, honest people, are quite frankly puzzled as to what all this is about. They see that their Party have been successful under the present system of election and they wonder why they should be asked to support a change in the rules, a change to the British system, in order to make sure that the new generation of Fianna Fáil will have it easy and will, by that change in the rules, be able to have a comfortable 90 to 100 seats.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that if the rules are changed, they will have those comfortable 90 to 100 seats for the lifetime of most of us in this House. I have said that this is a plot against the Labour Party which will virtually wipe out the Labour Party at a time when they are growing. Naturally and understandably I am biased in my view on this matter&mdash;I cannot pretend to be otherwise. I think it would be a disaster if the Labour Party were wiped out but I find that many people who are not supporters of or sympathisers with the Labour Party, are equally of that view. They consider it would be a very bad thing for democracy in this country if the Labour Party were wiped out by changing the system of election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to my principal point&mdash;that this is an attempt to take from us our democratic rights. It is all <Col N="1263" /> right to say that the system operates in Britain, in the US and in Canada. I am not concerned with that. I am concerned with the fact that we, by some miracle, having achieved the freedom we have for this part of the country, were successful in establishing a parliamentary democracy here. When one looks at what has happened in other countries in more recent and perhaps more educated times when they get freedom, one begins to appreciate our good luck in being able to establish and maintain up to now parliamentary democracy. Our democracy, to my mind, is a rather delicate flower. We have our own type of parliamentary democracy which I think is better than the British system. I have not been to the other countries mentioned but from what I have read, I prefer our system of democracy which has served us effectively up to now as a system of election to Parliament.</P>
    <P>I am not a PR crank; I am not one of those people who enjoy doing large sums and falling in love with the results. The point I am making is that PR, that system of election to Parliament, is an intrinsic part of the democracy we have built up in this country. It is something that was written into the 1936 Constitution and it is something on which the electorate decided again in 1959. I feel the PR system of election to Dáil Éireann is the most democratic method of election as long as it works.</P>
    <P>The whole point is that it has worked in this country. It has given us reasonable stability. It has given the opportunity for minority groups to seek and secure representation in Dáil Éireann and to grow, as they have, with the support of sufficient numbers. The Minister, again in his speech, is casting doubts, the same sort of doubts as were produced in 1959, that PR might not operate successfully in the future. That is a supposition. Whatever reasonable doubts there might have been in 1959 in the then circumstances, I do not think there can be any now. I have shown, in spite of the disappearance or withdrawal from active politics of certain strong personalities, this has not led to instability, has not <Col N="1264" /> led to inconclusive elections, and has not led to growth in the number of small Parties.</P>
    <P>There is no real evidence that PR cannot continue to work effectively in this country, as we know it, and with the people as they are. The Government again, as in 1959, are putting forward this proposal on a supposition, a supposition that PR might not work effectively in the future. From one supposition they want us to go on to a second, that the British system of electing one representative in a constituency without necessarily securing a majority of the votes cast will not damage the democratic fabric of our Parliament.</P>
    <P>Democracy is too precious, I hope, to all of us that we should be asked to take chances like this&mdash;chances, as I say, in the interests of power-hungry people. As I said, the attitude of the Labour Party is that we are vehemently opposed to this attack on democracy by Fianna Fáil. We know that the Minister has enough support in both Houses of the Oireachtas to put through this measure and that the final issue must rest with the people. What worries me about this is that so many words have been spoken about PR and about this referendum that the ordinary people are becoming fed up with the whole issue. There is a reaction among people, when you mention this: &ldquo;Has this not been decided? Was this not decided some years ago? What is this about now?&rdquo; There is a feeling among the people that this is no real issue. It is on that that the Minister and his Party are gambling. They are hoping that the people will be so fed up with this issue and this talk about it that when finally the day dawns, many of them will not bother to vote. This, to me, is a real danger.</P>
    <P>We feel there is not much point in discussing this at length in the Seanad because the result of the Seanad debate is a foregone conclusion. What is important is that this matter should be got to the people as quickly as possible and that they should decide the issue. We know that now again another pause will occur, that the referendum will not be held until October&mdash;again, I suppose, in the hope that the people will be lulled into not bothering to cast their votes on this <Col N="1265" /> issue and that as a result Fianna Fáil might slip through this change in the Constitution, which would be a tragedy for this nation.</P>
    <P>I believe we all interpret the turmoil which has occurred in many Western democracies in recent years as an indication that the ordinary people want to be more involved. They want to participate more in decision making. The young, as always, are impatient. Perhaps they are a bit more impatient in this generation than in previous generations. I do not know, but I think it is draft in that situation that we should alter our system of elections so that in effect the ordinary people would have less involvement in the election and in the life of Parliament.</P>
    <P>That will undoubtedly be one of the results of the abolition of PR, if that tragedy occurs. What worries me is not simply that you are changing the rules but that by changing them, you not alone diminish or reduce the extent of the democracy we have here but could destroy it completely. The approach of the people who are doing this for selfish party interest is quite unpatriotic. I suppose it is quite understandable that they would do this for selfish party interests and we might have a sneaking sympathy with them, but they are doing it in a way which may eventually destroy democracy in this country. That is why particularly the trade union movement is concerned with this. The trade union movement intervened in the issue in 1959, the issue of defending democracy and, again, on this occasion the trade union movement will be forthright in defending the issue of PR, in asking the electorate to maintain the PR system of election to Dáil Éireann, because we feel that the abolition of PR would be one step back from democracy and if we once start on that slippery slope goodness knows where we will end.</P>
    <P>We will be asking not alone for the support of Labour people in this referendum, not alone for the support of trade unionists, but for the support of all people in this country who believe in the maintenance of our democratic institutions. This is fundamentally an attack on democracy in <Col N="1266" /> this country. We hope that the result of the referendum will be decisive, that the electorate will again reject the blandishments of Fianna Fáil, and I hope that those voting against the proposal will include&mdash;and I say this sincerely&mdash;a large measure, many decent Fianna Fáil supporters around the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing which I should like to say to Senator Murphy before I start discussing these two Bills, and that is to quote for him, in reference to his remarks that this is a plot to destroy the Labour Party, a statement made once by Mr. Herbert Morrisson. Herbert Morrisson, as we know, was no friend of Ireland. We had no particular reason here to like him, but he was one of the great architects of the British Labour Party; he was a most distinguished member of that Party, and there is no doubt that that same Party owes an enormous amount to the work he did throughout his life for it. He spoke in the House of Commons on this subject of proportional representation in 1924 when there was a Private Members' Bill to introduce proportional representation to Britain, and I am quoting from volume 172 of Hansard at page 202. This is what he said:</P>
      <P>Proportional representation is a philosophy which is not unnatural to small new Parties struggling to get a footing in the electoral field and not having much staying power or pluck to fight. It is also perfectly natural to decaying political Parties who are doomed to extinction in the course of time and can only retain their position by elevating the power of the minority and subjecting the power of the majority. It is perfectly natural to them, but it is not natural to strong men and women who want their country to be governed wisely and firmly, and I hope therefore that the House will not accept that type of government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the quotation says that proportional representation is not natural to strong men and women who want their country to be governed wisely and firmly, by which he was referring to the British Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party in England, as, I am sure, Senator Murphy knows very well, at the beginning of this century were considerably weaker relatively than the present Labour Party in Ireland are now, yet they gained power ultimately under the straight vote. I think that that quotation from Herbert Morrisson is a very instructive one, and it is of interest not merely to the Irish Labour Party who apparently have not got what he described as much staying power or pluck to fight. If they had they would realise that their chance of gaining office as a sole majority Party under the straight vote is obviously greater than their chance of gaining any sort of power under the present system of proportional representation. That quotation is also of interest, I think, to the Fine Gael Party, who at least in their own minds appear to be what Herbert Morrisson described as a decaying Party doomed to extinction. PR has appealed always to minorities, whereas the straight vote appeals to people who hope to gain a majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other thing I wish to say to Senator Murphy before I begin on these Amendments is to refer&mdash;and I have no doubt that other people will refer during the course of the Debate&mdash; to a matter which I think I should mention. He says that he doubts if a majority of the Fianna Fáil Party supports these Amendments. I am an ordinary member of the Fianna Fáil Party, and I have been listening to discussions that have taken place on this topic of the straight vote in the Fianna Fáil Party, and I hope that Senator Murphy will take my word for it that I am perfectly sincere in this, that I do not know of one single member of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party who does not believe that the straight vote <Col N="1268" /> is the correct type of vote for this country. It may seem strange to Senator Murphy that the Fianna Fáil Party should have this unanimous view, but to my knowledge that is the position. I know of no member of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party who does not believe completely that the straight vote is the best type of vote for this country. I have no doubt whatever about that. He should be in no doubt about it either, otherwise he may run into difficulties if he thinks that anyone feels differently on it.</P>
    <P>What are we doing in discussing these two Amending Bills here in the Seanad? I think that the point we should stress is that we are not legislating in the normal sense of the word. Only the people can decide this issue. There has been an enormous amount of talk for months past while this has been going through the Dáil, and that also took place in 1959. There has been some of the most violent opposition from Opposition Parties to the passage of these Bills. Why should this be? I should have thought that on Amending Bills of this kind, Bills to amend the Constitution, the normal sensible practice would have been for them to be passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas with a relatively small amount of debate in order that all concerned could then go down to the country and talk to the people direct, because we cannot in this House&mdash;and it was deliberately arranged to be thus by Fianna Fáil when they were framing the Constitution&mdash;we cannot in this House, nor can Deputies in the Dáil, change the Constitution one iota, by one single comma, by means of ordinary legislation. Only the people can deal with this matter. That was deliberately laid down by Fianna Fáil in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge referred to the defeat of the similar Bill that came before this House in 1959. I was not, nor were you, Sir, a Member of this House at the time, but it has always seemed to me that that was essentially an undemocratic step for the Members of the then Seanad to have taken, because all they were trying to do was prevent the people of Ireland from exercising their democratic rights under the Constitution <Col N="1269" /> to decide the question of the electoral system they wanted. The people who brought about the defeat of that Bill in this House were saying in effect &ldquo;We do not want to allow the people to decide this matter.&rdquo; That seems to me to be utterly undemocratic.</P>

      <P>I think that was an undemocratic approach. There is no doubt about it, if it had been possible to defeat it in the Dáil, the Opposition at the time would have done it. The whole aim and purpose was to try to prevent the people from considering and deciding on this matter as they are perfectly entitled to do and they did by a very small margin of 16 votes to 15.</P>
      <P>I am sure we shall hear a considerable amount from Senator Sheehy Skeffington in the course of this debate so I hope that perhaps he will try to listen to me. Any other legislation, as I have said, could be enacted by this House but we cannot do anything to change the Constitution. This creates the puzzle as to what is the meaning of the Fine Gael amendment that has been moved here today. This amendment, to refuse a Second Reading, calls upon us to do so on two main grounds: first, that there is no public demand for the proposals contained in the Bill, and, secondly, that the Bill contains no machinery to decide impartially the limitations of constituencies.</P>

    <P>I cannot understand this reference to there being no public demand. I should have thought that the whole purpose of an amendment to the Constitution&mdash;a referendum for that purpose&mdash;was to decide whether there is a public demand. We are merely enacting legislation here to provide the machinery in order to find out whether there is a public demand. I cannot understand the point of a motion which says that we should not do this because there is no public demand. How do <Col N="1270" /> they know there is no public demand? That is a matter which we are seeking to find out.</P>
    <P>This part of the amendment seems to me to be a contradiction in terms. It is simply meaningless, but in fact there has already been a considerable and very strong public demand for the tolerance provision contained in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill. As a result of the decision of the High Court in 1961, at the last reapportionment of constituencies that took place, there were a considerable number of breaches made in what have come to be regarded as traditional county boundaries to constituencies. For example, 4,652 electors from County Wexford were attached to Counties Carlow and Kilkenny; 6,545 electors from County Meath were attached to County Kildare; 7,106 electors from County Westmeath were attached to County Kildare; 2,931 electors from County Roscommon were attached to part of County Mayo; 7,751 electors from County Louth were put into County Monaghan; 16,600 electors from County Leitrim were attached to County Roscommon for electoral purposes and the remainder of County Leitrim, 20,456, were attached to County Sligo; 2,901 from South Riding of County Tipperary were attached to Tipperary North Riding, which is of course the only county divided into two sections for local government purposes; 11,878 electors from County Waterford were put into Tipperary, South Riding.</P>
    <P>All these cases led to the greatest public unrest. Anyone who knows these areas will accept that these changes in traditional boundaries were very much resented by the electorate and in some cases people refused to vote on the grounds that tradition had been broken, and that the people they had been used to voting for were now in a different constituency. It caused a great deal of ill-feeling and this was reflected in the debate which took place in the Dáil at that time. A number of Deputies of different Parties objected strongly to the way in which this apportionment had been carried out and called on the Government to amend the Constitution to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1271" /> Deputy Corish complained about the situation in County Kildare and the late Deputy Donnellan was very strong on this whole question. He is quoted, at column 215 of volume 188, as saying:</P>
    <P>Of course, with Fianna Fáil the Constitution is almighty. According to them it is the gospel. They have an opportunity now of seeing what their Constitution is costing the people of rural Ireland. The Taoiseach was not man enough to submit the matter to a referendum so that the people might be given an opportunity of changing the relative article in the Constitution....</P>
    <P>The late Deputy Norton also has a great deal to say on this and he said as quoted in column 231 of volume 188:</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Government for introducing a Bill to deal with this situation. A Bill had to be introduced. That was inevitable after the decision of the High Court, but it is quite clear that the Constitution which imposes upon us the responsibilities now clearly defined by the Court, is a Constitution which should be amended....</P>
    <P>The late Deputy Desmond also called for an amendment to the Constitution. The late Deputy T. Lynch of Waterford, which of course was badly affected by this, said that the Government should have amended the Constitution. Deputy Coburn, of Louth, also complained about this.</P>
    <P>These complaints in the Dáil were merely a reflection of public opinion, of the resentment of this apportionment which was made necessary by the High Court decision. It is quite clear that the resentment of the public and the demand for a change which arose in 1961 is as nothing compared with the resentment which will be caused if an apportionment has to be carried out now under present circumstances in the absence of an amendment such as is proposed in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.</P>
    <P>This new apportionment inevitably <Col N="1272" /> will help to break up county boundaries from Donegal to West Cork in the West and from Monaghan to Wexford in the East. There is no doubt about it that there would be tremendous public resentment at this. Therefore, while the Fine Gael amendment in its reference to public demand is meaningless there is in fact in this instance very strong evidence of a public demand for some change which will no longer make necessary these kinds of breach in the county boundaries.</P>
    <P>You, Sir, referred&mdash;I think a little facetiously&mdash;to county boundaries as being an invention of King John and mentioned that there is a tendency nowadays in hospital services to go beyond county boundaries and to deal with things over larger areas. That is perfectly correct. However, we have to take things as we find them and there is no doubt about it that the public at large feel strongly about this. They resent very much having to vote in another county for people from another county and it even seems that where two counties are joined together there is also likely to be this resentment and there is a tendency not to worry about people in the other part of the constituency. I think we should regard this seriously even if it was King John who allegedly set up the boundaries&mdash;it is quite impossible to deal with the constituencies on a purely mathematical basis as was called for in effect by the High Court judge. The one-sixth tolerance which is suggested in this Third Amendment is far less than exists in Britain and most other countries and is really an absolute minimum which will be required to ensure that in most cases the traditional county boundaries will not be breached.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge said that all the High Court decision did was to say that a 5 per cent variation would be allowed whereas an 18 per cent variation would not be allowed but he went on to say there was a wide field between 5 and 18 per cent and no one could say where a boundary would be put in any future High Court action. He may be correct in that. I am not entirely satisfied that the High Court did not say <Col N="1273" /> that no more than 5 per cent would be allowed but at any rate there is no need to argue the point. I think basically this is a correct estimate of the court decision but can we leave it like that? Can we leave ourselves in a position that in any future apportionment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we will leave ourselves open to doubt? It is only common sense to put into the Constitution a provision which will lay down quite clearly what the tolerance allowed will be. This tolerance laid down in the Third Amendment Bill can only be exercised in certain ways defined in the Bill. It is not a matter left to the mere whim of the Minister in question. It is laid down in the Bill that in working out this tolerance, regard should be had to the extent and accessibility of constituencies and to the need for securing convenient areas of representation and subject to these considerations to the desirability of avoiding an overlapping of the boundaries of counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be clear: it is not left to the Minister to decide that he will prefer one county as against another. The manner in which this is to be exercised is not clearly laid down and no Minister can go beyond what is set out without having an action taken in the High Court or the Supreme Court. It is fair to say there obviously will be sentimental considerations and that the ordinary voter likes to vote in his own county. There are strong practical reasons also, though, why a constituency should coincide with the county boundaries. Clearly many activities of the State and local authorities overlap and it is highly desirable that the area over which the county council operates should be, as far as possible, the same as the constituency area. There is the relatively minor considerations also that the local authorities run Dáil elections and it is undesirable that an election in one county should be under the aegis of a local authority in a different county. It is desirable to have <Col N="1274" /> the Dáil constituencies and the county council areas coinciding as far as possible.</P>
    <P>In this Third Amendment Bill essentially we are only trying to determine what all Parties thought was the position until 1961. The constituency revision action of 1961 which was rejected by the High Court was agreed to unanimously by all Parties. It was thought that this was in accordance with the terms of the Constitution and we are in this Third Amendment Bill only returning to what the people had up to 1961 thought was the position.</P>
    <P>One wonders, in fact, what possible objection there can be to this Third Amendment Bill except perhaps the obvious one that Fianna Fáil are proposing it and that the members of the Opposition think they should oppose it. There is a general view that this is an amendment which is obviously needed and I do not think that members of the public will be under any illusion about this. It is so obvious that there should be little opposition to it once this Bill leaves this House.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion also complained that there is no provision for a Constituency Commission in the Third Amendment Bill and I find myself unable to understand this section of the motion at all. Since the Commission had to be put into one Bill or the other, surely it is commonsense to put it into the Bill which makes the more radical changes in constituency boundaries. Senator Dooge said rather to my surprise that it would be possible and only needs a bit of legal investigation to put the Commission into both Bills. I am surprised that Senator Dooge should have made that suggestion. I would have thought that he would have appreciated how utterly impossible it was.</P>
    <P>Let us consider what the result would be. If, for example, the Third Amendment were rejected, which contains the provision for the constitution of the Commission and the Fourth Amendment were accepted, what is the position? On the same day people have accepted what is in one Bill and rejected what is in the other. I certainly would not like to be in the Supreme Court explaining to the court why the <Col N="1275" /> Commission should be inserted in the Constitution, even though the people rejected it in a referendum. I think if Senator Dooge thought again about this, he would find it utterly impossible to have this in both Bills. There is a far greater need in the Fourth Amendment Bill because there you will have a situation where 144 new single-seat constituencies have to be brought in. Clearly there is a case where a Commission is highly desirable, an independent Commission as laid down in this Bill.</P>
    <P>As regards the Fourth Amendment Bill, this makes two distinct changes. In the first place, it provides for single-seat constituencies and in the second, it replaces the present system of PR with the straight vote. There will be, I imagine, unanimous support for the first change set out, the single-seat constituency. These have a number of very obvious advantages. In the first place, Deputies will be in very much closer contact with the voter and the ordinary man in the street. It is impossible to exaggerate the importance and the desirability of having as close contact as possible between a Deputy and his electorate. The more a Deputy or a Member of Parliament in any democratic country is able to get around among his people, talk to them and hear about their problems and their aspirations, the more he will be useful as a public representative. There is a danger in larger counties where there are very large numbers of voters per representative that he may be cut off from his electorate. There is a danger that the voter may feel that Parliament is a dim, far-off body operating in a vacuum, operating without regard to the electors and the man in the street. Where this happens any democratic system tends to fall into disrepute in the eyes of ordinary people. This is one of the real problems in a democratic society. People should feel that they have a close relationship with their public representatives and with Parliament.</P>
    <P>In other countries with huge populations, such as in Britain, this is a difficulty to which there is no answer. The ordinary British Member of Parliament <Col N="1276" /> has an average of about 80,000 people in his constituency. This is far too big and the ordinary British MP does not know the vast majority of his constituents and he is not known to them. We are only 3,000,000 people in this country as against 50,000,000 in Britain and we have the power to avoid this situation but because of the multi-seat constituencies we find our position is much the same as that in Britain. The average Dáil Deputy has also about 80,000 people in his constituency to deal with, the number varies between 60,000 and 100,000 and the average is 80,000. If we bring in the small single-seat constituency we will have the advantage of small populations, the average number will be down to about 20,000 with, perhaps, 12,000 adult voters.</P>
    <P>In these small constituencies, voters in the main will vote only for those whom they know. At present it is fair to say that in many cases in the rural areas and certainly in the cities a majority of the voters find names on the ballot papers which they do not recognise. This may not be such a problem in the rural areas but even there, there are cases where a voter comes to a polling booth and finds on his ballot paper the names of people whom he does not know and who live 60 miles away from him. In the city the situation is much worse and I would say that if you went out on the street and asked the first 100 people you meet to name their Deputies, very few of them would be able to name aright the people who represent them. When it comes to election times, along with the names of the sitting Deputies, there are also the names of other aspirants in the ballot paper and a majority of Dublin voters know nothing about them.</P>
    <P>The advantage of the single-seat constituency is that you have a small compact area and the majority of the candidates would be known to all the electorate. An obvious point which arises, I am not suggesting it is a major point, is the question of the unnecessary duplication and rivalries and manoeuvring that takes place in the large constituencies between Deputies of different Parties, and, indeed, be-</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> The other change in the Fourth tween Deputies of the same Party. This leads to many somewhat unedifying displays of public disunity and squabbling. Another minor matter is that of by-elections which are both wasteful in money and time. In the past 25 years there have been no less than 50 by-elections in this country. These have led to a lot of unnecessary expense.</P>
    <P>No one has attempted to defend the multi-seat constituencies as against the single-seat constituencies and on the question of the size of the constituencies there seems to have been a general acceptance that small, compact single-seat constituencies are more desirable than the large multi-seat constituencies under PR.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that the ordinary man in the street would vastly prefer the simplicity and commonsense of the small constituencies where he would know the people for whom he was voting as against the vast cumbrous multi-seat constituencies. The only serious objection that might have been taken to the proposed establishment of the single-seat constituencies would be the possibility of gerrymandering. This has been ended with the provision in the Fourth Amendment Bill for an independent commission to design the constituencies.</P>

      <P>I am talking about single-seat constituencies. The only objection that might be made to single-seat constituencies would be if there had not been this provision. The Fine Gael amendment suggests that this provision for the commission should be put into the Third Amendment Bill but that would have meant it being taken out of the Fourth Amendment Bill and if that was done I could see very strong and valid arguments being put up as to why it was not in the Fourth Amendment Bill. Here you would have a situation where 144 single-seat constituencies were being set up without any provision being <Col N="1278" /> made for a constituency commission. There would be very serious objections to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course we could have a Fifth Amendment Bill. Originally all this would have been in one Bill and, in theory, there would have been no problem about the Commission but, at the reasonable request of the Opposition, this was split up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be perfectly possible theoretically, it would be possible to have three ballot papers, red, pink and blue or whatever other colours you like and it would be possible to ask the voters to vote on three separate ballot papers. However, from the practical point of view if we were trying to get an intelligent approach by the electorate and a satisfactory result it would be lunacy to do the thing on three ballot papers. You might find that the electorate would knock out the Commission and put in the other two amendments and then the Opposition would have a serious complaint.</P>
      <P>The need to provide for the Commission in the Third Amendment Bill does not arise. Assuming that the Third Amendment Bill is passed and not the Fourth the situation would be that the Minister would have very little discretion but to alter the constituency boundaries in rural Ireland from the present situation in order to make them follow as far as possible the county boundaries. There would be very few cases where the new tolerance would not allow the existing county boundaries to be maintained. That is why it is a very sensible approach to the problem to provide for the Commission in the Fourth Amendment Bill. If it was not put in to the Fourth Amendment Bill the Opposition would have a very legitimate and vociferous complaint to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1279" /> Amendment Bill is, of course, the one about which there is most likely to be controversy. Everyone agrees, apparently, except Senator Sheehy Skeffington&mdash;he is the first person to have given us any other view&mdash;that <i>per se</i> the single-seat constituency has many advantages as against the large constituency, as a workable proposition. It is desirable not merely from the point of view of politicians&mdash;I am not worried about ourselves&mdash;but from the view of the ordinary man in the street, the ordinary voter. However, leaving that aside, we get on to the straight vote system. The straight vote system has certain practical advantages which no one can deny. The first point that occurs to one is that it is clearly much simpler for the voter, much easier for him to understand, than the PR system. I often wonder how many voters really understand PR.</P>

      <P>It is extraordinary the number of suggestions we have had from the Opposition about dictatorship and so forth yet they are extremely reluctant to listen to reasoned arguments for this change. Why? Is it just as it was in 1959 when the Opposition endeavoured to prevent the people from voting for it? Is it that they do not want the people to hear reasoned arguments? How many voters understand PR? The argument is often put up that only 1.6 of the total votes are spoiled. I wonder do people realise what makes a valid vote under PR. As long as there is a &ldquo;one&rdquo; somewhere on the ballot paper it is valid but a person may go on to vote alphabetically from top to bottom of the paper and that, too, is valid. One can hardly say that the person who just gives a number one vote and nothing more is making use of PR. Very few people vote down through the whole <Col N="1280" /> paper but many of those who do so do it simply alphabetically. Speaking as someone whose name begins with &ldquo;Y&rdquo;, I may have some feeling on this. It is a well known fact that there is a great advantage, if the candidate's name is on a long paper, to have a name beginning with &ldquo;A&rdquo;, &ldquo;B&rdquo;, or &ldquo;C&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>By his obscure intervention, Senator O'Quigley conveyed that he agrees with me that on a PR paper quite a high proportion of people tend to vote for the higher up names. That <Col N="1281" /> is a complete condemnation of the system and no amount of interruptions from Senators Carton or O'Quigley will obscure the point that the later preferences of a voter are of far less importance to him than his first preference. The ordinary voter votes No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 but when he gets down to the fifth and sixth names he comes to people whom he has never heard of and in whom he has no interest. However, the last seat, especially where the contest is close, is decided on the purely gratuitous No. 10 or No. 11 cast by people who are just jotting down anything, just deciding between two names about neither of which they knew anything. Therefore, the element of chance becomes increasingly great as the amount of interest the voter takes becomes increasingly less as he goes down through the paper. That is not surprising when one considers that on a voting paper with six names there are 720 different ways in which a voter could arrange his choices.</P>

      <P>I believe Senator O'Quigley is entitled to his point of view. I may have an innocent theory about this. I have a sort of a belief that in an election in a political system it is desirable that the ordinary man in the street should understand at least something about the system of election he is carrying out. I may be at fault in this but I have this belief that it is highly desirable that the ordinary man in the street should understand the system of election. I would even go so far as to say that it is essential that the ordinary average intelligent man in the street should be able to understand when he goes into a polling station and votes, just what he is doing.</P>
      <P>It may be that Senator O'Quigley, who is learned in the obscurities of the law, feels that those things are a mystery and the less people know about it the better. It may be his view but it is not mine. It seems to me almost vital that any election system should be simple and easily understood by the ordinary voter. Those are incidentals about the machinery of voting but I think they are of some importance, and I think in general people would tend to agree that the straight vote is simpler than PR. Let us at least not disagree on things which are self-evident.</P>

      <P>Proportional representation is a more complex system of election than the straight vote system. Can we not agree on that? Now we get on to the thing which is more contentious, that is, the effect of the two different types of voting, what they are likely to be. To my mind the greatest advantage of the straight vote is that it tends to lead, although nothing is certain in life, to stronger Government and also to a stronger Opposition. I am not talking about the numbers involved <Col N="1284" /> but about the fact that immediately the straight vote is brought in it establishes an alternative Government. Normally the straight vote would bring a Government with a reasonable majority in a position to carry out its mandate from the people and in a position to carry out the policies for which it has been elected.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooge has brought in his computation, which is based on the results if the last local elections had been fought on the straight vote system and he suggested that Fianna Fáil with just under 40 per cent of the total votes would have got 98 seats as against 46 seats for the Opposition. That seems to me to suggest that there would be a Labour candidate in something like 130 or 140 of the total number of seats, whereas we know under the straight vote, as things stand at the moment, in a large number of cases there would be a straight fight between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. However, the computation is utterly fantastic. It has never happened, to my knowledge, in any country under the straight vote that the Party who got less than 40 per cent of the votes would get two-thirds of the number of seats.</P>

      <P>It has never happened so far as I know that a minority like <Col N="1285" /> this could obtain such a number of seats. If it did happen that Senator Dooge's calculation was correct the point would still be, even in that unlikely eventuality, that the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party, as the case might be, would be established in the public mind as the alternative Government, able to take over as soon as the Government of the day became unpopular. They would then be able to take over from them. It is quite clear, and recent events have shown that it is so, there is no stronger weapon than the straight vote for making it easy to throw out one administration and replace it with another when it becomes unpopular. The quotation which I read to Senator Murphy at the beginning of my speech from Herbert Morrison is a very good one in this respect. The Opposition, and Senator Murphy recently, claimed that the straight vote leads to dictatorship. I do not think there is any reason to answer that again. I am not making comparisons with Britain, Canada, or the United States.</P>

      <P>The suggestion was made by Senator Murphy, and others before that, and I have no doubt it will be made all over again, that the introduction of the straight vote system into this country would lead to dictatorship. We even had people suggesting it would lead to war in the streets and manning the barricades. Can we not consider this in a rational way? There are two systems of election. Proportional representation has certain advantages and the straight vote has certain advantages. To my mind, and to those on our side of the House, the straight <Col N="1286" /> vote has so much more advantage than proportional representation that it ought to be adopted, but let us not fall into the trap of suggesting that one or the other would lead to dictatorship.</P>
      <P>I think Senator Dooge was very reasonable when he made the point that we should try to avoid thinking of proportional representation in terms of a dogma, the notion, in other words, that proportional representation is the only democratic way of running the country. It is ludicrous to suggest that if we bring in the straight vote we will have dictatorship. On the contrary, with proportional representation Fianna Fáil have been in office for 30 of the last 36 years. My own personal opinion is that under proportional representation, if it should continue in the next 30 years, for the vast majority of the time Fianna Fáil will remain in office because there is at present simply no alternative, but if the straight vote is brought in, I would be by no means so certain that we would be able to spend the majority of the next 30 years in power. My own personal view is that it would be easy for Fianna Fáil to stick to proportional representation, in view of the situation we are in at the moment when there is no alternative, which is bad for the country; from the narrow political point of view, it would be better for Fianna Fáil to stick to proportional representation. I am in no doubt about that, and no amount of cynical laughter can alter that fact.</P>

      <P>One of the interesting facets of this whole discussion, particularly in relation to the oft-repeated claim that the straight vote leads to dictatorship, is that on the whole over the past 40 years the most consistent supporters of the straight vote and opponents of proportional representation have been the Fine Gael and earlier the Cumann na nGaedheal Party. I can say that I accept that in this respect we in Fianna Fáil have not been as consistent as have the Fine Gael Party. The opposition to proportional representation from Fine Gael, or Cumann na nGaedheal, began very <Col N="1287" /> soon after the Treaty. Shortly after the first election in 1922 in the Irish Free State, in 1927 there was an election during which there was a good deal of discussion about proportional representation. There was a famous advertisement quoted very often which was published by Cumann na nGaedheal in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 4th of June, 1927 dealing with Coalition Governments. It reads: &ldquo;A Coalition Government means (1) bargaining for place and power between irresponsible minority groups; (2) a weak Government with no stated policy; (3) frequent changes of Government; (4) consequent depression in trade and industry; (5) no progress, but stability, security, and credit in constant danger.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>In that general election there was a good deal of discussion by Cumann na nGaedheal speakers about proportional representation. Ernest Blythe, Minister for Finance and Vice-President of the Executive Council, told an election meeting in Castleblayney &ldquo;Proportional representation tends to bring all kinds of freak candidates into the field.&rdquo; A few days later Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald, Minister for Defence, said at Kilmallock that PR would have to be done away with. On the same day, W.T. Cosgrave said that the election system would have to be changed. However, they did nothing about it.</P>
      <P>In 1930 we had another return to the fray. In a paper called &ldquo;An Réalt&mdash;the Star, a Weekly National Review&rdquo;, the official organ of Cumann na nGaedheal, on 10th May, 1930, an article was published which said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the factors which has delayed normal political development in the Saorstat is our bad electoral system. The particular form of proportional representation which is in force here is perhaps not so bad as that in force in Germany, but that is the best that can be said about it. It has all the ineradicable faults <Col N="1288" /> which attach to the system. It may be added that such faults have manifested themselves in every country in which proportional representation has been tried. Both before the outbreak of the great war and after its close a great many nations enshrined the principle of proportional representation in their electoral codes. For a while theorisers and faddists succeeded in pushing their views in many countries, with the result stated. Proportional representation has proved to be like Prohibition in two respects. Those who have had experience of it and who are prepared to judge it impartially are satisfied that on the whole its results are evil, but vested interests have quickly grown up around it which renders its abolition difficult. In our case proportional representation was thrust upon the country by the British.</P>
    <P>An interesting point there is to notice that nowadays Fine Gael speakers are all of the opinion that proportional representation was not thrust upon us by anybody but was invented by Arthur Griffith for the benefit of the Irish. Back in 1930 they had a more practical view. They said that in our case it was thrust upon the country by the British.</P>
    <P>The article continued:</P>
    <P>Generously subsidised propagandist societies had, for a long time, been at work in the neighbouring country endeavouring to persuade the people there to abandon an electoral system which in its main outline had been in existence since Parliament was first established. When the Home Rule Bill establishing two Parliaments in Ireland was passed, these kind people arranged, on the policy of trying it on the dog, that the new Parliaments should be elected on the principle of proportional representation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always a problem with Fine Gael to know where one policy stops and another starts, but the policy in 1933 was to kill proportional representation. I honestly cannot say how long this point continued to be part of Fine Gael policy, but at any rate in 1935 it was still Fine Gael policy, because in a new Party paper, <i>United Ireland</i> dealing with this matter on 2nd February, 1935, it said:</P>
      <P>This country has a scheme of proportional representation forced on the people by the Proportional Representation Society of England, which succeeded in inducing the British Government, which drafted the Home Rule Act of 1920, to try its nostrum on the dog. It has not yet produced a multi-Party system mainly because of the acute division on the Treaty issue, and which has prevented politics from developing along normal lines, the lines which were beginning to appear, for instance, before Fianna Fáil entered the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We then come to the debates on the Constitution in the Dáil in 1937. The President of the Executive Council, Éamon de Valera, dealt with the question of proportional representation, and he gave general support to it, but he expressed fears, and said that he was worried that it might lead to &ldquo;a group of Parties manoeuvring in Parliament, <Col N="1290" /> which does not make for good government and does not make for real progress&rdquo;. He pointed out&mdash;answering the fears expressed by such Fine Gael Deputies as John Costello, James Dillon and Patrick McGilligan, who had been opposing the installation of proportional representation in the Constitution&mdash;that if the fears expressed by these people proved justified, there was provision for amendment of the Constitution, and it could be amended at any time by the people.</P>
    <P>As an example of the speeches made by Fine Gael Deputies, we had Deputy J.A. Costello speaking during the debates on 1st June, 1937, reported at column 1345, volume 67:</P>
    <P>We always understood that the real defect under any system of proportional representation, and particularly the system of the single transferable vote, was that it led, in circumstances where there are no big economic issues before the country, to a large number of small parties being returned, making for instability in Government. That is inherent in the system of proportional representation and the single transferable vote.</P>
    <P>Proportional representation on paper is a perfect system, but when you come to practice it you run up against all sorts of difficulties, small Parties being returned, making for instability in Government. &ldquo;That is inherent in the system of PR and the single transferable vote.&rdquo; He went on to say that PR on paper was a perfect system but when you came to practice you ran up against all sorts of difficulties.</P>
    <P>Mr. McGilligan said: &ldquo;It was always held that with regard to PR, which this country adopted, we had adopted the worst possible system.&rdquo; I do not know to what extent Fine Gael Party policy continued at this stage to be against PR but there is no doubt that important members of Fine Gael continue to the present day to be opposed to PR. I cannot say what the Party policy was or at what stage they may have dropped Point Seven of the 1933 policy. We had, however, individual members of Fine Gael discussing PR. Deputy Dillon in the Dáil on the 12th November, 1947, said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1291" /> Personally, I think proportional representation is a fraud and a cod, and that it ought to be abolished ...PR is, in fact, as we all know in our hearts, the child of the brain of all the cranks in creation. So far as this country is concerned, it was tried out on the dog. I doubt if any other democratic country in the world has put it into operation in regard to its Parliament ... It was foisted upon us by a collection of half-lunatics who believed that they had something lovely that would work on paper like a jig-saw puzzle...</P>
    <P>As always Mr. Dillon's language is colourful but we can see his point. The Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Cosgrave, brought this up in April, 1965, when he held a conference for press and television reporters after he had been elected Leader of his Party, and he told them that he had made it quite clear on the night before he was elected that he had not changed his views on PR. At this conference he reiterated his belief and that he would do what he could to bring the Fine Gael Party around to his point of view and that he would take advantage of any opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>My purpose in bringing in all these quotations is not to try to pin down Fine Gael to the policies expressed in these. They are perfectly entitled to change their view and entitled to say: &ldquo;That is not the way we feel now.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not that Fine Gael are not entitled to change their view. They are entitled to say: &ldquo;All right. In 1933 and in 1947 our leaders were in favour of the straight vote but now we have changed our minds in spite of what our leaders may have said previously on PR.&rdquo; They are not <Col N="1292" /> entitled in all the circumstances to pretend that no one ever opposed PR until recently, until the Fianna Fáil Government decided to try to amend the Constitution. They are not entitled to say that nobody has ever opposed it before, nor that a change to the straight vote would bring a dictatorship. It is a matter on which there can be two views, and I think we should discuss this rationally.</P>
      <P>If Fine Gael had been concerned about dictatorship they could have come down on either side but to suggest that their policy which they followed for many years is one which will bring about a Fianna Fáil dictatorship is ludicrous. Deputy Cosgrave wished to see the system of the straight vote brought in. He would like some day to be Taoiseach. What Mr. Morrison referred to as the &ldquo;decaying political party&rdquo; attitude is now reflected in Fine Gael, while the strong men who believe they will come to office as a united Fine Gael Government feel the other way. To talk about dictatorship is just nonsense.</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious that under present conditions in this country&mdash;there is no use talking about Governor Wallace in the US or about previous elections in Britain, as Senator Dooge has done&mdash; there is no alternative to the present Government. Even members of the Fine Gael Party would concede that, except where a minority Fine Gael Government or a Fine Gael-Labour Coalition existed.</P>
      <P>It is a completely undemocratic concept that the people should be faced with the situation where there was no alternative but either to vote for continuance of Fianna Fáil or else to vote for a coalition or minority government which could not carry out the policies which have been placed before the people at the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to produce a couple of last quotations which are entirely relevant to the discussion. They come from Senator Garret FitzGerald&mdash;he was not a Senator at the time&mdash;but I think they are of interest as coming from a person who, whatever his political status may have been at that time, was not committed to the Fianna Fáil <Col N="1293" /> point of view. It was an article in the <i>Irish Times,</i> 26th February, 1964. He had this to say shortly after the famous Cork city and Kildare by-elections:</P>
    <P>Others again may see as the most crucial feature of these results, not the 6-7 per cent swing towards Fianna Fáil, but the 9-10 per cent swing away from Fine Gael. To those who take this view, the results may appear as a vote of no confidence in the principal Opposition Party, either because of a feeling that it did not offer a clear-cut and fully developed alternative policy, or because its opposition in recent years was judged ineffective, or because of a fear of weak government by a Fine Gael-led Coalition, or by a minority Fine Gael Party dependent on Labour support.</P>
    <P>He was perfectly right and one of the most serious problems in our present political set-up is that the people do not want either a weak Government or a Fine Gael-led coalition nor do they want a minority Fine Gael Government dependent on Labour support. Again, in the <i>Irish Times</i> on 27th May, 1964, Senator FitzGerald said:</P>
    <P>At some time, by this shift in policy, Fine Gael could find itself better placed to form a future Government, with the help of Labour, than in 1948 and 1954, when the papering over of wide political differences between Fine Gael and its left-wing partners led to weak Governments susceptible to pressures from too many different angles. And as over-all majorities will be hard to secure as long as we hang on to Proportional Representation and fail to adopt the alternative vote in single seat constituencies, whichever of the major Parties can align its policies most closely with those of Labour may stand the best chance of being the Party in power from 1965-66 onwards&mdash;so that even in terms of short-term Party advantage there is something to be said for a shift to the left on the part of Fine Gael.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment I had finished reading what Senators will be happy to know is the last quotation I will make. It is from an article by Senator Garret FitzGerald which appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> on 27th May, 1964. In that article he referred to the wide political differences that had arisen in the previous Coalition Government between Fine Gael and their left-wing partner. He stated that Fine Gael were susceptible to pressures and went on to suggest that, in view of that situation and because overall majorities would be difficult to obtain by Parties in future years, so long as we retain PR, so long as we did not abolish it, as he would prefer, in favour of the alternative vote in single seat constituencies, whichever of the two principal Parties most aligned their policies with those of Labour would stand the best chance of being able to form Governments in years to come.</P>
      <P>This is not the kind of political cynicism I would have expected from Senator FitzGerald. The suggestion is that a great Party such as Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil should align their policies with those of a small minority Party such as Labour then was and still is, with a view to attaining office. This type of situation is the greatest single danger inherent in the system of PR. We have the situation under PR in which Parties are tempted to change the policies on which they were originally elected to suit the policies of some minority Party, perhaps a very small one, in order to attain office or to maintain office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1296" /> I think no one will deny that each of the three main Parties are anxious to attain office on their own. We in Fianna Fáil have never been anxious for office except on the basis of carrying out our own policies. We have stated on many occasions that the policies of Fianna Fáil will be carried out so long as we are in office, no matter whether we have a majority or not. That is a clear, coherent standpoint which has always been adopted by us.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael recently have been making suggestions that there may be a Coalition between them and Labour in the event of Fianna Fáil not obtaining an overall majority in the next general election and I do not think I am being unfair in suggesting that Fine Gael would look on such a coalition as second best&mdash;that they want to be in office as a Fine Gael Government, that they are interested only in a coalition on the basis that nothing else can be got.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the Labour Party. We all know the catastrophe that befell Labour in the two Coalition Governments. Here and in the other House, when social welfare matters were being under discussion, we in Fianna Fáil have pointed out, as we were entitled to do, that, although the present Leader of the Labour Party was Minister for Social Welfare in the last Coalition Government, during the whole three years of office he was able to give only a measly, miserable half crown extra to the old age pensioners, and we have heard from the Labour Benches, and it is a reasonable reply, that after all they did not have a majority in that Government. It is quite clear that the Labour Party, who have said that never again will they take part in a Coalition Government, if they should ever go back on that would only be able to take part in a government in a subordinate position. They are also interested, as the Fine Gael Party and we are, in setting up a government of their own.</P>
    <P>No matter what comparisons may be made by Senator Dooge and others with conditions in other countries and prophesies about what would happen here under proportional representation or under the straight vote it is quite <Col N="1297" /> clear, as matters stand at the moment, that there is no alternative government to Fianna Fáil except either a minority Fine Gael government depending on Labour or else a Fine Gael-Labour Coalition. That is self-evident. I do not think either Fine Gael or Labour expect within the foreseeable future under proportional representation that they can obtain an overall majority. That, to my mind, is the greatest single danger inherent in the present electoral system.</P>
    <P>That is the main reason why we are recommending this change to a straight vote system to the people. We are doing so to clear up this matter once again, to ensure that political stagnation will not exist in Ireland in the future. We have had good governments for 30 years simply because Fianna Fáil have been able to get an overall majority or so near to an overall majority that they have been able to form a government. It is an unhealthy situation that there should have been no alternative government over such a long period. It shows that there is no alternative to the existing government.</P>
    <P>The people, by voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, as I personally believe they will, on the Fourth Amendment Bill, will be able under the straight vote to choose a government. Proportional representation is very good in enabling people to choose individual candidates or individual minority groupings but it is not good in enabling them to choose a government. Under the straight vote they will have a clear-cut issue before them of one government or another. They will be able to decide themselves as to which Party will be the government for the next four to five years. They will be able, in particular, to decide the policies they want carried out.</P>
    <P>One of the great dangers with any coalition or minority government depending on other Parties is the people have no way of knowing whether those policies will be carried out. Take, for example, those who voted Labour in the general election which led to a coalition government, expecting Labour policies to be carried out. When this happened the last time and the Labour Ministers came to power they were unable to carry out the <Col N="1298" /> policies they had set before the voters. All they were able to do was to say that they did not have power to do it although they were in government. This is an entirely unsatisfactory situation. By voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; on the Fourth Amendment Bill the people will get power, which they can exercise ruthlessly, to throw out an unpopular government, neck and crop. The straight vote is far more effective as a weapon for people who want to throw out an unpopular government than proportional representation ever could be.</P>
    <P>So far from establishing dictatorship we will under the straight vote system be joining what would be called the major democracies in the world and be setting up a system which would be much more democratic from the point of view of either a Fianna Fáil government or of an alternative government, which would be much more democratic than the one we have at the moment. I am in no doubt the way things have been going in recent months that the people will come to see it is in their own interest in the exercise of political power that they should adopt the straight vote system.</P>

      <P>Preaching to the converted has always seemed to me to be a useless exercise and having followed the debates in the Dáil, I am forced to the conclusion that that is what the Opposition in that House have been doing over recent weeks, simply preaching to the converted. Everyone of us here in the Oireachtas has, I am quite sure, been questioned at some time or other by visitors outside the country about our system of voting and I feel sure that all of us, or at least the great majority of us, have in explaining the workings of the system stressed its value in giving as fair a return as is humanly possible to all sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, in explaining our enlightened proportional representation system, felt something of pride in that our system gives a very much fairer return to those exercising the franchise than the system of the single nontransferable vote which can leave majorities without representation. By this I mean under the single non-transferable <Col N="1299" /> vote the candidate of No. 1 Party may get 4,000 votes and secure the seat while the candidates of No. 2 and No. 3 Parties may get 3,000 and 2,000 votes respectively, a total of 5,000 votes, but will get no representation at all under the system which it is now proposed to inflict on this country.</P>
    <P>Why is this being done? Why this exercise, savouring as it does, of a deathbed conversion? This second attempt to take from us our quite satisfactory system of election, to say the least of it, casts a deep shadow over the image of Fianna Fáil. Fianna Fáil is to me, and it is to many other people who disagree with many of its policies, a very great Party. To have held office over such a long time in the face of taking unpopular actions as well as introducing unpopular legislation surely marks it as a great Party. Their action in regard to this question of PR has been a disillusionment to many. After such a long reign when there would seem to be a chance of their eclipse, they seek to change the form of election in order to prevent power passing to another group of citizens at the will of the people. This is surely a move, in spite of what Senator Yeats has said, towards dictatorship.</P>
    <P>To become a Minister, a person must surely show something above ordinary ability. He must be capable of assessing situations and must, therefore, be fully aware that our people understand and are satisfied with their electoral system. It is not possible for me to accept that the Minister who is responsible for forcing through this measure is unaware of the advantages of PR. I am convinced that he and his colleagues are just as well aware as we in Opposition are of the fairness and value of PR which we have had since the beginning of our State.</P>
    <P>So much has been said without avail in the other House in support of the retention of PR by persons of great knowledge and experience that there is practically nothing one can say without repetition of arguments in support of this satisfactory and efficient system of election. I should like, therefore, to avoid repetition and to follow a line I have often followed in this House <Col N="1300" /> and to which my colleague, Senator Murphy, referred earlier today; that is, to refer to the subject of waste. In a country such as ours where so much requires to be done to build a better way of life for our people&mdash;particularly for those at the lower end of the social scale&mdash;it is nothing short of tragic that so much time and money have been and will be wasted in trying to bring about a supposed change of heart in the Minister and his colleagues. He and they know just as well as we do the advantages of PR.</P>
    <P>However, the Government, having decided that the system must go in order that they may be copperfastened in power, have no option but to keep up the pretence and go on with this time- and money-wasting exercise of making a second attempt within ten years to abolish PR.</P>
    <P>This being my view of the position, I do not propose to say anything further except to express the hope and the belief that the Irish people will show clearly by their votes in the coming referendum that they appreciate they have one of the best possible electoral systems and that they intend to hold on to it.</P>

      <P>During the last few years I have often listened to the speeches made in this House by Senator Dooge, and I must say I have always been impressed by his vigour, his enthusiasm and the forthright manner in which he presents his case. He gave me, at any rate, the impression that here was a man who believed in what he was saying. But, last night I was a trifle disappointed. I felt that Senator Dooge was rattling off the Fine Gael Party line and that he was not fully satisfied with it. As I listened to him, I could not help wondering on which side Senator Dooge was at that historic Fine Gael meeting in Leinster House when by a single solitary vote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I will spell the word &ldquo;heart&rdquo; for the stenographer afterwards. I feel that it is in the interests of this nation that the Fine Gael Party should tell the people of Ireland how many of their members believe in the abolition of PR and I feel that if they do not do that it is our duty to tell the people of Ireland <Col N="1302" /> that at that Fine Gael meeting one single vote dominated the issue.</P>

      <P>There are Members here who were defeated in the 1961 election but who did not consider it arrogant to ask their electorate to reconsider the matter in 1965. We have a third wing in this House, the intellectual wing. Many of them would say that the main purpose of the Houses of the Oireachtas is to study and consider legislation. It is well known that many of these people think that politicians should not have to act for the people in the way they are doing. However, many of us believe that the most effective method of representation is to meet and listen to the ordinary people of Ireland. Many Deputies and Senators every week have to write letters and act as advisers in many spheres. I believe that this is important work and it is only through this method that experience can be got to speak on legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the people of Ireland want this system. If they are sitting in a country cottage around the fire smoking their pipes at a meeting of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour, they know that if the suggestions they make are worthwhile, they will be brought much further. But under the present system it is very difficult in counties like mine for Deputies to give that type of representation. In the constituency of North-East Donegal, where I live, a Deputy can travel almost 100 miles within his constituency. It is natural, therefore, that if the constituencies became single-seaters, it would be much easier for the Deputy to get to his people and for his people to get to him. I have heard a lot about the comparison between Dublin and the rest of Ireland. Most <Col N="1305" /> Dublin people, as far as I can see, appear to meet their Deputies here in Leinster House or at a chosen venue on a chosen day; but in rural Ireland, and in my county in particular, the Deputy must travel to meet the people. This is a very strong argument in favour of the single-seat constituency.</P>
    <P>We have been scoffed at for the suggestion that there can be competition between Deputies of the one Party. I would ask the House to consider for a moment the situation, say, in the constituency of County Dublin.</P>

      <P>It is possible he was the most effective Fine Gael Deputy in the constituency. It is possible he was the most hardworking Fine Gael Deputy in the constituency, so hardworking, in fact, that his political colleagues believed his election to Dáil Éireann was secure. For that reason they voted for somebody else. Therefore, Senator Rooney, despite his hard work, was rejected by the people. Would Senator Rooney tell us that during his period as a Deputy was he watching the Minister for Local Government and his &ldquo;gracious colleague&rdquo; or was he watching his own colleague? It is natural that the main competition in political life here is not between Deputies of different Parties but between Deputies of the same Party. If Senator Rooney was not watching his own colleague, I suggest that if he is re-elected to Dáil Éireann, he will watch him more closely in future.</P>

      <P>Listening to Senator Dooge and to Senator Rooney's interruptions, one would think it was the Fianna Fáil Party who entered the High Court in 1960-61. Listening to these charges of gerrymandering, one would think that Fianna Fáil were responsible for the changes in the constituencies. Should Fianna Fáil lose the referendum, further constituency changes will be necessary. We shall find an unusual situation in County Donegal with the towns of Bundoran, Ballyshannon and Donegal put into a constituency with Sligo-Leitrim. The town that carries the name of Donegal, the Four Masters' town, may be represented by a Deputy from Leitrim or from Sligo.</P>

    <P>We could find that a member of <Col N="1307" /> Leitrim County Council would be the representative of Donegal town in Dáil Éireann. Possibly in a year or two Senator Dooge, or some other Fine Gael Senator, will say here that this part of Donegal was put into Sligo and Leitrim to prevent Deputy P. O'Donnell from being elected to Dáil Éireann, but if this situation should arise, we want to tell the people of Bundoran, Ballyshannon and Donegal town now that they are in a position to help to prevent it. The only way to prevent this amalgamation is to change the PR system of election.</P>
    <P>Last night Senator Dooge said that these changes in county boundaries made no difference, that they were accepted in other spheres, that the regional tourist organisations were the proof of this. When the regional tourist organisations were announced, Donegal County Council unanimously refused to enter into an organisation with County Sligo and Leitrim. Six months elapsed before they agreed to enter. Four months ago Donegal County Council unanimously agreed to inform the Minister for Transport and Power that they were severing their connections with Counties Sligo and Leitrim.</P>

We are only asking the Irish people to accept the method of election advocated by the Leader of Fine Gael and, remember, that when Deputy Cosgrave became the Leader of Fine Gael, the people of Ireland knew his views on PR, the Fine Gael Party knew his views on PR, and yet they accepted him as their Leader. I believe that Deputy Cosgrave, when he accepted the leadership of Fine Gael, felt he would have been able to swing the Fine Gael Party on his side. He did not count on the back room boys who were more interested in self-preservation. He did not count on the Paddys and the Micks and the Joes who felt there would be no seats for them in Dáil Éireann. We are asking the people of Ireland to give us a system of election accepted by Deputy Cosgrave, accepted by Deputy Oliver Flanagan, accepted by Deputy Costello&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is one thing, however, I have not as yet discovered, that is, what prompted the Minister and the Government at this stage, in spite of the considerable majority of the Fianna Fáil Party, to move these amendments to the Constitution. None of the speakers so far has given us any indication, good, bad or indifferent. Speaker after speaker of the Fianna Fáil Party that I have read or seen quoted has evaded this issue. The only reason why the Government want threequarters of the Dáil Members to be from Fianna Fáil is so that the Minister for External Affairs can, perhaps, stay in New York for good and will not be bothered coming home for divisions, happy in the knowledge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the only reason I can find. I cannot recall any section of the community in any part of the country advocating that we should have a change in the electoral system. But I recall over the past five or six years individuals and groups and councils in every one of the 26 counties and in every one of the 27 county councils advocating that other more urgent legislation be brought in, but these proposed Amendments to the Constitution are deemed to be so important that they must take precedence <Col N="1311" /> of legislation that many of us would like to see enacted, legislation that would help the people in many spheres in which reform is so urgently needed. I agree the Government cannot tackle all these problems at the one time, but why at this stage should a change in the electoral system seem to solve all our problems?</P>
      <P>I should like to ask Senators on the far side&mdash;and I am sure they will be kind enough to give us an answer either tonight or during the course of this debate&mdash;are they seeking a strong Government, or do they not consider the Government they have is strong enough? I feel that the present Government is a sufficiently strong Government, but they have struck fear into the hearts of the rural community because of the iron-fist tactics of the two Bs of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>I cannot see how an electoral system which is calculated to increase vastly the number of seats the Fianna Fáil Party now hold in Dáil Éireann will improve the quality of either the individuals concerned or the policies put forward by this Government. I should like the Minister for Local Government at some stage to underline what was the need for the urgency attached to this legislation. This is something the voters and the ordinary people want to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many things have been promised for quite a while in the line of proposed legislation. I recall the former Minister for Justice on a television programme some months ago promising many reforms in the legal code at the earliest possible opportunity. What he promised then would be of tremendous assistance and help to the ordinary Irish citizen. Yet we find that all these things are postponed or deferred indefinitely to allow the Fianna Fáil Party to endeavour to get an overall majority in Dáil Éireann. Somehow or other I am of the opinion &mdash;and recent events would perhaps bear out my theory&mdash;that the Government have&mdash;I will not say to their surprise &mdash; found out that the Irish people have now apparently reached the stage when they can accept a change, and they will refute in no <Col N="1312" /> uncertain way the latest proposals the Government are putting before them.</P>
    <P>The Government will get decisive answer from the Irish people against this proposal. For the benefit of Senators opposite, I will not quote any figures, but I can assure them that one of my colleagues will have sufficient figures to prove this theory, and he will be able to put them across in a very elementary way so that the least of us will be able to understand and grasp his meaning and benefit from it.</P>

      <P>That was just a thought. I have been searching my mind for a reason why this came about, and I could not find one. I can well imagine that there are important personages who would crib at having to make these arduous trips back and forth in order to vote, if a pair were not available. I am sure there are such people who carry quite an amount of weight, even in Fianna Fáil circles. I came up with that idea, because over the past few months I did not hear in any part of the country anyone advocating that we should have this change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening speech, the Minister spoke of a better type TD and a better type candidate under the proposed new system. I cannot see how this would follow, because there is a train of thought that even here in the Seanad perhaps some of the instant Senators leave something to be desired. I do not necessarily share that view or have any views on it, but it is wrong for anyone to advocate that because of a change in the system, we will have a change in the personnel or a different type of person, or that we will resurrect a different type of Irishman or woman who is prepared to serve his or her country. That is an unnecessary argument and perhaps not quite a valid one.</P>
      <P>As I have said, I do not propose to speak at any length because quite an amount has been said and written on this subject, not only in 1959 but over the past few months. I feel that already the public and the voters have made up their minds that they will vote against these proposals because they see them as a means whereby the Government are shirking their responsibility to introduce new legislation designed to help every section of the community. I look forward to the debate on the Finance Bill when I will indicate some areas in our society where the public have not been getting a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to give the House and the people some indication of the Government's reasons for the great hurry in introducing this legislation, and the great need at this or any other time for bringing in an amendment to the Constitution <Col N="1314" /> when, in fact, no campaign or no effort has been started or mentioned in any quarter of the State other than in a section of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He forgot to mention the many times this question came up within his own Oireachtas Party. If he believes what the correspondents say happened at our Party meetings or elsewhere, surely we have the right to believe what we read and hear about a majority of the Fianna Fáil Oireachtas Party being opposed to this legislation, and who know that if this legislation goes through, they will lose their seats. There are not enough seats in the Seanad for them all. Many of them must be on the verge of suffering heart attacks at the way the straight vote let them down during the recent BGA elections.</P>

      <P>I have been grumbling and growling to myself for a long time at the manner in which the debate on so very important a subject, in my opinion, has been conducted. There has been a great lack of considered and reasoned statements comparing one system with the other as systems, and not as weapons of one political Party or another. No reasoned statement has been put forward comparing the advantage to the people of Ireland of retaining PR or rejecting it and accepting single-seat constituencies. What will be the advantage to the country if we change our present system? None of that was done. Instead of being treated as the very important national question which it is, it has been transformed into a Party political debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until tonight, I had an awful lot more to say on that subject and an <Col N="1315" /> awful lot of fault to find with various people but, tonight, Senator Yeats spiked one of my guns. He put forward a very reasonable and commonsense comparison between the two electoral systems. He did so in a manner in which it could be understood by anybody who is at all interested in the question of electing a Government. Although Senator Yeats spiked one of my guns, I still remain one of those cranks and idiots who believe that proportional representation is the best form of democratic representation.</P>

      <P>The single-seat constituency system could work to the advantage of one political Party but we should not allow any comment or discussion on that point. We should insist on concentrating&mdash;I hope this House will make it the main issue&mdash;on why one electoral system is better than another.</P>
      <P>I am not one of the younger Members of the House: I am one of the old political people. I remember, as a young woman, being absolutely converted to the idea of proportional representation as the best and surest method of securing democratic representation for the people of a country. There are so many different points that one could make. I have heard the comments of most speakers in favour of the abolition of proportional representation, whether they were made in the Dáil, in the newspapers, on the radio or on the television. Not one single reason was advanced by them in favour of its abolition that the political history of our country, in the past 40 years, does not challenge and prove wrong. That is why I want the question to be treated on a national basis and not as a matter of Party loyalty. I want the two electoral systems to be compared and discussed. I want the position made clear so that the people will be able to vote at the referendum as their commonsense dictates and not as their sense of Party loyalty would call upon them to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some very remarkable misstatements were made in the Dáil in favour of the abolition of proportional representation. One of the most remarkable <Col N="1316" /> to me was the misstatement by the Taoiseach that proportional representation is out-of-date. Anybody who has studied the question of proportional representation knows that it was born out of the growing awareness of a vast number of people that the single-seat constituency no longer served the purpose of democracy, that inequalities were caused and that often majorities were returned which were composed of a large number of minor representatives.</P>
    <P>It was found that the system of the single representative for a constituency no longer served the purpose and was out of date due to changing circumstances. As a result, study and research was carried out to devise another system to take its place. After a number of years, the system of proportional representation was accepted as the only system that could take its place. There were trial elections and there was a good deal of propaganda. I remember going to propaganda meetings in Dublin at which people from various parts of the Continent explained the workings of proportional representation. Out of all that came the idea that proportional representation was the only system to take the place of the out-of-date one-man, one-constituency system. I was surprised that the Taoiseach did not remember that. I was very much surprised that he should ask us to change to a system of election which was declared out of date a generation or so before us and from a system on which years of study and research were spent in order to take its place.</P>
    <P>Other reasons were given as to why we should have a change. We were told that proportional representation is a difficult system, difficult to understand and difficult to operate. We have been using proportional representation for 40 years. It was thrown at us&mdash; overnight as it were&mdash;and we made it work. The only thing that ever made me waver in my belief in proportional representation&mdash;being a crank and an idiot who believed in it&mdash;was that it was imposed on us by Britain. At the time, I was full of suspicion of every deed Britain did to Ireland. I thought the British had some ulterior motive in <Col N="1317" /> testing proportional representation on us when they would not dream of using it themselves. We spoiled their game. I really think they believed that if we adopted proportional representation we would make such a muddle of our situation&mdash;of our Government and of our country&mdash;that Unionists and those who favoured reunion with Britain would get into control and we would go back sorrowful delinquents to Mother Britain. I believe that was her idea. I also believe that the trouble in the emergent nations which broke away from the British Empire, in Asia and Africa, is due to the fact that Britain insisted they have a system common to their own, the single-seat constituency, and they do not make a success of their freedom and their liberty as the Irish people were able to make under PR.</P>
    <P>It was not so difficult as time has proved for us to use PR. Everybody who seeks to abolish the system says that it is too difficult. We even had Senator Yeats speaking about how difficult it was. I cannot understand how an intelligent person can say that everybody must understand the mechanics of everything that works. If there is only one person driving a car, it does not mean that four other people cannot be in it and that four out of the five do not understand how it works. They trust the one who drives just as the present day voter in Ireland trusts the men who have been trained over the years and are experts in counting and apportioning the surplus votes.</P>
    <P>There were many other things which I had intended mentioning but they were referred to by other speakers and I do not want to repeat them. I just wonder if these references about the system being so difficult to understand, made by those who seek to abolish PR, are made because they have no faith in the new voters who are coming along, the people who are now 21 years of age and who will be voting in the referendum. Do they think that the new young voters are less intellectual than their grandfathers, their grandmothers, their uncles and aunts, their fathers and mothers, and would know less about marking ballot papers than the old people did?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1318" /> Lots of people forget that this marking of ballot papers in the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 is an advance on the old X system. It is not really necessary for me to tell Parliamentarians that the first electors did not mark votes because they were too illiterate. Their names on the voters' list was called and they stated aloud the candidate for whom they were voting. This meant that all the pressures of the landlords and bosses were against them and the fear of eviction and the loss of jobs most often caused them to call out the name of a candidate they did not want. Then we got the secret ballot and it was found that there was such a lot of illiteracy in the country and that the people have been accustomed to signing any important document such as the marriage register, birth certificates, leases and agreements of one sort or another, with &ldquo;X, his mark&rdquo; that voters were allowed to put their mark on the ballot paper&mdash;X&mdash;opposite the one they wanted to vote for.</P>
    <P>As I say, it was a sign of the illiteracy of the people and it is horrible that we should go back to a system which declares to the world that we are still of the illiterate class and must still sign &ldquo;X, our mark&rdquo; opposite the candidate we want. I think that more should adopt the method adopted by Senator Yeats and in plain commonsense language compare the proportional representation system with the single-seat system. Do not bother going into mathematics to the extent that some have done. That is all very good as far as statistics and research work for later on are concerned but it is no good for public propaganda. If they would make this comparison in simple words that would appeal to the commonsense and reason of the ordinary man and woman, they could then decide the question of what they think is best for the people and for the country and not allow the question to be decided on what political Party will gain advantage from the change or which political Party will it help to destroy. The question we are deciding is not a Party political question but a national political question and one which concerns everybody, no matter to what Party he belongs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to describe the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill as the &ldquo;Gerrymandering Bill&rdquo; because this is the Bill in which the principle of one man, one vote, can be transgressed by skilful manoeuvring of the populations in various constituencies. The Minister adverted to the British system of voting but if we look nearer home, at the North of Ireland system of voting, we should remember that in the North of Ireland over 20 constituencies are never contested. It is Hobson's choice for the electorate in these constituencies. There is no point in putting up any other candidate.</P>
      <P>If the system of proportional representation operated in the North of Ireland, there would be a point in putting up other candidates. You could put up a Nationalist candidate, a Labour candidate and a Unionist candidate in a particular constituency and, depending on how many seats there were in the constituency, the people would get proportional representation. If the Nationalist candidate secured a sufficient number of votes, he would get representation. At the present time, however, the Nationalist cannot win a seat and has no hope of winning a seat. Neither has the official Labour Party. The seat is not contested and the Unionist candidate who is nominated approximately ten days before the election date is automatically declared elected when the clock strikes 12. That is the situation in Northern Ireland. Over 20 Members of Parliament are elected repeatedly in that way because the other political Parties know there is no point in contesting the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party have, apparently been impressed, by this exercise in Northern Ireland and they are wondering now if, by adopting this system, they might possibly get themselves into a position in certain constituencies in which there would be no point in having a contest. It has been said that this referendum will cost £100,000 of the taxpayers' money, apart altogether from what it will cost the various political Parties, plus the cost of the election workers and the 38 or 40 returning officers who will be <Col N="1320" /> required. If Fianna Fáil are so anxious to have £100,000 spent on changing the system of voting, would they not be prepared to put up this money themselves since it is for their benefit they are hoping to change the system? Instead of doing that, they will use £100,000 of the taxpayers' money to get the present system changed to one they think will suit them better.</P>
    <P>It is obvious the Fianna Fáil Party have decided to adopt this system because their fortunes are falling. The percentage of the vote they obtain has been falling from one election to another. In the March election of 1965, Fianna Fáil got 49 per cent of the votes and 50 per cent of the seats, 72 out of 144. Their good organisation explains why, having got less than 50 per cent of the votes, they still secured 50 per cent of the seats. But their percentage poll now is dropping. It has dropped to approximately 40 per cent and it seems to be still falling. This is what has alarmed the Fianna Fáil Party and it is because they are alarmed that they are trying to change the system as quickly as possible. They are leaving much more important work aside while all this argument goes on about this proposal to change the voting system and alter the constituencies.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that, in the event of this proposal being accepted by the people, it is proposed to divide the country into approximately 144 constituencies. I should say, in passing, that that will mean 144 returning officers to be paid instead of the 38 at present, because at the moment we have 38 constituencies. In dividing up the constituencies, the Minister will make sure to divide them in a manner which will be of advantage to Fianna Fáil. He would be a fool if he did not do that. The Minister will not disregard the ambitions of his Party when he divides the constituencies. He is allowing for a tolerance of between 30 and 40 per cent. That means that he can divide a Fine Gael area in which there are 70,000 electors into three one-seat constituencies with approximately 23,500 voters in each. Adjacent to that, in a Fianna Fáil <Col N="1321" /> stronghold in which there are 70,000 electors, he can divide the area into four one-seat constituencies with less than 17,000 voters in each constituency. In actual figures that is what tolerance could mean. You could have two groups of 70,000 electors, one group having three Fine Gael representatives and the other having four Fianna Fáil representatives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, then I stand corrected, but I understood it was as a result of Fine Gael pressure, pressure designed to bring some measure of fair play into these proposals. However, I have demonstrated clearly what could happen; one group of 70,000 voters could elect three representatives and another group of 70,000 could elect four representatives. That cannot be contradicted. That could be the situation under the tolerance arrangement which allows for a minimum of something like 16,500 and a maximum of approximately 23,500. Obviously Fianna Fáil will have a part in making sure that Fianna Fáil areas will get the maximum representation with a low electorate as compared with predominantly Fine Gael areas with a greater number of electors. In Clare, for example, though they might not get a majority of the votes, they would get a relative majority&mdash;a very respectable description indeed&mdash;which is, of course, quite different from a majority. In other words, you would have no Fine Gael <Col N="1322" /> or Labour representative from Clare, as we have at the present time. There are other constituencies like that. Possibly in Dún Laoghaire, Fianna Fáil would get no representation; there would be four Fine Gael Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator need not worry. We will do all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be four Fine Gael Deputies from Dún Laoghaire and possibly four Fianna Fáil Deputies from Clare. What about the people who support Fianna Fáil and Labour in Dún Laoghaire and the people who support Fine Gael and Labour in Clare? That is where proportional representation really comes in. It gives fair representation to different political Parties and different policies.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the revision period of 12 years. Unfortunately Fianna Fáil have been fiddling with this legislation, if one may put it that way, in the past because they could have revised the constituencies in, I think, 1961 when the census figures were available. They pretended they were not available. They were with the printers and, since they were with the printers, they must have been available. The delay meant, of course, that constituencies went out of gear because regard was not had to the most recent census figures. It was suggested that in future the figures should be examined every five years while the revision must take place within a period of 12 years, but, in fairness, the revision should take place immediately after a census instead of before the next one so as to get a fair picture of the population in any area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no public demand for the legislation we are now discussing. We have not the people parading up and down outside or in the towns or, indeed, at county councils, or at various gatherings, clamouring for a change in the system of voting. The people have become accustomed to using the PR system. They have obtained the representation they looked for. The voters for Fine Gael have their representatives; the voters for Labour and the <Col N="1323" /> voters for Fianna Fáil have their representatives. In recent times&mdash;I am sure this is what prompted the Fianna Fáil Party to propose this change&mdash; four Deputies were elected by the Sinn Féin organisation. Prior to that, there was a group of 15 or 16 farmers elected to the Dáil. At various times groups have been elected to the Dáil under the PR system.</P>
    <P>That proves that the PR system is fair. It proves that if a sufficient number of people support a particular policy or a particular organisation, they can secure representation in Parliament. Fianna Fáil do not like this and are now bringing in a system by which they hope to cut down the political organisations to two. Fianna Fáil are trying to knock out the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party and to have one Opposition Party, one Party opposed to the Fianna Fáil Party. The people have elected representatives of the Labour Party and representatives of Fine Gael and they have the power to take out either Fine Gael or Labour any time they wish under the present system. It would not be easy for them to take Fianna Fáil out of Parliament if they decided to do it because Fianna Fáil would be fools if they did not copperfasten the position immediately if they secured the straight vote system. The Unionists in the North of Ireland have succeeded in doing that and the Fianna Fáil Party apparently have been impressed by that. Most Irish people are fair-minded and democratic and believe in fair play and fair representation. That is why I have no doubt that they will not accept this proposal.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech relating to the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill talked about county boundaries and about the one man one vote arrangement and tried to pretend that it was not one man, one vote that the people of Donegal had if they had to come up here to hospital or to school in Dublin, that they had not a fair measure of representation. What will the position be in another ten or 15 years if the flight from the land continues? Last year, 14,000 people left <Col N="1324" /> the rural areas. What will happen during the coming years? Will we not have a situation where it will be necessary to revise constituencies every 12 years and will have to make up our minds to depart from county boundaries where that is necessary?</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned that as a result of the High Court decision, it was necessary to slice a number of county boundaries in order to even up the population in relation to the law. He deplored this situation. He must admit that, if people continue to drift from the rural areas into the cities and towns, as far as county boundaries and the general territory of counties are concerned, he must follow the population and will have to change the boundaries.</P>
    <P>For instance, take Great Britain or even this country. The Minister is proposing under this new system to establish 144 constituencies but there are only 26 counties in this Republic. The Minister is very inconsistent when he complains that he cannot adhere to county boundaries under the present system when he proposes now to establish 144 constituencies, which will turn the country into a chessboard as far as constituencies are concerned.</P>
    <P>In England, there are approximately 650 constituencies. There again the country is divided like a draught-board and nobody is complaining. There is a name for the constituency. Those interested will be able to identify it according to whatever the local description is. The description of the constituency would probably be related to the major town in the area or to the name of the district. So that there is no very strong argument in favour of adherence to county boundaries. The Minister feels that it is traditional and should be retained but that is not possible when we come to a situation where we must ensure that it is a system of one man, one vote and not a system where a man in the country has a vote equal to two votes in the city, as at the present time. There are constituencies such as the Minister's constituency which I had the privilege of representing for a very long time where there <Col N="1325" /> are approximately 80,000 voters now for the five Deputies as compared with a very much smaller number of electors in other five-seat constituencies. The population of that constituency is growing very rapidly owing to the drift from the rural areas and the expansion of Dublin city.</P>
    <P>There is a requirement in law that constituencies must be revised within a period of not more than 12 years. That is why the Minister will have to face the fact that he will not be obliged to adhere to county boundaries. He will have to follow electoral areas. He may have to use the name of the principal town in the area as the name of the constituency in future but he can make up his mind that the population of rural Ireland will not remain static. Similarly, the population of Dublin, Cork and, possibly, Limerick and Galway will not remain static and an increased number of Deputies would be required for those areas. If the number of Deputies is to remain at 144 it means that if the population falls in a rural area that area must lose a representative and the seat handed over to an area where the population has increased, such as Dublin city.</P>
    <P>It is strange that the Minister, who spoke about county boundaries, found it necessary to bring Ballyfermot into his constituency, an area where he has his shop, his business and where he resides, considering that it is portion of Dublin city to which large numbers of city dwellers were moved into the new corporation estate. A chunk of that portion of Dublin city was taken out and put into the county area. I have no doubt that the Minister had a personal interest in that change. Whether he had or not, when he was putting on the act that he does not want to break county boundaries when reorganising or maintaining constituencies, he should have remembered that he was involved in the change of that area, taking a chunk out of Dublin city and putting it into the county. He will, of course, argue that it was to make it a five-seat area, but it could have been a four-seat constituency. There was no point in bringing in Ballyfermot.</P>

They wanted a four-seat constituency there, giving Fianna Fáil two and Fine Gael two, and they brought Ballyfermot out into the county to make the Minister safe, creating a five-seat constituency where there should have been only four.</P>

First of all, in 1959 when they tried to change the voting system, Dublin city had the final say and rejected it. In 1966, the President was hammered in Dublin city and county by a huge number of votes. As well, in the recent local elections Fianna Fáil were defeated.</P>

      <P>Fifteen out of 45, that was a big first. That is the point. Fianna Fáil were beaten both in the city and county. The Minister does not care about Dublin city or, indeed, about Cork city in the matter of one man one vote. I gather from what Senator McGlinchey had to say that it is intended to keep Fianna Fáil intact at all costs. I have no doubt that Deputy Blaney has made that stipulation already and that not alone Deputy Boland but all the other Government Ministers must toe the line when Deputy Blaney speaks, but why the special terms for Donegal? Is it not obvious it is because Deputy Blaney is from that constituency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dooge last night pointed out that county boundaries should not be regarded as sacrosanct in this respect&mdash; that the people who have the job of organising constituencies should be able to organise appropriate boundaries under the PR system. Senator McGlinchey spoke about the smaller population and that instead of six seats there will be only five seats in Donegal. Whether the number of seats is kept as it is or is reduced as required by the population census, it is not necessary to follow county boundaries. As the Minister said, there has been a <Col N="1328" /> tradition of keeping constituencies and naming them according to the counties, and somebody suggested that it is the Gaelic Athletic Association that has put the name of a county so high up in the minds of the people residing in that county.</P>
    <P>No matter where people reside, we are all Irish and when it comes down to the parish there are areas in which parishes are astride counties. When the Minister was making his plausible case in favour of the tolerence arrangement, he said it would do no more than equate the rural with urban votes. He pointed out that a certain number of people would be outside a constituency, even on a temporary basis, on the day when the census would be taken. However, when one takes averages one can always find that type of population movement. The Minister also mentioned that the large constituency was different for the electors. My reply is that with telephones and easy transport nowadays, and the fact that people are now well educated and literate, electors will be able to telephone or write intelligent letters to their Deputies. It is quite easy for them to get something if they request an interview with the TD for the area. In addition, with easier transport the Deputies themselves are making sure they will be available to their constituencies and can recognise those in the different areas so the case that a large constituency cannot be well served by Deputies is a weak one. Again, many people in the various constituencies are frequently in contact with the county councillors of each Party. Those councillors in turn are in touch with the TDs so that the people in general have a good service under this system.</P>
    <P>Under the proposed change you will have a situation where a very prominent Fine Gael person in a constituency might not have a Fine Gael Deputy to go to for the purpose of making representation, initiating legislation or any of the other activities associated with parliamentary work. That prominent Fine Gael person would be obliged to consult a Fine Gael Deputy in <Col N="1329" /> another constituency in order to ask him to initiate legislation in the House regarding a matter or to raise questions in the Dáil. You may be quite sure that you would not have a Fine Gael person or a Labour person walking up to a Fianna Fáil Deputy asking him to put down a question to embarrass the Government or to initiate legislation which might be opposed to the policy of the Government. In other words, Fine Gael and Labour voters in an area where there would be only a Fianna Fáil Deputy would not have that representation which they enjoy at present.</P>
    <P>At the present time the supporters of the various political Parties have their representatives in the county councils, the Dáil and the Seanad. They are able to make representations to those people and to have various questions raised or amendments to the law tabled on different legislation introduced. The single-seat constituency will put and end to all that. It will leave people without representation except by a particular Deputy. It could be a Labour Deputy, it could be a Fine Gael Deputy or it could be a Fianna Fáil Deputy who would have, first of all to represent the whole constituency but, politically, he would represent only one political Party.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when he was making the case in favour of this tolerance, which could reach above 30 and might even go up to 40 or 50 per cent according to the change in the population over a period; but 30 or 33? per cent would be a minimum in some cases although it could be more than that&mdash;said that in England there are places where it is 60 per cent below the national average and in some cases 80 per cent above in relation to the population for the various constituencies. Again, I have no doubt they have a system in Great Britain for reorganising the representation in Parliament in relation to the population.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that it will be necessary to alter 24 of the 38 constituencies if those proposals are defeated but he must face facts and he must realise, with the movement of population and with the emigration which has taken place from some of <Col N="1330" /> the counties, this situation is bound to arise and that is what the law is there for. The law says that the population of constituencies must be examined within 12 years and alterations must be made or must be arranged within that time having regard to population. There is no point in questioning that it would be necessary to alter 24 of the 38 constituencies. The obligation is there. There is an obligation to change the population in order to ensure fair representation for all the people of the Republic.</P>
    <P>Now, I want to come to the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, 1968. Let us examine what all this is about. First of all, the proposal here is to change over to the straight vote system. I was very impressed by Senator Mrs. Connolly O'Brien when she described the system of putting an X opposite a name as the illiterate system of voting. We often read about the system in America of the write-in vote. It is not illiterate to write in a vote. The proposal here is to change over to a system of placing a mark or an X opposite one name on the ballot paper. The Minister has said it will make it very simple. While it will make it very simple, it will leave a large number of people without a representative.</P>
    <P>Take a single seat constituency, where there are four candidates, a Fine Gael candidate, a Labour candidate, a Fianna Fáil candidate, a Farmers candidate or a Sinn Féin candidate. Obviously, if there are going to be four candidates and one of the Parties gets 26 per cent of the votes that is the Party that will get elected if others get less. In other words, by getting barely more than a quarter of the votes the Fianna Fáil Party would get the seat, or whatever candidate got over 25 per cent of the votes. Similarly, if there were five or six candidates it would need even a smaller percentage of the electorate in order to secure a seat, but the vast majority of the people who did not vote for that candidate would be left without any representative for the Party they supported or the policy they supported.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1331" /> This proposal appears to be a peevish decision on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party when they have discovered they are losing heavily to the trade unionists in Dublin city and Cork. They seem to be losing three votes to Labour for every one vote Fine Gael loses. Those votes appear to be what they call trade unionist votes, those who have voted for their Labour candidates. Fianna Fáil have decided to put a stop to this. They are going to prevent the trade unionists from coming away from Fianna Fáil and voting for Labour by bringing this system in as quickly as they can, if they are permitted by the people, in order to obliterate the Labour Party. They want to leave the Labour Party with less representation than they have in Parliament at present but in Parliament at the present time they have proportional representation. They have representation in proportion to the number of votes they have secured.</P>
    <P>The same applies to Fine Gael and to Fianna Fáil. As I pointed out already, Fianna Fáil got 49 per cent of the votes in the last General Election and, in addition, they secured a number of by-election seats. We were very interested, of course, and Fianna Fáil were, too, in the actual number of votes cast in those by-elections. There was a very heavy fall in the votes which they secured compared with those they obtained in the 1965 General Election in those constituencies, with the exception of one. That was County Clare.</P>
    <P>The greatest argument in favour of the system of PR is that it is democratic. It gives fair representation to various policies which are represented by various Parties. The straight vote system tends to cut out fair representation. The Liberals in England, for instance, number something around ten million people. Senator Yeats will be able to put me right on that; he is good at figures. They are used to getting large figures but they have only a handful in Parliament.</P>

      <P>The Liberal Party were the Government in Great Britain in the early part of this century, about 50 years ago. Under the straight vote system they have lost ground and they have lost seats in Parliment much more rapidly than they lost votes outside Parliament. The Minister in the course of his statement was rather critical of the coalitions, as I think he described them, of 1948 to 1951 and again of 1954 to 1958. Those were the years when great strides were made in the matter of modern policies and meeting modern needs. For instance, our record in housing has not been equalled in any year since. We built more local authority houses in one year than were built in any year of the 26 years about which Fianna Fáil are talking. There, again, let us remind the Fianna Fáil Party that they would never have got into Leinster House but for the PR system of election. They got in under that system of election. Fair enough they got the votes, they got the seats and they came into the Dáil in 1932 as a minority. They succeeded in forming a Government with the support of the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>Of course, they dishonoured the gentleman's agreement that existed between Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party in 1932 and threw them overboard in 1933. They boasted that the Labour Party would get back into Leinster House in a cab. There was a fairly large number of Labour Deputies supporting Fianna Fáil in 1932, but in 1933 the Fianna Fáil Party boasted that a cab would be large enough to bring back the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you. I will be listening very intently. As I have already mentioned, reference has been made to a multiplicity of political Parties. The people are entitled to form a political Party and if they get sufficient support for it to send their representatives to Parliament under the present system, but under the new system there will be no chance of those people ever getting support. In England no political Party is able to get support. In Northern Ireland they cannot gain any strength. Once you have the straight vote system without PR there is no opportunity for new policies, new ideas and new organisations to come into Parliament. Fianna Fáil pretend it is desirable that they should have a majority Government in order to implement their policies. I have just referred to their dropping of the Second Programme for Economic Expansion. They have an overall majority at the moment and what are they doing about the drainage of the Shannon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1335" />
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the drainage of the Boyne that you are holding up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about the Shannon now. When the people along the Shannon were up to their knees in water and there were votes to be got Fianna Fáil were down there promising to drain it. Many of the schemes Fianna Fáil implemented are not policy at all but merely a logical development of administration. Fianna Fáil just paddle along claiming to implement what appear to be new policies but which are, in fact, logical developments in a modern society.</P>
      <P>For example, what would Fianna Fáil have done but for the large volume of exports we have? Fianna Fáil's policy right up to 1948 was always one of self-sufficiency. They were not interested in expanding exports but only in achieving self-sufficiency as far as they could. But now all the talk is about exports. Remember, it was the inter-Party Government that put them on that line when they decided to establish the IDA. The IDA is now to be transformed into a semi-State body, and more power to it. We can all be proud of what the personnel of the IDA have achieved. They deserve the recognition they are getting. They must be given credit for improving our economy to such a great extent compared with the time when that organisation did not exist. But in regard to this body, which we are now going to make a semi-State organisation, Deputy Lemass said that at the first opportunity he would dismantle it.</P>

      <P>The Minister making his case here mentioned the desirability of having a Government with a majority <Col N="1336" /> in order to implement their policies. Any time Fianna Fáil have had a substantial majority that is the time they do nothing. It is when Fianna Fáil are in danger of being in a minority that they are busy.

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the matter of multi-Party representation. <Col N="1337" /> I should like to remind Senators that most of the Governments in Europe today are Coalition Governments. They are very successful and progressive Governments, just as were the two Coalition Governments we had here. In Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Germany, Holland and Denmark there are coalition Governments. We look up to the Danes and the Dutch for what they have achieved for their people in regard to their economies and standard of living. A majority of the progressive nations in Europe have coalition Governments, so Fianna Fail's argument that a coalition Government is not a good one falls down on that score.</P>
      <P>Another point made by the Minister was that in the large five-seat constituencies, where you get two Fine Gael, two Fianna Fáil and one Labour, the two Fine Gael fellows were at loggerheads with each other and trying to be one up on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think what the Minister found was that the Fianna Fáil fellows could not agree in their constituencies and were trying to be one up on each other. The Minister said that this constant cut-throat competition between two Fianna Fáil Deputies in a constituency was something to be avoided and that the only way to avoid it was to separate them and put them into single-seat constituencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>He also put up the argument that heading the poll does not guarantee the first seat, or any seat, to a candidate under the present system, but before the count starts, the quota is decided and if heading the poll means reaching the quota and, if he gets one vote over the quota, he will be elected. The point is that heading the poll without reaching the quota will not elect him and every Deputy elected will have to reach the quota except the final one. The argument about a candidate heading the poll and not being elected seems plausible until you consider that the candidate did not reach the quota under PR.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that the Fianna Fáil Party are trying to bring in this system because it will come to their rescue. In the first Bill, the tolerance arrangement will help them as a Party to get four seats in certain areas compared with three for the Opposition. In addition, they realise that if they can get the largest number of votes, even if it is only 25 per cent of the total poll in certain places where there is a number of candidates, they will secure the seat. They are trying to gain these two advantages at the expense of the taxpayer. An estimate of £100,000 has been made but I should like to know how it was reached. How much per constituency is it proposed to spend? Bring it down to £ s d and let us have the truth. The £100,000 appears to be very conservative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1339" /> As regards single-seat constituencies where only one person is elected, supposing he is a Fianna Fáil candidate, as the Minister hopes, there is the danger of political patronage being extended further than at present. The political patronage&mdash;if you like, the bribery and corruption&mdash;that can arise is a very serious danger and leaves the constituency wide open so far as this patronage weapon is concerned. People can be intimidated and bullied by a political Party, particularly by a Government Party, if a Government Deputy holds the constituency. People may feel they are threatened, even if they are not, by a Fianna Fáil Deputy in an area if Fianna Fáil happen to be in Government. It gives him undue influence not justified by the number of people who voted for the elected candidate.</P>
    <P>The Minister also argued that by-elections are very expensive and that a by-election in a small constituency would not be as expensive as one in a five-seat constituency as at present. Nobody will argue against the Minister on the matter of expense but it is a question of having a system of election that we know or changing to a completely different system resulting in smaller constituencies. I did not like the Minister's remarks when he spoke about the newspapers which are not the <i>Irish Press</i> or <i>Evening Press.</i> He spoke of the <i>Independent</i> and <i>Irish Times</i> and I suppose the <i>Cork Examiner</i> and the <i>Sunday Independent</i> as being the Opposition papers. What he admitted is that the <i>Irish Press</i> is a Party-tied political organ, that it is not a newspaper. He referred to the other newspapers as the Opposition Press. He should give the newspapers and their editors a little more credit for presenting the news and views in an intelligent unbiassed, manner. That is what we usually get from the <i>Independent</i> and the <i>Irish Times.</i></P>
    <P>Some time ago, for instance, we had a situation when Fianna Fáil threatened to outlaw the NFA because they did not like their activities at that time. The Taoiseach himself went on television to warn the farmers that he was on the point of declaring them an illegal organisation.</P>

I was very sorry the Minister was not present to hear exactly what she had to say, because I am quite sure it would have made an impression even on him. It might have caused him to change his mind and accept <Col N="1343" /> amendments, something he has no intention of doing. The Bill before us here reminds me of the Marts Bill. We had amendment after amendment and the Minister for Agriculture sat there and would not accept any of them.

      <P>The Fianna Fáilinspired amendment put down by Deputy Norton got the works, too, because the Minister would not give way on it. Quite a number of people in the Fianna Fáil Party wanted the single-seat and the transferable vote, and it was quite a close thing in their Party as to whether they would succeed or not. Some very prominent people were associated with putting down that motion before the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party, yet it was defeated because the Minister would not agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the attitude of the Minister to the Bill here today. It does not matter how long we take, whether we talk for two, three or four days; it will make no difference. The Minister will bulldoze this through Seanad Éireann and we shall have the referendum in October. We in the Labour Party would be delighted to see the referendum taking place next week because I am afraid the people throughout the country will get it into the back of their minds: &ldquo;I do not need to vote; it is going to be defeated&rdquo;. Fianna Fáil are playing that game, delayed action. The Minister for Local Government held up the Bill, making speeches for two and three hours. I listened to him in the Dáil. It was not the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party held up the Bill. You could say at the beginning there was a bit of filibustering all right, but in the end the only person who tried to delay the Bill was the <Col N="1344" /> Minister. If the Minister wanted to put the Bill through, he could have done so and the referendum could take place in the month of July.</P>

I will get in anyway, and I defy anyone in Ireland to defeat me.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I accept your ruling, Sir. The Minister made many references to the breaching of county boundaries, but if we go back to 1961, to the O'Donovan case, where it was proved that the constituencies had been wrongly constituted, we find that the breaking up of some of the constituencies at that time could give qualms of conscience to everyone in Fianna Fáil. I remember before that case was finished in the courts a certain TD stated: &ldquo;I hope O'Donovan wins the case and I will settle a couple of people.&rdquo; Fianna Fáil had a big say in drawing the lines as to where a constituency should start and where it should end. If they found someone coming up against them, they could cut up the constituency as they thought fit. It happened in my own case. Part of Westmeath was put in with Kildare, although not one inch of Westmeath touches the Kildare boundary. To overcome that, they slipped in a little bit of Meath, which touches Westmeath, and put the three of them together. For a person from Meath to go to a TD in Athy, he would have to pass through Westmeath, into Offaly, into Laois and down into Kildare before he could&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When there are interruptions and personal remarks it is very hard not to forget. We heard the Minister talking about the tolerance vote and about letting one TD represent about 16,000 people in the West of Ireland, or in Donegal, or in the south, and one TD represent about 23,000 in the urban areas. That in itself is proof to me that the Government have failed completely to do anything for the West. The Minister holds that he would have to go into two or three counties to get enough constituents in the West to elect a TD, but if that is the case, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and that is proof that the Government have failed to save the West, and failed to get the people to stay there. When people reach the age of 18 or 19 years there, they get on the boat and they are off to England, or they get on the train and go to Dublin. We have over one-fifth of the population of Ireland in Dublin today. We hear talk about decentralisation and putting the Department of Lands in Castlebar and the Department of Education in Athlone. We will see white blackbirds before those things happen. There are wheels within wheels. This is all propaganda for the election next year, and for the coming referendum.</P>

      <P>I spoke about the difficulty of having the single-seat system confined to countries. I think it would be impossible to do it. Take my own constituency of Longford. The population in Longford is so small that it would be impossible to elect two candidates, whereas in Westmeath there would not be enough to elect three. There was a lot of talk about the annihilation of the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>What is worrying everyone today is bread and butter. We see in the papers: &ldquo;We will go on strike if we do not get more pay&rdquo;. We see that today. Everyone is worried about bread and butter. We have grown to be more materialistic, and I do not blame people for growing materialistic. We became materialistic in Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann ourselves recently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is materialism all over the world. When people want to know whether Ireland is the right country to live in, the best country in the world, they ask themselves one question: &ldquo;Am I getting sufficient pay? Have I reasonable comfort?&rdquo; And unless they can answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to those two questions they will not consider it wise to live in this country, and they will leave it. It has been a trend right down for the past two or three years&mdash;industrial unrest and everything else. It will take a little while to settle all the matters that are in dispute. As soon as one is settled, another arises.</P>
      <P>My contention is that proportional representation has served us well in the past. We have had 40 years experience of it. As Senator Mrs. Connolly O'Brien says, it was not imposed. We were glad to accept the system of proportional representation. We were glad to be able to turn around and to say to the people of Northern Ireland: &ldquo;If you come in here with us, we shall give you a system of election that will give a minority fair representation in Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
