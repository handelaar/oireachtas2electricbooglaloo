      <P>In paragraph (b), line 12, before &ldquo;place&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;principal&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The amendment would negative the purpose of registration since it would allow a registered buyer to carry on business in an unregistered place to do business other than its principal business.

      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the terms of one of the clauses of this section. That is the one which relates to the laying before both Houses of the Oireachtas the matter of the revocation of a licence. This clause first appeared in the Marts Bill last year and on that occasion I congratulated the Minister on this beneficial section which had not appeared in any previous Bill and I expressed the hope that this would be an example for the future and that the practice would be continued. I see that the clause appears in this Bill and I congratulate the Minister on it.</P>

      <P>On Second Stage I raised a question under subsection (1) paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 9 which states:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall (a) cancel the registration of any person in the register, (b) revoke a licence granted to a person under this Act, upon the application of the person or, in the case of a deceased person, his personal representative, or in the case of a body corporate, the liquidator.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister no power to cancel the registration unless asked to do so by the personal representative of the deceased person?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also the following subsection which gives power to the Minister if he so thinks fit to cancel or suspend a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that cover a deceased as well as a living person?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that meets the case covered by subsection (1) but on reading further in subsection (2), paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) we find it gives reasons why the Minister might think fit to cancel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>If a licensed person has died the licence will cease to exist. The entire livelihood of that person's family and his employees may be depending on the business built up by <Col N="1140" /> him and I want to ask the Minister should the licence go to some other person in the firm and if the Minister considered there was no suitable person in the firm would the livelihood of all those engaged in the business be at stake?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you mean in the event of cancellation or revocation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the licence was cancelled or revoked, whether this was brought about by the action of the Minister or at the request of the personal representative, undoubtedly in each case there is likely to be some other person, whether an employee or a member of the family, who would be suitable to continue the business. It would be difficult to envisage the circumstances in which this would not be so and it would also be true to say that in the case of a revocation taking place as a result of the passing of the actual business holder. That would probably be dealt with subsequently by a new application from somebody allied to the firm or business, or family, or, indeed, in their employment who would be regarded as a suitable person to hold a licence and who would have a knowledge of the trade. I do not think it could happen even where a licence was taken away by the Minister because of various malpractices mentioned under subsection (a). It could be that a licence in respect of the business that had been carried on might well be granted on application to some new licence-holder. Again, it could be somebody from the particular business concerned. It could be somebody in the family concerned or somebody in the employment of the firm before the actual revocation of the licence because in that sort of case a great deal would depend on the circumstances that surround the taking away of licences and whether or not the person engaged in the businesses were, in fact, above board and above suspicion and that you were not taking back a licence because of some sort of malpractice which would continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would depend on the merits of the <Col N="1141" /> case if and when that would arise. This would be capable of being done and it would be fair to say that in any of these cases where revocation had ill effects for persons in employment that anything that could would be done. The new licence being issued would cater for them and secure them against total loss of employment. This undoubtedly would be the wish of the Minister of the day and I have no hesitation in saying that at this stage.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 10.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to know why the Minister wants this particular section. It would appear that it is giving extraordinary powers to the Minister. We all feel that there is necessity for legislation to help improve the market position of the wool and help the farmers who are engaged in this branch of agricultural husbandry. I feel that the Minister under section 10 is taking extraordinary powers in so far as if he so thinks fit that by regulation he can grant an exemption to a person or individual, complete exemption, under this particular Bill if it becomes an Act. I should like the Minister to tell us why he needs this power and the particular circumstances he would avail of under section 10 of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in regard to this Bill is that as it stands under section 10 the Minister would have no power to make regulations exempting from the Act businesses of a particular class. On this point there is no power to exempt individuals. Businesses of particular classes may be exempted. There is just one instance and it is the only concrete one I have. My present intention, under the terms of this Bill if it is passed and becomes law, is to exempt buyers of skinned wool as a class from the exemption. It may be that there will be other things that will emerge where exemption of this nature would not be desirable but section 10 will not only enable the exemption of the class, particularly of skinned wool, but perhaps others of a <Col N="1142" /> like nature to this in time ahead. As of now, my intention, under this particular section, is to exempt buyers of skinned wool from the provisions of the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wondered whether that section, in fact, conferred power on the Minister or merely infers power he already has.</P>
      <P>Section 8 says:</P>
      <P>...such fee (if any) as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may fix...</P>
      <P>Is this enough to give him the power?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) of section 8 says:</P>
      <P>There shall be paid to the Minister...</P>
      <P>That is the lead-in of that one. It is in the first line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this section which relates to the grading of wool, perhaps the Minister could give us some information when he would propose to bring that into operation in view of the very large programme involved in training the necessary personnel for the purchase of wool on a graded basis? It is one of the most important aspects of the Bill that the wool producer will benefit in prices for his trouble in presenting fleeces in a clean and thorough manner but there is more to it than just that. The different grades of wool will emerge from the best types of sheep and the Minister might be able to tell us how far research has gone into the production of the best type of wool required on the market today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We realise that there are many types <Col N="1143" /> of wool which will find a market eventually in, if you like, Australia and New Zealand. I do not propose that we embark on importing Merino sheep but they concentrate on the production of the best type of wool which they have there. I can see great problems arising in this country where we have so many different types of sheep and this will be a lengthy job. I cannot see it happening this year and I doubt if the personnel will be available next year to put this into effect. Perhaps the Minister could give more information on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject is wide. It would be more a matter to look up in the Library than for the Minister to try to answer that. The quality of our wool is dealt with by the Committee on Wool Improvements. They state in paragraph 115 of their report that the basic quality of Irish wool is of a reasonably good standard.</P>
      <P>An Foras Talúntais are interesting themselves in this matter of quality, product and breeding but I have not got this information at the moment. In relation to the section, what the Senator started on was the question of when the grading and the paraphernalia attached to the Bill will be in operation. Straight off I should say that it is my hope that by this time next year there will be in operation a simplified form of grading, not necessarily the final system of grading but at any rate a simplified form, in time for next year's clip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be in relation to the entire flock of the country rather than a section of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and our treatment of the wool we have will form an early part of our effort. Of course, the greater part of our endeavour will be a development of that which we have got at the moment to see that not only is the wool clipped clean but that it is kept clean and in sound condition and not abused between the time of the clip and the time it is marketed. We have got a bit yet to do before we get down to the more important and more far-reaching questions of the <Col N="1144" /> breeding and the varieties of wool as well as inquiring into the intricacies that exist in that respect. I wish to state now that the basic quality of our wool is regarded as being reasonably sound but there is a good deal we can do about breeding and presentation. We hope to have this in operation and to do a better job next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister be able to control the price of wool this year? Most of the wool has been disposed of and there is evidence of a couple of pence increase per pound. This is rather regrettable because the majority of farmers sold at a low price, yet the price appears to have been uniform in the case of all buyers. There is what would appear to be a ring in operation and the time has come when the Minister must announce minimum prices for produce of this kind. Paragraph (c) of subsection (2) is that to which I am referring and I should like to ask the Minister the specific circumstances he envisages here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to a number of these questions one would need notice in order to do justice to the replies. The short answer to the query is that the particulars will be as may be prescribed. I presume the Senator wishes to go further and that he wishes to know what are these particulars. Before mentioning anything in relation to that, I have referred to the other question in regard to the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am anxious about is whether the Minister will be able to control the price and announce a minimum price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this is really on. The announcement of a minimum price would imply a responsibility to buy at that minimum price. A case has not been made for this merely because wool may be a couple of pence dearer than the price at which it was sold originally. If wool is kept for a few months after the clip it does not add to its weight if it is reasonably kept and the person who gets the penny or twopence more for it today is probably no better off than the person who sold it a little cheaper some months <Col N="1145" /> ago. Of course, there is a possibility that the fact that buyers offer in or around the same price can denote that there may be a ring, but, of course, the ring price need not necessarily react to the disadvantage of the sellers. It could be that these people's efforts to sell their wool and get around the same price for it would be indicative of reasonable handling but this need not necessarily mean that the price has been created to the disadvantage of the sellers though, as I have said, it is a possibility.</P>
      <P>Very often when such things happen, the immediate indication is that this is a fix to the disadvantage of the farmers. On the other hand, one would be prompted to ask whether this is the case when there is a wide disparity between the price offered by one buyer and another. Therefore, the fact that wool is offered at the same price does not set up the case that this is a ring to the disadvantage of the farmers. Under the aegis of An Chomhairle and under their realistic appraisal of the various grades of wool, I hope prices will be about the same for comparable grades throughout the country. That is what we should aim at rather than condemning the fact that we have similar prices paid by all buyers. We should look further to find if there is a ring to the disadvantage of the farmers or if this is a true reflection of the economics of the market in which the wool was sold. We may be wronging people who are offering similar prices throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 12.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 12 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which caused the greatest controversy in the other House. It is one about which I feel very strongly. In it, the Minister will have either a very useless body or a body with tremendous potential and it seems at this stage that the Comhairle will have neither power nor responsibility. During the debate in the other House on this section in Committee, Deputy Clinton asked the <Col N="1146" /> Minister whether An Chomhairle could inspect premises and the Minister replied that it would not be part of their function. I fail to see how any body can give advice to the Minister and yet not be able to acquire knowledge themselves from experience which they themselves have of visiting other people in the same or allied businesses.</P>

      <P>On section 12, which sets up the wool council, the council is totally ineffective for what is required as a board, because the council as set up under this section has not the powers to give worthwhile assistance to the wool trade by means of stabilising prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say, perhaps, if the council will be able to relieve the Irish wool producer of being completely dependent on the Bradford sales and that it would embark on a sales campaign for the Irish <Col N="1147" /> farmers alone rather than for the clip being exported on an artificial price created in another country? I can see the problems arising for the Comhairle as time goes on, but the only effective remedy to my mind is to give them more power and authority. I realise that it is the Minister who will be responsible for the Bill and, therefore, to set up a complete wool marketing board at this stage, as we pointed out on Second Reading, is probably not possible in view of the enormous difficulties involved. Nevertheless, I think the Minister should not tie the hands of the council too early, and should give them more scope for the functions which they can perform to the great benefit of the wool trade in this country, especially in the marketing line, if they are to be free to find new markets for wool and encourage its greater use in this country as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that secondary to ensuring that the Irish farmers will be paid adequately for their produce, the most important work of the proposed council will be to promote the use of wool in this country. It would be no harm if the council adopted the wool mark, which I presume is international, ensuring that it is stamped on all articles of clothing. There must be many of the younger generation who have not or did not appreciate the quality of woollen garments because they may not have had them available to them on account of the fact that so many of the milliners and shopkeepers seemed to prefer to display for sale fabrics and clothing made from synthetic fibres. From that point of view I feel that we can use this council to put back on the market woollen material and woollen garments and ensure that the demand for wool will be maintained and increased. In this way I feel that it will have a very big direct effect on the demand for the wool of the Irish sheep.</P>

      <P>As regards this section on the functions of the council, it was held by the National Farmers Association in their submission on the Report of the Committee on Wool Improvement that the only solution <Col N="1148" /> was the creation of a full wool marketing board like the British Wool Marketing Board. Unless there is some hope that the present council will go on in a very few years to pinpoint the need for such a wool marketing board requiring that the council be dissolved in favour of the creation of the necessary board on a semi-State or co-operative basis, there is very little use in the present legislation. What the wool trade has called for is stabilisation of prices and the power to cope with rings.</P>
      <P>I cannot see why the Government have been so faint-hearted in their approach. After all, we have Bord Bainne doing its job on behalf of milk, we have stabilised prices for beet, wheat and some other crops, and wool, looked at in that context, is a very small item, indeed, on the national scale &mdash; with a total output of somewhere about £4 million to £5 million at most. The excellent headline given by the British Wool Marketing Board is not by any means a costly one. Over the past ten years it has cost about £3 million a year to the Exchequer for doing the job fully, including a very large research arm, for some 29,000,000 sheep as compared with our under 5,000,000. Therefore, taking it <i>pro rata</i> a proper marketing board would cost around half a million pounds a year. Surely that is not too much to stabilise such an important sector of our agricultural production, and a sector that is capable of very great improvement and development. I would ask that official thinking should be directed to regarding the present as a very interim arrangement, because it was on that basis that the representative of the National Farmers Association, Mr. John Callanan, signed this Report with the reservations that are stated quite clearly on page 36 of the Report &ldquo;whereas I still believe that the only ultimate solution is a complete marketing board, I am prepared to sign this report as a stepping stone to such a board, subject to the following reservations&rdquo;. I appeal to the Minister to get on with the complete job as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the functions assigned to the present limited council as outlined under section 13, these are rather of an advisory <Col N="1149" /> nature and carry no real punch in them. They have not gone any way towards meeting what would be required under the submissions on pages 24, 25 and 26 of this Report by the National Farmers Association and by the IAOS, compared with the British board, where its principal concern is to promote the wool industry, particularly in regard to marketing and scientific and industrial research in relation to wool and sheep with a view to improvements in quality and quantity and discovering new and improved methods of wool utilisation &mdash; in other words, modernising a sector of the economy and engaging in the necessary research work. This research work here is undertaken at present by the Agricultural Institute. I do not see any mention of it here unless, perhaps, in the next section about the additional vague powers which could possibly be used to undertake or sponsor research.</P>
    <P>The power asked could be used to assign some research responsibility to An Chomhairle but as constituted it is not capable of doing that. These have to be done. Research is properly the function of the Agricultural Institute and the utmost liaison and encouragement are necessary so that the Institute is enabled to get on with the job on the research level without being hampered by red tape or departmental pin-pricking as seems to be going on at present. I hope that does not continue to happen and that the Institute is left free to get on with the wonderful work it is doing. I shall leave my query to the next Session when I shall endeavour to find out how the Minister proposes to use the powers he is asking for in that section.</P>

      <P>I did not think that anything just stated now requires any comment from me. Senator Quinlan obviously has his own ideas. The proposed legislation does not meet with his approval nor does it do the job he thinks it should do. I believe it will do the job which requires to be done.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 14 (a) the Minister is given power to assign to An Chomhairle such additional functions relating to wool as he thinks fit. Does this involve something along the lines which I have quoted in connection with the British Wool Board? Will it involve research and could it be used to carry out under the Comhairle work that is at present being done by the Agricultural Institute or should be done by that Institute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no limitation, as the Senator will readily appreciate, on the functions I may assign under this legislation to the Wool Board. That is to say, if it was thought fit to assign research functions I may do so. What I think the Senator is overlooking is that I may at the moment direct An Foras Talúntais to do any research in regard to agricultural matters that I choose. It is obvious that I can have research done through the Institute, or by An Chomhairle in conjunction with the Institute, or by An Chomhairle without the Institute, if I so think fit, so that there is a complete opportunity of coverage in that and in anything else which may occur. There is no limit to the matters that may be assigned to them at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">

      <P>I agree that the Minister has that power. It was written into the Agricultural Institute Bill and I know there is grave concern at present that that power may be used to split our national agricultural effort. There is a tendency for the Minister's Department to do research work on its own that should more properly be done, and is being done, by the Agricultural Institute. I should hope in connection with sheep and wool that the present excellent work being done by the Agricultural Institute would be encouraged in every way possible and that the Minister would see to it that his Department does not try to engage in rival research.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not disagree with the principle of a levy in order to help finance the proposed council, I should like to ask the Minister if he can give us some idea of whether the levy will apply directly on the producer's sale to the buyers, that is, on the first part of the transaction. There is a certain amount of disappointment at the present time with regard to the increase in the levy on milk which is certainly being introduced at a most inopportune time having regard to the costings. I feel that unless we clarify this matter now before this Bill becomes an Act we will have misunderstandings and, perhaps, dissension among the various farming groups if a similar situation arose in a few years hence regarding the proposed wool levy. I feel also with the price of wool at such a low figure and having regard to the fact that it is not even one half the price per pound that it was a few years ago it is wrong to take further from that price by imposing a levy, as it is proposed, on the producers.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask a question in relation to subsection (3) which says: &ldquo;The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, amend or revoke a levy order or an order under this subsection&rdquo;. The levy in itself is obviously necessary, as subsection (1) says, for the purpose of defraying expenses in relation to the performance by An Chomhairle of its functions under this Bill. All the details relating to the levy seem to me justified but I am puzzled to know why the Minister wants power to cancel this levy just by his own order. I feel if the Comhairle with the consent of the Minister for Finance thinks the levy order necessary it is strange to give the Minister power to cancel it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that what we are inclined to get away from all the time here is that the Minister for Agriculture has certain responsibilities; this being one of them, he intends to hold on to it not because he wants to <Col N="1152" /> but because it is a responsibility which reposes in him. There would appear to be a belief that the Minister for Agriculture is responsible for nothing but for what goes wrong and, therefore, he should have no rights or responsibilities either for changing or revoking anything even if he were responsible for bringing about the situation. In this case a levy can and may be put on and unless we are satisfied that we will have it there forever, then obviously a method of amending or revoking it must be instituted. That is the power that is being taken here in subsection (3). Circumstances can change and I am sure the House will agree that where a levy, which was imposed this year, may turn out for various reasons to be quite inequitable in two or ten years from now we may wish to change it.</P>
      <P>I am merely taking the power there to revoke a levy already imposed and in operation which may have served its purpose so widely in use that it is no longer necessary or maybe the levy is such that it is either too high or too low and the circumstances have been such that we want to amend it by applying a higher levy or a lower levy, a wider or narrower range, if we see that this is the right thing to do. So, the power to amend or revoke the levy is there for that reason. If the levy has served well for a time and the circumstances alter, then the power to amend or revoke it must also be given. This is only what is being sought in this particular subsection.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister makes his case well. There is just a lingering doubt which remains for me. Has An Chomhairle any say in this matter? The Minister for Finance must be consulted. The Minister will go to the Comhairle. It is for the benefit of An Chomhairle in regard to the working of their duties but there is nothing in this section, as I read it, that gives them the power even to express an opinion as to whether the levy is right, whether it should be cancelled or amended. I wonder would the Minister consider at least giving them consultative status under this section in <Col N="1153" /> the same way as the Minister for Finance has been given that status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very great difference between the Minister for Finance and An Chomhairle. The purpose of the levies in whatever way they are applied is to defray the expenses of An Chomhairle. They will be spending the levy money to defray the expenses of carrying out their work. If their expenses were such that the levies do not meet the cost, or if there are no levies and still expenses, obviously the Minister for Finance is the only source from which the moneys can possibly come to defray those expenses. It is not a case that the Minister for Finance is being set apart in this sense.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>They will have, undoubtedly, to be consulted because the very existence of their operation will be in some way related to actual moneys made available for the operation of their functions and the levy subscription towards defraying their expenses. Costs will be very active in the minds of this Comhairle and their Minister, namely the Minister for Agriculture in this case. If the moneys received are not sufficient, they will have to go to the Minister for Finance. If An Chomhairle spend more money than they earn by way of levies the whole thing then devolves on the Minister for Finance and he is entitled to know whether we propose to alter the money basis on which our income may be coming in. If we alter it, it falls on the Minister for Finance and the Exchequer. This is basically why he must be here for this consultation and it is a very vital part of his responsibility in this regard, the same as it is in regard to any other Minister.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>To delete article 3 and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3. The period of office of An Chomhairle shall be five years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In moving these amendments we are concerned with the constitution of the council. Here we are told that the Bill merely takes the recommendations in the Report of the Committee on Wool Improvements whereas there is a most significant deviation from that in that the Report which on page 34, paragraph 137, said:</P>
      <P>The Committee considers that the most equitable arrangement would be a Council consisting of a Chairman, three representatives of producers, three representatives of wooltraders, two representatives of the Department of Agriculture, one representative of An Foras Talúntais and one representative of the IOAS.</P>
      <P>We find this self-same tendency, which is shown by the Minister in all his recent legislation, to say that he alone picks representatives: &ldquo;persons whom the Minister considers representative&rdquo;. This is very new. It is something we should fight against because it means that organisations are not given their proper place in national affairs. If organisations are on it, all they are concerned with is whatever is being done and the best way to do it. Whether it is education, agriculture or industry the organisations concerned should be entitled to nominate their own representatives to such councils or boards.</P>
      <P>It has not been done in the present case. I am proposing that the National Farmers Association nominate three members to represent the producers. There is no need to underline for Members of the Seanad the widespread support that the National Farmers Association has in this country. We had the most significant and most conclusive demonstration of that in the recent beetgrowers elections where they won 58 out of 60 seats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let no one suggest that the National Farmers Association are not a fully representative organisation completely in tune with the needs of modern agriculture. Indeed, if we wish to see more of their work we can examine their work that led up to the present developments in wool. It began in 1953, 15 years ago, when Macra na Feirme set up its wool committee.</P>
      <P>The evils that afflicted the wool trade were evident to those who led Macra na Feirme at that period. With their limited resources they did a remarkable job in making the wool producers conscious of the necessity for quality. They brought in payments on quality and their scheme was launched in 1954. On the inception of the National Farmers Association on that historic day, 6th January, 1955, the NFA took over responsibility for the wool scheme and since then they have conducted negotiations and sales with the Scottish Wool Buyers; they have kept the scheme going from strength to strength, and, in 1964, they formed the Irish Wool Producers Co-operative. All this has been excellent preparatory work on the problem of quality wool production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1955 they have been calling for the setting up of a wool board on which producers would have majority representation as the solution. That is a far cry from being given three out of eleven selected by the Minister from those he says are &ldquo;representative of the industry&rdquo;. If it appears strange to us here, where we pride ourselves as being a democracy, that producers should have some rights, why not look at England where the British Wool Board of 15 members have 12 nominated by the producers and three by the government? The middlemen only <Col N="1156" /> come in as agents of that board, but here the middlemen are given very substantial representation. I am not quarrelling with giving the middlemen some representation but I hope now the important national position of the NFA will be recognised and that even at this late stage we may see a magnanimous gesture from the Minister and that he will follow the example of the man whom he has met so often in the last two years, Mr. Peart of England, and openly recognise the National Farmers Association and have them nominate their members to the wool council.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is still worried as to whether the NFA represents the farmers, why not get agreement on having the wool producers registered like the beetgrowers and then in true democratic fashion through the ballot box, let them elect their representatives on the wool council. Let the wool producers elect their representatives on the council through the ballot box. That is the true democratic way, and there is no better testimony to the democratic structure of the NFA than the fact that they were able to say good-bye to a very distinguished person, a great leader, Mr. Deasy, when his term of office ended. They will likewise be able to relieve their present president, Mr. T.J. Maher, who is doing such tremendous unselfish and patriotic work, when his term of office ends in two years time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am appealing that the representatives elected to this council should have the full confidence of the industry concerned and I am showing that the NFA, in the way in which it is organised and in the manner in which it elects its own committees, has the full confidence of the producers and should be invited to nominate three members to the council. If there is to be a full wool board the Minister must look for national elections. All concerned with progressive agriculture in this country would welcome national elections. They have every confidence in them and in their future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other organisation which I ask should be represented on the council <Col N="1157" /> is the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society. There are a number of co-operatives linked with this including the Irish Wool Producers Co-operative formed by the NFA. The Minister may say that he will pick somebody from those co-operatives but that is not good enough. We believe that vocational groups should have representation in their own right. Whether in education, agriculture, industry or in labour relations we have to recognise the important and vital place of these vocational groups. The keystone of agricultural progress, the IAOS, should be given recognition here and they should be invited to nominate one member. We should rely on them to pick for the council a competent representative of the co-operative movement.</P>
    <P>I have asked that the Agricultural Institute should nominate a member. The report recommends that this organisation should nominate a member, just as it recommends that the IAOS should nominate a member. The Agricultural Institute has done much research work on improving the quality and quantity of Irish wool and it is not necessary to argue the case for the representation of the Institute on the council. If this was done the Minister would at least have begun to reverse the trend of endeavouring to take everything in under his own Department and of taking to himself the right to say who represents any particular organisation. I appeal to the House to recognise the fact that agriculture has spoken in the last two weeks, that the recognition that has been won by the trade unions from successive governments down through the years must now be given to the agricultural organisation if we are to really develop in 20th century fashion. Likewise, the reports on the co-operative movement into which we are pouring good money and which are just gathering dust on the bookshelves at present should be acted upon without delay. I am asking for one very minor concession and that is that one IAOS representative be appointed on this council.</P>
    <P>Finally, we in this House stand behind the Agricultural Institute and appreciate the great work they have <Col N="1158" /> done, the obstacles they have overcome, and we recognise that they have a major contribution to make to the output of the wool industry in this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment No. 5 is to delete article 3 of the Schedule. This says that the Minister may at any time remove a member of An Chomhairle from office. At the present stage of farming and departmental relationships in agriculture, I feel this is a regrettable clause in the Schedule. It would appear to most people that this is a big stick the Minister has to wave over the members of the proposed Comhairle, who, perhaps, for one reason or another, refuse to act as, perhaps, the Minister and the Department wish a member to act. Even if it is only in the interest of harmony and co-operation, I cannot see the upset it will cause if the Minister accepts this amendment.</P>
      <P>A person whom the Minister would deem to qualify to serve on the proposed council will be a man big enough to hold that office and to serve it well. The only reason I can envisage whereby a member should be removed from office is if his views are diametrically opposed to those of the Minister. This is regrettable and, even if it is only a suspicion, I feel that over the past few years events would give fair ground for any suspicion of this kind. I would appeal to the Minister to make every effort to restore co-operation and goodwill to the ranks of Irish farming and Irish agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear, and we anticipate that at some future date, perhaps sooner than we may realise, we may gain entry to the Common Market of Europe. If there is one thing Irish agriculture will need it is co-operation in every sense and if our Irish farmers are to have any chance the Minister must use every effort at his disposal to re-introduce and create harmony between the different <Col N="1159" /> agricultural organisations and his Department. I feel that this can best be done if the Minister brings together representatives of the various sectors of wool producers in the country. I think the Minister now has a great opportunity of ensuring that not only the hill farmers but the farmers in the plains and in the midlands with the Combined Mountain Sheep Farmers Association and the Wool Committee of the NFA should be asked to nominate people whom they consider to be eminently and suitably equipped with sufficient knowledge to serve on this council in the national interest to the best of their ability.</P>
    <P>I should like to impress on the Minister and on the Department of Agriculture the serious situation wherein sheep farmers find themselves at this time when the price per pound of wool paid to them is only something in the region of 2/6, whereas five or six years ago it was 5/- and over per lb.</P>
    <P>On top of this, in this Bill provision is made to impose a levy on the wool producer which will go even further to reduce the income of farmers from their wool crop. The Minister has a wonderful opportunity here now to demonstrate in a very practical way his desire for full co-operation in every sense of the word between the various interests concerned in the production of wool. I feel, and I believe, the Minister will be man enough to bury the axes that have been ground over the past months and try to unite the various groups to help in a truly national job and ensure the best possible advantage to the Irish farmers under the guidance of this proposed council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendments by Senators Quinlan and McDonald. I think a very strong case has been made by both Senators for An Chomhairle which will not only be representative of the producers and the wool trade but will be clearly and publicly seen to be representative. I mentioned on Second Stage already that I was dissatisfied with this sixth subsection of the Schedule. It reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> Of the ordinary members of An Chomhairle&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) not less than three shall be persons each of whom the Minister considers representative of wool producers, and</P>
    <P>(b) not less than three shall be persons each of whom the Minister considers representative of the wool trade.</P>
    <P>I do not feel that the Minister is doing himself justice in demanding that power should be given to him to be the sole decider as to the representative character of the members of An Chomhairle among the wool producers and the members of An Chomhairle among members of the wool trade. It is not fair to the Minister and it is not fair to the appointed representatives. I think we must assume that the Minister is not getting as his main aim here merely yes-men on the council.</P>
    <P>To be fair to the Minister, I have envisaged his desiring people who will be prepared, if necessary, to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to a ministerial proposal, who will be prepared to stand up to him and take an independent line. I take it he does not want people, as has been defined elsewhere, of tremendous personality who will do exactly what they are told. If I am right in assuming the Minister wants people of independent mind and truly representative people, then I think he must tell the House why it is he wants to reserve to himself the right to select them.</P>
    <P>It would seem normal that one would ask the organisations, the associations, the co-operatives of wool producers to do their own selection of representatives, and it seems very odd to me to say that their representatives shall be merely people each of whom the Minister considers representative. &ldquo;Considers representative&rdquo; in a sense gives away the case. It is not demanded that they shall be representative but merely that the Minister shall so consider them. He weakens his own position, his own authority, by asking for excessive powers under the Schedule.</P>
    <P>Attention has already been drawn by Senator Quinlan to the report of the Committee on Wool Improvements which was brought in in 1966, the <Col N="1161" /> actual date being 21st April, 1966. It is a very careful document and, as has been pointed out by Senator Quinlan, paragraph 137 reads:</P>
    <P>The constitution of such a Wool Council&mdash;</P>
    <P>being An Chomhairle Olla as under the Bill&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;presented some difficulty to produce and delayed members of the Committee. On the whole, however, the Committee considers that the most equitable arrangement would be a council consisting of a chairman, three representatives of the producers, three representatives of the wool traders&mdash;merchants, exporters, manufacturers&mdash;two representatives of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, one representative of An Foras Talúntais and one representative of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society.</P>
    <P>That is a pretty clear paragraph, a clear recommendation, and I think many Members of the House will feel that it would have been far better honoured and realised by the Minister if we had a section of the Schedule which he has put forward on the lines proposed by the amendment put forward by Senator Quinlan in which three members of the Comhairle would be appointed by the NFA, one by the IAOS, one by the Agricultural Institute and four by the Minister. There is no doubt in my mind that the council members, whether as individuals or organised in societies, will not be satisfied that the best person to decide who among their members is most fully representative of them is the Minister. I do not think that will be accepted and I do not think the Minister is doing himself justice in asking us to accept that.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan referred to the reelection of the Beetgrowers Association and Senator Ó Maoláin, for reasons best known to himself, drew attention to the fact that this was held under the so-called straight vote system. That is true and in so far as it was under the so-called straight vote system it was manifestly unjust because I believe that people who had the support of about 30 per cent of the voters got only two seats out of 60. I do not know whether <Col N="1162" /> Senator Ó Maoláin was desirous of drawing attention to the basic injustice of the manner of voting when he interjected twice that the election was held under the so-called straight vote system. However we look at it, we must realise that the NFA and their candidates had a major victory.</P>
    <P>This may be distasteful to the Minister. It may be distasteful to the Government, but I think enough of the Minister to credit him with not allowing personal animosity in any way to affect his outlook in looking at the result of that election. I credit him with the capacity to see that the NFA are a force in the land and on the land and that the Government must make up their minds to co-operate fully with them. Therefore, for that purpose, and not only in relation to the NFA but to the other organisations mentioned in Senator Quinlan's amendment, I urge very strongly on the Minister to accept the amendments or on the House to vote them in even if the Minister is not prepared to concede that they are as just as they seem to me to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">

      <P>I support the amendments in relation to the appointment of the Comhairle. The Minister, I am quite sure, is as anxious as everybody else to see that the Comhairle will get away to a good start and that it will represent all the sections of the farming industry, particularly the wool-producing industry. If the Minister had spelled out the membership of An Chomhairle in the Bill it could have been discussed freely here and in the Dáil and recommendations could have been made on it. Instead, we are told that not fewer than three shall be milk producers. Seeing that this is in the Bill and that in all probability it will remain in it, I request the Minister to give to the farming organisations the right to fill these three or more positions. It would create greater confidence in the Comhairle by the producers themselves and it would prevent what is bound to happen&mdash;that as soon as the Minister makes his appointments someone will say: &ldquo;Jobs for the boys.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members may be the best that the Minister knows of, the most suitable <Col N="1163" /> members, but the agricultural organisations, especially the NFA, who have a wool committee, a sheep committee, will understand the producers' problems better than anyone. If they are given the right to nominate to the producers' panel on this council, it will create greater confidence in the council which can then get on to a good start. If such a body are to start badly it will take a long time to pick up afterwards.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the co-operatives represented. They play a very important part in the agricultural life of the country. Senators will have seen in the daily press the report that last week a Czech buyer came here looking for wool and that he was told there was not any to be got, or at least that he went away empty-handed, though there was one co-operative who could have supplied him with the amount and the type of wool he required. They are just my reflections on the amendments. If the Minister would, even at this late stage, be big enough to say: &ldquo;Right, we will give those farming organisations the right to nominate to membership of the board,&rdquo; he would be creating greater confidence in the body which would then go from strength to strength.</P>

      <P>Senator McDonald made it clear that the price of wool is now about half what it was a year ago, and yet we are told that the only thing to do is to return to the same kind of marketing arrangements which were engaged upon 15 years ago by Macra na Feirme and then on the great historic date of the 6th January, 1955 taken over by the National Farmers Association. One would gather that this should have gone apace during the 13 years since then, but according to Senator McDonald and others who know something about wool and have practical sense they are realistic enough to come into the House and say that the price of wool is certainly not as good as last year and that it is not half what it was some years ago. We are bringing in this Comhairle under this Bill to try to do a job which, with all due respect to the organisations Senator Quinlan talked about, have not succeeded in doing despite the fact that they started 15 years ago, and conditions have got worse rather than better. With that as the background one does begin to wonder what all this talk is about having certain people or organisations given the right and democracy invoked as a cause that this should be bestowed on certain organisations. Do we want to aid these organisations or do we want to improve the prices for wool for those who produce it, or do they want the honour and glory of being represented on a board as of right whether, in fact, it will mean a better or a worse board? It is the result that matters, and this is the question that I have asked myself coming to this House and to the Dáil with this Bill&mdash;how to get the best machinery available to improve and increase production, to get better prices for the farmers for wool, and I am not one bit concerned who takes the credit or who does not. I could not care less so long as the producer gets the money.</P>

Other Senators have made more pointed remarks here that one might take more seriously though I would say that they have been particularly misleading. The question of putting certain organisations in a position to nominate people does not make this board one bit better, and I thought that it was very significant that Senator Sheehy Skeffington wound up, whether unwittingly or otherwise, and said that the Government should endeavour to co-operate with the NFA. This seems to be the state and the stage we have reached apparently with people like Senator Sheehy Skeffington who are beginning to talk and, in fact, to think in this way at the moment&mdash;that the Government and other agencies should, in fact, co-operate, and that there is no question that the NFA and others like them should co-operate with the Government. This does not seem to enter the picture any more. It is an absolutely staggering situation, with this sort of attitude not only in the minds of people but expressed by them solemnly as it has been expressed here by Senator Sheehy Skeffington, wittingly or unwittingly, I hope unwittingly. He is not given to expressing opinions unwittingly, according to my knowledge and experience here in this House.</P>

The point is that I do not intend on this amendment, which was not moved though it was discussed here, amendment No. 4&mdash;I want to say about amendment No. 4 that it is a completely unnecessary amendment, and as I do not believe in doing unnecessary things it would, therefore, be rather silly to accept it, and I am asking the House to reject it. As far as amendment No. 5 is concerned it was Senator McDonald who talked on this particular amendment and proposed that we should accept it. He seemed to think that there was merit in the suggestion that the Minister should not have the power to remove the chairman of An Chomhairle or any member from the date of appointment until the due date of their retirement. I feel on this particular matter that the power to put on people must automatically involve responsibility for having the power to take them off. This is a clear fact. If one accepts the responsibility <Col N="1167" /> for putting them on, surely if for any reason they are no longer performing the job they were put on to do there should be power to take them off.</P>

      <P>What I am attempting to do is to get an instrument whereby more wool can be produced, its presentation can be upgraded, its value can be enhanced and the markets extended, and I am sure that this House would assist me in doing this and setting up this organisation under this legislation. I do not think that anything can be more reasonable than that. Those who have criticised me on my approach to this should have the decency to recognise that this is the purpose of this measure, and that it is not, as one would gather from listening to some of those who have spoken against parts of this Bill, that the whole exercise here by this measure was to kill the wool trade, to put the sheep producers out of business and to put the farmers out of production. This is what one would gather was intended by this Bill. This is what it would appear to be from listening to the wanderings and the meanderings here upon sections of this measure. The fact is that, as I have said, this is for the benefit of the sheep and wool producers of this country and that it comes at a time when it is, indeed, regarded by some as being too long delayed, and it comes long years after all of these Messiahs have had their try for years, during which they have been trying to do a job that it is now admitted has not been well done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>From the reply given by the Minister I do not intend to join issue with him in relation to the amazing deduction he made. A case is not proved by indulging in extravagance. I was amazed to hear the Minister's reflections on voluntary effort in this country at a time when all reasonable thinking people realise that it is only by working together, both in voluntary organisations and with the Government, that we can really achieve our aims in the decade ahead, our aims of full employment and better educational facilities, aims which call for more and better production from our industries and especially from our major industry, agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> Let us see how unfair the Minister has been in his reflection on voluntary effort. He could not for one moment claim that a voluntary committee could have the resources either in personnel or in finance to cope with the problem involved and, indeed, neither have they the statutory requirements to enforce the grading and the other licensing requirements. Like any other voluntary group setting out, they saw a problem and did the pioneering work, bringing it as far as they could bring it and they called for the necessary legislation and the necessary organisation to do the job. That is the democratic way. It is the way that is recognised in every country west and, indeed, east, of the Iron Curtain. I am sure they would recognise such voluntary efforts just as well. Here, however, such efforts are only derided and scorned with the idea that they failed to do the job, that they were responsible for the drop in prices. The Minister says he never heard such nonsense before. The fact is that prices are subject to international markets and international fluctuations. These are the greatest headaches in the marketing of all agricultural products.</P>
    <P>To think that this voluntary committee of people giving of their time unpaid, often travelling at their own expense and spending many days at its wool collection centres to aid their fellow farmers are now accused of being responsible for decreasing the price of wool is shocking. If that is the mentality of the Minister I appeal to him, as I appealed to him the last day, to do his greatest service for Irish agriculture to leave this Ministry. There are half a dozen in the Fianna Fáil Party who could make a success of it, who have some idea of co-operation. Surely the purpose of the Government is to foster co-operation with groups and when this country was threatened with its most severe economic crisis of foot and mouth disease some nine months ago the NFA offered their resources on a voluntary basis to help in every way in preventing the disease coming in but they were just brushed aside.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that the Minister can meet his counterparts from England and from the Common Market countries <Col N="1170" /> with such a record of bad relations with the farming organisations. Would he please do the service I have asked? There is a good pension scheme now for retired Ministers. The Minister for Finance pointed to its advantages. Would he please take this pension and let some co-operator come in?</P>
    <P>On the point of co-operation, it is interesting to note that these voluntary bodies were brought together by Macra na Feirme in 1953. The conference held on 3rd May of that year in Ballinasloe was unanimous in proposing that a wool marketing organisation be set up. It was agreed that such an organisation should be controlled by a board consisting of Macra na Feirme, the IAOS, the Department of Agriculture and Córas Tráchtála. In other words, it was recognised that each of those had a role to play and there was full acceptance that voluntary organisations be represented on the council but when we put this up we are just simply derided. We are told that we just do not know what we are talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take the Minister up on one point. He said I was not consistent when speaking on the price of wool and quality of wool. The work and the activity of Macra na Feirme, in particular, in organising sheep-shearing competitions which train farmers' sons and daughters in the correct method of shearing sheep, handling fleeces, and rolling them up, has improved the quality of wool in a very definite manner. I cannot see why he can blame that organisation and their activities on the desperately low and bad prices people have been getting in the past year for their wool. <Col N="1172" /> I cannot see the Minister's right or any Minister's right in appointing any board in keeping certain people out. Surely the Minister must accept if he appoints an individual on a board that that board will have the benefit of that individual's views and of his thoughts on any particular subject. If the Minister appoints a representative of a specialist body dealing in a specific commodity such a man will come in armed with much wider views, and the views of a body or an organisation who have applied their mind to the problems will affect the particular business of the proposed board.</P>
      <P>Surely you have in this country sufficient specialised vocational bodies. When people who are interested in improving the standing, the activities and the livelihood of their fellow members give their time voluntarily, surely the Minister could come along and pick even one of his own supporters&mdash;surely there must be at least one Fianna Fáil man to whom the Minister can say: &ldquo;Here, will you act on that board?&rdquo; At least, no matter what Party that man represents or supports, you will be putting him in there knowing he has at his command and his disposal the views of a number of other people who are specifically interested in the production of wool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Minister should continue bickering with these organisations. It is true that the NFA is a large representative organisation and if the President of the NFA recommended one of his 100,000 members as being a suitably-equipped man to serve on this board, one would imagine that any fair-minded Minister would accept a man from such a well-organised body who have an excellent secretariat and who would be able to assemble the views from the various parts of the country. All we are asking in those amendments is that the Minister should avail, through the co-operation of the many voluntary agencies which exist, of the people who have been trying for years, voluntarily, and certainly not as successfully as we would wish, to improve the position and lot of Irish farmers, the only section of the community who year in, year out are forced to accept a lower <Col N="1173" /> standard of living. They have this year received a record low price for wool, taking the last ten years. Despite this the Minister introduces a levy on the price of wool which will bring it down still further.</P>
    <P>It is poor compensation for those people to know that the Minister wants for some particular reason or other to engage in this battle of wits where people are either expected to opt for one organisation or another. After all, the Minister must accept that a person who has at his disposal the views of the majority of people actively engaged in this particular line of agricultural production would be of some benefit to the proposed council. Then, again, the Minister has at his disposal 27 sheep-dipping committees. Their function is small but I venture to say that out of the 27 committees the Minister could get 27 men to pick from who have flocks of sheep from a half dozen up to several hundred or more who have in the past reared sheep and their generations before them have done the same. Here again, the Minister has an opportunity of selecting people with expert knowledge. Yet, he will give no indication, good, bad or indifferent of the type of people he wishes to put on this board. I feel the Minister should avail of this opportunity to reintroduce into Irish agriculture, even in this small way, and dealing with this small commodity, the important principle of co-operation.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister should endeavour to help Irish farmers to improve their lot. I would not blame the Minister for everything because in every row you must have two sides, and I do not wish to get involved. But unless the Minister recognises the facts and avails of the enormous amount of talent we have and is big enough to pick people who are best suited for the purpose of this board, it will not succeed. Perhaps the Minister would give the matter a second thought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>I had rather hoped that when the Minister came into this House to deal with this Bill he would have benefited from his experience in the Department of Agriculture, that his bitterness against voluntary rural organisations had died and that he would <Col N="1174" /> have at long last shown that proper co-operation will get you much further than the iron heel and the mailed fist which will not get him anywhere.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that that attitude still prevails in the Minister's mind. It is a sorry day for Irish agriculture that we have in charge of the most important Department in the State a man who will wield only the iron hand and the iron fist. When I was speaking about the Czech buyer who came here and could not buy any wool I was quoting from the <i>Irish Press</i> of 3rd July, 1968, which stated that a prominent wool buyer had told him that there was no wool available. He said the wool was there all right but they could not lay their hands on it. I am sure the Department of Agriculture should have been able to help there.</P>

      <P>Senator McDonald has instanced all sorts of people whom he would like to see on this Comhairle. This debate was led off very badly by Senator Quinlan for the reason that he was not talking about the Bill or the amendment but about his pet organisations. However, Senator McDonald has been putting forward a reasonable case and one that is not inconsistent with the Bill as it stands. What the Senator has been advocating is not inconsistent with the Bill as suggested and proposed to the House but the arguments put forward have so obscured what is in the Bill as to make it appear that what Senator McDonald advocates is not capable of being done under the Bill. It is capable of being done and in all probability will be done in a number of the cases mentioned.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7, inclusive, not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In article 6 (a) to delete &ldquo;three&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;four&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister intimated some time ago that it was possible to do some of the things I advocated earlier. If he does not accept this amendment, no matter how he wishes, it will curtail his opportunity to have as many representatives of agricultural organisations as he otherwise could. It is an undisputed fact that by far the greatest number of persons interested in the wool trade are the sheep farmers. Therefore, a minimum of three representatives of sheep farmers is not enough to give them fair representation and I suggest in the amendment that not fewer than four persons, each of whom the Minister considers representative of wool producers, should be appointed.</P>
      <P>It is imperative that any wool council must have the views of sheep farmers available to them&mdash;the views of a cross-section of the farmers. Anyone who knows anything about Irish agriculture will agree that techniques in the wool-producing industry vary greatly from county to county. If the Minister really wishes to be in a position to get this council to help every section of the sheep farmers, he must be able to have on the council members who represent sheep farmers. He would need, shall we say, to have someone representative of the lowland sheep farmers. There are very important people among the producers who buy in sheep and fatten them in the autumn and during the winter. They contribute to the general economy in different ways. What might suit one group of sheep farmers might not suit another. The phraseology of paragraph (a) of the subsection states &ldquo;not less than three&rdquo;. It would be a minimum rather than a maximum and I should like to have the assurance of the Minister that at least four representatives of the farmers will be appointed.</P>
      <P>In paragraph (b) of the subsection the Minister provides that not fewer than three persons, each of whom the Minister considers to be representative of the wool trade, shall be appointed. I suggest that numerically there are fewer people in the wool trade than there are farmers and, therefore, if we are to use proportional representation, which I suggest we should, the farmers should have the stronger voice. Figures will prove that the number of people in the wool trade has decreased during the years.</P>
      <P>There is need, therefore, to have at least four farmers on the council and I cannot see that acceptance of this amendment will take from the Minister's scheme in any way. Indeed, it will ensure that each community of sheep farmers will be represented. One cannot, for instance, compare the problems of Donegal sheep farmers with those of farmers in Laois, in Carlow or in Wick-low. The husbandry in these areas varies widely. The Galway producers with their distinctive breed are entitled to specific representation and then the has not missed the provision in the mountain sheep farmers have their own association, a small vocational group on their own, their strongest area being County Mayo. They can have strong views on the problems and have a lot to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Senator has not missed the provision in the <Col N="1179" /> subsection which states &ldquo;not less than three&rdquo; representatives of the wool producers and &ldquo;not less than three&rdquo; of the trade. This does not indicate that not more than three may be appointed. In addition, &ldquo;not less than three&rdquo; in either case is in conformity with the general recommendation of the Committee on Wool Improvements. I do not think there is any particular need for the amendment. I do not think it would be wise and sensible to assure the Senator that there will be not fewer than four. We are providing there cannot be fewer than three but further than that I do not think we should bind ourselves. Though, numerically speaking, there is the matter of comparison between the producers and the number of people in the trade, there is no doubt that there is no comparison numerically between the people the board will bring into play&mdash;the usefulness of the trade not only in the purchase but in the sale of wool at the best possible prices, whether at home or abroad. Therefore, it will be essential to have in this council people from the trade who will be knowledgeable of the trade, who will be useful in the trade and who, above all, will be able to contribute to the deliberations of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say in this respect that whether it be on behalf of the producers or the traders it is not quite the volume of sound that can be created by a greater number of voices on a board such as this that would count. What those who are talking about on such a board, having the say and the experience from which the talk comes, is really of the essence. In naming three from each there is an effort within a board of limited size, which from a practical point of view must be limited, otherwise it becomes an unworkable piece of machinery&mdash; but within the limited size we envisage at the moment that by ensuring that not fewer than three of each of these very vital interests in this matter are on it, there will be drawn from that not fewer than three of each a wide variety of experience and knowledge whether in the buying and selling, the trading and exporting abroad by the trader element <Col N="1180" /> or in the production, handling, disposal and breeding of the sheep, from which, and from the fact that three is the minimum, we will ensure that the best and broadest sort of knowledge that could be wished for will be assured.</P>
    <P>Whether that may be added to by taking another one or two of each group is a matter that only time will dictate with the setting up of the actual board and its membership, envisaging that this particular one would be available to them and would be likely to contribute from the variety of his experience and his knowledge from the producer's point of view on types of breeds of sheep about which he may have knowledge and of the parts of the country or the practices in production there as well, and we will get a very great variety of producers. Having not fewer than three ensures that we will be fairly well served there, but it does not mean we will have less. We may have four, or, indeed, we could have five if circumstances so indicated that the total knowledge we wanted could only be contributed by adding another. This could only be considered in the actual circumstances of the appointment of the board membership.</P>
    <P>If we leave it as it stands we ensure that the minimum will not fall below three, but we are free to add to it if we feel that it is in the best interests of the board as a whole and its obligations to appoint more. For that reason I would suggest to Senator McDonald that he should not press this matter to the degree that he might. On the one hand he should consider this in the knowledge that this three is not absolute by any means but is there as a minimum of the two great interests on either side, and that it may be added to if the calibre and experience of the people envisaged does not seem sufficient, and we may find a fourth or fifth and that it would be a pity to be without them. At that point we could decide that we will move somebody else and put one more on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, perhaps, unwittingly has made quite a case for my amendment. What I want in this amendment is a guarantee that the producers will be adequately represented. <Col N="1181" /> No one in his sane mind would suggest that Irish farmers keep sheep for the sole purpose of producing wool, because it is not economically possible to do that. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that some representation be given to the views of the various pedigree breeders associations, and we have two or three excellent ones in the country for many years. These people have engaged in upgrading the standard of Irish sheep in no uncertain way. Surely even the Minister will accept that these people are bound to have constructive views to offer. One need only go to any of the Irish provincial shows, leaving the RDS out, to see the quality of the various breeds. As I have said before, the Minister has a wealth of experts in this field from which to draw.</P>
      <P>What I strive to do in this amendment is to ensure that the producers, who are the majority of the people concerned, will have fair, adequate and strong representation, and that every section will be well represented. This board, surely, if it is going to be successful must have at least one breeder of the pedigree breeds of sheep. Such a person is not very difficult to find in this country. You have many hundreds of them, and you must have a man such as that on the board. On the other hand, you must have the people with the expert knowledge of mountain sheep, someone from one of the mountain areas who has to exist solely on the sheep. Surely they are entitled to representation. On the other hand, getting back to a distasteful subject, you have the large NFA who have a sheep committee, and whoever they would nominate, or one of their members, would have something constructive to do to help in this entire project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My only interest is that the farmers should at this late stage get a fair crack of the whip and that their economy would be improved to some degree at least. Unless we write into the Bill that at least four members shall be from the farming community, I feel that they can be more or less outvoted or, perhaps, their voices will not be strong enough to ensure adequate protection for the Irish farmers. <Col N="1182" /> If the Minister allows that to happen people will have very little confidence in the board. Four out of 11, even if it be a minimum number, is certainly far from a majority. Having regard to the great differences in the personnel in the many different sectors of sheep farming, it is imperative to give them all a fair crack of the whip. We must have at least four members. There are certainly more than four categories. A minimum of four at all times on the committees is the very least that one can contemplate and that would be providing for just one of the pedigree sheep associations. I can assure the Minister, and I defy contradiction, that any farmer who has pedigree livestock, whether it is sheep or cattle or horses, has such knowledge that there is no one who can tell him anything about the particular animals he has, because you find these people talk about nothing else. They really live for their animals, the way they groom them and produce them. Surely any board that would not get energetic representatives of one of the pedigree sheep breeders associations could not survive very long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Senator McDonald on this. I have no real confidence in the Minister selecting the representatives in this way. At least it should be shown that the producers are considered more important than the representatives of the wool trade. The wool trade is adequately served by three, as recommended in the commission report. They actually segregated the three because of the three natural divisions, dealers, manufacturers and exporters. It should be recognised that the producers should be entitled to more than those, and we should take the fine example of the Wool Marketing Board in England where out of a board of 15 the producers actually appoint 12 members. The Government appoint three and there is no talk about the manufacturers or merchants, who are merely acting as agents for the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the present case the Minister should at least show token recognition that the primary producers are the most important people associated with the wool trade. I should hope <Col N="1183" /> that the Minister will bring in an amendment on Report Stage next week, even though he uses the same collective formula as here, to the effect that he will appoint at least one member whom he considers representative of the IAOS and at least one member whom the Minister considers representative of An Foras Talúntais.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a fundamental factor. The Minister must accept that the wool trade is secondary to the production of sheep. There are hundreds of farmers in this country in mountain regions living solely from their income from sheep. The Minister is not being fair to them. He is not giving them moral support by ensuring they will be adequately represented. The only way I can be reassured is by the Minister making adequate minimum provision, and I can see little difficulty in ensuring that at least four representatives <Col N="1184" /> be appointed. With fewer than four it would be impossible, in my view, to ensure adequate representation for each sector engaged in the production of sheep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the difficulty of the adequacy and fairness of representation as to the various breeds of sheep, undoubtedly if one was to follow that line and the line mentioned earlier when it was said there were 27 county sheep-dipping committees we could envisage true representation of 70-80. I do not propose, and I think the House will fully agree, it is not even to be contemplated. Having got that far, we are down to the practical difficulty of incorporating within a relatively small board all interests to the greatest degree possible. While the difficulty may or may not emerge, there are as knowledgeable people in sheep rearing today as there have been in the past and will be in the future, who know a great deal about several varieties of sheep. They are not just one-trackers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is about the pedigree breeders. One might ask which of the pedigree should we have. If we have one rather than another it will be regarded as a slight on the other breed, or one up for the breed represented on the board. Is this a great thing for the sheep rearers in the country as distinct from the pedigree breeders? There is something else which must be looked at and which the board members will appreciate fully. I do not anticipate and I would be very loath to think of decisions in regard to the functions of this board being taken by vote. This is not the way these boards operate and certainly not the way we hope this board will operate. This brings us to the point of getting interests from the organisations on the board. To whom, if they are put on by the organisations, do they owe allegiance? Is it to the organisation or to the board on which they are asked to serve? I assert that this is a very good question. I have my own view as to what the answer must <Col N="1185" /> be. We have had experience of this in the past, and we do know from this experience that it is likely to be a more harmonious board working together in a co-operative way which Senator Quinlan likes to talk about, with an common end in view, approaching in the best way they can to attain that end, giving and taking a little as they go along rather than coming in if they are a representative section of the organisation with a viewpoint determined for them, not as to their own best knowledge and interest, but by a general consensus of opinion that may, in fact, represent nothing good for anyone. They are stuck with a viewpoint and they may not depart from these views even after a discussion. Another member well qualified in a particular aspect of the board advances good arguments to change the view of the men, full of the enthusiasm for the line that has been given to them by their own organisation. He is not free to go on that because he is already committed to instructions not representative of his own knowledge. He could be regarded as representing a consensus of opinion which in many respects, as all of us know, represents nobody's opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that sense I do not see the great good that can come from this idea that we will have a group of people that will hold the same sort of view, so that if and when a time comes when they are voting in a particular way they will vote as a bloc. I should hate to think this board would operate on that basis. That is not the way a board can operate, whether it be a semi-State board or private business. It is not the way that a successful board ever operates. Such a board would not long remain a very successful board. I feel that too much emphasis is being placed by Senator McDonald on the numbers that will be written into this particular measure here. He says &ldquo;three&rdquo;. We say &ldquo;not less than three&rdquo; and all I can say to Senator McDonald is that I as Minister, or any other Minister who may come to operate this particular measure in the future, will be fully conscious of these various interests. If this requires four representatives being appointed on <Col N="1186" /> this particular board, or three at another time, or five at another time, depending on what is available to the Minister, the Minister of the day will obviously have to balance one thing against another. He may have three, four or five, but not less than three. This is really what we are doing. That Schedule might well have been constituted without mentioning numbers.</P>
    <P>We have come to the point of saying not less than three. This is an assurance beyond which I do not think it is wise to go. Coming to this board, the first board, or any subsequent board, I think the best way the Senator can be fully satisfied is by being assured that whatever Minister or interests come to operate this particular part of the Schedule in the future all of this I can foresee will be in the mind of the Minister, his officials and his advisers, in selecting people where they can and the knowledge they have on it would be in the best interest of a board whose primary business is for the very benefit of the producers Senator McDonald is talking about. Remember, the traders will be on this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 of the Schedule as laid out has this grotesque business through which the only person capable of deciding who shall represent the wool producers is the Minister&mdash;that only those appointed shall be so appointed because the Minister considers them to be representative. On Committee Stage, the Minister rejected our proposal that there should be, as in any democratic body, in any democratically constituted Parliament, direct nomination to this council. This phrase is less grotesque when applied to two other bodies that should be represented on the council&mdash;when applied to the IAOS and the Agricultural Institute.</P>
      <P>The range of representatives from which the Minister could select from such organisations is very limited and it would have to refer to people very prominent in those organisations. Consequently, even at this eleventh hour, it would be a considerable improvement in the Bill if the Minister accepted that such organisations should be represented by rights even if they are to be selected by the Minister. This is in accordance with the Report of the Committee on Wool Improvements from which the Minister quoted so extensively. It is in accordance with paragraph 137, page 34, of the Report in which the committee envisaged and recommended that the council, in addition to representatives of the producers and the traders, that there should also be one representative of An Foras Talúntais and one from the IAOS, plus two from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not go all the way with the report in that we do not see any reason why the Department should be entitled to two representatives, but we readily concede the Department the same representation as we propose for the IAOS and the Agricultural Institute. That is the only departure we are making from the committee. It is hardly necessary to argue the need for having such bodies represented on the council because the whole future of <Col N="1192" /> Irish agriculture depends on the fullest possible development of the co-operative movement. It is sad to think that we, who pioneered the agricultural co-operative movement through the work of such great Irishmen as Father Finlay and Horace Plunkett&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have never heard of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;should sit back and let the rest of the agricultural world get ahead with the fullest development and adaptation of the co-operative movement. We have lagged considerably behind, apart from the great recent development in the co-operative marts and the great boon they have been to the country at large. Now is the time to redirect our agricultural policies into the path of the co-operative and, indeed, the spirit of the co-operative because that is what is needed more than anything else.</P>
      <P>At present you have the Irish Wool Traders Co-Operative set up by the NFA in 1964, and also some co-operative societies handling wool, and many more could be got into this. Consequently, it is not necessary to take up the time of the House in arguing the necessity of having the IAOS fully represented on it. The Committee on Wool Improvements did not see that it was necessary to argue this. They just merely put down what was to them a self-evident fact. The same applies to the Agricultural Institute because it is charged with research and development in Irish agriculture. Wool is just one facet of that, and wool development is, of course, in association with the sheep industry generally interwoven into the family farm picture. Consequently, again the necessity for an overall approach on this is absolutely self-evident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, if we look at the English Wool Board, which provides the ideal to which we should try to aim in our development in this country, we find on page 22 that the very first statement of the principal concern of the Wool Board is with the wool industry, particularly in regard to markets, scientific and industrial research in relation to wool and sheep with a view to improvements <Col N="1193" /> in quality and quantity&mdash;in other words, research is right in at the very foundation as one of the chief tasks of the English Wool Board. The other task of stabilising prices and so on is secondary. The first is to produce the quality product and to cut costs of production.</P>
    <P>That is where the Agricultural Institute comes in. Indeed, it is not a case of it coming in, for it is in the sheep business in general just as it is in all other forms of agricultural production. Already it has a spectacular list of successes in research in sheep husbandry. Therefore, it is right and proper that it should be recognised&mdash; not, indeed, that recognising it in this way is any honour to it&mdash;but it is a necessity to ensure that the wool committee or council is in close touch with research and that we should have this indispensable link between the two.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to be aware that in the past year or two apparently relations are not what they should be between the Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Institute. It is only right and proper that that should be faced. This House and the Oireachtas charged the Agricultural Institute with doing a job, and we applaud the way they have done that job, and demand that they be given every encouragement to go ahead with it. We do not want unnecessary duplication or unnecessary pinpricking by the Department of the Agricultural Institute. I think you should extend this invitation to the Institute to try to put one of their leading members, one in charge of the sheep section and sheep development, at the disposal of this wool council so that you will have a really effective organisation.</P>
    <P>To show that our proposals here are in every way balanced, as they should be, we acknowledge the position of the Department of Agriculture and the relationship between the regulations and so on and the wool council. As recommended in this amendment, the Department of Agriculture should be represented, but we differ in that we do not see why the Department of Agriculture should have more representation than the IAOS or An Foras Talúntais, but we give them equal <Col N="1194" /> representation. We use the same phrase, that it shall be somebody whom the Minister considers representative of his Department. We are not altogether tying him to a Department official.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons I urge on the Parliamentary Secretary to bring a fresh viewpoint to bear on this and to show his initiative and his openness by accepting this very reasonable amendment standing in the name of Senator Sheehy Skeffington and myself. If the Minister does this he will show that there is a change of heart in the Government as regards agriculture. He will show that they are getting away from the type of Blaneyism that was repudiated in the recent BGA elections and that they recognise that what is needed for the future is co-operation, not dictatorship, and that what is needed now is co-ordinated effort with balanced co-operation, with research, agricultural organisations and the Department of Agriculture all harnessed together in the service of agriculture and in particular in the service of this small branch we are dealing with here, and dealing with very inadequately because the only long-term solution must be a marketing board. In the meantime if what is being forced on us is this product, right as far as it is done to date up to the Schedule, then at least we can improve that by inserting this reasonable amendment. Consequently, I confidently asked the acting Minister, who is a young man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this amendment. I regard it as a second best but the House decided earlier on Committee Stage that it did not want three members of An Chomhairle to be appointed by the NFA, one member by the IAOS and one by the Agricultural Institute. Therefore, it seemed reasonable, as the next best thing, to say: &ldquo;Let us adopt the formula of the Minister and leave it to him to decide, since this is what he wants, who shall be the most representative of the IAOS and of the Agricultural Institute and, indeed, of his own Department&rdquo;. Nevertheless, let us enshrine it in the Bill and in the Act that there shall be a necessity on him to have at least one each of these interests represented on An Chomhairle when it is finally set up.</P>
      <P>This is a kind of compromise in the hope that, despite the fact that the Minister did not feel he was able to accept the earlier amendments and the House agreed with the Minister, that both the Minister and the House might agree to take this compromise amendment. It seemed very important to me that the organised agricultural community should have recognition in the Bill and at least the right to this minimum amount of representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things about which the farming community generally complain, and the sheep farmers in particular, <Col N="1196" /> is something that occurs also in other walks of life. It is that the middlemen, sometimes the buyers or the intermediary buyers, seem to get more out of the product than those who produce it. It has been suggested to me that there are more bloodsuckers on sheep than ticks. The preying upon the sheep producing community by the middlemen, sometimes rather parasitic middlemen, is one of the factors in the very small amount of money that reaches the producers in this very important sector of the agricultural community in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is in the hope that the organised agricultural interests shall be represented and recognised in the Bill&mdash;after all nowhere else in the Bill are they recognised&mdash;that I second this amendment of Professor Quinlan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment, especially because I feel that not sufficient emphasis is placed on the work of the Agricultural Institute. While I concede that the Minister, who is now taking the right to appoint whom he likes, I still think he can do this and be quite free to do it. If he were to ask the Director of the Institute, Dr. Walsh, to suggest a name to him of somebody who, in Dr. Walsh's experience, is an expert in this particular field of agricultural husbandry, I feel sure he could come up with an eminent expert who would be a great asset on the proposed board.</P>
      <P>I believe that sufficient acknowledgement is not given to the tremendous work that the Agricultural Institute is doing. The State is paying for this service and I do not think that sufficient of its findings are percolating back to the farmers. In this way the Minister can come along and lift off the top of the expert knowledge and advice that the State is actually paying for. They are doing the work but I do not believe that the results of the various experiments are getting across to sufficiently large numbers of the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel also that as a token of the Department's desire to foster co-operation it would be important that the Minister should look to the IAOS <Col N="1197" /> for one person to serve as a member of An Chomhairle Olla. In this way the Minister cannot only have the best possible brains and experts in this particular field but he can also emphasise the importance of these bodies and support them in their great work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment as put down. The board, in common with many other boards, can consist of up to approximately ten people. There are six altogether which are being specified. There is nowhere an indication that, in fact, some from the Irish agricultural societies or from An Foras Talúntais might not be on the remaining four. This wool Bill, even if it has not shown anything else, has certainly brought out those wolves who are masquerading in sheep's clothing. People who spoke here of their wish to have co-operation and who by innuendo or, indeed, by open statement said that relations between the Department and the Agricultural Institute have not been what they might have been during the last two years are as far off their mark as the Tuskar Rock is from here.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture not only set up both these organisations but financed them and last year £1½ million went to the Agricultural Institute from the Department, similarly the IAOS received £30,000 and a licence to collect £70,000 from cooperative creameries. These are the things that often irritate me&mdash;people who try to act as peacemakers turning out to be troublemakers, people who make difficulties and invent them where they were not already.</P>
      <P>Regarding what Senator McDonald has said in relation to insufficient information coming back for the money being paid for the maintenance and the workings of the Agricultural Institute, I could not disagree more with him. The Agricultural Institute is doing a first-class job. The findings of its many researches are available to every farmer and every farming organisation and to the public at large if they display sufficient interest in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most that the Agricultural Institute can do is to make its findings, <Col N="1198" /> make the submissions on paper and then those who are interested can avail themselves of that certain knowledge that has been found on a scientific basis and, indeed, on costly research. I should like to extend a special word of thanks to all the people involved in this research for the magnificent work they are doing not merely for the Department, not merely for farming interests but particularly for the nation, because they are doing a national service which I and the Department appreciate. I am not prepared to accept the amendment but nonetheless I see in the other four people on this council, the possibility that one or each could possibly fall within that ilk. It baffles me why the Department should be mentioned in this regard but I am not able to follow all the devious routes of Senator Quinlan's imagination.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the Parliamentary Secretary did not show a little more initiative and comprehension. He, too, believes in whistling past the graveyard. We will have to leave him whistling there for a little longer. He says that relations between the Department and the Agricultural Institute and so on are good but that is not what we hear. Like his Minister, he claims he has no quarrel with the NFA or any other organisation. In other words, there is nothing good, bad or indifferent between them but that is not so. It is right that we should say that here and also indicate, as public representatives, that we are aware that things are not as they should be between the Agricultural Institute and the Department of Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The determination of Dáil constituencies is governed by section 2 of Article 16 of the Constitution. Subsection 3º of that section reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1202" /> The purpose of this Bill is to spell out clearly in the Constitution the meaning of the words &ldquo;so far as it is practicable&rdquo;. This is done in effect in the proposed new subsection 3º which is contained in the Schedule to the Bill and which is being substituted for the existing subsection 3º of section 2 of Article 16. It sets out precisely the maximum divergence from strict mathematical parity of population per member permitted for constituencies and the factors which may justify a divergence up to that limit. The subsection fixes a maximum divergence of one-sixth from the national average population per member and provides that regard must be had to the extent and accessibility of constituencies, the need for securing convenient areas of representation and the desirability of avoiding the overlapping of county boundaries. This maximum divergence and the other factors will, in the event of the Bill being approved, apply whether or not the constituencies are multi-member or single-member.</P>
    <P>I should like first of all to deal with the proposed requirement to have regard to the desirability of avoiding the overlapping by constituencies of county boundaries because it has a direct bearing on the size of the divergence proposed.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised by authorities on electoral matters that constituencies should, as far as possible, be based on local communities. It is an undeniable fact that there is a strong feeling of local patriotism within our counties which should be respected.</P>
    <P>There is also the point that much of a Deputy's work relates to matters within the competence of the county council. In addition, the whole process of registration of electors and holding of elections is geared to counties. Apart from these rather obvious reasons for adhering to county boundaries, constituencies based firmly on local administrative divisions will obviously command more public confidence than purely arbitrary creations. If the present system is retained, the aim should be that as many constituencies as possible should consist of a complete county or of two grouped <Col N="1203" /> counties, the boundary in each case coinciding with the county boundary, or should be wholly contained within the boundaries of one county. If single seat constituencies are adopted, the commission to be set up will be facilitated in their task if they can take county boundaries within the proposed limit of divergence as a firm frame of reference in creating constituencies.</P>
    <P>These are some of the reasons why the breaching of county boundaries was avoided where possible at all revisions of constituencies prior to 1961. At the 1959 revision, in no case was part of a county attached to the whole or part of another county to form a constituency. This involved in certain instances a divergence from the national average of population per Deputy to the extent that the number of population per Deputy varied from 16,575 to 23,128. This revision was, I should emphasise, endorsed at that time by all Parties in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As we all know, the 1959 revision was declared by the High Court to be unconstitutional. This decision of the High Court resulted in the present scheme of constituencies in which 16 counties are affected by the attaching of part of a county to the whole or part of another county or counties. During the debate on the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1961, which determined the present constituencies, this aspect of the proposals, i.e. the breaching of county boundaries, was severely criticised by prominent Opposition spokesmen to the point of demanding amendment of the Constitution. Unless the Constitution is amended as proposed in this Bill it is doubtful if any county in Ireland could remain intact at future revisions of constituencies.</P>
    <P>If the widespread breaching of county boundaries is to be avoided it is obviously necessary to allow the population per member in constituencies to deviate to some degree from the national average. It would be necessary to allow a deviation of nearly one-third above or below the average to avoid the breaching of all county boundaries and indeed, this would not <Col N="1204" /> be out of line with the position in many other democracies.</P>
    <P>The deviation of one-sixth proposed in the Bill would, however, avoid the breaching of county boundaries in the big majority of cases. With multi-Member constituencies this deviation would, on present population figures, enable all constituencies to be wholly contained within the individual counties or in pairs of counties which have a tradition of grouping. This would not be possible within the deviation of 12½ per cent suggested by the informal Committee on the Constitution in their arguments adduced in favour of a change in the relevant constitutional provisions.</P>
    <P>I must make it absolutely clear, therefore, that the maximum deviation of one-sixth proposed in the Bill is the smallest deviation which would, in general, enable the breaching of county boundaries to be avoided and would keep constituencies within our county framework. I may say in passing that a deviation of this order would be necessary for the purpose irrespective of whether representation is based on population or on electorate. However, because of the fact that the proportion of adults in the total population varies considerably throughout the country and because the census enumerates all those resident in a particular place on the specified day, including babies and their mothers in maternity hospitals, all those in children's institutions, patients in hospitals irrespective of their normal place of residence, people staying in hotels, students at colleges and aliens, the overall results of the operation of a divergence within these limits, confined to taking account of the factors mentioned in the Bill, will do no more than in general equate the value of a rural vote to that of an urban vote&mdash;if it even does that.</P>
    <P>Having decided on a maximum divergence of one-sixth, it was necessary for the Government to decide on the other basic factors, in addition to preserving county boundaries intact, to which regard should be had at a determination of constituencies. The Government have always taken the view that the special difficulties of persons living in large, thinly populated constituencies should be recognised. <Col N="1205" /> The Bill accordingly provides that regard shall be had at a determination of constituencies to the extent and accessibility of constituencies and the need for securing convenient areas of representation.</P>
    <P>All pre-1961 revisions had regard to these considerations and the 1959 revision, which as I have already said was endorsed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, made concessions in respect of these factors involving departures from the national average of population per Deputy greater than would be possible under the proposed amendment. The factor of the extent and accessibility of constituencies&mdash;taken in conjunction with the limit of one-sixth divergence&mdash;will, as I have pointed out, have the indirect result of making it possible to keep the rural vote in general equal in value with the vote in the bigger cities.</P>
    <P>This leads me to deal with some misconceptions which exist regarding the proposed tolerance. First of all, it has been argued that the tolerance will result in votes in rural areas having a greater value than votes in urban areas and that rural areas will get greater, and urban areas less, representation than that to which they are entitled. In order to correct this erroneous idea I propose to show how application of the tolerance provision cannot have this result.</P>
    <P>Under the Constitution, Dáil representation is based on population. The proposed tolerance of one-sixth is also based on population. The present national average population per Deputy is 20,028. In theory, therefore, a rural area could get one Deputy for not fewer than each 16,690 of the population and a city area one Deputy for not more than each 23,366 of the population. But the percentage of electorate per population is not the same in rural and urban areas. In fact, and this is an essential point, the electorate as a percentage of the population is appreciably higher in rural areas than in city areas. The total national electorate expressed as a percentage of the total population is 59.4 per cent. The percentage in the constituency of Dublin North-West is, however, only 50.96 per cent whereas in the constituency <Col N="1206" /> of South-West Donegal it is 67.74 per cent. If, therefore, one Deputy were allocated to South-West Donegal for each 16,690 of the population and to Dublin North-West for each 23,366 of the population, the average electorate per Member would be 11,305 in South-West Donegal and 11,907 in Dublin North-West. This is very close in each case to the national average electorate per Member of 11,899.</P>
    <P>If, however, representation in these two constituencies were based on equality of population per member, as required by the present Constitution, the electorate per Member in South-West Donegal would be 13,567 and in Dublin North-West only 10,206, giving the city vote a much higher value than the rural vote.</P>
    <P>I could give many more examples to show that under the proposed tolerance there would be very little difference between the value of rural and city votes, whereas under the present Constitution there is definite discrimination against areas outside the larger cities and boroughs. Indeed, if nothing is done to correct this injustice, all the indications are that the gap between the value of a vote in the cities and elsewhere will grow with anticipated increases in the non-voting population of the cities, arising from increases in the numbers of students, the increasing regionalisation of institutions, <i>et cetera.</i> I do not think that city voters expect or want to retain such favourable treatment and I trust that Senators will endorse the principle of one-man-one-vote of equal value which is inherent in the proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are a few further points I should like to mention on this question of tolerance. The idea of a tolerance is not something new. A tolerance of this order was applied at all revisions prior to 1961 and the 1959 revision involved a greater deviation from the national average than that now proposed. The maximum tolerance of one-sixth proposed is substantially smaller than that applicable in other countries. In Britain, for example, the deviation in constituencies ranges from 60 per cent below the national average electorate <Col N="1207" /> per Member to 80 per cent above. This means that the electorate per Member in the largest constituency is 450 per cent greater than in the smallest.</P>
    <P>Finally, the tolerance cannot be applied arbitrarily; it must be used in the circumstances outlined in the Bill, namely to take account of the extent and accessibility of constituencies, the need for securing convenient areas of representation and the desirability of avoiding the overlapping of county boundaries. In fact, it will be mandatory to have regard to these factors in determining each constituency.</P>
    <P>Apart from the need to define the phrase "so far as it is practicable" in the existing subsection (3) of section 2 of Article 16 of the Constitution, the subsection also suffers from a defect, only recently come to light, that due to the inclusion of the words &ldquo;at any time&rdquo; a revision of constituencies could well have to be carried out after each quinquennial census in the future. The census results recently published show that at present 24 of the 38 constituencies do not comply with the legal interpretation of the Constitution and that a revision is, therefore, now required. A revision could thus have to be made in the lifetime of each Dáil making a reasonable continuity of representation impossible. The proposed new subsection does not contain any such requirement. The practice in this respect would also, therefore, revert to that which obtained prior to 1961 of revising the constituencies once every 12 years.</P>
    <P>I should like to acknowledge that the Bill as passed by the Dáil includes a number of provisions which were suggested by Opposition spokesmen. One of these ensures that a revision of constituencies shall not take place during the interval between the date of a census and the publication of the final results thereof.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by posing two questions on which I should like to hear the views of the Senators. Is there a defect in the Constitution requiring amendment and if so, how shall the amendment be effected? With regard to the question whether the Constitution <Col N="1208" /> requires amendment, the Opposition Parties demanded it in 1961 and, in the course of the recent debate in the Dáil, Deputy J.A. Costello admitted that there exists what he called a &ldquo;Constitutional infirmity&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>With regard to the manner in which the infirmity should be dealt with, the amendment proposed in this Bill will, in effect, revert to the position which existed and was acceptable to all Parties prior to 1961. I must make it perfectly clear that failure to amend the Constitution as proposed in the Bill will result in frequent revisions of constituencies involving wholesale breaching of county boundaries, with consequent frustration for the people, their representatives and for political Party organisations, and unfair discrimination against areas outside the big cities.</P>
    <P>In commending the Bill to the Seanad, I trust that the proposal will be debated in a constructive manner, bearing in mind that it is the people who will ultimately decide the issue at a referendum.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill is to enable the people to decide if single-seat constituencies and the straight vote should be substituted for the present system of multi-seat constituencies and the transferable vote. The new provisions which would be inserted in the Constitution are set out in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Parts I and II of the Schedule contain the provisions relating to single-seat constituencies and the straight vote and are, of course, the most important in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Parts III and IV are consequential. In effect, they propose to regulate the number of constituencies rather than the number of Members of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Parts V and VI, which make up the greater part of the Schedule, contain provisions relating mainly to the proposed constituency commission. These provisions are relatively uncontroversial. They have, on the whole, been constructively debated in the Dáil and have been amended to meet points <Col N="1209" /> raised. They might, I suggest, be more appropriately discussed at Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The kernel of the Bill is contained in the two subsections set out in Parts I and II of the Schedule. Subsection 1º provides for single-seat constituencies and subsection 2º requires that Members shall be elected by means of the straight vote. I shall deal with each in turn.</P>
    <P>The multi-seat constituency has many disadvantages. The large size of many constituencies and the competition between Deputies&mdash;even members of one Party&mdash;bring about the situation that each Deputy is fully occupied in constituency matters, often of a trivial nature, to the detriment of his highly important duties in relation to legislation, and national economic, financial and social policies. Competition between candidates of the same Party can lead to disedifying intrigues &mdash;&ldquo;the machinations of the multi-seat constituency.&rdquo; as a recent newspaper article put it. The system has an inherent tendency to keep out potentially strong new candidates particularly where the return of an established member of the same Party would be endangered. The system of election necessitating a ballot paper with a large number of names, some of them unknown to most electors, and a complicated system of transferring some of the votes an indefinite number of times, in which the element of chance plays an important part, is not conducive to producing the best results. There have been cases of candidates who have headed the poll at the first count and have subsequently to the mystification of the voters in the constituency failed in the processes of counting and transfers to secure election.</P>
    <P>Contrast this with the single-seat constituency. It will be much smaller &mdash;in some cases only one-fifth of the size of an existing constituency. Consequently, the amount of constituency and organisation work will be considerably reduced, leaving the Deputy more time for his duties as a Member of the House. The fact that he is the only Deputy for the area means that he will not be driven by competition from other Deputies into currying favour <Col N="1210" /> with electors by pretending to obtain benefits for them which, in fact, they are entitled to receive as of right. This will further reduce constituency work by making it feasible for the Deputy to confine such work to what is really necessary in the interest of his constituents.</P>
    <P>At the same time, because of the more reasonable area of the constituency and the smaller number of people involved it will be possible for the Deputy to give better service to his constituents in regard to local and personal matters which really require his attention. It will also alter for the better the whole tone of public life which is adversely affected at present by the inevitable tendency of multimember constituencies to foster the belief that benefits and services and even public appointments are obtainable through the intercession of Deputies. This better atmosphere and the new status of Deputies should attract a better type of prospective candidate and the political Parties will, in turn, have every incentive to put the best man forward. In the small constituencies which will be established, containing an average of about 11,000 electors each, personal factors will be very important and each candidate must be prepared to win on his own merits as well as the merits of the policy he supports. It will no longer be feasible to put forward candidates in the hope that they will be elected on the transfer of votes of outstanding individuals. The number of candidates going forward in a constituency will be fewer than at present with normally only two or three serious contenders, all of them well known to the electors of the area. It will then rest with the electors to elect the best candidate, taking into account his qualifications and his policy. The Deputy who is elected will look after the true interests of the whole constituency&mdash;otherwise he will lose his seat at the next election and be replaced by a better representative. Our case then is that the single-seat constituency will raise the standard of parliamentary life, attract a better type of candidate, encourage Parties to put forward the best candidate available and, in a clear-cut confrontation, make <Col N="1211" /> it possible for the voters to elect the best man.</P>
    <P>At national level the single-seat constituency will also have beneficial results. While experience abroad suggests that it does not, of itself, prevent the emergence of a multi-party system or guarantee an overall majority for the Government of the day, it does at least prevent the worst shortcomings inherent in the present system and it gives the people a much better opportunity of avoiding indeterminate election results and, therefore, a better chance of electing a government. With no vested interest in individual constituencies inhibiting the selection of the best candidate and with no conflicting interests to dissipate the efforts of Party organisations, each Party will be able to make a more effective and unified effort to attain a majority.</P>
    <P>One of the most objectionable features of the present system is the disproportionate effort and expense both for the State and political Parties involved in by-elections. Under present circumstances the Returning Officer must make arrangements for all the voters in a large area to vote to elect a fraction of their representation. Party organisations must try to persuade all these voters, who already have from 2 to 4 representatives, that it is important to elect another who may be from a distant part of the constituency or even from another county or province. Under the proposed system the people in a fraction of these areas will be voting to elect their full representation. The arrangements for voting to be made by the Returning Officer will, therefore, be much less expensive and disruptive and more appropriate to the job to be done, while, apart from the smaller area and the smaller numbers involved, the fact that the election will be for the purpose of electing the full representation of the constituency and replacing a truly local representative will make it easier to explain to the people the importance of voting. All this will mean less demand on the physical and financial resources of political Parties, will call for less disruption of the Dáil and Seanad and will have less serious <Col N="1212" /> effects on the stamina and health of individual Deputies and Senators.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need say any more on this particular provision. Whatever their public attitudes may be, it is known that the vast majority of the Members of all Parties favour the single-seat constituency, or at least they would if they thought they would be elected. Even the opposition press has admitted as much. For example, the political correspondent of the <i>Irish Independent</i> wrote in that paper's issue of 25th May last that: &ldquo;out of all the uncertainty and confusion one thing comes through loud and clear to the observer: practically everybody now in Dáil Éireann would like to have a single-seat rather than to share his constituency with other Members. They do not agree on the means of election to the seat&mdash;some favouring the alternative vote system with its by-election attractions, others favouring the first-past-the-post system&rdquo;. Later in the same article it is pointed out that in a single-seat constituency &ldquo;more time would be devoted to parliamentary as opposed to bog-drain business, and many of the present indignities would be eliminated.&rdquo; More recently, the political correspondent of the <i>Irish Times</i> writing on the 15th June, made the following remarkable admission: &ldquo;Indeed one gathers in all parties that there is the unexpressed hope that somehow or another the straight vote may become operative. That is accepted, almost universally, as its one great asset: it would make for better quality TDs as each man would have to go out and make his own case in a small area where he would be well known. Later he would not be handicapped in his study of national affairs by his present role as a messenger boy for his constituents.&rdquo; I am confident that among the public generally there is also the same appreciation of the value of the single-seat constituency.</P>
    <P>Subsection 2º provides that election shall be on the relative majority system by means of the single nontransferable vote. This gives practical effect to the principle of &ldquo;one-man-one-vote&rdquo;, as unlike the present position each voter will have only one vote and the candidate who secures the <Col N="1213" /> largest number of votes is elected. The amendment which was moved in the Dáil in an effort to find common ground to substitute the single transferable vote for the straight vote failed to secure acceptance by any Party. However, since some of the arguments put forward in public against the Government's proposals tend to concentrate on the method of voting, I think I should deal with the relative merits of the straight vote and the transferable vote in single-seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>The principal argument usually advanced in favour of the alternative vote is that the candidate elected under this system has an overall majority of the votes at the final count. Under the straight vote, on the other hand, so the argument runs, a minority candidate can be elected. This argument will not stand up to critical examination. The so-called majority obtained under the transferable vote is a contrived one&mdash;contrived unjustifiably by counting the preferences of some, and only some, of the voters and crediting these preferences, some being even the lowest possible preferences, as full votes. Let us suppose, for example, that if there are three candidates A, B and C, A secures the highest number of votes, B the next highest and C the lowest. If A does not secure an overall majority, C is elimated and the second preferences on his ballot papers are now credited as No. 1 votes and distributed between the other two candidates. This may result in the election of B. The theory behind this is that the people who voted for C have been unable to elect their candidate and are entitled to a second chance. If this is valid why should not the people who voted for A, who has not been elected, be given a second chance? If they were it could well be that C and not B would be elected. This in turn would raise the question of B's second preferences which might have the result of electing A. The application of the principle of the transferable vote, therefore, in a non-discriminatory way would be very likely to show an overall majority in favour of more than one candidate. Even more absurd results are obtained where more than three candidates contest <Col N="1214" /> a seat. The absurdity arises from two factors&mdash;the counting of the preferences of some voters only and equating a later preference with a full vote. This is obviously not only absurd but also unjust and undemocratic. As a result we sometimes have the situation in by-elections that the outcome may depend more on who got the lowest number of votes and is first eliminated than on who got the highest number, the decision in effect being made not by the majority but by the smallest minority in the constituency.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the person elected under the transferable vote system need not have a majority of the votes cast. Indeed, he may not even have the highest number of votes, measured either in terms of first preferences only or of all preferences cast. Under the straight vote, on the other hand, the winner must at least secure more votes than any other candidate, and indeed, as experience in other countries shows, he usually secures an overall majority of votes as well. It is clearly not possible to establish that there is any overall majority in favour of one candidate unless more than 50 per cent of the people vote for one particular candidate.</P>
    <P>As to the relative effects on the political system of the two methods of voting, the position has been well summarised by Dr. F.A. Hermens, Professor of Politics at the University of Notre Dame in his book <i>Europe Between Democracy and Anarchy,</i> published by The Committee on International Relations, University of Notre Dame.</P>

      <P>I do not know. In discussing the effects of a change in Britain from the straight vote to the alternative vote he states, I am quoting from page 28 of his book: &ldquo;There is no way to limit the benefits of the scheme, i.e., the alternative vote, to the Liberals. The Communists, the left wing Socialists and the Fascists would be grateful to be re-insured against wasting their votes. No one can tell who would benefit and by how much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> A multiple-party system would, however, be certain to develop.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In contrast with that situation, it is accepted by all authorities that the straight vote has an integrating and moderating effect on politics. Each major Party will try to attract support from all sections of the population and will aim in particular at the &ldquo;middle ground&rdquo;. In order to win, a candidate must appeal not only to committed supporters of his Party but to the marginal voter as well.</P>
    <P>Those opposed to the proposals in the Bill have not sought to deny that electoral experts all over the world regard PR as favouring the development of a multi-party system in which it would be impossible for any one party to secure an overall majority, nor that in other countries PR has been associated with the emergence of a multi-party system. The evidence is too strong to admit of any denial. Instead they have concentrated on the Irish experience and suggest that since we now have only three effective Parties, PR does not give rise to a multiplicity of Parties.</P>
    <P>This argument ignores two vital points. First, the Civil War and its aftermath, the constitutional struggles of the thirties, the Economic War and the Second World War&mdash;all these provided great issues which dominated the political scene and at the time made the situation unfavourable for the emergence of splinter groups. The second point is that on a number of occasions we have seen the beginnings of a multi-party system, for example, in the period 1948-1957. We should not forget the instability of that period or its disastrous economic consequences. After the 1956-57 crash there was considerable public disenchantment with splinter groups and coalitions and we have been fortunate that this has so far inhibited the development of a multi-party system. However, with the passing of time, a similar situation could again emerge and, in fact, there is a continuing effort to form splinter parties. The really serious aspect of this is that once a multi-party system is finally established, it is then too late to make the change.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" /> Perhaps the objection most insistently advanced against the Fourth Amendment Bill is that it will benefit the Fianna Fáil Party. This objection takes a number of forms. For example, it is urged that the change must favour one side or the other and that the Government would be unlikely to promote it if it favoured the Opposition. This argument can, perhaps, best be countered by another: one might inquire if it is to keep Fianna Fáil in power that the Leader of Fine Gael and a substantial number of members of the Fine Gael Front Bench and Parliamentary Party favour the straight vote? The real fallacy, of course, is the suggestion that the change must necessarily favour one side or the other. This is a point with which I would like to deal at some length, particularly because of pseudo scientific forecasts of the results of the straight vote.</P>
    <P>The forecast to which most publicity is given has suggested on the basis of the last local elections that Fianna Fáil might win over 90 seats under the straight vote. The assumptions on which this forecast is said to be based are completely unreal. The first assumption is that constituencies, at any rate outside Dublin, will be related to the local electoral areas on which local elections are based. In fact, there can be no possible correlation between these areas and the proposed single-seat constituencies. Some counties have many more local electoral areas than the number of Deputies to which they would be entitled and others have less. Even within counties there can be no correlation, since most of these areas were drawn up many years ago and bear no relation to the present distribution of population. The population of county electoral areas ranges from 3,603 to 51,772. It should be noted also that the issues and personalities in local elections tend by definition to be essentially local.</P>
    <P>The second assumption on which the projection is based is that the same number of Parties and groups will contest the constituencies as contested the local elections and that the number of votes going to each Party or group will be as in the local elections. This assumption is manifestly absurd. Experience of elections under the straight <Col N="1217" /> vote abroad and of by-elections here shows that in most constituencies there will be only two or at most three effective candidates who between them will secure nearly all the votes. This is sufficient to undermine the validity of the projection. Anyone who knows anything about elections knows that the individuals contesting constituencies are a very relevant consideration and any attempted forecast of results without any knowledge of either the constituencies or the candidates is obviously a farce. In the final analysis the issue will, of course, be determined by the votes of the people. If, as the Opposition claim, the people are turning from Fianna Fáil, then the outcome of the election will be quite clear&mdash; Fianna Fáil will lose. I am confident, that in an unambiguous confrontation between Fianna Fáil and the coalition, Fianna Fáil will win. However, because of the fact that neither constituencies nor candidates are known it is not possible to be certain. On the other hand, the fact that Fianna Fáil have in the lifetime of this Dáil been successful in six out of seven by-elections is the clearest possible indication that under the present system Fianna Fáil are certain to be the next government.</P>
    <P>I have referred to these short-term aspects because they have been frequently used as arguments against the proposal. The fact that they have been so frequently used, in one form or another, is evidence that the opposition to the present proposal is based on fear and suspicion of their own prospects in conditions of a clear confrontation between the Parties rather than on grounds of principle or long-term considerations.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;ndiúltaíonn Seanad Éireann an Dara Léamh a thabhairt don Bhille um an Tríú Leasú ar an mBunreacht, 1968, ar an bhforas nach bhfuil aon éileamh ag an bpobal ar an togra atá sa Bhille agus nach bhfuil aon sásra sa <Col N="1218" /> Bhille chun teorannú dáilcheantar a chinneadh go neamhchlaon&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;That&rdquo; and to substitute:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968 on the grounds that there has been no public demand for the proposal contained in the Bill and the Bill contains no machinery to decide impartially the delimitation of constituencies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are many possible approaches for the Seanad and for Senators to the discussion of this particular matter and of this particular measure. There is, I hope, no need to repeat all that was said nine years ago on the subject and no need to repeat all that has been said on the subject in Dáil Éireann in recent months. Indeed, some people might raise the question whether there is any real need for a thorough discussion of this measure by the Seanad at all. The view might be expressed that the two Bills which deal essentially with the matter of the manner of election to Dáil Éireann is a subject on which the Seanad might, if it speaks its mind at all, do so briefly.</P>
    <P>However, the issue we have before us is such that the Seanad must view it thoroughly, that Senators must speak their minds on the matter. No matter what viewpoint we take, we cannot avoid the responsibility of stating our views on this particular issue. We have a constitutional responsibility to defend the Constitution if we see no need for change. Equally, those who are convinced that it is in the public interest that the Constitution should be amended have a duty to give the reasons for their point of view.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion when a similar measure came before the Oireachtas, in 1959, when there was a proposal to abolish Proportional Representation, the move was approved by Dáil Éireann, often known as the popular House, it was defeated in the Seanad, re-enacted by Dáil Éireann and ultimately rejected by the people. On that occasion the popular House did not <Col N="1219" /> take what ultimately proved to be the popular view. The Seanad, in discharging its duty on that occasion, in discussing the measure thoroughly, expressing its opinion of it and defeating it, was taking the view that was ultimately taken in the referendum by the general population. This time there is no possibility of Seanad Éireann defeating the Bill.</P>

      <P>The political situation in this House is such that that eventuality will not happen this time but the Seanad and its Members can speak their minds on the two measures which have been laid before us, and they should. Those measures have been brought before us. This Bill, which is before us now, was introduced into the Dáil by the Taoiseach as a matter worthy of the attention of the Houses of the Oireachtas above anything else which might be brought before them at this particular time. We have had in recent times an interest in matters of constitutional reform. In August, 1966, an informal committee was set up in agreement between the Parties to review the constitutional, legislative and institutional basis of Government.</P>
      <P>This committee, in which three Members of this House took part, did a good deal of work between August, 1966, and December, 1967, when their interim report was issued. Despite interruptions by by-elections and local elections, the committee did get through a good deal of work but I think the Minister will probably agree with me in one thing and that is that the proposals which are before us this evening have very little to do with the work of that particular committee. The committee set up to review the Constitution reported in its interim report on Constitutional matters on 26 topics and referred a similar number to the Attorney General as being matters of law and legal interpretation which might more properly be examined by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their eventual report the Constitutional committee dealt with four <Col N="1220" /> points of electoral reform. They dealt with the question of the qualifying age; they deal with the question of the size of the Dáil; they dealt with the question of rural representation; and they dealt with the question of the electoral system. The committee were divided on all four points and in accordance with the practice which they adopted they reported on the arguments which had been put forward on the committee on one side or the other on those four divided questions. Before the committee had completed its report in the autumn of 1967 the Minister spoke on a few occasions in public on the question of electoral reform. At the end of November, 1967, the informal committee formed of the three major Parties was obliged to speed up the final drafting of their report because of the imminence of a Government decision on this question of electoral reform.</P>
    <P>It was a matter of regret that the committee was obliged to act in that way and I think, in fact, the report of the committee which was issued in December, 1967, has suffered from the fact that the final drafting and revision of its report was not as detailed as it might have been. It is still more a matter of regret that the decision taken by the Government in regard to the type of electoral reform to be proposed ignored the opinions expressed on all sides of that committee. This is the stand to which the Government and the Government Party have adhered to since.</P>
    <P>There is very little relation between what the Government proposes and what the committee proposed. The Minister said he is introducing a tolerance here of one-sixth in comparison with the 12½ per cent tolerance between constituencies proposed by this committee. That committee proposed no such thing. The Constitution Committee never proposed a 12½ per cent tolerance between constituency and constituency. If the Minister who has been talking on this matter now for several months would only read the committee's report properly this fact should be obvious to him. The committee reported on page 19 of its report on the question of delimitation of constituencies, <Col N="1221" /> which is covered by Article 16.2.3º of the Constitution. This is the Article which in the Constitution provides that the ratio between the number of Members to be elected for each constituency and the population shall as far as practical be the same throughout the country. The committee were not in agreement on this particular point and there was no recommendation from the full committee.</P>

      <P>I am sorry but that is the way I heard it. It certainly was the impression given to me and I should not like it to be the impression given to anybody else on this particular matter.</P>
      <P>In regard to the substance of the Fourth Amendment Bill, the proposal put forward by the Government is quite beside the views put forward in this committee. In the committee the proposition that was brought forward and reported on with different views was not a proposition to change from proportional representation to the relative majority system but to change from the present system to single-seat constituencies with the transferable vote. What we have to discuss this evening are the proposals the Government have put before us. These are that between one constituency and another there should be, at the time of the revision of the constituencies, a possible variation of plus or minus one-sixth, a range of one-third or a disparity of 40 per cent. There is also the proposal in the Fourth Amendment Bill that we should have single-seat constituencies in which the method of election would be by the relative majority system, described in the report of the committee as the first-past-the-post system. There is also a provision for the setting up of a constituency commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Third Amendment Bill there <Col N="1222" /> is no provision for the setting up of the constituency commission. This was one of the clear recommendations of the all-Party committee which recommended that if there was any constitutional change in the present position there should be such a commission. That committee left open the question of the form such a commission should take.</P>
    <P>What we have to consider next is why there should be any proposals at all. They do not arise from the report of the Constitutional committee. There certainly has been no popular demand for them and the only possible reason for them is that the Government are acting in the public interest. In the absence of specific recommendations from the committee, in the absence of any public demand the Government is entitled to bring forward propositions on its own initiative if it considers that they are in the public interest but the onus of proof is on those who take the initiative. This is an onus which the Government has not discharged.</P>
    <P>Since the matter was first mooted early last year we have had a variety of arguments used. Before the publication of the Government's proposals certain arguments were used. After the publication of the proposals certain other arguments were put forward and in the discussion in the Dáil further additional arguments were put forward. Probably in the course of this debate the arguments will change again and we will probably have a final set of arguments used in the public campaign.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the case made by the Minister in regard to the Third Amendment Bill. The essence of his arguments is that there should be a variation of plus or minus one-sixth in the ratio of population per Member. The Minister proposed that this should be allowed to take account of three factors&mdash;of taking into account the extent and accessibility of constituencies, the convenience of representation and the avoidance of the overlapping of counties. The Bill makes no mention of the relation between electorate and population of which the Minister made so much in his statement this evening. If the <Col N="1223" /> Minister is so worried about this matter why did he not put it into the Bill? When he decided to change the way of determining the constituencies the Minister did not include that particular change in his proposals. The reason is that this is an example of one of the arguments used in favour of the Government's proposals only at a later date. It would have been easy for the Minister, who talked of the injustice which occurs due to the varying ratios of electorate to population throughout the country, to have written his proposals into the Bill but he did not do so.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is worried on this point let him come in here with the proposition to change from population and put the electorate in its place in the Constitution. That he has not done but what has he done? He has made it impossible to take it into account. The Minister has given specific reasons which he proposes to write into the Constitution and by writing in these reasons he is ruling out all other reasons as a basis of consideration as to how a commission or a minister could vary the ratio of population or electorate to member throughout the country. The Minister made a great deal of this particular question, yet his own amending Bill will make it impossible for it to be taken into account. If he is worried about this point let him amend the Bill in regard to this point. If he shows sincerity in this regard he would get a reasonable hearing.</P>
    <P>We should be clear in regard to the tolerance which is or should be allowed between county and county. There has been a great deal of misunderstanding and confusion on this particular point. All we know on this matter from the judgments that have been made is that a 5 per cent variation was allowed and an 18 per cent variation was not. It is not true to say that a variation of more than 5 per cent would not be recognised by the courts. Nobody has any right to say this. The particular variation of 18 per cent put to the courts was disallowed but there has been no judicial determination of the <Col N="1224" /> effect on the present constituencies of a scheme including a variation of 10 per cent. It has been suggested that the variation in the scheme disallowed by the High Court was the normal practice which had gone on for many years.</P>
    <P>This is not so. I am not sure of the exact figures but I am quite sure the Minister will be able to remind me of them in his reply. The figure of 18 per cent is the figure in my memory. In introducing this Bill in the Dáil the Taoiseach talked of the variation as being one of 11 to 19 per cent over the years so that 18 per cent was at the top of the range and was over the average figure. It is not true to say that anything over five per cent would be disallowed by the courts and it is not true to say that the Constitutional committee as a committee was in favour of a ratio of 12½ per cent as between constituencies.</P>
    <P>There is one point which has been completely ignored in this discussion on the tolerance and that is the effect of the 12-year revision period on the particular tolerance fixed at the beginning of the period. The whole debate has been centred over the point of exactly what ratio should we have between Members and population or Members and electorate at the time of revision. It is important to look beyond this because this is not something which is subject to continual revision. Indeed, the Minister has indicated that there is an absolute necessity to go through the business of Constitutional reform because a five-yearly revision would be absolutely intolerable but the effect of a 12-year revision has quite a substantial effect on the ratio that occurs. Even if the constituencies started out absolutely equal at the beginning of the 12-year period, the lapse of the 12 years would result in a considerable distortion as between the various constituencies.</P>
    <P>We can look back and see what happened in the last revision. It was made in 1961, not made on the 1961 census, but made on the 1956 census returns even though the results of the 1961 census were available to the Government at the time of the revision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter we could dispute but I have no wish to do this. The situation is that the revision anyway, the Minister does agree, was on the 1956 census. This meant that at the time this actual revision was made in 1961 the determination was made on the basis of figures which were already five years out of date. The 1961 general election was fought on figures which were five years out of date. The 1965 general election was fought on figures which were nine years out of date. Was this effect a small one, something which we should neglect, something which we should ignore completely? It certainly was not, and in order to illustrate the fact I should like to take the case of two constituencies. So that the Minister will feel at home, I should like to take his own constituency of County Dublin. In the figures based on the 1956 census, according to my calculations, the population per Member in County Dublin with a division based on the 1956 census was 20,751, whereas the population per Member for the constituency of South Mayo was 19,419, a disparity of seven per cent between the two, a disparity which is of the order which one would accept as being not unreasonable, of the order which it would appear would be allowable under the present Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the position according to the census of 1956. By the time the actual division of constituencies was made the 1961 census had already been taken, the figures had already been compiled in the Central Statistics Office and the position was that at the time the scheme was made the ratio of population to Member in County Dublin had risen from 20,000 to 23,386, while the figure for South Mayo had fallen to 18,024, so that the position was that even on the day the scheme was made there was already a disparity of 30 per cent between the position in South Mayo and in County Dublin. It took 30 per cent more population to earn a seat in County <Col N="1226" /> Dublin than it did in the constituency of South Mayo. That was the position at the beginning of the scheme in 1961.</P>
    <P>In 1966 there was a further census taken, at a time five years after the revision of the census taken, at a time when less than one-half of the Constitutional period had run. Five of the 12 years had elapsed. By this time the position was that the ratio of population to Dáil Member in County Dublin had risen to 29,181 and the population per Dáil Member in South Mayo had fallen to 16,950. The position then was that before one-half the time this particular determination of constituencies had run there was a 72 per cent disparity between the figures. The number of persons per Member in Dublin was 72 per cent higher than in South Mayo.</P>
    <P>This is an essential factor. The Minister is proposing now to us a scheme which he is endeavouring to ensure beyond all ambiguity will run for 12 years. That he proposes that at the beginning of this period there should be allowable a disparity of 30 to 40 per cent between one constituency and another. He has indicated that this is something which should be done so that we can leave the representation which it has had to the areas which have suffered by loss of population, that we should not have to take account in the next division of constituencies of any shift of population from certain parts of the country to other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>If we now put in at the beginning of the 12 year period a disparity of 30 to 40 per cent we will, indeed, find that long before the end of the period there will be, on the basis of our experience in the past, over 100 per cent disparity. In the five years since the last revision&mdash;in the ten years since the 1956 census, if we consider a scheme will always be made immediately after a census&mdash;we find here in ten years a difference of seven per cent initially between County Dublin and South Mayo which gives after ten years a difference of 72 per cent. Give a bonus of 30 to 40 per cent to South Mayo initially and this will grow to a difference of 100 per cent. This will completely mask the ten to 20 per cent <Col N="1227" /> variation in electorate over population of which the Minister has made so much. Here we will be getting into the position of one-man-one-vote in County Dublin and one-man-two-votes in South Mayo. This will be the position under the present Bill.</P>
    <P>I think we must be very slow to assent to the proposition that there should be an initial disparity built into the system at the beginning of a period and, in particular, that there should be an initial disparity built in in favour of this constituency which by the trend of events, by the unfortunate but largely uncontrollable, movement of population, will produce a disparity of close to 100 per cent before it is time for a new revision to take place. These are serious matters which must be considered.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said this disparity should be built into the system, that at the start of each 12-year period we should build in this disparity, and one of the factors that should be taken into account, he has told us, is the extent and accessibility of constituencies. This is losing sight of the purpose of an electoral system, of the purpose of representative democracy. In this respect I can only quote what has been stated in the report of the Constitutional committee as one of the arguments adduced against a change:</P>
    <P>The objective of the electoral system should be to give votes to persons and not to geographical areas.</P>
    <P>I was of that opinion then and I remain of that opinion.</P>
    <P>The second factor which the Minister has said should be taken into account is that a disparity should be built in between constituency and constituency in order to give convenient areas of representation. There the argument is based on the idea that it is important there should be real representation of the people in Parliament. What the Minister is proposing to us this evening in the Third and Fourth Amendments&mdash;now separate Bills, originally all part of one&mdash;is to pass the Third Amendment and to allow, for example, the County of Donegal to <Col N="1228" /> keep the number of Deputies it has at the moment, and then to pass the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution in order to ensure that all six Members will belong to his own Party. What sort of representation is this? If we are interested in representation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We have enough Donegalmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may feel he has enough Donegalmen in his Party but at the moment we are discussing the question of the representation of Donegal. If we are interested in the idea of representation, we must look at these two Bills together and when we do so this argument that we must build in a disparity on the basis of convenient areas of representation does not carry very much weight.</P>
      <P>The third factor which the Minister is endeavouring to write into the Constitution, and to leave there as a matter that can be changed only by referendum, is the proposed sanctity of county boundaries. This is a matter which should be looked at in perspective. There has been a certain tendency in the public debate on this question, on both sides, indeed, to refer to the system they dislike as the British system. There has been a tendency on the part of Government supporters to label PR as a British imposition and on the part of those opposed to the Government's proposals to refer to the relative majority system as the British system. They do not make very much sense and I remind those who make that approach that the system of dividing Ireland into counties was introduced not by Cumann Lúchleas Gael but by King John in about the year 1200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>A long time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>A long time ago, indeed, and the Minister now wishes to say that these boundaries must be taken account of and written into the Irish Constitution. The counties as they stand today mean a great deal to us. Since their institution in the year 1200 they have formed many associations and there are loyalties to counties, but the position is that the counties do not <Col N="1229" /> necessarily correspond with the natural communities of Ireland as they stand today and it is, therefore, rather disturbing that the Minister in charge of the physical planning of this country should be obsessed with the idea of the sanctity of county boundaries.</P>
      <P>We have our county loyalties but there is no question that our people have loyalties to regions and areas other than counties. Anyone with a knowledge of County Cork will know that the people of East Cork may have different loyalties from those in West Cork. There is the other aspect, that mere respect for county boundaries will not produce suitable constituencies to represent communities. In fact, the county boundaries have been breached many times. In the past few years we have had many regional groupings and attempts to go beyond the county. We have had a union of counties but we have also had the breaking of boundaries. This has been suggested in the Hospitals Report circulated to Members today &mdash; a new organisation of regional and local hospitals, ignoring King John's counties in order to produce a scheme to meet the needs of the community. In the matters of tourism, Health, technical colleges, planning, regions have been outlined and always these have not been harmonised among themselves, and they have not agreed with county boundaries.</P>
      <P>It is quite possible that in the near future a reform of local government may be introduced in which this administrative unit will disappear. The Minister might have been better occupied examining the question of such a reform of the local government structure rather than indulging in the exercise which has us here this evening. Is the present Minister or some future Minister to be inhibited in any attempt to recast the local government structure in terms of regions on the one hand or of communities smaller than counties on the other by the fact that in this measure he is putting the administrative county as such into the Constitution? This is a reflection of the innate conservatism of the Minister and of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I remarked in passing earlier, <Col N="1230" /> sticking within counties will not necessarily give us reasonable constituencies. In many cases, where the constituencies are within counties, we have a pattern which does not reflect the local community.</P>
    <P>In a by-election in the relatively recent past Members may have become familiar with the constituency of Mid-Cork which as far as I know lies wholly within the administrative County of Cork. This constituency runs from within a quarter mile of the centre of Cork City to the Kerry border. It does not breach the great principle which the Minister has invoked but it is, nevertheless, a somewhat crazy constituency. From a point about 100 yards from Cork City Hall, the constituency includes the purely urban suburbs of Ballinlough, Blackrock and Douglas and sweeps out the country to Bandon, Millstreet and up by Knocknagree to the Kerry border. The county boundary has been preserved but it is not a constituency that has been well designed from the representational point of view.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is a mistake to make overmuch of the idea of the administrative counties. From what the Minister said here this evening and what has been said before this, I feel that no case has been made for the proposition which the Minister puts to us. Certainly, no case has been made for such a variation between constituency and constituency without a special constituency commission. A Minister is perfectly capable of producing the constituency of Mid-Cork because he takes viewpoints other than those which might be taken by an impartial constituency commission. Indeed, the constituency of Mid-Cork was well designed, and did its job. The job of the constituency of Mid-Cork was to remove Alderman Stephen Barrett from the head of the poll in Cork city by removing from the Cork city constituency his old strongholds of Ballinlough, Blackrock and Douglas. In this it was successful, and at the first election afterwards Fianna Fáil went within 300 votes of securing a third seat in Cork city. As I say, the question is that if we are to have an exercise in disparity between constituencies <Col N="1231" /> let this be done in the constituency commission, let the reasons be argued there and let the reasons be given in a report of a constituency commission, if necessary a constituency commission of the type such as is suggested in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill. Given such a commission and given certain other modifications of it, there may be points in what the Minister proposes under the Third Amendment Bill which would be worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>It does appear that there is at least ambiguity and awkwardness in the present constituency provisions, for equality between constituency and constituency. If we were given this proposition, and if the Minister had come forward with the idea which he proposes tonight to move to electorate rather than to population, then he should put this into the Third Amendment and also have brought in the idea of a commission. In this regard I want to quote from paragraph 57 page 21 of the Report of the Commission on the Constitution. I quote:</P>
    <P>Certain Members felt that even under the existing system it was desirable to establish a Commission to determine the delimitation of the constituencies. Though this viewpoint was not acceptable to all Members, the Committee were unanimous that in the event of any constitutional change a commission should be established to determine the delimitation of the constituencies.</P>
    <P>This was the unanimous recommendation of this all-Party committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">

      <P>The Minister is in the position here that when it was a package deal there was a constituency commission provided for the two changes the Minister was proposing. The recommendation of the Constitution committee was that if there was to be any change&mdash;and the Third Amendment is a change&mdash;it should have its own commission. Are the people not entitled to accept the Third and reject the Fourth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that it is beyond the ingenuity of the Minister's advisers to deal with this particular matter. People are now being told: &ldquo;Even if you want the Third Amendment you cannot have the commission unanimously recommended by the Constitution committee unless you will swallow the single transferable vote at the same time.&rdquo; This is no way to put a choice before the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not our fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, we know that. We know that if the Minister had his way we would not have a referendum at all. I am sure he finds all this a terrible nuisance. Under this Third Amendment if it were brought forward on the basis of proposing the replacement of population by electorate, if the disparity were not quite so wide, if there were some allowances for the very serious effects of lapse of time, and if there were a constituency commission, it might well be that this Third Amendment would recommend itself as something which could be accepted on Second Stage and possibly amended to make a better Bill. The <Col N="1233" /> way in which it is proposed here is I feel such that the Fine Gael Party in the Seanad will have little option but to vote against this particular amendment of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The other Bill which is being discussed with this is the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill. The proposals with regard to this are contained in the Schedule to the Bill. We have here in Parts 1 and 2 the proposals for a single member constituency and a single non-transferable vote. Parts 3 and 4 are a re-enactment of the 20,000-30,000 national average in order to meet the special position of the Ceann Comhairle, and in Parts 5 and 6 we have the recommendation in regard to the constituency commission.</P>
      <P>How should we approach the discussion of this proposal to change the electoral system, which is coming to this House now for the second time? There is one thing which should be made clear above all&mdash;that if we are to discharge our responsibility as a House of the Oireachtas on this matter we must avoid at all costs dogmatism in regard to electoral systems. If we are to have a useful discussion here in the House we have to recognise from the very beginning that electoral systems are means and not ends. This is the only way in which we can have a useful discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be easy enough to swop slogans across the floor of the House, but I think that to do this would be for the Seanad to fail to do the duty which is imposed upon it. If we are to have a reasonable discussion we should try to get as much agreement as we can on what the purposes of elections are, what objectives we are aiming at; and while we will not be able to reach unanimity on this we should be able to reach a fair measure of agreement. Having got some agreement about that, we can then discuss how different electoral systems might help us to achieve the objectives on which we are, by and large, in agreement. We will probably find agreement that the purpose of elections falls broadly into the election of a Parliament and indirectly the election of a Government. We want to be able to elect as the result of a <Col N="1234" /> general election a Government which will have the power to act in the public interest and still be responsible to Parliament and ultimately responsible to the electorate. Unless we are in favour of the one-Party system, this implies that we envisage the possible replacement of the Government and the need at all times for an alternative Government ready to take over. This particular aspect was stressed very heavily in the initial Government propaganda in favour of the proposals which are being made to us. It was stressed in many statements that one of the results which would ensure if the Fourth Amendment were accepted would be a strengthening of the Opposition, increasing the importance of the Opposition as the alternative ready to take over under this new system.</P>
    <P>It is only fair that we should examine, but examine critically, the Government proposals in this particular respect. We look to them for an electoral system which will give us a Government which would be responsible to Parliament but which can act firmly in the public interest&mdash;a system which would ensure that if the people wish they could transfer their allegiance to an alternative Government and replace the Government which has met with their displeasure. We have the other aspect of it. We are not only interested in the election of a Government but also in the election of a Parliament&mdash;a Parliament whose members have to fulfil certain criteria and who must be able to act as legislators, to act as representatives of their constituents and, also, if we are to have an alternative Government a certain number of them must be capable in the future of acting as executives.</P>
    <P>We can broadly agree that these are things we are looking for when we discuss the merits of the electoral system. A great deal of the disagreements which are likely to arise in the course of this debate will not be so much that we disagree about ultimate objectives but rather that we disagree about the emphasis which should be placed on one of these objectives rather than another or that we disagree concerning the extent to which these objectives will be achieved by one <Col N="1235" /> particular method of election or another.</P>
    <P>Speaking about the Fourth Amendment I said that we must avoid any idea that, on the one hand, PR is a dogma which we must cling to at all costs or on the other hand, that the two-Party system is a fundamental principle of good Government which cannot be abandoned. We must look at these objectives, agree on them in so far as we can and choose as a legislature and later as a people, the means which appear to us as those most likely to achieve the objectives we are looking for under present circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Government have the initiative in regard to this. We are asked and the people will be asked to choose between the present system of PR and the relative majority system. It is the Government Party that have determined the choice. This is not the choice the people would have asked for themselves. If the terms of the choice were left to public opinion, I do not think it would be a choice between PR and the relative majority system. Indeed, if one looks at the Report of the Constitution Committee, it would appear that if the matter had been in their hands, the choice which the Government now proposes to us did not appear to the Constitutional Committee as being the most natural choice to place before the people.</P>
    <P>In this connection I would quote paragraph 61 on page two of the report:</P>
    <P>The question of adopting a different election system for Dáil elections was considered by the Committee. The substitution of the present system of PR for the alternative straight vote was proposed and the arguments adduced for and against are set out hereunder.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of entering into any discussion of what happened inside that committee but the report is there for any Member to read. All I can say is that paragraph 61 of the report is an accurate reflection of the proceedings and conclusions of that committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1236" /> Let us be clear as to what the choice is which is being put before the House and before the people. Those of us who are in favour of the <i>status quo</i> are not concerned with PR as a dogma, are not concerned with doctrinaire views of full PR, views expressed by certain writers at times during the 19th century. People who hold these dogmatic views on PR would probably not be satisfied with anything short of PR with the whole country as a single constituency. There is no attempt on behalf of those of us in this House who wish to defend the present system of election, there is no proposal to defend the original system on the basis of dogmatism such as I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>We are not concerned with any doctrinaire advocates of PR or any advocacy which is concerned with theoretical methods of election. We are concerned with the methods of PR as practised in this country which for a considerable time past have been PR with constituencies returning three, four or five members.</P>
    <P>We are not concerned either with any doctrinaire view that the multiplicity of Parties or the increase of Parties above two is something which is <i>per se</i> indispensable. There is an onus on those who feel that PR leads to an undue multiplicity to show it does so in the circumstances of Ireland today and is likely to do so in the Ireland in the 70's. The onus is here to show what will be the effect of our present system if we hold to it in the Ireland of the 70's and after. If we want to make a comparison what we should do is compare the two systems put before us at present, the present system of PR and the relative majority system which is being proposed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>How can we go about this? How can we compare these particular methods? We can, of course, look at what has happened in this country. We can make prognostications of what might happen in this country in the 70's. We can look at the present position in countries which have a system of PR although no country has one which is really close to ours. We can look at countries which are operating the relative majority system. It is, of course, <Col N="1237" /> always a dangerous thing to transfer from one country to another, to say that because something has happened in one country it will not necessarily happen in another. Nevertheless, if anyone can point to a consequence which has occurred in a country which is clearly traceable to a particular electoral system, then I think we should take it into account in our assessment of what might be the effect of a change of system in this country.</P>
