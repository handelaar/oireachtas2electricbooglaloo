      <P>I am very glad that the Minister has brought in this amendment because I think it does improve the Bill and maintains the authority of Parliament over these orders when made. I am sorry that the Minister did not avail himself of the services of the Parliamentary draftsmen to make the amendments that we were suggesting to 7 and 8. I had found it quite difficult to work out the kind of amendment that would have been agreeable to the Minister if they had been put down but it was not possible, I think, for the ordinary person to put them into parliamentary language. However, I am grateful that the Minister has introduced this particular amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Bill, as amended, received for final consideration.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to some of the points raised during the Committee Stage debate, particularly in connection with the definition of the words &ldquo;performance&rdquo; and &ldquo;performer&rdquo; Some doubts and, indeed, perplexity were shown in the House on that occasion. I have looked into this <Col N="411" /> matter and the position appears to be that the reference in the definition of the word &ldquo;performance&rdquo; to electrical means relates to the manner in which the performance is rendered audible or visible. It has been necessary to define the word &ldquo;performance&rdquo; in a mechanical performance because of the possibility of confusion arising where the person, the compère or the disc jockey, operates the mechanical device. The reference to electrical relates only to the manner in which the performance is rendered audible or visible and not to the performance itself.</P>
      <P>In connection with a point raised under section 4, the provisions of this Bill are to the effect that a record made without consent in a country in which consent is required is deemed to be in contravention of our Act. If it is dealt in commercially or used in broadcasting here in this country it is not a matter for the Irish authorities but for the performer himself to initiate proceedings against the dealer or user and to prove to the satisfaction of the court that the record was made unlawfully abroad. The performer must be presumed to know what the law is in his own country where the record was made.</P>
      <P>There may have been some confusion in which it may have been thought that the onus was being put on a performer in this country to establish what the law is in another country. This is not so. A performer in another country seeking to institute proceedings in this country will have to prove what the law is in his country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to section 8, some dissatisfaction with the wording was expressed. I admit that in the section the words &ldquo;which appear to the court to have been made in contravention of this Act or to be adapted for the making of records in contravention of this Act&rdquo; may possibly be somewhat superfluous but not to the extent to be clearly that they were. On the other hand, I do not think they are superfluous to the extent that it would be necessary or, indeed, desirable to delete them. I say that because this section is on the lines of a similar section in the 1958 British Act. There is a great deal to be said particularly in this field of performers' protection for having as far as possible the laws of this country and the laws of Britain on the same lines.</P>
      <P>Indeed, we have subscribed to a Convention on the unification of the law and undertaken as far as possible to have our laws conform with those in other countries. Particularly in the case of Britain there is a great deal to be said for having, where possible, the same wording in this field so that judicial proceedings will tend to be fairly well uniform and that the people who will be concerned not only in this country but in Britain can be reasonably sure where they stand under the judicial interpretation relating to the laws of performers' protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On section 9, I think Senator Yeats mentioned the freedom which was given in relation to the inclusion of a performance by way of background in a record or film. The Convention does not make specific provision for this but it does provide that a contracting State may provide for &ldquo;the same kind of limitations with regard to the protection of performers ... as it provides for... in connection with the protection of copyright in literary or artistic works&rdquo;. In section 14 (4) of the Copyright Act, 1963, there is provision for freedom for the inclusion of an artistic work in a film or television broadcast by way of background. An artistic work under the Copyright Act is, of course, a visual work and could not form the background to a record or sound broadcast but the inclusion of a performance without consent by way of background in the exemption given <Col N="413" /> by section 9 of this Bill is in accordance with the Convention and follows on the lines of the provisions of the Copyright Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>Finally, some Senators referred to the misspelling of the word &ldquo;principal&rdquo; in section 9 (b). The Seanad Office had already noted this for correction in the next printing of the Bill. I may just add that the matter is under control.</P>

      <P>The managing authority is defined as the authority responsible for the management, control, operation and maintenance of the harbour. Under section 4 (2) subparagraph (d) the Minister is empowered to appoint such number of officers and servants as he deems necessary for the purpose and provide for their powers, functions and duties. I wonder are those people going to be officers of the Minister's Department? Will they be civil servants or officers used in a different sense? In other words, will the managing authority be purely a Civil Service body or will they be what one might call semi-State employees?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, the Minister could tell us why it was <Col N="414" /> necessary for him to give this authority completely to his Department rather than set up an appropriate semi-State body which could be organised on much more technological lines than the present scheme seems to imply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing would be in relation to what is the job to be done in regard to those harbours. It arises on other points as to why we should have this legislation at all. There is undoubtedly evidence that the authorities as at present constituted do not have the power to do certain jobs or have not the wish to do them and taking over the management of it in the manner the Bill provides at this particular time seems the appropriate thing to do. It may well be that the development of these harbours and all that goes with them on the fishing side might in future bring about a situation as to whether some such authority as Senator Quinlan mentioned might then be appropriate. I do not think that at this stage there is any real reason why it should be set up to do a job which has not yet arisen.</P>

      <P>I asked on Second Stage if the Minister would contemplate publishing in the form of a White Paper a statement giving an indication as to what, in fact, are his plans for each of these sections, with regard to the land to be taken over, the buildings to be provided, and so on. It is important that the people should know what the Minister has in mind. Very often when the Government make adequate and suitable plans they fail to consult sufficiently with local interests. There should be a communication on their intentions so that there may be opportunity for comment on them with regard to development in a more suitable manner for the needs of the fishing in the particular area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said earlier, the making of the order under section 2 would go right through the section with regard to the making of that <Col N="415" /> order, and that would then be considered to be the appropriate time to refer to the things proposed to be done. I mentioned in the House also on Second Stage that it is felt by us that such indication by way of publicising of such an order would be sufficient indication and would be clear enough as to what was intended to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not recall the Minister saying that on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did. Perhaps my recollection is slipping but I did think so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. One of us is at fault; it may be either of us. I am wondering whether the order which is a very formal document laying down the minimum information would give adequately the kind of picture which would be planned. I would imagine the order would say that the Minister would take over a certain amount of land but what he will do with it, the shape of buildings, and so on, is something which would not go into the order as far as I can imagine. I wonder whether at that time the Minister could issue a statement in some form stating what is planned in such an order. Perhaps the time to do that is when the order is published but I do not think the order itself would be sufficient to give guidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is, in fact, anticipating what the operation would entail. If that order is to be made under the Act undoubtedly it will not be the order itself as such that would give the information. Usually it would be known what is sought to be done, and asked and requested to be done, for some considerable time before we got around to taking the steps to make the order. If things were obscure at the point of time of the making of the order, undoubtedly they would be clarified. If it is any assistance to the House in seeing it in the light I see it, if such informations are not already self-evident, as it were, I will take steps to ensure that they will be evident <Col N="416" /> at the time of making such an order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is provided in section 6 that where the Minister makes a draft order objections may be made to it and that the objections shall be in writing stating the improvements and modifications asked for and then the Minister will consider these. It occurs to me that the Minister might be able to deal with this by way of undertaking. Very often it is very difficult within the confines of any written document for any group of persons to set out what their main objections are or why they think the draft order should be in a particular way rather than the way in which it is drafted. I wonder whether the Minister would be disposed to delegate an officer of his Department, if he did not have time himself, to meet people who would appear to have substantial grounds for objection and who would request to be received so that they could give, apart from what may be incorporated in a memorandum, an elaboration on what they have written. I think I see a situation in which you cannot fully deal with what is in a written objection and the validity of an objection and its strength will come out in discussion across the table. Will the Minister be prepared to undertake that one of his officers, in an appropriate case, will meet people who have a desire to discuss objections which they have put in in writing in the first instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Senator has suggested is a reasonable operation and, indeed, one which would very likely be followed. If we got observations that the order was not clear and did not seem to be made clear by people writing, some such operation as suggested by the Senator would be adopted in such a case. I should like to point out that where objections are being submitted and are not subsequently withdrawn it is provided that the Minister can hold a public inquiry and this, of course, will be to elicit probably rather different information which would be extremely difficult to get across by either written submission or <Col N="417" /> by verbal exchange as between an officer of the Minister and a given person. I think the House can take it that the provision there for power to hold a public inquiry does not impede the possibility of some of these in-between systems that might be better such as a verbal exchange of views to supplement something that may have already been indicated to us or prescribed in writing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of that. I think it is the attitude that will be adopted and one that will be very helpful. There is another thing in relation to the inquiry that will be held. If a person is given power to take evidence on oath, it does not follow that he is empowered to administer oaths. There is a whole code of legislation as to the people who are empowered to administer oaths. It seems to me that something should be said in section 6. I thought that was not in. I had read it twice but I did not find it. I see now that the point is covered.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (3) contains the familiar code under which compensation, in parenthesis, is paid to persons where land is acquired by any public authority. The code is the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919. I had occasion previously to refer to this code. Senators ought to know what the code provides and there is a long case called Comyn versus the Minister for Industry and Commerce reported in the <i>Irish Reports.</i> The reason why that case was fought so vigorously was that the Minister, or his legal advisers at the time, wanted to have the compensation, which was to be payable to that man for the compulsory acquisition of certain property of his in County Clare during the Emergency, assessed under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, whereas Mr. <Col N="418" /> Comyn, the plaintiff, wanted to have it assessed by the courts or alternatively under the Land Clauses Acts.</P>
      <P>The reason the Department at that time sought to have the 1919 Act applied for the purpose of determining compensation was that Mr. Comyn would thereby get a great deal less compensation than he would get if other standards for measuring his compensation were applied to him. Anybody who is familiar with the operation of the 1919 Act knows that when compensation is calculated under that Act the person gets merely the market value of the property being acquired, and the market value of the property being acquired compulsorily is by no means adequate for the property owner because, if he owned a little shed where he is carrying on certain business in relation to a harbour or a fishery and he had plans for expanding in the future, and that plot is acquired, the 1919 Act sets out that all he is entitled to get is the market value of that property.</P>
      <P>The property may be only a few roods and the market value of a few roods of land might be only £50 or £60, but the value to me who wants to expand my business, may be far in excess, and that is where the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, is, in my view, most unfair to the landowner. The same thing would apply if a county council came in on somebody's property on a highway and brought the road right up to the person's door, cutting out the garden and the privacy the person had. The person would get the market value of a few perches of ground but not the value of that land to that person. It is not assessable, it is not reckonable, under the 1919 Act, whereas if the code were such and if the provision were such that it took account of the value of the land to the person from whom it was being acquired compulsorily, it would in my view do what would be fair play to the owner of the land. Though the difference would be substantial in relation to the landowner, in terms of public acquisition of the land it would always be a minor matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know enough and I have <Col N="419" /> not had an opportunity of looking up sections 69 to 83 of the 1845 Act which are intended to measure compensation, but the Minister might be able to assure me that this Bill incorporates the kind of provisions that will enable the owner of land to get the value of the land to him when the land is being acquired compulsorily. As I have said, I do not know enough offhand about the provisions of the 1845 Act to say whether these are the facts. I should be very happy if that is so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The general approach to this matter of land acquisition for public purposes, whether by local authorities, Government Departments or what have you, is that it is agreed acquisition which is normally sought. It is only when it is not possible to get such agreement&mdash;this very often has to do with the method of compensation&mdash; that recourse is had to the 1919 Act. If the 1919 Act is wrong, then I do not think it is for us here, in this measure, to propose the alteration in it. We may propose it but there is not a lot we can do about it. I have always held that the emphasis in any acquisition by a public authority, State or local, should be to get an agreed deal done. That is a far, far better thing in many respects than having to have recourse to compulsory acquisition with an arbitrary figure being set. It is to be understood that any lands or property proposed to be taken under this measure will be subject at least to the same rights as in any other context where land is being taken over by public bodies. Only in the last analysis, when it has not been possible to reach agreement, will the question of the 1919 Act and its effect on compensation really enter the picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think this or any other code is abused in so far as these matters are concerned. Very often it is true that one might say the reverse can be the case&mdash;that people might unreasonably hold up unduly the acquisition of land, regardless of the offers of compensation, land that could be of very great value to the public. That happens far more often than the situation in respect of which Senator <Col N="420" /> O'Quigley has been expressing fears. In this measure, the same pattern is very likely to emerge&mdash;that we would have the unreasonable person more often than an unreasonable public authority, to the detriment of the public interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The vast majority of most kinds of legal relationships between people are disposed of by sensible people in a sensible and orderly way and without recourse, very often, to lawyers, the courts or independent arbitrators. One finds an area, relatively small, where for one reason or another there is a strong divergence of opinion and that can well apply in relation to the value of a piece of land. It certainly applies where the land has a particular value to the individual.</P>
      <P>If it is a whole farm of land that is being sold or taken over there is very little difficulty about what happens in the case of the claimants, because the auctioneers and the owners have a fair idea of what the prices are and after a bit of bargaining an agreement is reached. But if it is only part of the farm that is being taken over, perhaps the best field is being acquired, then that is a different thing. How do you assess the value of the best field of a small farm for the man concerned? That is the kind of area where you run into difficulties. The market value of the field may be £400 but the landowner has to find another similar field adjacent to his farm and may have to pay £800 or £900 for it. It is in that kind of area that one finds that people fear going to an arbitrator to have it decided. That is precisely the kind of loss of value to the landholder which may not be taken into account under the 1919 Act. That is precisely the kind of loss he has to grin and bear for the benefit of the public weal. There is no auctioneer or lawyer concerned with the operation of the 1919 Act who does not declare every time on one side or the other that it is most unsatisfactory and unfair in its operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that it cannot be amended under this Bill, but, of course, it can. The Statute Books are <Col N="421" /> strewn with references to this Act of 1919, with new rules incorporated in the schedules in order to deal with that particular form of acquisition. I think it occurs in the Derelict Sites Act and also in the Planning and Development Act, 1963. If the Minister wanted to he could well accept an amendment which should be in order, I have no doubt, to this particular Bill in order to ensure that people get appropriate compensation. What I do say is this, that one has always to declare that one is not speaking as a lawyer but as a legislator with the experience of a lawyer in dealing with this kind of claim. We all know that in the vast majority of cases where land is acquired by the Land Commission, in 90 per cent of the cases perhaps the price of the land is agreed between the landholder and the Land Commission. It is in about ten per cent of cases that the price is not agreed, and there is a very simple procedure whereby a person applies to the appeal tribunal presided over by a judge of the High Court and on practically every Friday morning in the High Court a landholder who may have land valued at £600 or £700, or £300, comes in before the judge of the High Court, the auctioneer and the inspector give evidence and the matter is disposed of in half an hour with very little cost to anybody. That system gives tremendous satisfaction to all concerned. It is an extremely fair system because the learned judge of the appeal tribunal has great experience in this particular field and there is nobody who is present at these assessments of compensation who is not impressed by the fairness, and everybody knows that the landholder gets a fair deal and the full market value. But we all know that no arbitrator sitting under the Act of 1919, even if he wanted to, can give the landholder the compensation to which he is entitled. The rules set out in the Act of 1919 prohibit him from giving compensation in particular areas.</P>
    <P>People will hear what I am saying and will know cases where people have not got adequate compensation, but I am afraid that very few people are prepared to do anything about it except to extend sympathy to people when <Col N="422" /> they are affected afterwards. The 1919 Act is an unfair measure, and its unfairness to the landholder is to be seen in the figures of compensation provided by the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I have no doubt that what I have said will fall upon the Minister with no great result. I should also like to direct the attention of the House to subsection (4) which provides that all claims for compensation in respect of any land or right acquired under the section shall be made within one year after the land or right is first entered on or exercised under the section. These rigid periods of a year or three months or six months always cause trouble. One always finds, for whatever reason except that it is a part of the makeup of human nature, that people who are entitled to money will fooster around and have discussions and fail to put their claim in in writing within the statutory period. One has seen that and has seen people lose hundreds of pounds, and in some cases thousands, because they did not put in their claim in time.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that in this case there will always be somebody late and hardship will occur. Therefore, I suggest that the Minister should accept an amendment to make it within one year or such longer period as the Minister may consider reasonable or may allow to enable that period to be extended. In the Landlord and Tenant Act one finds provision for extending periods where people failed to put in a claim for a new tenancy, and one finds it too in the Workmen's Compensation Act, now deceased to the loss of every employee as we are now hearing and as we prophesied here about the Occupational Injuries Act and how unsatisfactorily it is working. Even in that Act there was provision for extending the period of time. I would certainly put down an amendment to give some authority some latitude in relation to the extension of the period within which to lodge a claim. In subsection (8) we find that the powers of compulsory acquisition conferred on the Minister by this section shall not extend to land or rights vested in the State, a Minister of State or the Land <Col N="423" /> Commission and so on. I wonder why not. Why should the Land Commission not be liable to have land vested in them by virtue of a compulsory acquisition order that they have made being required for a harbour authority, and why should not the Land Commission be liable to have that land taken over compulsorily, or, indeed, any Minister of State or the ESB? There is no reason that they should not, and the Land Commission are about the greatest holders of land in the country.</P>

      <P>As regards subsection (3), if, as I say, there are faults in the 1919 Act they are of much more general application and affect far more people than the results of this measure. It would be a more appropriate thing that the 1919 Act should be sought to be remedied rather than that we should start something new here under this particular head. If it is felt strongly that this is affecting people at the moment it should be followed under that head. In the adoption of the 1919 Act procedure I was doing so knowingly and with full knowledge that it has been applied over the years since 1919 with a great deal of success and that what was suitable for this large number of cases is suitable for the type of cases that might arise under this Bill. As regards subsection (4) and this matter of a year and the possibility of the Minister being given power to extend the time, and quoting other enactments where extensions of time are provided for, the fact, and the only real fact, is, that no matter what time is fixed there will be people late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If people choose to be late whether it be a year or ten years, I do not see how we can provide for continuing a situation wherein we provide a longer time for those who will be late. Regardless of what length of time is fixed this type of person will be late and they are just as likely to be late if it is five, ten or twenty years or whatever the fixed period might be. With regard to the suggestion that there should be power to enable the time to be extended in this particular measure here, <Col N="424" /> I should imagine as distinct, for instance, from the other enactments mentioned by the Senator in regard to the renewal of a tenancy, a tenancy could have been running for some generations, hundreds of years perhaps or at least a long number of years and, therefore, the lack of knowledge of its impending cessation or closure might not be so evident as will be the operations under this particular measure which would yet have to take place and immediately after would be open to the aggrieved parties or parties of claims to be aware of it and then giving them the 12 months after the operation had been applied. If they are not aware of it at that stage I do not know when they are going to be aware of it.</P>
    <P>If it is just purely the dilatoriness of human nature as is put forward by Senator O'Quigley as one of the possible reasons why this should happen, no matter what length of time is set out it still would not be long enough. I think that a year is long enough. I think we have only got to consider what is a reasonable time to give and I think that a year is not only reasonable but anybody who has not got around to making a claim which they feel they have within 12 months after a happening, then I do not think there is anything we can do by way of legislation to get these people to do their own business in any time that we set out. I still feel that a year is more than reasonable and extending the period longer than a year into the future would, I think, have other disadvantages in that it would mean that an acquisition and any compensation or rights to be paid for could not be finally wound up until after whatever period we had set out. I feel this would be a messy and unnecessary operation without any great good accruing from it and for that reason I would be inclined to leave the thing as it is in the belief that it is more than reasonable in so far as what we are trying to maintain is concerned.</P>
    <P>In so far as subsection (8) is concerned the mention here is why leave out the Land Commission, the semi-State bodies, the local authorities and <Col N="425" /> so on. I suppose we could, first of all, say that this is a customary provision which has been inserted in, I think, all our legislation over the years and we are continuing the practice. As to the basis for this practice, I should imagine straight off that all of these bodies are to one degree or another within, as it were, the competence or jurisdiction of some element of Government whether directly or indirectly and that instead of having legal paraphernalia to solve problems as between elements of the same State institutions that there is the more sensible arrangement that these elements get together, being all in the nature of a public service and that the ultimate good for the greatest number is what would be the determining factor in the mind of both sides in an issue such as this.</P>
    <P>It is on that sensible basis that we have the customary provision that I am asking the House to have inserted in the Bill in the knowledge that such a provision in other legislation has worked out and has not thrown up any case wherein something that could and should go on if only the property was in hands other than the hands of these bodies because it is in their hands does not go on. We have no evidence that that has been so. Indeed, if there was evidence of this, the provision would long since have ceased to be put into legislation of this sort and would have been repealed in legislation in which it occurred. The pattern is as I have said and the sensible approach to it has been this provision. I have no reason to believe that there would be any departure from that sort of approach in the solution of any problem that might arise in regard to any of these fishery harbour centres.</P>
    <P>For that reason I would not agree at all that there is any need for this. I do not think it arises. If there was need I would certainly not have come to the House and asked to have this provision passed.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister was for a short period of his career a civil servant. I was for a period of my career a civil servant and I know the procedures of the Civil Service well, in a way, perhaps, that no matter how <Col N="426" /> long you are a Minister of State you will never get to know the procedures because you must be way down there and see what is happening. When the Minister says that two Departments of State can get together and agree sensibly as to who is to have what, he certainly is not speaking from experience because I have seen in my time files six inches and nine inches thick with memoranda, reports of architects, reports of engineers, comments, further reports, further comments and so on between two Departments as to who is liable to pay sixpence. That is not an exaggeration and when it comes to ceding land just fancy the Department of Defence being asked to cede a bit of land to the Department of Agriculture and the Lands Branch of the Department of Defence telling the Minister for Agriculture where he gets off. Every Department of State is as jealous about its property and about what is going to be put on to its Vote as if they were not part at all of the same undertaking. When it comes to the Land Commission, well the Land Commission was to have been disbanded 40 years ago and it is still a thriving industry, so thriving, in fact, that they are now going to transplant it in Castlebar.</P>

I am glad that the Minister has that view of the persons who serve the Government and serve the public, that they are a sensible body. Mind you, in every one of these memoranda the arguments are convincing. They go a little stage further and the counter argument is quite convincing and then a little further again and so the memoranda pile up. However, I hope that if it becomes necessary and the Minister is aware of this kind of codology going on, the Land Commission holding on to a bit of land needed for the development of the fishing industry in a particular harbour, that he will come back into the House with the necessary amending legislation. Mind you, it <Col N="427" /> does not do to say that the Minister for Lands will talk to the Minister for Agriculture. That will not happen either because the Ministers will have to be guided by their own officials and each, like good Ministers, will defend the view of his own Department. However we will leave it at that.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to agree with the Minister&mdash;and this is something that does not happen very often&mdash;that no matter what period one fixes for the making of a claim for compensation you will always have somebody who will be late and the Minister and myself are at one as to why this is so but I would ask the Minister to do what is now being done to the Act which the Minister had a major part in, the Local Government Planning and Development Act, of compulsorily incorporating in a notification that a person has a particular right and that they should be notified of that right, the right to claim, within 12 months.</P>
      <P>Therefore I would suggest to the Minister that when he or the managing authority enters upon any land that he should notify the owner and occupier and that he should also notify them that they have the right to claim compensation under section 3 of the Act within one year of the time they enter on the land. That should not present any great difficulty but suppose somebody has emigrated and is not to be found. They hear from the neighbours that the Government or Minister were in on their land, they come home at Christmas and then they find that it is 13 months since the first day on which the Minister went in. Such people are out and they have no remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a person is abroad, or ill, or in a mental hospital a case can be made that that person cannot make his claim within the year and there should be some provision in the Bill to enable the claim to be exercised where a reasonable cause is shown for the delay. That is not unreasonable. The <Col N="428" /> majority of the incorrigible late claimants could be dealt with because they could not show any reasonable cause for the delay. I would have no sympathy with such people but I would have sympathy with persons who had emigrated, who were ill or who were in a mental hospital.</P>

I should like to ask the Minister if we are going to reach the stage where it will be possible to purchase fish retail on the spot at these centres. There is at present a ridiculous system under which fish may be landed at Galway but you cannot buy it retail where it is landed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an interesting point to this question of the retail purchase of fish at the landing points. Neither can you purchase a box of matches where it is made, and there are good reasons for this. If fish are to <Col N="429" /> be sold at any landing point and are auctioned the buyers will be retailers from the local towns and cities. I am sure that if fish were to be sold retail off the boats this would be resented very much by the retailers whose custom at the wholesale market would be essential if you were to have an auction on the pier. These are the considerations you have to keep in mind when you ask the question as to whether fish can be sold retail at the landing point.</P>
      <P>In making a realistic appreciation of this matter, I realise quite clearly that to make a promise that this could be done would be making a promise that would not be capable of being kept and I do not like making promises that I cannot keep. The sale of fish by retail at the landing points could work against the best interests of the fishermen and their interests are of primary importance to me and to this measure. If the facility can be provided with advantage to all concerned then let us do our best to arrange that such a facility can be provided. It would be a very nice thing for those who are able to proceed to the pier at the time of a landing of fish and buy the fish from the boats but such people can only be a very small and select part of the population. If we can provide this facility without hurting anybody or without hurting the fishing industry as a whole it would be well worthy of consideration but to make the promise that it will be done is something I could not do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>It does appear that there may be some improvement because, under the Bill, instead of there being only one fish market there will be five. There will be some improvement in that. I see from another section that the Minister is going to make bye-laws. A variety of these will have to be made to deal with the operation and development of the centres and in sub-section (6) the Minister says:</P>
      <P>A person who contravenes a provision of an order or bye-law under this section shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is fair enough but the fact that <Col N="430" /> strikes me is that these bye-laws and orders are going to give rise for a prosecution for an offence and, at the same time, they are not being laid before either House of the Oireachtas, although they are making a criminal offence. I would ask the Minister why they are not going to be laid before the House under section 10.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not of the same importance and the making of them need not have any lasting irrevocable consequences, whereas the orders made under the other section would have an irrevocable quality about them and should, therefore, be laid before the House so that there would not be any danger in them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that any kind of order that warrants any punishment or involves the imposition of a penalty amounting to £100 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months, or both, is sufficiently important to be laid before either House of the Oireachtas. It seems to me, and I think the Minister would agree with me, that it should be included in section 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so much the question of their importance. As I was emphasising, it would be their irrevocable nature as was indicated in an earlier section. There is nothing irrevocable about those. As time goes on undoubtedly changes might be necessary and if for any reason it was found at any time to be unsuitable to the circumstances, then, as I say, the very fact that they did exist would not at times prevent their being <Col N="431" /> changed. Those type of regulations refer to the setting up of certain physical works on roads adjacent to the ports. If the order were capable of being changed it could only be changed at a very great expense of time and money but in the case of the bye-laws there will be time to bring about changes in those and they would be capable of being changed and no damage need necessarily be done by them. They could be good in themselves at the outset and fall to be renewed, amended or revoked at any given time by the passage of time and the change of circumstances.</P>
      <P>They are, as I said, not to be related to the others that have been quoted here as being laid before the House of the Oireachtas. It is not a question of importance. The question of the £100 fine is important but it is the laying of the bye-laws that the Senator has in mind. It is only the consequence of the breaking of those, to which one might take objection, that brings in the question of the £100 fine. It has to be done in two ways. One is the making of the bye-law and the other is the breaking of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite appreciate the distinction. Once the order takes effect it is irrevocable. Then there is the fact that regulations and so on in relation to any particular harbour may be changed at any time. For instance, if one thinks of the Planning Act of 1963 the Minister there has power to make a variety of regulations. Equally so, the Minister has power to amend and revoke those regulations if circumstances change and perhaps even when the order or regulation was made it did not quite do what the Minister wanted it to do and it had to be redrafted. I can think, for instance, of the regulation which was made under the Planning Act fixing the payments that were to be made by the local authorities and the Minister for Local Government in respect of petrol pumps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember that particular order was brought before the Dáil. I do not know whether the Minister changed it or not at the time, having had <Col N="432" /> second thoughts. At any rate, the Dáil had the right to bring in that and say: &ldquo;The charges you are making for every single item of equipment in a petrol station are much too high and the cost of the licence fixed is unfair&rdquo;. Equally so, it might well be that there would be a particular view in relation to rates or at least on charges that might be fixed or some order that would be made by the Minister or advice that might be difficult to work or too difficult to observe and those would impose great obligations on people and they should be revoked or it certainly should be possible to have the matter debated in the Dáil or the Seanad. It is certainly necessary also because the breach of any of those bye-laws or orders will bring with them a penalty of up to £100 and that kind of bye-law, not because it is going to be permanent but because it is important, should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. I do not think the Minister dealt with that aspect but I think that is the right point of view from which it should be regarded.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the case made by Senator O'Quigley. I had thought this, going through the the Bill, as something that was rather strange and out of line with the orders under section 4 which are excluded from being laid before the House. Apart from the penalties involved, there is also a scheme under subsection (7) (v) by which the Minister publishes locally certain of the bye-laws but then, having received the local objections or suggestions on those under section 5, he can do whatever he thinks fit. In other words, he can ignore them if he wishes.</P>
      <P>It is only right and proper, therefore, that an opportunity should be afforded to discuss the orders in the Houses of the Oireachtas. This is a power which we should guard especially in a Bill in which we are giving so much blanket powers to the Minister. We should keep this modicum of control by amending this when we come to section 10 to ensure that all orders are laid before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things which rather surprises me is that local authority <Col N="433" /> bye-laws are not required to be laid before Houses. Mind you, they can be and are of a very controversial nature. They can be quite important and embrace a great many matters which might be regarded as infringement of established rights of a great number of our people. It is strange that they can be dealt with in this manner and yet in the making of bye-laws and the making of orders under this particular section, as distinct from the other section earlier, under this section it is provided that they can be amended or revoked. In the case of the bye-laws it has not been necessary to say they may be revoked or amended because in the 1927 interpretation Act this is understood to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other thing, of course, which I think I mentioned on an earlier stage of the Bill is that those bye-laws and orders under this section will be published in full in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> so that from the outset there is an opportunity, if it should miss anybody's notice, that it will not and secondly, as I say, the battle can be taken on if ever such would be needed, to correct, if it was a mistaken matter, which is unlikely because, as Senator O'Quigley said, none of this is lightly undertaken by a Department of State. All civil servants write a great deal. In fact, they write mostly everything they think when it comes to their transmitting the right to us. They do not, as some of us foolishly do at times, depend on their memories as to what took place and why it took place. They usually set that down at the time. If these pass from one to the other there is no doubt that at the end of the day and in the last analysis in all matters and in this matter specifically there will be a full record built up stage by stage as to why these things were decided in a particular way, how they came to be argued out and what the merits and demerits were or proposals indicating what bye-laws or orders may be. They are not done lightly or hastily and are subject to and capable of rectification or amendment, both as to the orders and as to the bye-laws. I do not see the dangers which are suggested here arising at all. I do not see that the <Col N="434" /> precedent, for instance, in regard to local authority bye-laws arises. They do not claim to be required to be laid before the Houses here and they are all as onerous and far-reaching and are very much more general in their application than this particular measure which applies only to particular sectors of five all of which are unanimously agreed to require to have a great deal done to them quickly to facilitate development of the fishing industry in this country. To do things which are capable of being done there is nobody enabled to do them, financially speaking, or who has the wish to do them even if they had the way of doing them. The manner of procedure here is in accordance with the relative importance of what is proposed to be done by those bye-laws and orders and setting it apart from the very important orders as outlined in section 2 which does require that they be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The question I wish to raise might well be valid on section 9. It is in relation to accounts in the fishery harbour centres.

      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General's job relates to his requirements in relation to accountability for moneys. His job is to see that nobody pinches the money. He has not to initial the accounts of semi-commercial activities undertaken by Government Departments. They are not in a form which is considered acceptable. They do not set out the accounts in a balance sheet form. The accounts he deals with are the accounts of Government Departments. He accepts the accounts and the revenue and expenditure as stated there. He may well have a prejudice for this kind of data in a balance sheet form. What I am concerned about is that these harbours will be run as a commercial enterprise of some kind. In those circumstances, I do not think we should have a post office type of position in which all the expenditure has to be voted by the Dáil on the one hand and all the revenue on the other and there is no account of what the capital investment or the current revenue and expenditure is. It is precisely because the Comptroller and Auditor General is involved and is antipathetic to the commercial approach that I raise this matter.</P>

      <P>I do not think we are on the same point. If a body such as a commercial enterprise or a statutory board were to present their accounts in a form which is appropriate such bodies should present their accounts in the form I have mentioned, that is, with a balance sheet, stating assets and liabilities and the current and profit and loss account or whatever it may be. In some cases he audits these in the form in which they are presented. He does not require that the commercial activities of State bodies are not presented in that form. All he is asked to do is see whether somebody is pinching the money or whether it is used properly for the purpose for which it is promoted. He has no function to require that commercial accounts be produced for enterprises of this kind. It is because of that I want the Minister to ensure that the accounts will be produced in the form in which An Bord Iascaigh Mhara produce their accounts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General does not accept generally anything and everything that is put to him by State boards. He has on several occasions suggested alterations and alternative methods of presentation if they do not satisfy him as to how he is doing his job. If the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries feel that there are certain suggestions in regard to the accounting and the checking of these accounts by the Comptroller and Auditor General, which we felt would give a knowledge which we would wish to have on the overall operation, control, management and well-being of these particular centres, there is no reason why we should not and will not indicate to the Comptroller and Auditor General the changes we wish to have. This is anticipated and presumably if he will not do his job in a way that would give us a commercial picture, then we would undoubtedly <Col N="437" /> be seeking that these informations would be made available to him and if necessary we would make the necessary suggestions and promptings to him to see that this situation was brought about. That is what the Senator is concerned about&mdash;that we should not have a stereotyped accounting system that did not disclose the real position.</P>
      <P>In the operation of the harbours, it is a commercial position rather than the operation of a Government Department in the goings and the comings and the movement of what was voted and what went out. What the Senator fears will not and cannot be allowed to happen. It would be contrary to our whole approach to the commercial well being of a venture in its preparation and its workings.</P>

      <P>Is not the Comptroller and Auditor General somewhat hamstrung by the provisions of sub-section (1) which provides that the accounts will be in such form as may be approved by the Minister for Finance? If the Minister for Finance says the usual kind of accounts shall be kept to show that no moneys have been misappropriated, the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot do anything about it. I do not say he will, but if the Minister for Finance chose to have the more simple type of public Department accounts kept, the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot do anything about it because the accounts are being kept in the form approved by the Minister for Finance. The Minister is nearly going the whole way with Senator FitzGerald.</P>

      <P>He is coming round. What clearly should be done, and I rather think what the Minister is saying will be done, is that the ordinary commercial accounts will be kept in relation to each centre and that they will set a target for the managing authority of the centre when they know what the position was last year. They will know that the public, the Members of the Oireachtas, are keeping an eye on them. That is the hope of the <Col N="438" /> Minister but he has not gone the distance of saying so, perhaps because he does not know what the Minister for Finance will prescribe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's closing remarks seem to be accepting that what I was aiming at is what he is trying to do. Earlier, the Minister seemed to be speaking as if the Comptroller and Auditor General was the person who kept the accounts and that he would ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to prepare the accounts in a suitable form. The fact is that the section we are dealing with provides that the Minister shall keep the accounts, not personally perhaps, but through his agents, in a form approved by the Minister for Finance. They then will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. What I am concerned about is that the Minister prepares his accounts. It is his responsibility under this section to prepare the accounts, a commercial form with balance sheet and profit and loss account. The Comptroller and Auditor General's role is to audit them and see that they are prepared in accordance with legislative requirements. Those requirements could be easily met because they are so vaguely expressed here, either by lumping everything in with no balance sheet or by having a commercial type account.</P>
      <P>If either of these would meet the requirements of the Comptroller and Auditor General, he has no function. Of course he might advise that a different method should be adopted in the future but he has no power to require anything if the vague requirements of this subsection are met. What I am concerned about is the Minister's preparation of the accounts. Is it his intention that his Department will prepare the accounts in the form I have suggested for submission to the Comptroller and Auditor General and that they will then be subject to the usual discussions with the Comptroller and the Auditor General to see that they meet the requirements of accountability? Is that the Minister's intention?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that I am not misleading myself but if I have misled the House I am sorry. What we have been talking about is the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General. What I have said in regard to him is, that being an experienced and responsible officer, he will in so far as possible seek to have, if necessary, changes made in the keeping of accounts so as to fulfil his function. In addition, it is true to say that subsection (1) provides that the Minister for Agriculture shall keep or cause to be kept accounts in such form as may be prescribed by the Minister for Finance, but it does not provide that if the requirements of the Minister for Finance are so lightly dealt with as to fail to disclose the commercial well-being or otherwise of the harbour&mdash;I know the requirements of the Minister for Finance will not so fail&mdash;there is nothing in subsections (1) or (2) to prevent the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries seeing to it that the accounts are kept in a proper manner as far as he and his agents are concerned.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly the nature of this whole venture will make it one in which the really vital element will be its commercial well being&mdash;how is it going on, what way is it doing, is it losing or gaining, making up ground or losing ground, what are its assets, what has gone into it, will it be viable or otherwise? This is the essential pattern which will decide if we are to expand the harbour, which we will not do blindly. We must know once a year how much money went in and how much came out. We must satisfy general accounting procedure in relation to a Department of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must know once a year if we are succeeding in what we have attempted to do. We must have a measure as to whether the gain was worth the candle, and I can assure the House that neither I nor anyone <Col N="440" /> who succeeds me will embark on this sort of operation without at least keeping a very close eye to see whether it is getting where it was proposed to go or whether it is dying or failing, in which case we should have to decide whether it should be scrapped or whether the gap should be closed. It is so fundamental to the whole exercise that perhaps I underestimated what Senator FitzGerald is seeking. However, I shall state fully and finally that irrespective of whether the Comptroller and Auditor General or the Minister for Finance seek the information about the commercial well being of the enterprise, the Minister for Agriculture will make very sure that he is made aware fully, each year at least, of the commercial account as to what the state of the enterprise is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my introduction on the last day I pointed out how the present measure called for a great <Col N="441" /> degree of prior consultation with those in a position to advise on the proper means of selection of students for university work, and that this has not been done, unfortunately, and that the present scheme has all the hallmarks of and suffers from all the sad defects following from this lack of consultation. I am sorry to say that the lack of consultation follows a pattern evident in the recent work of the Department of Education. If we are serious in getting down to the challenge of education in the present times we can learn much from looking across the Border and seeing how they approach their problems. The attitude of the Department of Education in believing that they know all the answers is wrong and that we must have adequate and proper consultations at all levels in the future.</P>
      <P>A grave defect in the present scheme is the way in which it is based on the leaving certificate with the stipulation of four honours. The main defect in this is that no test at present could be as unequal or lacking in uniformity as the leaving certificate, because it depends so much on the type of teaching available in the schools. We all know that a gifted teacher like some of the teachers who are available in some of the very large schools in our big cities can increase substantially the performance of any student entrusted to their care. In the university when we look at the performance of students coming in we are more inclined to look at the school they came from, and very often find that students who have been crammed and given very intensive teaching do not live up to their leaving certificate performance in subsequent work, whereas students who have come through what in many ways might be a more natural type of course, certainly with less cramming and less specialisation, in a smaller school in a provincial town or a country school, very often in the university environment go from strength to strength and improve very considerably on their previous performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing, therefore, that I would suggest is that the determining factor in the giving and the continuation of grants should be transferred, <Col N="442" /> after the initial year, to performance in the relevant university examinations, wherein all students meet on common terms and have the same type of teaching and the same opportunities within the university centre and so their performance can be evaluated fairly. We should have no hesitation in discontinuing a grant to a student who has not measured up to the required performance, and likewise&mdash;and I do not think that the Minister has provided for this&mdash;ensure that a student who stepped up his performance on the leaving certificate should be entitled to get whatever grant is available in the second, third or fourth years depending on his performance. It is obviously unfair to base a student's whole career on just one examination, on the leaving certificate, and it is especially wrong at the present moment when there seem to be some rather strange notions about examinations prevalent in the Department of Education, where there is a feeling that growing boys and girls should not be subject to examinations, that they should progress from class to class in a secondary school without having to pass any examinations. Unfortunately, the primary certificate has now been abolished as an entrance requirement for secondary school. There is a growing feeling that standards in the intermediate and leaving certificate are being considerably watered down and now there is a feeling amongst many that the groundwork is being laid for the almost total abolition of the intermediate certificate as an examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that it does not happen and that the Minister will see to it that the present tendency is reversed. The one and only examination set at the career end is the leaving certificate, and therefore, students suffer from all forms of nerves, especially when they are facing that first big test when they are not examination-conditioned. So then it is necessary, whatever use is made of the leaving certificate in selecting for grants, to ensure that it is used only for the first year of the grant, afterwards a more reliable estimate of the <Col N="443" /> student's ability and suitability for continuing in university work is required. We want to ensure that students are assisted to university or university type work only when they have an ability in that direction and where it is likely that they will profit by it but when it becomes obvious that students are not profiting then it is only a kindness to the students and is right and proper that they should be taken out of that stream as soon as possible and put to some other line of work that may be more suited to their talents. Many factors are required in a university student beyond mere performance at leaving certificate&mdash;how he develops under the freer university conditions and his future leadership potential&mdash; all go to shape his career and subsequent performance.</P>
      <P>Again, of course, we have the dangers of grinding because the prize at stake is a very large one&mdash;a scholarship or grant of £300 over a period of four years, £1,200. Anyone who has had any experience in examinations could say quite categorically that a grind in any leaving certificate subject given by a competent person, even a ten grind session, could and should lift the mark at least 20 per cent. That is unfortunate but it is something that is difficult to guard against. Again, a competent person giving a grind knows the style of question that can be asked in the examination and can give specimen papers to the students and get them to answer those and then show them how to answer effectively. This is something we cannot avoid. It does not occur at university level but it will occur, and we have no way of preventing it, at leaving certificate level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, the scheme requires four honours without specifying the nature of the honours. All that is required is a 60 per cent level. I think this is very wrong. Honours should be weighted and a student who gets 90 per cent is obviously a much better university prospects and should get much more credit for that performance than for getting a mere 60 per cent. Weighting, of course, is quite possible since in the future scheme projected for the leaving <Col N="444" /> certificate a system of grades is being adopted. I do not know what the exact levels are but, say, grade A 80 or 85 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister should weight grants accordingly&mdash;in other words, rather than four honours let it be so many points attained on the leaving certificate examination. That would mean that a grade A might carry four points, grade B three points, grade C two points and we might require a minimum of eight points for a grant. I must say, speaking from the university angle, that that is what we are proposing to do in regard to matriculation based on the new leaving certificate, thereby giving full weight to the various examination levels, and allowing the students to compensate for a relatively poor performance in one subject by a very good performance in another. As far as the university prospects go, we would much prefer to have a student coming in with high honours in two subjects rather than mediocre honours, which may have been the result of cramming or intensive grinding, in four subjects.</P>
      <P>Again, of course, the subjects matter very much and in dealing with, say, engineering or science it has long been recognised, especially in the physical sciences that the performance in mathematics is really the decisive factor. Yet, as proposed, honours in mathematics just counts exactly the same as, say, honours in Latin or honours in Spanish or some other subject. Again, I think that is unjust and that the subject mathematics requires at least double weighting in any proper scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these points that I am raising are points on which the Minister can still get good advice, before he makes an order, by consulting some small committee drawn from the universities. <Col N="445" /> If he does it will ensure that the grant money will be spent to better advantage.</P>
    <P>We note the lack of incentive applied in the Minister's scheme. When the student gets a grant thereafter some minimum standard is specified for retaining the grant, but there is no real incentive to top class performance. Therefore, I would suggest that while it is not reasonable to insist on attaining honours in the university in the subsequent examinations to retain a grant the Minister should certainly specify some performance better than a pass performance, say, somewhere probably half-way in between pass and honour level or corresponding to a grade, that has been coming in in science recently, of third honours.</P>
    <P>While this is specified for retaining, the student who makes the honours grade should receive some bonus recognition. Whether that bonus recognition is given by giving an added increment in the grants, by increasing £300 to £350 or else, what is probably better, the universities should be provided with rather liberal scholarships funds to be able to give scholarships freely to students attaining honours. That is probably a better scheme because it would maintain the distinction that should be associated with the word &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will do it that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that would be well worthwhile. &ldquo;Scholarship&rdquo; means attaining honours. It means the hallmark of a scholar whereas &ldquo;grant&rdquo; is something much less.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amount of money involved I know the Minister's purse is limited, but the amount involved, £300, for those having to stay in the university city is certainly not going to cover the whole cost by any manner or means because with fees around £100, books another £40 and 30 weeks residence to cater for plus other expenses it is just not sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> I have no great objection to that because it is all to the good that students be encouraged to borrow a certain amount and I know that the banks are fairly free in advancing loans to students in need. That is a reasonable enough provision. I should like to see this trend developing far more, and I should like to see low interest loans playing a greater part in our approach to the problem of university education.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the role of the county councils and the corporations in this matter. I have read through the Bill and I cannot see any reason, other than some window dressing, why these bodies are left in the scheme, not even the fact that they are providing some £280,000 from the rates for it. That provision could be waived. Already subventions are being made from the Central Fund to the rates for other purposes and this matter of the £280,000 could be incorporated in these subventions. What function have the county councils and the corporations got in the scheme any longer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to suggest that we operate this scheme without any means test whatever. I was asking what role the county councils play; they have none as far as the selection of students and the continuation of grants goes. I am satisfied that the county councils have always been too lax in continuing scholarships to students whose performance was not up to the mark. Either the present scheme is going to have uniform conditions even if it is going to be based on an non-uniform examination!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the investigation of means goes, I cannot see how the county councils are better equipped to do that than a central body. It is surely a <Col N="447" /> question of a simple type of income return, either based on valuation or on income tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The county councils are getting poor value from it. On this question of the means test, I appeal to the Minister to have another look at it and try to abolish it. This can be done. If the Minister of the Government should decide that any income group above the £1,500 or £2,000 bracket, say, is not to be entitled to help from the State in this regard, then it is a simple matter to devise a system of additional tax payments by people in that income brackets, any additional tax increment that will provide the necessary funds to pay by and large for whatever grants are given to that group. Of course, it would mean that the bachelor earning £2,000 a year would be contributing about £10 a year to the group fund, and all persons earning over £2,000 a year would be paying it for all their lifetime but then would get it back if one of their children qualified for the grant. If two or more of the children of a person in that group qualified for grants their parents would, of course, get back much more than they contributed. I should like to hear the Minister state if there is any obstacle to such a scheme.</P>
      <P>The £2,000 and over a year class are excluded from the present scheme, and £2,000 a year is not a great salary today. Such a man with four dependants is still completely outside the scope of the scheme. That applies to many local authority employees, engineers and so forth. It applies to quite a number of the higher secondary teachers who, when they get above £2,000 a year, are out.</P>

These four could qualify as students in the university but the question of providing £300 a year <Col N="448" /> each for them is a sheer impossibility. If the Government feel that they still cannot provide funds to assist that person, I suggest a PAYE approach to the problem. Under such scheme a person in that income group gets assistance when he needs it most, when his children are at the university. His children may get the grants, and he pays for it for the rest of his working life in small yearly sums of £10 or £15 based on his salary. What I am asking for is a system of additional income tax at higher income levels the proceeds to be devoted to solving the problems of such people. It is unrealistic to assume that at a salary of £2,000 a man must have four dependants before his children can qualify for these grants. A person at that income level has to have ten dependants before he can qualify for a full grant.</P>
      <P>In framing this scheme, which is designed to help needy students to benefit by free university education or to follow a degree course, have the Minister and the Government considered the impact this is going to have on recruitment into the Civil Service and into many of the semi-State bodies, the entrance to which is now based on the honours leaving certificate? If it is suggested that any worthwhile student with leaving certificate honours should be assisted into the university will this not lower considerably the ability of those entering the Civil Service and the various semi-State bodies? This would be rather disastrous because our nation depends so much on the quality of the men who man those organisations. Therefore, the Government have got to face, in introducing the present scheme, the problems of the recruitment of those grades. The recruitment level must be raised from leaving certificate to degree level. The ordinary honours leaving certificate recruitment corresponds to a pass degree man because the number of honours attained in university courses is very few. Honours is a very special distinction in the universities. Indeed, for the public service honours people may not be the best suited to dealing with the more routine type of work required in the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>It is necessary before we commit the House and the country to large expenditure on diverting men and women into universities, who previously formed the backbone of our recruitment into the public service, that we should consider what will be done about recruitment. The two go hand in hand. I, for one, would not favour recruitment into the university if in any way it sowed the seeds of a lowering of our standards of recruitment into the public service. Therefore, I am asking the Minister now to see that the Government as soon as possible take cognisance of this and that it changes the recruitment pattern of the Civil Service and bases it more on pass degrees rather than on honours leaving certificate.</P>
      <P>We commend the Minister on bringing in this measure because it makes another £500,000 a year available under this heading. Even though this may appear small by the sums which are spent in Northern Ireland and infinitesimal by the sums that are spent in England it is a beginning. We hope the Minister will now remedy the grave lack of consultation I have pointed out and that he will have consultations forthwith before bringing in the orders for which provision is made in this Bill. All the statements made by the Minister at present about so many honours, about various income levels and so on, will all be covered by future orders. The orders have not been made yet. Therefore, I hope this debate and the consultations which I hope the Minister will have over the next month will take care of this.</P>
      <P>I should like also to say that the advertisement in the papers which gave details of this scheme in many ways treated both Houses with rather scant respect because it was assumed that the scheme as published in the advertisement was already passed, whereas theoretically we were in a position to make some changes in the scheme.</P>

I would advise the Minister to leave the administration as far as possible to the universities and not have too much red tape about it. I am tired of filling up forms for graduates at present. One comes every month. We should be sparing about form-filling and we should let the universities do as much of the administrative work as possible. I want to conclude by commending the Minister for this and to assure him that any help I or my colleagues can give in this matter will be given to him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to welcome the Bill because it marks a tremendous advancement. Indeed, it is the natural follow-through to the Government's thinking in the field of education for <Col N="451" /> many years past. Only a very short time ago the Government pushed through this new scheme which now has become one of the greatest things which has taken place probably in this century because children now have an opportunity of getting post-primary education, something which was denied to them in many parts of the country. Now that situation has come to pass and buses are taking those children to the secondary and vocational schools it is only natural that the Government, having the interests of better educational facilities for children at heart, would be thinking of what will happen in the years ahead when those people come to the end of their courses in post-primary and secondary school and when they would be thinking in terms of going on to higher education, be it in the universities or other appropriate institutions. One of the things which always hampered people in this country for quite a long time, and still does, is the provision of meals. We all know that stipends and fees, not alone in secondary schools, but particularly at university level, were a very important part in the provision of education in this country. Very many students who had the ability but, unfortunately, not the means were denied this education.</P>
    <P>It is good to see that the State is stepping in, and I am particularly pleased to see that this year roughly 900 university scholarships will be awarded. This is a tremendous advance because up to this these people had not the opportunity. I think it is good to see this change taking place. I am also pleased to see that selection is being done on a scholarship basis. After all, we would like to see people going into these places having a certain standard. This year, and in future, the standard will be some four honours in the leaving certificate. That may seem very high to some people at present but, after all. I think the Minister gave figures stating that roughly 1,900 students obtained four honours <Col N="452" /> last year in the leaving certificate. Were all those to go to the university which they did not &mdash; many go to training colleges &mdash; it would be necessary to extend and improve those buildings immensely to cater for them. At any rate, it shows that the standard being asked for in the matter of those scholarships is not altogether beyond the capacity of those who are doing the leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>We expect that as the years go by with the increased facilities, with the increased number of students receiving secondary education in the schools it may be necessary to raise the standard. I could never understand for a long time why it was necessary in those universities that students who got six or seven honours in the leaving certificate were still obliged to do the matriculation examination to get entrance to university. I am glad to see that that was changed some years ago when they began to recognise that the leaving certificate was of immense value and of a high standard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the attitude that was prevailing in the universities then when they decided whom they would admit and on what educational standards. In other words, it reminds me of what is going on in some of the secondary schools where they hold entrance examinations and pick people so as to ensure that other people not so well off will have to go to vocational schools. The test this year will be four honours in the leaving certificate. That is not too hard in view of the fact that many who go to the training colleges often have six, seven, eight and even nine honours and they still are being denied facilities to complete their course at the universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the means test. Naturally, we all admit that we have to have a means test in this as we have a means test in many other areas, old age pensions and so on. If we were sufficiently rich to provide all these moneys from the taxpayers there would be no need for a means test. These scholarships are being more or <Col N="453" /> less designed to help people who are not in the affluent conditions of others, so that the children of the poor and destitute will get a fair opportunity of attaining a much higher education. It is for that reason the means test will be enforced. That may be altered from time to time but for the time being, at any rate, seeing that we are spending almost £60 million on education out of our total Budget that is no mean sum and it has to be taken from the taxpayer. Consequently, because sums of money are not unlimited we have to have this means test. It is all very well for others to suggest that there should be a free for all in everything, in the health services, educational services and so on, but the Government have the responsibility of providing the money, money that you can only get through taxation, and for that reason for the time being in the field of education, because of what still remains to be done in providing buildings and so on, it will be necessary to be careful as to how we allot the money we raise in so far as the various educational purposes are concerned.</P>
    <P>As a Government, we would like to be able to give much more and as things progress from year to year we will be able to do a lot extra, as we have been doing in the last nine or ten years in providing extra grants for schools and universities. I instanced the cost of Belfield and I also instanced the amount spent on the training colleges and the amount spent in providing buildings for post-primary education over the last nine to ten years.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the county councils and the role they play in education. I am glad to see that the 900 places are being provided on a scholarship basis because in poorer counties where they were not able to give the amount of money they would like to give they were not able to send more pupils to university on a scholarship basis. This will give them a chance which they have not had in the past when people got county council scholarships and others in neighbouring councils were unable to get scholarships. This scheme will remove a lot of that.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to make comparison <Col N="454" /> with the Six Counties and England. In so far as we are concerned with regard to education, we are a young country as countries go and we have not the great industrial arm they have in England.</P>

      <P>I just want to say that I, on behalf of a number of people I know especially in the north western end of the country, welcome this Bill. I congratulate the Minister on bringing it in. I should just like to say to some of the Opposition who have been vocal recently, that this has been their thinking on education for many years, that it is a tremendous change to see that not alone have we provided schemes and money and schools and teachers at national and secondary and vocational level, but that now we are concentrating on higher education. In the comprehensive schools even there are new technical colleges being erected and I would ask the Opposition to contrast that with the performance of what happened in their term, when all they succeeded in doing was to cut the capitation grants to secondary schools and the building programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in the welcome other Senators have extended to the Minister on his first appearance in the House as Minister for Education. At the moment, as we all know, he bears the gravest of responsibilities certainly in the eyes of our university members. We have every hope that he will act with justice and prudence and patience. His Department has heard hard words from time to time, in the present and in the past. But in one respect at any rate its conduct and policy have been exemplary. The Department of Education has <Col N="455" /> always acted with justice, and with more than justice, with generosity, towards the schools and colleges of the religious minority. There is no likelihood they are likely to change that policy.</P>
      <P>At the moment the Minister has no cause for anxiety in this House. There is nothing to be worried about in the passing of this Bill, except for some details. Its aims, which all public-spirited educationalists are likely to share, is to make the best possible use of our intellectual resources. Our country is comparatively weak in numbers and in physical resources. But history has shown that intellectually, as well as spiritually, we have long been one of the more powerful nations of the world. Therefore we have a moral as well as an economic duty to develop our intellectual talents to the full.</P>
      <P>Obviously this is a highly commendable Bill. It will enable many hundreds of our young citizens to have the higher education that they could not otherwise afford. But one risk in particular must be avoided, as I see it. We must be extremely careful that the increased numbers of students are met by increased numbers of staff and by necessary enlargements of the buildings and the equipment of the universities. I insist on this with all the emphasis I can command. It is easy enough to say we will provide so many with £300 a year and send them all to the universities. This would be a shallow and short-sighted policy. It could do more harm to this country than good if these large numbers of students were to cause overcrowding and a lowering of academic standards in the universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the intellectual deterioration that would result, we have seen only too clearly within the last few months what happens when students feel overcrowded and neglected. We have seen it only too clearly in Paris and in California, right across the world from Istanbul to San Francisco. Only this morning in the newspapers we read of the deplorable happenings in Venice when young students with some grievance or other, probably due to academic neglect, tried to break into <Col N="456" /> one of the most beautiful and noble shrines in Christendom, Saint Mark's. It was only through counter action taken very promptly by the citizens of Venice that the church was protected from desecration.</P>
    <P>I quote this to show what happens when students begin to boil with indignation. What happens is that they, by their own natural feelings, are eager for action &mdash; that word &ldquo;activist&rdquo; is a sinister one nowadays &mdash; and then, as we know in this country, a few sinister elements from outside use them for their own purposes.</P>
    <P>We must meet this in Ireland, both in the universities and outside, by giving the students justice, by giving them good conditions, by making them feel they are not being neglected. The events in Trinity College a month or so ago won a great deal of attention. The fact, as we see it, looking back, is that because 95 per cent or 99 per cent of our students felt that conditions were reasonably good, tolerably good, they were not capable of being inflamed, even by fairly skilful agitators. It was because they felt they were reasonably well treated that they could not be driven to rush out of Trinity and break into, say, Saint Patrick's Cathedral or some place like that, as they did in Venice.</P>
    <P>However, in these present conditions there is the risk that the extra 900 students might lead to overcrowding and make a critical psychological difference. Then we would do our country more harm than good by this Bill. Therefore I emphasise with all the power I have that every pound spent&mdash;and most commendably spent&mdash; on these grants must be matched by many more pounds for staff and equipment. We must remember, too, that nowadays staffing is not as simple as it was 30 or 40 years ago when it meant just professors and lecturers. Now we must have secretaries, typists, telephonists and all types of administrative paraphernalia. They do a good job but they cost a lot of money. This is a depressing thing to have to say to the Minister, because money is fairly short. However, it is realistic, and I urge him, in all the plans he has, to remember that it is not just a question <Col N="457" /> of opening the university gates to the students, but also of keeping the universities worthy of these young people who come to us with such high hopes.</P>
    <P>This opens a large question that has been dealt with already by Senators Dooge and Quinlan &mdash; the question of selection. First of all, I do not agree with the part of the motion before us that university education should be free to all who qualify for university entrance, unless the universities are prepared to raise their standards even higher, unless the universities are prepared to go to four honours at least, as in this Bill. Nor do I agree with Professor Quinlan that a means test is undesirable &mdash; well perhaps I concede it is undesirable, but I feel it is necessary in the present financial state of this country. And I do not agree with him in his scheme for the extra taxation of those with £1,500 or £2,000 a year or whatever it is. Perhaps my reason partly is that all except one of my family have passed through the university while perhaps fewer of his have as yet done so. This stands on a personal motivation, but not entirely: we try to be public-spirited as well. I do not think that ultimately it would be fair to inflict extra taxation on all people above that level to avoid a means test, which is fair if properly worked.</P>
    <P>One thing worries me greatly. It worried Senator Dooge, too, and it worried Senator Quinlan. It is the tragic fate of the potentially brilliant young boy or girl who, for lack of good teaching, cannot get four honours in the leaving certificate. This is one of the most tragic misfits that we can see in our country: some brilliant child who through no fault of his own goes into work which needs minimal intelligence. What can the Minister, or what can we, devise to get round this? If we accept the principle in the motion that university education should be free to all who qualify for university entrance, that will screen out, as I see it, these brilliant but under-taught children. Unless we are prepared to build much larger universities <Col N="458" /> and to extend them, we simply will not be able to fit them in.</P>
    <P>To put it more clearly, if we want to keep the universities reasonably uncrowded, and if there is free university education for all who qualify, the standard of the university matriculation will be so high that these undertaught but intelligent students will not be able to get in. We will have to watch that. It is a problem that we will have to consider a great deal more. We must try to devise some way in which these boys from the poor little grammar school down the country, or something like that, potentially as brilliant as any of us, can get a chance. I wonder would it work if the Minister gave grants to the universities to devise scholarship tests for this kind of child which would be quite different from the leaving certificate kind of examination, some other kind of qualification which does not depend just on book work and high-pressure teaching and grinding. If we could do that, it would be a most desirable thing.</P>
    <P>I turn now to a matter which is of special concern to Trinity College, Dublin. I think that it will not concern us very much more in the future, but it should be mentioned. In the recent past there have been two main impediments hindering Trinity College from playing a full and unrestricted part in educating the youth of Ireland. The first is the ecclesiastical ban. I hope that under this Bill there will be no question of any obstacle against a grantee going to the university of his choice. We know that there are pressures, and there have been obstacles in this way. But I hope that this Bill will be another means of breaking down this barrier. Secondly, Trinity College has been inhibited from educating people in Ireland in the past by the fact that certain local authorities refused to allow their scholars to go to Trinity College. It was impossible from some counties and areas. I know of one particular case of a very good friend of my own, and a member of this House in the past, who won a county council scholarship down in the south-west &mdash; I will not specify more than that, it would not be fair. He asked to go to Trinity College and <Col N="459" /> was told &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He simply said &ldquo;I am going to Trinity College&rdquo; and he got a Reid sizarship, as we call it, from Trinity College, which is given to people who come from this particular county&mdash;this rather indicates at once where it was, but it does not matter&mdash; and he came to Trinity College and had a very good career, becoming an eminent citizen and also a good member of this House. Unless he had had the determination to go to the university of his choice he would have been diverted elsewhere. Perhaps he might have done just as well as he did at Trinity College, but at any rate I hope that it will not be necessary in the future for that kind of thing to happen. He could have got £200 a year or whatever it was from his county, but he accepted instead something in the order of £80 a year, a thing which I personally think was a great credit to him. May he rest in peace.</P>
    <P>There is one further point which has been raised already in the Dáil debate and incidentally here&mdash;what is the effect of this Bill going to be on the recruitment of primary teachers? It is likely that any student, any boy or girl, who gets five honours, or four, will choose rather to go to the universities than into the training colleges. Now there is a very clear way to cure this effect of the Bill if the Minister would accept this implication. The way to meet it is clearly to make a university degree a requirement for primary teaching. Some of the primary teachers in the Church of Ireland Training College do take a degree. We think that it is a great advantage. This would solve our whole problem here. Let them go to the university as scholars and then let them turn to primary teaching, because though many people perhaps, or at any rate some people, in this country are inclined to deny it, primary teaching is just as important as secondary or university teaching. It needs people of just as much intelligence and with just as fine teaching gifts. Let us agree on that, and if we agree on that then the answer is to make primary teachers take university degrees.</P>

      <P>Naturally, I wish to welcome the Bill on behalf of the Labour Party because it is a move in the right direction to raise the standard of education and it provides an opportunity to our young people of intelligence to avail of higher education, which is something they did not have in the past. Children in the lower income group will now have an opportunity of attending university provided they get four honours. Children in the middle income group will also benefit under the grant scheme as prepared by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I should like to say that there are quite a number of people who are not exactly satisfied with the Bill, and we can divide them into three categories. First, there are people who got four honours last year. They are writing to every public representative in the country at the present time to know if they would be included under the grants in the coming year. and the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. Then we have the people who are outside the income limits and excluded, but who under the old system of scholarship would have had an opportunity of coming in in the top 25 per cent to get a scholarship to a university. The fact that they won the money did not mean so much, but it was an incentive to get a scholarship, and to be in the top 25 per cent was something that was worth thinking about. Those people are greatly disappointed that they have not the same opportunity now to show their talent. I notice something in the Minister's statement, and I hope that he will proceed with it, that he will ask the universities to give a greater number of scholarships&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It takes a much higher standard to get into training than it does to get four honours in the leaving certificate, and as far as the scheme goes there is no provision made to give children who will opt for training any help whatsoever. I know that the Department has given loans to these people in the past, yet there are no grants, and I agree entirely with Senator Stanford that the standard of primary teaching is just as important as the standard of a professor in a university. If you do not get it at the bottom level you cannot expect to do wonders when you have not from the beginning had the best type of teachers. He is hoping for the day when all people who are going in for teaching will have to pass through the university and I think that the Minister himself is in full agreement with the views expressed.</P>

      <P>The means test is something that worries me very much, because anyone who is a member of a local authority knows what the means test is. You have the Health Act, old age pensions and widows pensions, and just a pound or two one way or the other may knock a person out of a pension or out of the benefits of the Health Act. We have not found county managers or anyone else flexible about allowing borderline cases. There is no trouble about people in the lower income group or within the means test. There is no trouble about people away above it; but we get into trouble with the person with £61 valuation, and if we get a person with £1,201 a year then we are in real trouble. I can see <Col N="462" /> the Minister having a very busy time with appeals from various people throughout the country.

      <P>I hope not. We had a lot of difficulty arising out of that. We had scholarship children who were sent to University College, Dublin and they were told to stand out of the line of scholarship students as the college was not affiliated with Westmeath County Council. That forced me to put down a motion that we ask the authorities to reconsider the position and it would be worthwhile to read the minute dealing with the discussion. It says that Councillor McAuliffe outlined the council's position with particular reference to the agreement with University College, Dublin. He pointed out that some years ago the council provided a boy with a scholarship to Trinity College, Dublin and that he thought they had acted correctly but that University College, Dublin, had then disaffiliated itself from the scheme. He pointed out that this had created a problem for scholarship <Col N="464" /> boys who proposed to study in University College, Dublin, and said that they were told to stand aside from the scholarship lines and were informed that Westmeath County Council was not affiliated with University College, Dublin, for scholarship purposes. He said that this created difficulties in some cases and suggested that the county council should approach the authorities of University College, Dublin, and ask them to reconsider their attitude in regard to the scholarship scheme. He said that agreement would not be reached with University College, Dublin. The council should pay the fees direct to the parents in the following way, half before 23rd October and the other half in May.</P>
      <P>Councillor Keane supported Councillor McAuliffe and drew attention to the fact that progress reports would not be supplied to the council for a scholarship holder from Westmeath, at least not officially from the university. We met with that for years and we could not get any report from the university as to whether a student failed or not. We had to go through the back door and send letters to some professors and depend on their goodwill whether they gave a report how the particular child was getting on.</P>
      <P>That was sent to the university authorities but no reply was received. I went in yesterday and asked if any reply had been sent. I was told there was no record of it. I am quite sure, for that reason, that the present Minister will not allow any such situation to arise in the future. Senator Stanford made reference to that question here today and said that a child should go to the university of his choice. I am in full agreement with him on the statement he has made and I am quite sure the Minister will support Senator Stanford and me in making that statement.</P>

      <P>I have experience of being on a scholarship committee for 15 years and I would suggest to the Minister that the fees should be paid direct to the college. The student selects whatever faculties he believes he should go into but the fees are different for every faculty you take. They are from £100 down to £80 or £60 in some cases. The fees should be paid direct to the college. It is not a good idea to give them direct to the parents and for the parents to send them on to the college. Some difficulties may arise. We had an extraordinary case in Mullingar when we got travelling scholarships for 16 children. The travelling scholarships were paid direct to the children, 16 cheques.

      <P>There is nothing to show how the fees will be paid. There is another matter I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister. University students spend about eight months of the year in the university. I believe they should be paid in eight monthly instalments because if we are going to bring people in from the lower income group no landlady will keep them for half a year without getting the LSD. In fact, the order of the day in Dublin at the present time is to pay in advance, not pay after a month. People who go <Col N="466" /> into flats could jump out overnight and the landlady would have no chance of catching them. If a fellow jumped out in the middle of the night there would be no chance of catching him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>That brings us to the question of accommodation for the students. It is one of the biggest problems we have in the university. I do not know whether it is a matter for the Government or the university authorities but there are students in Dublin at the present time living in conditions that do not lend themselves to study. I can tell the Minister I know three students and three other people who are not students living in one room paying £1 to £6 each. These people sleep and eat and do everything else they have to do in that one room. How could a person study in such circumstances? If we are to have higher education in this country we will have to put up flats for these children. We will have to put up a study hall for them and give them an opportunity to study when they get into the university.</P>
      <P>Professor Dooge in his summing up of the whole matter spoke of the number of failures in the university and the people who came in and got honours in first year and honours in second year and came out with a pass degree. If we are to change that we will have to provide some sort of accommodation especially for the people from the rural areas. They have not been out before and we will have to provide some sort of suitable accommodation for these people where they can study and get down to work in earnest. If they come in on the leaving certificate they should go out with an honours degree if they work hard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a requirement for four honours subjects as the qualification which students must have for entry to university. I am doubtful about the four honours subjects. There are subjects in which it is difficult to get honours &mdash; for example, mathematics, physics, science and so on. These are <Col N="467" /> hard subjects in which to get honours. Will we have a drift away from these subjects in the lower and middle income groups and will students try to get honours in four subjects that are not as valuable to the country and to the students? I am afraid there is a grave danger that children will take subjects in which honours are easily got instead of taking subjects in which it is hard to get honours.</P>
    <P>I saw an honours paper of the leaving certificate this year and I can say that anyone who got honours in it is a good pupil. I could say the same about the Irish paper. I am prepared to give credit to the Minister. I know there are fanatics who will not give him credit. There are some people who say that the pupils should get honours in Irish but the Minister has not said that. It does not matter how many honours you had in the leaving certificate, you must get through Irish. I agree with that. There is, however, another subject which is left out. It is only a few days ago that I found out that English is not a university subject. The Minister said that English is not a university subject.</P>

Is there a possibility that that same trouble might arise in Ireland? I would be very sorry to see such a situation arising here.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem which this Bill is designed to tackle is inequality of educational opportunities. None of us should fool ourselves that this Bill will do more than make a substantial and useful contribution in this direction. Even if the Bill were a much better one, even if it implemented to the full the proposals in the Fine Gael policy, it would only make a partial and incomplete contribution towards the solution of this problem. It is first necessarily to overcome the financial obstacles. You cannot solve this problem unless you solve the financial obstacles. But to eliminate these obstacles will not solve the problem. It will only start to solve the problem. As Senator Dooge said 92 per cent of students in Britain receive university education through scholarships and yet the figure of participation in university education is, I think, only 2½ per cent in respect of the children of manual workers in Britain. In France you have free university education and not more than 1½ per cent of the children of manual workers reach a university. These figures contrast <Col N="469" /> with figures running into the 30 per cent and 40 per cent for the children of better-off people who get to university in this country and also in Northern Ireland and Britain. Thus the mere elimination of the financial problem only makes a first contribution towards solving this problem and no more.</P>
      <P>The reason lying behind this problem is the existence of very real cultural differences between different social groups which owe their origins to past financial inequality and past educational inequality, which are deep rooted and difficult to shift, and which reflect the different attitudes of parents to different social groups. We have in this country an analysis of this problem. In Paper No. 23 of the Economic Research Institute published less than four years ago there is a table which by a process of mathematical analysis calculates from the household budget enquiry for 1951-52 the pattern of expenditure for two families with identical incomes and identical family responsibilities, and drawn from different social groups. From this table we can see how different are the attitudes of the people in different social groups because of their different cultural backgrounds, because of the different financial circumstances of their parents over the generations. It shows that as between two families with the same income levels and the same family responsibilities, those classified as &ldquo;white collar&rdquo; spent 50 per cent more on education than those classified as &ldquo;blue-collar&rdquo;&mdash;manual workers &mdash; and 80 per cent more on medical expenditure. They spent 25 per cent less on drink and tobacco, 10 per cent less on travel and holidays and 50 per cent on entertainment, thus spending barely half as much on entertainment. By giving up these various sums of expenditure, they found the money to spend on education and health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other interesting thing about this table is that it shows that if people in these particular social groups got additional income &mdash; though at that time they were spending a relatively small amount on education because in many cases their children did not go beyond <Col N="470" /> primary schools &mdash; if their incomes went up, the one thing to which they devoted the biggest share of the increased income was education. For every 10 per cent increase in income 35 per cent more would be spent on education, showing their deep interest in education and their desire to get a better education for their children. However, because of their past background their current expenditure on education was low because they did not send their children to secondary schools, but the pattern was changing rapidly as they got better off.</P>
    <P>There is a very great social difference here and we need not fool ourselves that it is not so. It is a vicious circle and it will continue indefinitely if the cycle is not broken at some point. To break it will require great additional effort. It will require educational effort, a programme to persuade more and more parents of the benefits of education and to accept the sacrifices involved which will still be involved even with the benefits of this Bill. Something of a campaign is required to put this across. We will require also a social effort in the universities themselves. Something more must be done to integrate the different social classes and to help those children who come from a different social background and who have not had the same opportunities, the same background of reading in the home, the same tradition of reading which is so important to university students, and who find it difficult to fit into the university.</P>
    <P>More must be done by students themselves to help their fellow students. Students on the whole are good at helping each other but a lot more attention should be directed to this. Finally, in the universities themselves, the teachers in particular should do more to help. There is a weakness in our university system, that even where the ordinary classes or lectures are supplemented by tutorials where they are smaller, and by seminars where they are larger, there is still lacking, particularly in my own college of UCD, by virtue of the great size of the classes, personal contact with the students, which is particularly important for <Col N="471" /> children whose home background does not provide them with the tradition of reading and a general interest in cultural things. It is not just extra teaching but direct personal contact which must be aimed at. The arrangement which exists in Trinity College &mdash; it is easier for them to provide personal contact because of the smaller size of that institution &mdash; provides a moral tutor, somebody to advise the students not only in a particular subject but indeed in the life of the college. This is more necessary in larger colleges like UCD where there is a certain lack of a sense identity, where there is an alienation from the society of the university because the very large number of students there makes it more difficult to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>We know from the experience of other countries &mdash; I believe, though I have not any direct knowledge of it, that this is particularly true in the Soviet Union &mdash; that they have overcome these difficulties and obstacles to the gradual elimination of class distinctions. The obstacles which exist can be overcome by education and by the utilisation of the opportunities for education over a relatively short period of time &mdash; a generation or so. I think we have something to learn in this matter from the experience of other countries, particularly the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>This new system of financing will change the universities themselves and will lead to a significant change in the cultural and social backgrounds of the students even though, even in ten years' time, we need not expect to find more than perhaps 2½ per cent of the children of manual workers reaching the university&mdash;that is, 2½ per cent of half the population. That 2½ per cent will naturally be quite a large group. At present only 1 per cent of university students come from that half of the population, who are manual workers. This will become 25 per cent to 30 per cent over a period of 10 years with the evolution of this scheme. I hope, by the efforts of successive Governments. This increase in the proportion of students coming from a <Col N="472" /> different social background will change the universities. Universities have recently been described as middle-class institutions and this feature is under fire by some of the more radical students.</P>
    <P>The demand for university democracy will become more strident in these circumstances. That has to be faced. This demand by the students has been misunderstood both in Ireland and outside, but especially in Ireland where there are several reasons why the gap between the community and the university students is greater than elsewhere. One reason is that there is a greater urban-rural gap. Universities are in urban centres and much of our population, half of it, is in rural areas. There is a very marked contrast between the age gap in urban and rural Ireland. Something like 55 per cent of the over-forties are to be found in rural areas but barely 40 per cent of those in their twenties are in rural areas. Therefore, there is a much older population in rural areas with much less contact with younger people and this aggravates the gap between the generations. In urban centres there is a much younger population. In Ireland it is not only an age gap but also partly a geographical one.</P>
    <P>The fact that so many of our graduates are forced to emigrate &mdash; it has been estimated at half, though I doubt if it is as high as that &mdash; means that our population does not contain so many graduates. We have a situation here in which there is a disproportionate number of university students to graduates in our population. There is a big gap in the number of graduates. Experience of university life is thus relatively small in the population.</P>
    <P>Again, in this country, we have been slow to take up new ideas. We tend to live in the past and at times we seem to live in terms of 50 years ago, and that has been evidenced at times in this and the other House on certain subjects. We are not quick to understand or appreciate what happens elsewhere. There is a tendency here still to confuse any new form of radical thinking with Stalinist Communism, the result <Col N="473" /> being that the present student movement, which started as a revolt against Communist rule in Poland and which everywhere it has occurred has tended to seek democratisation, so that students in socialist countries and in France and elsewhere have tended to move away from Communist tendencies &mdash; this movement in Ireland, for some extraordinary reason, is regarded an emanation of Communism, simply because there are 30 people in one particular college who made a fuss on one particular occasion.</P>
    <P>There is a problem here of understanding between the community as a whole and university students, and there is a failure to understand fully what is happening in the universities abroad and indeed in Ireland. This is important because there is a danger that this new radicalism among university students, which some of us think is overdue in some respects, if misunderstood could give rise, not to constructive and useful changes which are badly needed, but to unnecessary clashes and misunderstandings within the community. It is important that every opportunity should be taken to try to clarify what this is all about and to ensure that we do not, as we develop our universities and through this scheme change them in a radical way, lose contact with them, that the community does not lose contact with the university students and that a gap does not grow up between them.</P>
    <P>The aim of students nowadays is to democratise the universities themselves and society.</P>

    <P>I am always conscious when lecturing in the university of how important is the help that may be contributed by the students themselves, and so one endeavours to seek to draw questions from them and tries to see that every opportunity is given to them to clarify one's thinking. All the time one is conscious that one is acting within the framework of something that one has devised oneself &mdash; that has been handed on to one and which has not been designed by and with the cooperation of the people for whom it is intended. They are the consumers, though they are subject to the natural limitations of immaturity, and ultimately <Col N="475" /> one must accept that they know better than anyone else what they require. We have not hitherto faced up to this fact though many of us are facing up to it now. I can assure the Minister that there is great goodwill among the staff in the universities towards changes in those institutions which while they will maintain discipline and authority, and will do nothing to weaken or destroy the efforts of the universities in research or higher learning, will ensure the kind of teaching that will transform them into more useful institutions.</P>
    <P>I stress this because I have had a discussion on it with a number of people in the past, including in one instance an official of the Minister's Department several years ago. I remarked that in my experience many children showed great appreciation of their teachers' abilities and of the way the course was set out and the best way in which its objectives could be attained, and that this was something to which the children can usefully contribute even at quite a young age, helping thus to improve our educational system. My experience as I sat in my car driving along with children in the back of the car, and listening to their talk about how they were taught even from the age of even eight or nine upwards, and subsequently checking with the school as to whether their views were accurate or not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I suggested to this official that anything we could do to get the consumer's point of view, despite the obvious difficulty of finding it out at eight or nine, but certainly anything that could be done at university level, would be useful. I met not only with resistance but with a horrified resistance from this gentleman, who thought that at any level no student should have any view or any consideration given to his view in this field. This was the authoritarian view. This was from somebody who was humane, thoughtful, and an intelligent man but who simply had not ever considered this problem from the point of view of the consumer of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> This is, fortunately, something which we in the universities are alert to and I believe that with great speed we will make the necessary changes now that the demand is there and that we feel what we have not felt until now, that, the students themselves are willing, and prepared to make their own contribution towards their own education and towards organising it.</P>

I thought I had made it clear that this Bill was something which was going ultimately to transform the whole social character of the universities and to intensify a movement that now exists which will create problems in university education unless we face these changes, and that unless we do this we must face great difficulties and problems, not only in this field. This Bill could be a great breakthrough in creating equality of opportunity and a breakthrough even helping to change the character of education in our universities. If I have not communicated this fully to the Senator, then the fault, I am sure, is mine. I have been developing it at some length because I was led into it by the question of An Seanadóir Ó Maoláin who asked me what I meant by the democratisation.</P>

This is an evolution which has started in certain areas and there will be more of it.

      <P>They have been privileged to secure this education which imposes on them the burden and the duty of playing a fuller part in our society, a burden and a duty which many of them do not fulfil at the present time. Many of them pass through the university and tend thereafter simply to go through their lives at their profession without giving a damn about their country. What I find encouraging is that many of our students during their passage through the university and after they have left it are now showing a commitment to the country that was not shown before, and that this new generation are doing what we did not do to the same extent &mdash;they want to play their part and when they do so the first reaction of some people is to slap them down. That is not the first reaction of other people, however. As far as I am concerned the students' new approach, even if at times I may consider their method of approach wrong, is one to be encouraged and I shall always try to encourage them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is here a radical change in our students. This is a change which will eventually transform our society, because, although I think some of these people will relapse, will eventually lose interest when they start to earn their living, many of them will in the future maintain this interest. I find that more of my students are joining the Civil Service than was the case two or three years ago because they feel that through membership of the Civil Service they can do something for their country, a thought which had not struck them so much previously, when the image of the Civil Service was less good than perhaps it is now. Of those who are not going into the Civil Service, in many cases the more lively minded <Col N="479" /> of these are interested in politics and maintain that interest after they leave. They attach themselves to a number of political Parties. If the Senator's Party has not attracted as many of them as some other Parties perhaps this is the result of the attitude of mind of some people in the Senator's Party. I would suggest that in the long run the Senator's Party should try to get in on the act.</P>

Of course we do not always agree with the conclusions they reach but we should not underestimate the extent to which they <Col N="480" /> can make a contribution. Let us face the fact.</P>
      <P>Let us take one single example, that of France under its authoritarian Government. Who was able to make that Government shift, make it totter? Not the mighty United States, not the Government of Britain, not indeed even the French electorate, it was in fact the students who raised this cry of democratisation, participation, who wrung from General De Gaulle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is a valuable contribution to France and through France a valuable contribution to the world, made by students because they are students, because they are in that particular position of, in a sense, irresponsibility and at the same time of enlightenment at that particular period in their lives. Let us not dismiss this when it is making such a contribution to the shaping of the world, when it is shaking capitalism, shaking communism and forcing people to reconsider their attitudes to the whole political structure, when it is raising again the idea of people helping to run their own affairs, a right which the bureaucracies of East and West have tried to tear away from them over the last 50 years.</P>

I do not share the view implied in the Senator's question, however, that they should wait until then to do anything or say anything because if they had waited to do so we would not have had the contribution to political thought and to the whole shape of political life that we have had in the last couple of months.</P>

I therefore skipped a page but by a happy coincidence, speaker after speaker on the other side have asked questions the answers to which I have written down here! One of the points I had here was that while we can reasonably expect from students sufficient insight to pinpoint problems and to point to the broad lines of solution, it would be sheer lunacy on our part to expect them to give us a blueprint for society, in the sense of a detailed working out of how a new society could be brought about. This is something we cannot expect. They have raised the flag of democracy and participation. They have put the challenge to us who have the power to do something about it and they have told us what it is that should be done and have awakened our consciences. They do not claim to know how to solve the problem in detail, but they claim the right to tell us what the problem is, and through we cannot expect to get detailed solutions from them, as we proceed to solve these problems we shall, I am sure, get helpful criticism from them if we take the wrong road or fail to follow the road with the enthusiasm and vigour that they demand of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a policy which involves substantial expenditure, and the full details of which are set out in the last three pages. A good deal of scepticism was expressed at the time by people in the Government as to how this expenditure, spread over three years as was proposed, could be undertaken without specific increases in taxation. That is a scepticism which was, perhaps, understandable from the other side of the House, but they have to a large measure voided their own scepticism in this measure, because I am not aware that any significant increase in taxation has been introduced by the Government to finance their own schemes. It has been said that they are being financed by the buoyancy of revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we said in our scheme, and it deals with the buoyancy argument once and for all, so that we can now get on to the policy itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The features of the Fine Gael proposals which I should like to put to the House are the following, the first of which I would like to emphasise because it has not been sufficiently discussed, and that is our belief that university education should be charged for at the full cost. The question of who should pay the cost is another issue, that I will come to in a moment. The present method is that the Government give block grants to the universities to cover two-thirds of the cost. That is a <Col N="484" /> scheme of finance which is unsatisfactory because it has meant that up to now those who can pay the £65 to £100 fee get the rest of the cost for nothing, but those who cannot afford to pay this fee to maintain their children in the university are in the position that they get nothing. Therefore, we propose that the full cost should be charged in the fee.</P>
    <P>A second reason for this proposal was that we felt that the cost of the various types of university education varies widely, so widely, indeed, that at present some of the universities do not know themselves what the cost is. This is not a good way to run any institution, to run it without full knowledge of the cost, and we think it is important that all courses and faculties should be costed and charged for at the appropriate fee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have a higher education authority shortly to deal with this and other such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Good. We feel that these fees should be paid for on behalf of the citizens of the State regardless of means test. I am not talking now of maintenance or board grants but of the fees. We feel that if people come from other countries to this country for university education they should pay the full cost, although there should be a system of scholarships for people from underdeveloped countries. I have called Britain many things in my life but I have never called her an underdeveloped country and I do not see why we should finance university education for students from Britain at one-third of the cost. The full fee should be charged and a fee grant should be available for our own citizens, payable not to the university but to the parents of the student so that the student can pay his fee directly himself or have it paid by his parents on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advantage of this&mdash;there are many advantages &mdash; but the one to which I wish to draw particular attention is that it would mean that the universities will be much less dependent on direct payments from the Government, and the autonomy of the <Col N="485" /> universities would thereby be safeguarded and improved. It would be the student who would be provided with the fee and he could pay it directly to whatever university he wished to go to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not impractical. It may not be as simple to administer as the present system, but for reasons of university autonomy and the freedom of the university student it might be wise to depart from the present system. I see no reason why it could not be done. The fee grant would be made available to the student and he would make his own choice as to which university he would go to. The amount that the university would get direct from the Government would thus be minimised; it would be reduced to the grants required for post-graduate work and research, and the autonomy of the universities would be much more safeguarded than if as at present two-thirds of the grant was coming direct from the Department; where the university must apply to the Department for its fee, stating the amount that is required for each purpose; where that application must also be vetted by the Department of Finance, and where the university is given a lump sum which never comes up to what is sought, and where the university is then told that the money is for the purpose of X, Y and Z, although the amount would only pay for X and Y and leave nothing for Z.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that. The next point is the question of paying maintenance and board grants to those who need them. The Minister's scheme is similar in outline to the one we devised and put forward about 18 months ago. There are differences in detail but the concept of smaller grants for people in low income groups living in a university city, and the concept of larger and higher board grants for students living some distance away, were put forward by us. They are different in detail in the Bill but the principle of the scheme is the same. But in the Minister's scheme the fee grants have to come out of the money for the maintenance and board grants, and that could make a pretty important difference from the students' point of view.</P>
      <P>There is a fourth point and this is very important; it is important that we should keep some scholarships. The Minister has gone some distance in this direction and has initiated discussion on the matter of providing scholarships so I suppose he is willing to provide some money for the purpose. This would help. I do not personally think it is likely to be sufficient. The number of entrance scholarships is small at the moment and even doubling them would still mean that the number of scholarships available to people on merit would be much smaller than hitherto, at least so I would think. I am open to reassurance by the Minister that there will not be a drastic reduction in this.</P>

We in the university think more should be done in this direction. I would recommend this to the Minister &mdash; I think he has got round to reading our policy now.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Government proposals, I want to contrast them with our proposals and show certain defects. First of all, by keeping the present system under which universities are financed largely by direct grants; no improvement is made in their autonomy which would be achieved by fee grants paid to the students. Secondly, foreigners under the present scheme will not be charged the full cost of university education, which I believe they should be, unless they are scholarship holders from underdeveloped countries. Thirdly, the <Col N="489" /> scheme involves the introduction of a means test for the grants out of which fees should be paid. Our scheme would have meant as far as the fees were concerned those were free to everybody without a means test. The means test would come only in maintenance and board grants, as is proper. This is a defect in this scheme, in that the fees have to be paid out of the maintenance grant which itself is governed by a means test. In our scheme the fees would be paid separately. Finally, there is a defect, which the Minister has now gone a good distance to alleviate, that is that there would be no scholarships open to all.</P>
      <P>One point I would like to make is that the Minister has attempted to persuade the other House, and I think this House too, that this is not a scholarship scheme but a grant scheme, but his good friend, Senator Dolan, blew this one sky-high today when he said he congratulated the Minister and said he was delighted with the scheme because it was a scholarship scheme, a scheme under which you could only get into the universities with the aid of those scholarships if you achieved a high standard. There had to be scholarships, no nonsense such as giving grants to people just to let them free into a university. So, that particular smoke-screen has been blown away with the help of Senator Dolan.</P>
      <P>There are other defects of this scholarship scheme to which I should like to draw attention. There is this point to which I might draw attention and which should be stressed but I shall not develop it at length. It was developed well in the other House which is perhaps not true of all the points that have been made so far. There is inequity to local authorities in the scheme because those which are progressive and which raised the rates to the higher level, are now stuck with having to pay that indefinitely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may have a difficulty in remedying this here and now but I would like to see it remedied in future and I would like when we come to the Committee Stage that we would consider some amendment which would help him to remedy it. I think with <Col N="490" /> the present wording he would be unable to alleviate this injustice even if he wanted to. I think an amendment would at least make it possible for him to do so if he felt it financially practical. I do not think we can press him much beyond that at the moment but that at least might be acceptable.</P>
    <P>Another feature which Senator Dooge stressed, and therefore I shall not develop it further, is that the scheme leaves the local authorities as simple and pure agents of central government, carrying out their automatic function for them. This is a role to which they are relegated far too often and this is not in accord with the concepts of democratisation, to which I was referring earlier, under the inspiration of Senator Ó Maoláin and Senator Ó Donnabháin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The next point I want to make, and here I want to press the Minister hard, although I know it is very hard for the Minister to give ground, and that is the inequity to existing students of excluding them from the scheme. The Minister has come clean on this and has said: &ldquo;Frankly the reason is cost, £300,000.&rdquo; I would be interested to know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It must diminish. Obviously the next year it must be less and the following year virtually nothing. As we go on all the students will have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we went back to every existing student irrespective of entry it would be close to £1 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about what they paid in the past. I am talking about the position next year where you will have some students in the university getting those grants and others not getting them simply according to what date they entered. Obviously the cost of remedying this for the first year would be <Col N="491" /> £300,000, diminishing each year until it would disappear in three or four years time.</P>
      <P>I want to press the Minister on this for several reasons. First of all, on the grounds of equity. It is inequitable to create this situation. I know a start has to be made somewhere and when you start any new beneficial scheme those who are just cut outside it by having passed through the gates just beforehand will feel they were at a disadvantage. I appreciate there is always such a problem but to have side by side in the same college students, often indeed in the same year, if they are repeating &mdash; and many of them will be &mdash; I am just correcting examination scripts at the moment &mdash; side by side in the same year, some with grants and some not having grants seems to me to be clearly inequitable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the problem. The whole past is behind us. The students have suffered through failures on both sides of the House, although for the last 11 years the main responsibility was on the other side of the House, and they will all be crying out for vengeance and justice, it is true. But at this particular point I am concerned with the situation in the university next year, when you will have those students side by side and with the sense of injustice that will be felt. I would like to say to the Minister that he will want to consider that very seriously because anybody who is in the university at the moment, who has his ear even several feet from the ground will know of the strong feelings the subject has aroused. I think the Minister will find himself faced with considerable trouble, trouble of a kind he has not had before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend any inflammatory statement and indeed anything I can do will be designed to prevent any trouble arising, but I must say to the Minister that this particular thing has aroused a sense of great injustice among students at a time when some of them are looking around for something to feel injustice about because they have examples in other countries. In this country, we have not got all that many injustices but to produce a nice, new, fresh injustice and throw it on their laps at this moment in time, seems to me unwise. I can say if I were the Minister I would seek to avoid doing this at this time, if at all possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the Minister will get himself into very severe difficulties in this if something is not done about it because people are aware that many students this year, faced with the threat of this injustice, met the situation by abandoning their first arts examination and doing the leaving certificate again, to get four honours and get their grants, a situation which was academically very unfortunate &mdash; that they should abandon their examinations. Whether they can do them again in the autumn is a problem in some cases. I think the universities are trying to facilitate them in this. I believe in one college, in one faculty, in one examination 140 students were not there because they were redoing their leaving certificate to get the grant. In one college, in one faculty, in one examination 140 empty places because of students doing their leaving certificate again to get the grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In another case the students approached the faculty to ask if they could abandon the first year examination as a whole and take the examination afresh in the autumn by taking a repeat in the autumn having failed to do it in the summer. This is a situation that is evidence of the gross injustice and inequity of the Minister's <Col N="493" /> proposals as they are at present drafted. What is the Minister going to do? Will the position be that these students will get their grants or will the Minister turn round after the event and use some obscure power in the Bill to deprive them of the grants?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of depriving them. Any student who gets four honours in 1968 will get in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the students who put first their immediate academic performance, who put their duty to their university examination first, will be at a disadvantage and those who abandoned the examination and did the leaving certificate will be at an advantage. Under no circumstances must the Minister play around with this and withdraw from the people the advantage consequent on doing the examination. But by giving it to them and not giving it to the others he will create a resentment at a particularly unjust decision. There is nothing the Minister can do at this stage but go to the Minister for Finance and look for that £300,000 if he wants to avoid serious trouble next autumn.</P>
      <P>The next defect of the Minister's scheme to which I want to draw attention is &mdash; and this has been mentioned by other speakers&mdash;that because of the standard of four honours many university entrants will be excluded. The Minister has told us that the present scheme will apply to 1,900 students. He said, I think, that 1,900 students are expected to emerge from this year's leaving certificate with four honours and of these 900 are expected to be entitled to get a grant and to take it up and go to university. Is that right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that these figures should be on the record. If the ratio is the same he should expect that 2,000 would go to university if he gave the grants on the basis of the university entrance qualification. In fact, the proportion would be less because those who had a less high qualification would be less inclined to go to university. We can say broadly that probably the effect of applying the scheme to students with two honours would be that those going to university with grants would be doubled.</P>

      <P>I appreciate this would be a factor, but in my experience the &ldquo;drop-out&rdquo; rate, as you might call it, as you go down the scale in honours is considerable. I would think that of those who get four honours in the leaving certificate virtually all go to university or to the Civil Service or to the teacher training college, but when you go down the line to two honours there would, in fact, be many who would not attend any of these places. Allowing for the effect of the Civil Service and the teacher training, I would have thought that the proportion of those entitled to take up the award would be rather less for the two honours group.</P>

      <P>In any event it would probably be a doubling of the numbers. It seems to me that it <Col N="495" /> is very unfortunate to have created a situation in which you are establishing this grant or scholarship system for those who get twice as many honours as those who require to enter university. I would think the Minister should reconsider this.</P>

      <P>I am not speaking of the flexibility at all but of the Minister's stated intention in implementing the Bill. I would hope that this could be reconsidered. In our proposals we gave much thought to this problem. We considered whether there should be a higher standard for free grants, maintenance grants and board grants for university entrants, so that there would be some people who fell down on the grants but who would nevertheless qualify for entrance if their parents were prepared to pay the full cost of university education.</P>
      <P>We hesitated long over that but eventually we felt it would be an unsatisfactory situation and we came down in favour of applying the university entrance qualification to anybody who qualifies for entry to university &mdash; all should be entitled to the grants. I should like the Minister to say that this is something he agrees with in principle. I should like to hear his views on this even if he is inhibited by financial difficulties from implementing this principle this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the entrance qualification itself, I am concerned about things that have happened recently in the university as well as in the Minister's Department in relation to specialisation. We had the university raising the entrance requirement, which was long overdue and of which I am entirely in favour. I am entirely in favour of raising the entrance but the method adopted was not one of saying that a certain standard be reached on the aggregate in the examination but that by specialisation a student must concentrate on one or two subjects to get the necessary number of honours. The <Col N="496" /> university was wrong to adopt this method. It may have been a matter of administrative convenience, which is something that carries weight in universities as well as in the Civil Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We will wait for him.</P>
      <P>I was about to speak on the subject of the entrance qualification which is being employed for the purpose of this Bill and I was criticising the universities for having, in raising the entrance standards, employed as the technique for so doing a system of one or two honours in the leaving certificate examination. This seems bad to me because it encourages students to concentrate their efforts on particular subjects, to ensure they will get honours, instead of concentrating on getting a broad education in the secondary schools. It is fair to say this is a widespread feeling in educational circles although it is not unanimous, because nothing ever is in the universities.</P>
      <P>It might be thought by people outside the universities that university professors, in their enthusiasm for their subjects, would like to have students who had specialised in their subjects and who had reached a high standard in them already, because they would be less troublesome to teach. This is an attraction for the university professor but nevertheless to a remarkable degree university staffs in this country at the present time are strongly of the view that any encouragement to specialise is harmful &mdash; that what is required is a broad general education but with a higher standard than heretofore, with specialisation awaiting entrance to the universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The university authorities were not, I think, really representing the views of their staffs in adopting this system of raising standards. It has been accepted by the staffs because the urgent need for raising standards was acceptable to everybody and this method was the simplest, but it has not got strong support and most people would like to see some other system. It has been <Col N="497" /> followed by the new leaving certificate proposals which have also had a very bad press in the universities where there is a strong feeling that they involve too much concentration and specialisation, and in the discussions on them it has been evident that even with later modifications, they are too much in the direction of specialisation and away from the direction in which Britain is moving. We seem to be moving in the opposite direction from educational opinion elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Now it is proposed in a third way to encourage specialisation and, perhaps, in some way the most acute pressure towards it is to provide that one will get into university with these grants if one gets four honours encouraging, therefore, a high degree of concentration on those four subjects to the exclusion of the broader spectrum of education which the students should be securing at that stage. It is a merit of our system of education at the moment that it is not too specialised. I have a child taking the intermediate certificate at the moment and I find that she is taking it in nine or ten subjects. I think that this is a good thing. It can be overdone, of course, but broadly it is to be encouraged for those students who are able to do it without losing out by spreading their efforts over too wide a sphere. In any event, the four honours arrangement is a further encouragement of specialisation, a third move in that direction made in a very short space of time and which many Irish people abhor.</P>
    <P>I am personally doubtful whether one can effectively combine any terminal examination such as the leaving certificate is designed to be &mdash; designed to give people a qualification as they leave secondary school, designed to be passed by 91 or 92 per cent of our people&mdash;I am not at all sure that you can combine that with a university entrance examination, which should be fairly stringent. I have doubts about the Minister's solution of four honours.</P>

      <P>On this point of the actual examination I do not suggest that my view here is a majority one or even is necessarily a very general one. Many people in the universities feel that you can make good use of the leaving certificate in this way, but, on the other hand, there are others who think that this kind of terminal examination ought not to be used as a university entrance standard. I am perhaps in a minority on this. It is only fair to say that. I am, nevertheless, still sceptical about it. My views, in fact, are shared by the Union of Students in Ireland in its representations to the Minister about this scheme. I do not suggest that this proves that I am necessarily right, but it adds further force to my argument. What I should like to see as a university entrance examination is a genuine matriculation examination designed for the purpose of university entrance as an appropriate standard, where you would not concentrate on getting good results in one or two subjects but would have to pass this entrance examination at a reasonable standard. There are difficulties about such a scheme. The sheer numbers involved would impose enormous strains on the universities, and as one who is now immersed in examination papers I can sympathise with my university colleagues who do not wish to take on that additional strain, some of which, indeed, we at present off-load on other people who have to deal with the leaving certificate. But I am not sure that we should allow our self-interest in that respect to determine the shape of the examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinlan raised an interesting and valuable point which should not be lost sight of, because not only is it useful in this context but it is something that should be looked at in the broader context of our whole system of transfer payments. This is the point of providing a means test through the taxation <Col N="499" /> system rather than introducing a new special one for the purpose. It seems that we have not used our imagination in this, and while I know that it would be difficult to secure the precise results the Minister has secured as regards the tapering off of these grants through the taxation system, it would not be impossible to secure something very close to it, if the Minister were prepared to introduce some provision under which people in receipt of these grants would be given them not under a means test basis, but that they would on the one hand have to pay tax on them, and perhaps pay tax, at certain income levels, at more than the standard rate, and would also lose the benefit of the child allowances which they can maintain if a child remains in education; by a judicious combination of these two methods almost exactly the same tapering effect could be achieved as is achieved here without introducing any new means test, using the income tax code for the purpose. If every parent was entitled to these grants but had to return this on his income tax form and by a judicious admixture of taxation allowances at various rates at appropriate income levels, and taking away the £150 child allowance also at certain income levels, you could achieve any particular result you wanted as regards tapering off the benefits of this scheme so that from the Exchequer point of view the same result would be achieved. It would require at a certain income level a taxing of the grant at more than the standard rate, but if the Minister for Finance were prepared to consider such an arrangement, the whole means test paraphernalia introduced here could be done away with and administratively this would be of great benefit. I emphasise this point because it has a wider importance. We in this country have developed a very proper antipathy to means tests as they have been applied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not my proposal. I was thinking of balancing up through the whole class but I was not suggesting the individual balancing that the Senator seems to <Col N="500" /> think I was. I cannot see any merit in the individual balancing up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not mean to suggest that what I was putting forward was Senator Quinlan's proposal but I was suggesting that using the tax system seemed to be something worth looking at. I would prefer something on the lines I have mentioned, something which is closer to what the Minister has here. Senator Quinlan would see the problem somewhat differently, but I think both of us agree that to introduce a special means test of this kind to be administered for the purpose of this scheme only seems at this stage unnecessary. Means tests have been necessary at very low income levels where finance does not permit of great generosity because the taxation level is not applying at those levels. We are in a difficulty here. There must be some kind of means test applied, but as incomes rise we can eventually reach the point where the whole of our means tests which we have to have for transferring income from one group to another can be operated through an imaginative tax code, but this would involve close cooperation between the Departments of Finance, Education, Social Welfare and Health. I would suggest to the Minister that he should take this suggestion away and look at it. This is probably something he could not do at this stage but I think from the long term point of view of social welfare in the broad sense, not just social insurance and assistance but social welfare as this is, where we must transfer income from one group to another, it would be well worthwhile to establish an inter-Departmental Committee to look at this whole area and see whether we could not introduce a system which would be applied to a whole range of social benefits.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> I would like now to deal with the last point I have to make as regards defects in the scheme. It is the Minister's proposal to exclude for the time being the teacher training colleges from the scheme. It seems to me that this is a wrong thing to do in itself. The Minister has said that this is only to be for one year, that he proposes to bring them into the university system within a year, and this will get over this difficulty. I am not, however, convinced or happy. First of all I do not think there is much to be said for excluding them for one year and then bringing them in. It is not worthwhile even financially to do it. There is no point in the exercise. It seems to me that the Minister and his Department did not wish to bring them in in the first instance. They have now been pushed to it and do not appear to be able in the time available to adjust themselves to bring them into the scheme at this point. I think this should be reconsidered. I am unhappy about the whole position as regards training colleges because this proposal that they should be left out for a year and then brought in raises the question in what form are they to be brought in. There are disturbing rumours of the Minister's intentions in this regard.</P>

The whole tone of this contribution was to force them out of this area into another, by in fact making the attractions of the university financially much greater than those of the training college. It is one thing to make them open to people, to give them an option, it is a different thing to try to force them out of this area and into another. What he was proposing at that time was that people should deliberately be given financial aid to go to university and not to training colleges.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that this is wrong and that we should not even for a year have these diversionary tactics to push people out of training colleges into universities. What I am concerned about is how in fact the colleges are to be integrated into the university system on the basis of the Minister's remarks. In our proposal we give a lot of thought to this problem. In fact we gave a considerable amount of time and thought to the question of how teacher training should be brought into the university system. The solution we came up with we considered tentative and the Minister will know that while we did suggest a particular solution we said we were not convinced it was necessarily the best solution and considered it a matter for further consideration. Our proposal was that in fact people going to be primary teachers would go to a university and undertake a university course of three years but that normally they would undergo simultaneous training in the theory and practice of education and this would then be followed by a full year at the training college. This would have several merits. First of all, it would have the merit that the teachers would all have the opportunity of a university education. Secondly, by reducing the period of residence from a period of two years to one year, the output could be doubled. We felt very strongly that the policy of the Government in the Second Programme of reducing the training of national teachers despite the fact that the Programme itself says that several thousand extra teachers were needed on the grounds that if you provided extra facilities that might not be needed in the 1970s, was an absurd policy because the Government's own population forecast showed that there would be 100,000 extra primary school children in this country in 1981 by contrast with 1971. To suggest in those circumstances that extra facilities to train extra teachers would become unnecessary when in fact there would be a desperate need for more teachers in the seventies was obvious nonsense. It showed a total lack of any idea of proper planning in the Minister's <Col N="504" /> Department, for which the Minister was not then responsible. On this side we were concerned to divert the Government from this policy and instead to promote an increase in the output of teachers and the quickest way to do that was to reduce residence in a teachers' college to one year, giving them three years at a university and one full year in the teachers' college concentrating on education.</P>

      <P>We felt, however, that this might not necessarily be ideal because in the case of one teachers' college its achievements in the field of research and education are such that it seemed to some of us that it was approaching the point at which it could reasonably seek university status. I am referring to St. Patrick's Training College, and our solution to the problem would have kept it in its present situation as a training college. For that reason we did not press the matter and we felt that it should be looked at in more detail. My concern is whether the Minister's proposals for the training colleges would secure a genuine university education for primary teachers by continuing to train them in the existing colleges, pretending they were university colleges, and perhaps giving them some fake qualifications at the end of their courses? My other concern is that St. Patrick's Training College would, in the Minister's scheme, be deprived of the opportunity of developing into a university college. There are disturbing rumours of the Minister's intention to locate the principal teachers' training college elsewhere than in Dublin.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to hear that. It is a great step forward.</P>
      <P>Another point of clarification arises with regard to Irish and the leaving certificate. In columns 556 and 557 the Minister says:</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully and Deputy Lindsay both mentioned specific cases that had been brought to their notice of persons who had got four honours in the leaving certificate last year and in one case had not got Irish and in another had not got Latin and who were doing these subjects this year. I have decided that this type of person &mdash; there must not be more than three or four of them in the whole country &mdash; should come within the ambit of the Bill and I can give that assurance that we will devise arrangements whereby these particular cases will come within the ambit of this year's higher education grants scheme.</P>
      <P>This does not appear in the Minister's explanatory memorandum which says that we will provide a grant to anybody going to the university North or South who gets four honours in the leaving certificate. I take it the question of whether he got Irish is not an essential.</P>

      <P>I should like to make the point, unless the Minister cares to direct me, that what is stated here is that the standard for obtaining admission is four honours in university subjects in the leaving certificate examination. It is not said anywhere that they must have passed the examination. I would appeal to the Minister not to perpetuate and aggravate the injustice at the present time imposed on students by the leaving certificate Irish requirement, this penal requirement, introduced in 1934, when, in fact, 95 per cent of the children in the schools were taking Irish in the leaving certificate anyway. I appeal to him not at this stage to create a situation in which people are going to be deprived of the opportunity of going to any university, North or South, even with four honours in the leaving certificate, even if they meet the Minister's explanatory memorandum, just because they have failed in this particular subject.</P>
      <P>The Minister will do himself no good; his Party no good and the country no good by perpetuating and aggravating the present situation. If he wants to go on now, with this rule in relation to the bit of paper he hands out we cannot stop him although we are committed, as the Minister knows, to getting rid of that when we come into office. But I do appeal to him not to introduce this at this stage into the grants scheme, not to create a new source of grievance against the language, not once again to set up something that is going to turn people further against the language and cause controversy in this country when there has been some hope in recent times of getting away from it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A point was raised by Senator McAuliffe on the question of UCD scholarships and NUI scholarships. I can only comment that the situation in which students from Westmeath were penalised because that County Council decided to allow some student to take a scholarship to Trinity College is one which many people in the NUI and University College, Dublin feel is totally wrong and I am glad that this will disappear. It is due to what I think is a misinterpretation by the authorities of one or more university colleges in the NUI of the terms of the 1908 Act, a misinterpretation which has caused hardship and has done a lot of damage to the image of University College, Dublin and the NUI throughout the country where people cannot understand why there should be this attempt to prevent any student, no matter what his religious denomination or particular interest in taking a <Col N="510" /> particular subject, from taking a particular scholarship in Trinity College.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the Minister's assurance. I am merely saying that although this has been done in the past it has not had the support by any means of everyone or indeed even the majority, or anything like the majority, of people in the university colleges of the NUI. It is an anachronism of which many of us are ashamed.</P>
      <P>One final point was raised in the debate and that is the question of accommodation. Here, I would simply like to say that I would support the point made. The whole question of accommodation for university students is something we must turn our attention to. I know there are problems of capital resources. There are so many things for which we need capital that some people may feel that this is not of the highest urgency, that as long as there are landladies somewhere in Dublin who will take students in, it is all right, but I think this is something we cannot continue to accept, the virtual and total absence of hostel accommodation, except for the great work some religious orders are doing, but the number of places in those hostels is tending to diminish and not all of them will be able to continue their operations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister knows there are possibilities here of getting capital from other sources, the possibilities of private insurance companies or other institutions providing the capital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope if proposals come forward, and even if they involve some degree of subsidisation in the running of those hostels by the universities that the Minister would consider them and consider making available to those colleges whatever small sums are needed <Col N="511" /> to subsidise the running of these hostels. Such hostels should be designed imaginatively so that as much as possible of the accommodation vacated by some of the students in the summer &mdash; many of them remain on of course for their BA degree or whatever degree it may be &mdash; can be used for tourist purposes. There are possibilities here of a very efficient and economic operation. I am glad to see that the Minister is interested in this and that something is going ahead.</P>
      <P>I think that is the last point I have to make. I look forward to hearing the Minister replying, although we have been gratified by a reply to a number of points in the course of the debate, but nevertheless I look forward to hearing him summing up the whole round of the debate when a number of other speakers have finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House will be unanimous in the fact that this legislation is both necessary and urgent. Any deliberations we have in connection with it should be in the light of that necessity and that urgency. The first necessity is to develop, as Senator Stanford has referred to it, our peculiar national culture and our moral fibre so that we can, in fact, realise our full potential. The second is, of course, a practical urgency which has arisen because of the extension of the facilities for free education at secondary school level. If this education programme is to be brought to its logical conclusion then, of course, it will have to be implemented at every level, primary, secondary and university. For that reason, in view of the fact that the secondary school programme is already under way, it is vitally important that this extension of the scheme now to university education be implemented without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we must all appreciate that the Minister has said here initially that he does not suggest that his proposals in this Bill are the final proposals he has made it is quite clear in fact that he thinks the merits of this Bill is its flexibility as to standards which will be required, as to the means test and as to the institutions which will be recognised <Col N="512" /> and I think that even in the light of what has been said so far it is, indeed, evident that much will require to be done if not this year, next year, to update and to improve the scheme and the facilities according as the demands arise.</P>
    <P>My main concern for university education generally lies in the fact that the graduates up to the present do not represent either the general level across the nation of the population of this country in the fashion in which they should and even in so far as they do qualify with university qualifications they do not have the urgency to contribute to the general development of the nation as one would hope they should. I made this point earlier in connection with the debate on the Report of the Commission on Higher Education when I said that even in active political life one does not find at all &mdash; though it is not so much true of this House as of the other House &mdash; the professions playing the part they should. I feel the answer to this certainly is that many of those who have come through our universities up to this time have not been in direct association with need and urgency, have been in many ways subsidised by wealthy parents and for that reason have felt no obligation, either to themselves or to the nation, to give back what has been given to them.</P>
    <P>One of the great advantages of the scheme we are now launching is that we will, so to speak, introduce a new channel of university graduates who, having come from homes which otherwise could not have provided education will realise that they have come quite a long way and will be anxious to go even further and will not settle down merely for purposes of their own comfort and, possibly, their own wealth.</P>
    <P>This must be the first principle of this legislation which we are discussing and, I think, in this I would agree with much that has been said by many Senators that we should as much as possible, both in looking at the standard that is being applied for entry for the scholarships as well as looking at the university curricula, hammer home the fact that specialisation is not the best nor near the greatest of the <Col N="513" /> virtues to be got from university education. In any area on educational development it never was so regarded and it would be a great pity now if most people who availed of these would feel that it would give them the qualification which would put them in a particular profession which would give them a certain level of income. University means much more than that and our approach to this Bill both to the standard for entry and the standard maintained at university level should be always to ensure that the broader aspects of university education would be encouraged.</P>
    <P>Having realised that the problem is one of immediate urgency, we must then come to consider how can it now be tackled, not necessarily what is the best way to tackle it if we wait for ten or five years. I think Senator G. FitzGerald will agree with me, and I do not misquote him I hope, that many of his proposals, while well deserving of further study, could not possibly be implemented now or indeed in two, three or four years. They certainly do bear investigation on our part so as to consider what we are now implementing. In addition to that the Minister has proposed, first of all, approved institutions, we take it the institutions at which these higher education grants will be made available. Here I see the first significant step in the extension of what was previously regarded as a narrow field of university education. It is evident, though the institutions are not yet spelled out, that it will go beyond the limit of what are now the universities as we know them. Many of the technological schools, institutes of legal and other studies, will come within the scope of this Bill. We have had the anomaly on many occasions. It is sufficient to give an example of people who wish to study law to qualify as a barrister or a solicitor who could not use their university scholarship to qualify as a barrister or solicitor. The only advantage they could get from their university scholarship was a university degree in law which was not the basic qualification for the profession and this is something which has been a glaring fault for so long that many of those have first of all <Col N="514" /> taken the university qualifications and then have been obliged to do further part-time work to give them the essential qualifications they need to practice. This must apply in many other cases and I am glad to see the Minister has, in fact, indicated in this Bill that the approved institutions will go beyond the universities as we know them. I would suggest to him and I know this will give him and his Department much thought for a while that in this interpretation he should be liberal, if not this year, in subsequent years. There are many spheres of higher education in which we are at present entirely deficient. One that occurs to me is physical education, one which is bound up with the health and well-being of the nation, and we do not have, unfortunately, an approved institute of higher training for physical education. There are many young boys and girls who would, even with academic ability which would probably equip them well for studies in the humanities or other professional activities, still like to devote themselves to this very important aspect of higher education and cannot now do so. I would suggest to the Minister that where these gaps or deficiencies exist that he must first examine and, then as time goes on, provide such institutions where they do not now exist and, having done so, extend the benefits of these grants to such institutions. It is rather ludicrous that we should have to depend on the facilities which may be available in England or elsewhere for any training in any particular specialised sphere of higher education.</P>
    <P>I would also agree entirely with the suggestion that the training colleges, of course, must come within the ambit of this scheme. I would, without any knowledge of what the difficulty of introducing the scheme this year might be, agree with Senator FitzGerald that it would be desirable that it could be done at the start. Perhaps the Minister might explain in his reply what the problems are this year for leaving the training colleges outside the scope of the scheme just for now. I am encouraged to know that it will not be excluded any longer than this year. In <Col N="515" /> fact, I would be happier to know that it would be included from the start.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly it is, I will come to deal with the entrance point in a moment. If we are to have co-ordination we must have it in the fullest sense. I accept from the Minister if this co-ordination of the university course needs to be ironed out over this year it may be necessary to do so.</P>
      <P>With regard to the first criterion of qualification, very briefly on means, all of us feel somewhat repelled by the notion of means and as much as possible we would like to eliminate the qualification of a means test. It has not been one of the most attractive criteria of our social welfare system and we all look forward to the day when we can dispense with it in some fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we must face the fact that the urgency which is there at present must be met and that it must be met from limited resources. Its implementation must be within those limited resources and I do not think there is any way to do it except by applying a means test. On the application of a means test I should like to make one <Col N="516" /> or two comments on hardship cases that will arise in the means test as it will be applied this year.</P>
    <P>From the explanatory memorandum it seems evident that the farming community will get, I would say, a fair deal in that the farmer with a valuation of £60 is taken as being more or less on a par with a man of a salary of £1,200. A good farmer &mdash; we are under no obligation to subsidise a bad farmer any more than a bad teacher or a bad lawyer &mdash; is in a far better position than a man with a salary of £1,200. This, of course, is a general observation because there may well be exceptional cases in which, for instance, a farmer may be suffering from some physical disability or illness which obliges him to hire other labour on a farm of £50 or £60 valuation. The Bill as at present drawn up apparently does not give the Minister any discretion in giving what one might call a compensation allowance to any person who has to employ extra labour because of his illness, not an uncommon experience throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Apart from illness, the question of old age arises on many Irish farms. Therefore, the Minister might consider leaving himself the facility to extend the scheme to people who otherwise would be outside it on the basis of what one might call unusual personal hardship.</P>
