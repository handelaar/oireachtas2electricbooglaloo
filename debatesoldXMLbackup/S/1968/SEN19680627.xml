      <P>Before we take up consideration of the Second Stage of this Bill I should like to indicate that I have ruled that amendment No. 1, standing in the names of Senators Quinlan and Sheehy Skeffington is out of order on the grounds that it is not relevant to the subject matter of the Bill. The Senators have been informed accordingly.</P>
      <P>Question proposed : &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in the Dáil, the primary purpose of this Bill is to ensure that no person who thinks that he has a contribution to make to public affairs will be prevented from offering himself for election to the Dáil or Seanad because of his material circumstances. Due to the influence which the State exercises today over practically every aspect of the daily life of the citizen the role of the public representative is of major importance and the country requires the best material that can be got for both the Dáil and the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is need for more and more communication and understanding <Col N="736" /> between the Government and the people at every level and I am satisfied that the job of promoting this understanding can only be done properly by top class public representatives. I have no doubt that many eminently suitable people have in the past been deterred from entering public life either through lack of means or because of the substantial losses they would incur by the neglect of their private affairs which such a step would entail.</P>
    <P>The people we need must be willing and able to sacrifice a great deal of their time and energy to public affairs. The Dáil Deputy, in particular, has no set hours and is expected to be constantly at the disposal of his constituents; there are countless callers to be seen, letters to be written, calls to be made, deputations arranged, questions put down, and so on. Over and above all this there is his work as legislator which is of prime importance. As a member of the Dáil he must deal with the continuing process of legislation, with complex bills, financial business and a wide variety of other issues with which he must be familiar, and able to discuss and decide upon.</P>
    <P>The fact that a Senator's activities are more restricted and that his expenses, though quite substantial, are on a lesser scale than those of Deputies is reflected in the lower rate of allowance which he receives. This Bill proposes a broadly proportionate increase for Senators to that proposed for Deputies.</P>
    <P>In mentioning expenses I want to emphasise once again that a Deputy or Senator does not get anything like the full amount of the allowance for his own use. Outgoings will vary from place to place and from individual to individual but they will in all cases be substantial. Secretarial assistance has to be employed in many cases and I do not have to remind Senators that there are constant appeals for all sorts of desirable causes which have to be met, charities to be supported, and subscriptions of all sorts to be made. It is, I think, taken for granted that a public representative should give a lead within his resources in contributing to charities, etc.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> I also want to refer once again to the position about the tax liability of Deputies and Senators as far as these allowances are concerned. Since 1960 the allowances paid to members of the Oireachtas are liable to income tax. Senators are well aware of this from their own experience but it is necessary to explain the position in order to dispel once and for all the notion some people have that these allowances are tax-free.</P>
    <P>I now deal with the proposed new salaries for members of the Government and similar whole-time offices. The salary of the Taoiseach is being increased from £3,300 to £5,500 a year, those of Ministers from £2,200 to £3,500 and those of Parliamentary Secretaries from £1,320 to £2,250. The salaries of the Attorney General, of the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle and of the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Cathaoirleach are being increased on much the same lines.</P>
    <P>I think there is fairly general agreement that the present salaries are far too low and unrealistic. It is a fact that the remuneration of the Taoiseach is much less than that obtaining for a top management job in commerce or industry or at the top of the professions. Ministers are in a similar position and have people under their jurisdiction who are paid a great deal more than they are. As I said in the Dáil, it would be very bad for our system of government&mdash;and for the future of our country&mdash;if men who would be eminently suitable for the most responsible posts in the service of the State had to turn away in order to protect the interests of their families. In looking to the years to come, one must consider what calibre of man is likely to be attracted to political life &mdash; as Deputy, Senator or Minister &mdash; if the reward is a great deal less than that available in the much less exacting and far more secure private sector. There is therefore, I believe, a solemn obligation on the Oireachtas to see to it that the right people are attracted to its service now and in the future.</P>
    <P>Finally the Bill proposes an increase in the assistance given to the two main Opposition Parties to enable them to discharge their parliamentary duties <Col N="738" /> efficiently. The increasing complexities and scope of modern Government demands, that to ensure the effective functioning of Parliament, the Opposition Parties must have at least a minimum of administrative and research assistance available to them. The existing allowances of £3,360 for the Leader of the main Opposition Party and £1,680 for the Leader of the smaller Party are now entirely inadequate for this purpose and the Bill proposes that these allowances should be increased to £10,000 and £5,000 respectively.</P>
    <P>What I have said will, I hope, help to put the Bill in its true perspective, which is, to ensure that the best talents among those who feel drawn to public life will not be prevented, through lack of means, from serving their country in this way. The effectiveness of future Governments will depend on the quality of the young people entering politics now. We cannot afford to let the situation deteriorate because of a reluctance to face some temporary unpopularity. We must provide allowances which will cover their necessary expenses and give them a reasonable standard of living. Increasingly, public service becomes more demanding in time, energy and money. Those who are elected to give this service should be suitably recompensed. I therefore recommend the proposals in this Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to move the second amendment on the Order Paper:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Bill, 1968 because it does not include provision for the provision for the application of a means test in accordance with which the proposed increases would be granted to members of Dáil Éireann and to members of Seanad Éireann under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for putting down this amendment rather than raising the matter in a recommendation on Committee Stage is that the Government decided, justifiably from the technical point of view, to have this Bill considered <Col N="739" /> as a Money Bill, and consequently the type of amendment which would include a means test would have been ruled out of order on the Committee Stage. Therefore I had no other way of raising the matter on this proposal, which gives an increase of £1,000 per year to every Deputy and an increase of £500 per year to every Senator.</P>
    <P>We are about to have a referendum on another matter, probably in October. We are not having a referendum on this matter of Oireachtas salaries but I would suggest to the House and the Minister that if a referendum was held on this question as to whether the Irish public and electorate felt that this was the time to increase the allowances of Deputies by 66? per cent and that of Senators by 50 per cent, the answer of the country would be &ldquo;no&rdquo;. That is one reason why I consider it important to put the matter before the House and I hope the House will be convinced that this is a matter which we should refer back to the Dáil for further consideration.</P>
    <P>I hold, and I think many people will agree with me, that there has been indecent haste in dealing with this Bill. I think that what prompted the haste is that the Government know and are increasingly being made aware of the fact that the country is saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;. It would be awkward for the Government to have the matter drag and to have it discussed publicly more and more, and so the Government want to get rid of it fast and press it through with markedly more speed than other measures of far greater urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>On May 15th last in the Seanad, the Minister for Finance told me in relation to the pensions of widows and orphans of State servants in column 1378, volume 64, No. 16:</P>
      <P>I directed that the question of pensions for widows and orphans of State servants should be taken up by the conciliation and arbitration machinery and an effort made to devise an acceptable scheme. That work has actually been in progress for some considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> At column 1382 the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The position about the pensions for widows and orphans of State servants is as I said some time ago&mdash; I do not know whether I used the word &ldquo;considerable&rdquo;; if I did I would modify it to &ldquo;some time ago&rdquo;&mdash;that this matter was taken up in connection with conciliation and arbitration machinery. It is not a question of it being under review. It is a question of work going on, a drawing up of an acceptable scheme by the people concerned. As soon as that scheme can be hammered out, there will be no delay on my part in introducing it.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that this had been in action for some considerable time and that the scheme has practically come to fruition. He assured me of that on 15th May. Today is 27th June and the Minister has not been guilty of indecent haste in relation to this scheme of pensions for widows and orphans of State servants.</P>
    <P>It seems to me indefensible that we should be so eager and so willing to rush through legislation for increases for ourselves when lack of money is freely used as an excuse for other and far more urgent objects. I mentioned yesterday, and I do not intend to delay the Seanad by mentioning in detail again, that we subject widows and old age pensioners and blind pensioners and the unemployed to means tests which imply that £169 a year is enough for a widow to live on, because that is the point at which the means test results in her getting nothing by way of non-contributory pension. Similarly with an old age pensioner. I mentioned also the fact that for parents of university students hoping to benefit under the new grants scheme, if a parent has £1,800 a year, this is considered ample for him and his family of ten children and he should be able within the £1,800 to put all his ten children successively, and presumably successfully, through the university with no State aid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is incorrect: £1,800 is not the maximum for ten children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but my memory is that at £1,700 and less than £1,800 there is slight aid, but at £1,800 there is none, though I am open to correction on that. It is possible that it applies only to the man with fewer children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>And he <Col N="742" /> repeats &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; in his characteristic way. I am afraid that I am unaffected by this type of interruption because I am used to it, and I intend, Mr. Chairman&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in spite of the interruptions and the dignified &ldquo;cheap, cheap&rdquo; of Senator Yeats. I am not affected by this kind of birdcall. My contention is, and I recognise that on the question of whether it be ten children or one child or 20 children, the ceiling of course varies, but there is no question of the fact that if a parent of university children wants to get a grant, there is a maximum at which he will get the trivial grant and that is, if I remember correctly, £2,500. The point I am making is that whether the number of children is smaller or bigger, a means test is applied.</P>
      <P>When I made it known that I was putting down an amendment to this effect, a difficulty arose, and that was in obtaining a seconder. I asked a number of Senators in the House would they second this, and for one reason or another, there was a certain reluctance to do so. I did not ask anybody in the Government Party, because they are very obedient to the Party Whip, but I did ask a number of Independents and members of the Fine Gael Party and of the Labour Party. While I did not meet with any hostility, I did not meet with any notable support from any of those Senators. I am grateful to Senator Quinlan for enabling this to be discussed by putting his name to it and supporting me. I had also a promise from my colleague, Senator Stanford, but unfortunately Senator Stanford was taken ill yesterday and rushed to hospital. I am glad to say that he is doing well, but he is prevented from being here by this illness. I think that it is not without significance that whilst the country at large contains large numbers of people who feel that this legislation to increase our allowances is ill-conceived, it is extremely difficult to get any support for this view in the House, or even any great willingness to have the case presented and debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> I remember in the early days of Fianna Fáil, in 1927, when Fianna Fáil first went into the Dáil, the Leader of Fianna Fáil at that time committed himself publicly to the proposition that no man was worth more than £1,000 a year. I am fully aware that £1,000 a year then was worth markedly more than it is now, but the whole spirit of Fianna Fáil in those days was one which was far more egalitarian than it is now. It was far more republican. Senator Yeats yesterday, when I was objecting to major increases of the judicial salaries, said that I was talking in terms of ten, 20 or 30 years ago. I interjected: &ldquo;Yes, those were republican days.&rdquo; Senator Yeats is not old enough to remember them, but there are members of his Party who remember them; and the whole ethos of Fianna Fáil was then far more egalitarian than now. It was said by Vivian Mercier about the <i>Irish Press</i>, in an article he wrote in <i>The Bell</i>, that the <i>Irish Press</i> started with high ideals and a big overdraft and the two have diminished side by side down the years. Now they have no overdraft.</P>

      <P>I am making <Col N="744" /> the point that there was a genuine aim in those days to live in what was known by the phrase &ldquo;frugal comfort&rdquo;. I remember a drawing in <i>Dublin Opinion</i> of the front of Leinster House and somebody inquiring whether the Leader of Fianna Fáil, which was then an Opposition Party, was in the House or not. The porter at the gate said: &ldquo;Yes, he is there all right; I can see his bicycle.&rdquo; This was the spirit with which Fianna Fáil in those days was identified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that in the case of Senator O'Reilly. The point I was making was that in days gone by the Party that is now the Government Party stood for a more egalitarian regime and denied the necessity to which the Minister for Finance now refers for having this enormous difference between the best off in the community and the least well off. I would contend also that the Minister is unjust to the Irish people when he says that the only way of getting the best people is to pay more money. I do not think we have gone <Col N="745" /> quite so completely over to mammon-worship as to feel that you can get the best in our society only by paying more and more and more. I would contend, furthermore, that much of public service on public boards, county councils and corporations, splendid service, is done, and for nothing, and the Minister knows that as well as I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concede that one portion of the Government case is justified. I concede that there may well be TDs in particular, perhaps less so in the case of Senators, who might suffer considerably, particularly if they had large families, by reason of having to give up so much time to the Oireachtas and actually doing so, and making a serious sacrifice by so doing, and perhaps if they lose their seats at some coming election being unable to quite get back to the way of life that they had been used to before. I recognise, therefore, that in the case of the less well off Members of Dáil and Seanad a case can be made for some increase, though I am inclined to think that the increase of £1,000 a year, a 66? per cent increase, for Dáil Members is too much and that the 50 per cent increase, £500 a year, for Senators is also too much, but I am prepared to concede that a case on these lines can be made for some Members of the Oireachtas. This being so, I contend that in these cases these persons should make that case. There are only 200 of us in both Houses, and it ought to be possible, quite easily, to sort this out and to have each case made. This would be the practical way of applying the means test, showing that there is a definite limitation of means in the granting of these increases. I believe that a scheme could be drawn up by the Minister for Finance along the lines of the slightly complicated table put forward by the Minister for Education in relation to parents of university children, a means test for application to the Members of the Oireachtas who are perhaps more hit than others by their membership of either House. This would mean that some of us, well paid in other professions, would get no increase. This would be the result of such a means test. I feel that in conceding this I am conceding the main <Col N="746" /> argument for an increase for some Members, while denying it to all without distinction as to real need or justification.</P>
    <P>I am afraid it was the Leader of the Labour Party in the Dáil who made the point that there have only been four or five increases in Oireachtas allowances since the start of the State; but, in fact, of these four or five, three have been in 1960, 1964 and now in 1968. The 1960 one introduced the principle whereby while allowances were being increased income tax was going to be paid by Members of Dáil and Seanad on these allowances, or on a large portion of them, for the first time. Therefore, the real increase in 1960 was not as great. In 1964 the allowances for Senators were raised from the £750 to which they had been raised in 1960 to £1,000. That was a rise between 1960 and 1964 of £250 which is 33? per cent. In 1968, having had this rise in 1964, we now put in for a rise of 50 per cent, a rise from £1,000 a year, which we reached in 1964, to £1,500.</P>
    <P>I find this quite unjustifiable, and I think the Minister should advert to the fact that he has proposed major percentage increases. He has proposed an increase of 50 per cent for members of this House and 66? per cent for members of the other House. How can he hold up his head and face the trade unionists who appear before the Labour Court and are told that a 10 or 11 per cent increase is absolutely impossible in the economic circumstances in which we now find ourselves, the crucial times, <i>et cetera, et cetera?</i> How can he answer trade unionists who will say: &ldquo;What is good enough for the Oireachtas goose ought to be good enough for the trade union gander&rdquo;; and if the Oireachtas members can get 50 per cent increase or 66? per cent increase what about the workers outside who suffer as much as the Oireachtas Members do from increases in the cost of living?</P>
    <P>I am aware, of course, that it can be said, as has been said to me by some of my colleagues here, that in a sense the income tax code does represent a form of means test, and this is true. It can also be said that the allowances to TDs and Senators is not <Col N="747" /> a grant like the education grant or the old age pension. It is for work done. I am afraid that some members of the public, if you say to them that this increase is for work done, tend to ask: &ldquo;Is the amount of work done really being increased all that much, is there a productivity increase?&rdquo; That was indeed the burden of the amendment that was ruled out of order, because Senator Quinlan and myself thought that a greater degree of work could usefully be done by Members of this House and the other House, were there to be a restructuring of the Committee system, but we do recognise and accept your ruling, a Chathaoirligh, that perhaps this is not the best place to put this up. Our hope had been that this increase in salary might be linked to productivity. Of course, the Minister and all his Cabinet colleagues roam the countryside talking about the necessity for linking salary and wage increases with productivity increases. The one exception is when it comes to increasing the salaries of Members of the Oireachtas. I ask the Minister why there should be no reference to this at all.</P>
    <P>I recognise that in the United Kingdom the allowance of a Member of Parliament is more than the £2,500 that is proposed under this Bill for our TDs. I think the present figure there is £3,250, that is to say, £750 more than that of our TDs. Of course, two points arise there. The first is the social services are similarly geared well below the United Kingdom level, but, even more important, our TDs represent some 20,000 electors whereas the British MP represents 80,000 on an average, so if you are talking about the amount of work done for his constituents you might expect that the number of demands from his constituents on his time would be four times as much in the case of a British MP as in the case of the Irish TD.</P>
    <P>Some Members of the Seanad may remember in 1959 when we had a previous suggestion to amend the Constitution, I put down an amendment to the effect that Members of the Dáil should represent something nearer the 35,000 mark than 20,000. This amendment <Col N="748" /> was discussed in this House but it got singularly little support. The feeling was that 20,000 was quite a good figure. This would have meant that the size of the Dáil would have been cut down to a bit over 100 instead of 144. I did not get the support of four Members of the Seanad, which would have been necessary for dividing the House on that occasion, but I got the support of two when you, Sir, I think, in the Chair asked how many Senators wanted a division, and Senator Margaret Pearse and Senator Roger McHugh rose in their places in support of this idea that perhaps our TDs should be fewer in number and represent rather more in the electorate and rather more of the population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say, a Chathaoirligh, I am quite satisfied with the measure of protection you give me, and I do not feel this kind of Ministerial remark will do him any good. I feel it is damaging to the Minister, not to me. On a point of fact, in relation to this House, it so happens the university representatives, the &ldquo;academics&rdquo; in the word of the Minister, are put here by a larger electorate than any other Senators, not excluding those of the Minister's Party. The Minister knows this quite well. He is aware that the electors for the other Senators, the panel members, are round about the 1,000 mark&mdash;let us say round about, lest he accuse me of being inaccurate if I do not give it to the last unit&mdash;whereas the university representatives are elected by an electorate of between 6,000 and 15,000 graduates. I do not think this particular point justifies the sort of sneer to which the Minister has just resorted, which will do him damage.</P>
      <P>We had a television programme the other day in which I was one of the participants and there were three TDs on it. We saw a film showing another TD being interviewed on this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> The point was made by him that all kinds of expenses were incurred by public representatives and the price of some of them was going up. He made the point, in particular, that the price of funeral offerings and wedding presents constituted a considerable proportion of his expenditure as well as going over £2 a day on petrol over and above the petrol allowance he got as a TD. Another TD on the same programme said one of the things a TD has to do is to stand drinks to constituents, and that the price of drink has been going up. All of this is true, no doubt, but nevertheless I have a feeling that if a trade union representative appeared before the Labour Court pleading on behalf of a body of workers and said that a large proportion of the reason for the demand for increased wages was the price of funeral offerings, drinks and petrol, he would get short shrift from the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>Another speaker on this programme, who spoke for the general public, made the point that he noted in the Dáil that very often there was a certain fractiousness about the debate, and he saw the other day that everything was courtesy. He looked to see what debate was this in which everybody was so nice to everybody else, and he found it was a debate in which everybody was agreed to increase their own salaries. I feel this was a very telling point to bring home and everybody who read the debates recently would find it had a large measure of validity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government never suggested that the price of funeral offerings, drink and petrol prices had any bearing on this. I am sure Senator Sheehy Skeffington knows this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think any Party can be responsible for the views of individual Deputies and I do not think Senator Sheehy Skeffington would suggest that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I prefer to concede Senator O'Kennedy's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="752" /> The Government have not made this point. That is true. The Minister did mention the general expenses. I forget the exact phrase he used. Let me see: he said&mdash;and I am quoting him now because I know he has a great desire for accuracy&mdash;that more secretarial assistance has to be employed in many cases and &ldquo;I do not have to remind Senators that there are constant appeals for all sorts of desirable causes that have to be met, charities to be supported and subscriptions of all sorts to be made&rdquo;. I grant that Senator O'Kennedy is right that the Government did not make the extreme example of this type of appeal, but it was made on television by a TD, and the reference to the cost of drink and so on was made by a Fianna Fáil TD. If this kind of appeal were made on behalf of workers before the Labour Court it would receive short shrift.</P>
    <P>The picture that sometimes emerges, not only from the film to which I have referred, but also from debates and in Government statements, of the sort of work that TDs are doing, seems to make him into a kind of &ldquo;fixer&rdquo;, a man who uses influence for his constituents. We are told this again and again in relation to the necessity for the abolition of PR, how much better it would be if a TD were in a small constituency, and so on. He could get around much easier, we have been told, and fix things up properly for as many of his constituents as he could. I resent this picture of a TD or a Senator as a kind of fixer. I would hope that responsible members of both Houses, and I would like to think them as being a majority, would be prepared to use their influence only for a case where injustice has been done and not merely because an applicant is a constituent.</P>
    <P>I would argue that the system, perhaps an amplified system, of the ombudsman should be introduced here for the purpose of dealing with legitimate grievances, and in order to take this type of burden off the backs of TDs. It is not the job of a Member of Parliament to be running around trying to fix things up for constituents. I do not know what the Minister thinks. He may agree.</P>

      <P>This can be said in relation to one kind of &ldquo;active&rdquo; TD. The measurement of working days on that kind of activity seems to me to debase parliament rather than do it honour.</P>
      <P>My criticism, therefore, is that the increase ought to be an overall increase for everybody. I notice, for instance, that the leader of the main Opposition Party is to get £10,000 a year for expenses. I have great respect for the present occupant of that post, and I am quite certain that this is spent on expenses, but the amount seems to me to be very big indeed, even allowing for all secretarial and Party work involved for the chief leader of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, consequently, it is my intention to put down not amendments but recommendations, that is assuming that we reach the Committee Stage, because it is possible, of course, that the Minister's eloquence has convinced the House that we should not give this Bill a Second Reading. If we do reach the Committee Stage it is my intention to put down recommendations for the purpose of reducing the amounts. I am precluded from putting a recommendation down for the purpose of creating a means test. I can only do that under the present amendment, but it is my intention on Committee Stage, if any, to put down recommendations and reduce the amount involved, that is if I can find a seconder.</P>

    <P>My colleague, Senator Stanford, on a previous occasion said in relation to the increases that if they were forced upon him, he would give them away to charity, and I respect him very much for that. I am making no such claim. I am prepared to accept them, if they are thrust upon me. Senator Murphy <Col N="754" /> would like to know why. It would be open to me to give this to charity if the increases are thrust upon me, or it would be open to me to return it to the Minister for Finance. However, I must say he is the last person I would return it to.</P>

I say that because I do not like the way in which he spends public money. I do not like the way in which he drags his feet in relation to urgent matters and quickens his pace in relation to matters that are not urgent. If it is thrust upon me, it is my intention to spend it for the upkeep and repair of my favourite independent socialist, and in advancing the socialist principles which eventually will come into application in this country.</P>
      <P>I am appealing finally to Members of this House to pass this amendment, to reject this Bill altogether and send it back to the Dáil. It has been said by an American that when people say, as some Members of the Oireachtas have been saying in relation to these increases, that &ldquo;it is not the money it is the principle&rdquo;, the American said when somebody said that it is not the money, it is the principle, &ldquo;it is the money&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask Members of this House whether they feel they can without embarrassment cheerfully vote these large sums, giving increases of 50 per cent to Senators and 66? per cent to TDs. I should like to hope that on a division the House will divide in my favour. I should like to think in this case that the Whips would not be put on and that every Senator would be allowed to vote in accordance with his own conscience. I do not think that this is a Party matter. Fine Gael would not collapse if they were to vote against it. The Labour Party would not go out of being if their representatives here were to vote against this <Col N="755" /> increase. I do not believe the Government Party would go out of power if the Senators in the Government Party here were to vote against these increases. Therefore, it is with a measure of confidence that I ask you when the time comes for a division, if I get, first of all, sufficient support to enable the House to have a division, and then sufficient support from every Senator acting in accordance with his own conscience, to refuse a Second Reading to this Bill.</P>

      <P>I believe, mind you, that if Members of the Dáil and Seanad spent more time, if they were in a position to do so, considering the problems of the country and the real things about which legislators should be concerned, we would go a good deal further towards narrowing differentials. When one considers the various measures brought in here and how little constructive thinking is done by Members of the Oireachtas, one sees that not as much is being done to achieve the utopia Senator Sheehy Skeffington dreams about as could be done&mdash;and a large part of that is attributable to the fact that Deputies and Senators are concerned with the trivia of their jobs and to a large extent very few of them can spend as much time as they would wish at the work they might otherwise be doing because all of them have got to earn a living. However, I will come back to that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> I suggest that Senator Sheehy Skeffington has done some service here this morning. He reminds me of the monsignor of the Roman Rota doing the <i>advocatus diaboli.</i> It is a good thing that he has directed his objections to this Bill so that their validity can be tested and that it will be seen as far as the public are concerned that there are people who like to question these things. I have some observations to make which will indicate that I do not accept entirely salary increases brought about in this way or of this order.</P>
    <P>I must say I dislike this Bill. I dislike the idea of putting my hand into the pocket of somebody else to remunerate myself. I do not say I do not earn the increase or that anybody else will say I do not earn it, but I dislike this system, and when we were increasing the pensions of former Members of the Oireachtas and their widows I said there ought to be a system whereby somebody outside the Oireachtas would make a recommendation to the Government and the Oireachtas as to what the rate should be. I believe that is still correct.</P>
    <P>I do not like the idea of saying I am worth so much and I have never been a good judge or advocate in my own cause. During a period of my life I worked for better conditions for civil servants, ranging from prison officers to higher executive officers and I was a good advocate on their behalf. I remember on one occasion I had to claim some money from the Revenue Commissioners in respect of conditions of service attaching to my position but I found I could not advocate on my own behalf. It was repugnant to my nature, though clearly I was entitled to it&mdash;it was something that was my due. There are other people who are brassy about that but I do not like the idea of saying that we as Members of the Oireachtas should say: &ldquo;This is what we should be paid&rdquo;, or that the Government should say: &ldquo;This is what we as Ministers should be paid&rdquo;, or that the Taoiseach should say: &ldquo;This is what I should be paid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would be far healthier if some outside body were to make recommendations to the Government, like many <Col N="758" /> other recommendations are made to the Government, with the pros and cons argued and a decision given one way or the other. I have very little doubt that in such a system the salaries would be something of the order that is proposed here because it is an absurdity to say that the Secretary of the Department of Finance at the present time receives a salary of £5,200 a year and that the Minister for Finance, his superior, receives a salary of £3,700 a year. That is absurd. If the Minister is the man in charge of his Department he is entitled to a higher salary than the Secretary of his Department.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance or any Minister devotes his whole time to the work of Government. It is not a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. job. I do not say that the Secretary of the Department of Finance is engaged merely from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. but there are some limits to the time higher civil servants have to work. On the other hand, Ministers do in fact, and most Deputies do, work a 12-hour or a 14-hour day every day of the week, Monday to Sunday.</P>
      <P>If the Senator does not accept that, then he has no knowledge of the work done by Deputies, Senators, and Ministers. We all know the kind of duties cast upon members of the Oireachtas and we all know the inevitability of having to work a 12-and 14-hour day. We have seen in recent days the evidence of the toll that kind of work takes on the lives of Members of the Oireachtas. The death rate out of 200 people is probably much higher than average. If Senator Sheehy Skeffington or anybody else faces up to these facts, it cannot but be clear to them that Members of Parliament and Ministers of State are not being paid over-generously.</P>

    <P>I did not hear from Senator Sheehy Skeffington the suggestion that to achieve the egalitarian society about which he dreams the salaries of secretaries of Departments, assistant secretaries, principal officers, higher execuand semi-State bodies should be reduced. <Col N="759" /> Why should they get their salaries, the salaries they get, for a 40-hour week and Members of the Government or the Oireachtas not be entitled to increases of some sort?</P>

      <P>The Senator again displays an ignorance of the affairs of this country. When we enact pieces of legislation from time to time giving the Ministers power to make regulations by order, when we say that the Minister may decide or that the Minister in his discretion may do so and so, we pass that on to the Minister but the real power is exercised by the public servants. There is a great thrill, when you are a civil servant sitting in your office, in being able to decide: &ldquo;This is what it is, this is what is to be done.&rdquo; That is where the real power lies. It is limited perhaps, but so is the power of Ministers limited, the power of Parliament is limited by the Constitution, but the real power is exercised by the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>When I was collecting revenue on behalf of the State and when we could not get people to send in their accounts and pay their duty, there used to be a lot of correspondence with the solicitors of these people but after all this the time came to take sterner methods and you wrote direct to the people, leaving out the solicitors, directing them to deliver their accounts or otherwise legal proceedings would be instituted against them which might lead to their attachment and imprisonment. Then they would hop. This is power of a small kind but real power it is. There is real power to be exercised by the Civil Service and there is a great thrill for the good civil servant in seeing the scheme which he propounds being accepted by Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ought, in the words of the Minister, attempt to attract to Parliament the best material that can be got for both Dáil and Seanad; we should ensure <Col N="760" /> that the best talent amongst those who feel drawn to public life should not be turned away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so. There is a new science growing up for selecting people for different posts but politicians have not yet acquired this new science and, perhaps, we in Fine Gael have not got that far. However, as far as my Party is concerned we are entirely happy with the material we have. I want to make this criticism and even the Minister must accept it and agree that it is justified. There is one stage and one instance in which the selection of the best material can be put to the test. Under the Constitution the Taoiseach had the opportunity of selecting eleven people to be members of the Seanad after all the elections are over. These are people who may have gone for election to the Dáil and may not have succeeded. Some have been candidates for the Seanad and have been rejected by the confined electorate. Senator Sheehy Skeffington shares that distinction with myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These things happen but at the end of the day when the elections are over the Taoiseach can sit down and consult with his Party, with his Ministers and with civil servants who are able to advise him, and select eleven people to be Senators. To my mind it is entirely wrong, unjust to the Seanad, and unfair to the public to select as a Senator a person whom it is known will not be able to attend the deliberations of the Seanad. There may be good reasons why such a person should <Col N="761" /> be supported out of public funds but to nominate such a person as a member of the Seanad is quite wrong. In such cases, where it is desired to honour a person, there are methods by which it can be done other than by selecting such people as members of the Taoiseach's eleven nominees.</P>
    <P>Anybody who looks at the eleven nominees selected by the Taoiseach over the last number of years cannot say in honesty that these are eleven of the best people in the country or that they are the kind of people who, if they went for election, and were not elected, should be appointed to the Seanad. We know that the dominant reason behind the selection of the Taoiseach's eleven is the interest of his political Party. I do not think it is correct to say, and it weakens the case of the Minister to say, that these selected by the Taoiseach are the best that can be found, because the power has been there and the power has not been exercised to select all of the eleven people who are the best talents and who are the best material for the Taoiseach's eleven. I think that it is highly regrettable that that splendid device which was contained in the Constitution was not used in a way that would benefit the public interest.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it is also correct to say that people having been appointed as Taoiseach's nominees or elected to the Seanad, and Deputies having been elected to the Dáil, find themselves then with a particular job of work to do, and I have very little hesitation in saying, knowing the work which Deputies have to do, that by any standard that one might like to choose Deputies up to the present time have not been over-remunerated and certainly will not be overpaid by the time that this Bill is law. The amount of time involved and the patience which Deputies have to show, the calls upon them to which they readily respond, are such in my view as to warrant any salary that could in reason be given to them, and £2,500 for the active Deputy and for the time he spends and the particular service he renders to the community in which he lives is not too much.</P>
    <P>To a lesser extent there are certain <Col N="762" /> kinds of Senators who do work broadly analogous to the work of Deputies, and for them, again, the salary which they at present receive and which they will get under the new Bill can hardly be said to be too much. I think that Senator Sheehy Skeffington is correct when he refers to the fact that a great amount of the time of Members of Parliament is taken up with things which properly ought not to be the concern of Members of the Oireachtas if public affairs were properly ordered. As the Minister says, a great deal of affairs have now come within the ambit of the State. Unfortunately, a climate has developed in this country where people feel that unless they have as a crutch a Deputy, a Senator or a county councillor they will not get what they are entitled to. In my own experience I have had people asking me to find out various things which a letter to the appropriate public body or semi-State Body could have ascertained for them quite easily, but the climate has developed that unless a Deputy or a Senator or a county councillor or a member of a corporation makes the inquiry on their behalf or clears the ground for them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

One would imagine that one would get a straightforward answer, yes or no, or that they would <Col N="763" /> ask for more information, but not at all. They sent me out a form to be filled up, and I am put down as an employer, and all the questions are designed for somebody who is in quite a different category as it turns out. All I want to know is the answer to the question, a straightforward question which I set out clearly in a typed letter so that they could not have any excuse about not reading my writing. The matter has been going on from there, with interviews, calls and so on, and I still cannot get from the Department of Social Welfare a simple answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; or &ldquo;we cannot tell you&rdquo;. That is the situation with somebody who presents a simple question to a Government Department and cannot get an answer from them.</P>

      <P>I can, and I can give you a copy of all the documents. I do not want to get anybody into trouble either, and that is very oftentimes our attitude too. Oftentimes people fill up a form and one comes across the case where because they have not filled it up completely or have left something vague they are told: &ldquo;You are not entitled to the grant&rdquo; or &ldquo;You cannot get the licence&rdquo;, whereas if somebody says that the answer to question 9 (a) is so and so, then they will say: &ldquo;You are qualified for a grant but on the basis of the information we had before we could not give it to you&rdquo;. I have seen forms presented to small shopkeepers to answer in relation to their turnover and with all my not inconsiderable experience as a lawyer I could not answer some of the questions. I could not know what they wanted, and this form was issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce. I did not know, and I told the people concerned: &ldquo;You <Col N="764" /> will have to write in and ask them if it means this, this, this or this&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>All of that is entirely relevant to what I am saying about the work of TDs, Senators and county councillors. The civil servants in the Minister's own Department are conscious of this, because when I was associated with the Civil Service Staff Association ten or 12 years ago they were trying to clarify the forms and introduce similar methods of expression in the public service and things of that kind. I have, unfortunately, lost touch with what is going on in the Civil Service in detail nowadays, but I am quite satisfied that the Minister's Department could go quite a distance towards enabling members of the public to understand what the Department wants and what information they should supply. The Minister for Finance will render great service to the public and to the public service if a new system can be devised whereby information between public departments, public bodies and the members of the public is improved. I said on the Appropriation Bill last year or the year before that what should be done by the Government is that every Department should appoint a number of public relations officers, not merely to give information to members of the press and organs of mass media when they look for it but to be able to deal with all these kinds of inquiries from people and go out and see them, and that there should be a number of higher officers who know the whole work of their Department who would go to markets in the various towns and fairs and gatherings of that kind where they would be available when somebody wants to know how to apply for a reconstruction grant or if he is entitled to something from the Department of Social Welfare or how to go about getting a telephone more quickly than he has been promised, and things of that kind, if he is entitled to priority because he belongs to a particular way of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems to me to be a service which the public service should provide and if that were done a great deal bof the time of Deputies, Senators and county councillors would not have to be <Col N="765" /> spent on these matters. I think that can be done. It will take some time to do it and I have no doubt that there will be opposition from some Deputies and Senators to anything of that kind because they think that they will lose contact with the public and that they will cease to confer the kind of favours on members of the public they now confer when they have to do these kind of things.</P>
    <P>I believe that the salaries that are being paid are probably correct or of a proper order in magnitude. I should like, however, to refer to one matter which to my mind is something of an injustice to persons who formerly held the office of Minister. Perhaps the Minister would be kind enough when replying to the debate to clarify a matter on which I am not clear. In the Oireachtas Allowances Act of 1960 in section 15 it says:</P>
    <P>A Ministerial pension shall be at the following rates, that is to say: so long as the pensionable service of the person entitled thereto is three years, £300 per annum.</P>
    <P>The corresponding provision as I read it in section 10 of this Bill seems to change the three years to four years. It says:</P>
    <P>A Ministerial pension shall be at the following rates, that is to say:</P>
    <P>so long as the pensionable service of the person entitled thereto is less than four years, twenty-five per cent of the annual sum payable for the time being by way of salary to a member of the Government other than the Taoiseach or (if the person held the Office of Taoiseach on the last day on which he held qualifying office) to the Taoiseach,</P>
    <P>I wonder if I am right in saying that this means that the minimum period which a Minister must serve is now four years instead of three?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have hoped the Minister when he was dealing with this particular section at all would have adopted in relation to the pensions of Ministers the kind of provision that one finds in a variety of pension <Col N="766" /> and superannuation schemes. There are cases and there will be cases where Ministers, because an election has to be called at a particular time, will have less than the full three years. If it happens that a Minister has two years and 364 days he cannot get any pension. Mind you in a period of three years if a person abandons his business or profession completely to devote himself to the work of a Minister of State he can lose a considerable amount and he can find himself way down in the queue when he returns to his particular occupation or profession. Three years is a substantial leeway to make up in either a profession or business particularly in cases where a person has to render personal service. I feel that if a person has two years and 264 days service it is unfair to draw the line and say: &ldquo;No, you do not get any pension&rdquo;. I believe that there should be a system of rounding up to the nearest year. What I would propose is that where a person has, say, two and a half or perhaps 2¾ years, that could be worked out in days because you cannot divide 365 by four accurately, that that should be rounded up to the nearest year and that should apply certainly at the minimum where it is a question of a person getting no pension or some pension. I think it should be done in favour of the person down at the bottom. I think it is correct to say that in the Order we had here recently with the Minister in relation to the allowances for members of the Oireachtas a half year is rounded up to a full year in the case of members of the Oireachtas. I feel that we would not be doing anything which even the imagined outraged public of Senator Sheehy Skeffington's imagination would regard as being over generous or unfair to the taxpayer. I would ask the Minister to have a look at that and to consider whether it would not be consistent with existing practice in relation to superannuation schemes to do this. I think it is correct to say that under the 1960 Act the pension position for people with long service was improved but there was no corresponding improvement for the people who were down at the bottom. I feel there is a good case for improving their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> The allowance of the Leader of the Opposition is being increased from £3,360 to £10,000 and may I say that while that is an increase which I welcome I make bold to say and without apology and I am quite prepared to defend it on any platform that the allowance to the leaders of the Opposition Parties should be not £10,000 but £20,000 or £30,000 or £40,000 per annum and there would be an even greater justification for the much larger increases if more and more time of Deputies and Senators was devoted to the real work of Parliament and the real business of members of the Oireachtas. As the matter stands at the moment nobody can make an effective contribution to any public debate nowadays without having carried out adequate research and done adequate reading on the particular subject on which he is engaged. Members of Parliament have so many duties and have to turn from so many different types of problems that to make a really effective contribution to measures which come before Parliament and to measures which should come before Parliament and which do not they must have research facilities. They must have people who will be able to advise them on technical matters and they must have people who will be able to discuss different problems, people who will not always be available from pure public spirit and who on occasions will have to be remunerated for doing research and doing work in specialised fields.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Government have increased the allowances to the leaders of the Opposition but I have very little doubt that in order to get adequate secretarial assistance and technical staff, that would to some extent be the counterpart of the expert advisors that the different Ministers of the Government have, a much higher figure than £10,000 is necessary. There are about 12 Departments of State. The Minister in each Department has many technical advisors. Sometimes when he wants expert advice which is not available in the Department he can go outside the Department and get experts from abroad. That has happened. It continues to happen, and rightly so. Very <Col N="768" /> often, too, and this point has been put to me by Deputies, and I am aware of it myself, when a Minister is making an assessment of a particular situation or when he makes a particular proposal in order to evaluate that, it is necessary for the Opposition, if they are to be a really constructive and effective Opposition, to take counsel with other experts because there are many occasions on which there are two views.</P>
    <P>It is not possible for an Opposition to work as effectively as it ought to at the present time, except with the voluntary support of outside experts. While it is correct to say, as far as my own Party is concerned, we are able to command increasing numbers in voluntary experts from various fields, industrial, social welfare, education and so on, there must always be some person in the office who will prepare the draft documents on which there can be discussions and that person must be a person of a high degree of competence.</P>
    <P>There are many things which Govern ment Departments and Governmen Ministers cannot get round to doing for one reason or another which Member of the Opposition could well do and would do if they had experts available to them. I believe that any money given to the Opposition Parties for their work is money well spent. Mind you, I would go the further distance&mdash; I do not know whether all members of my Party agree with me&mdash;and say that if the allowance was what I believe it should be, trebled or quadrupled, I would have no hesitation in saying that it should be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. I would have no hesitation in saying to him that he could look at the allowances given to the Leader of the Party to see how that money was spent. I do not believe it would interfere with the autonomy of Opposition Parties if that were done, but in order to have a really effective Opposition, so that they can make the greatest contribution to the work of Parliament, a much higher allowance than is provided for in this Bill should be afforded. As I say I would go the whole distance of having it subjected <Col N="769" /> to audit if the Minister for Finance thought it was necessary.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the allowances, I would like to say this. The Seanad, as a second house of Parliament, from time to time comes in for criticism, some of it ignorant and ill-informed and some of it which is informed and not without some justification and merit. I believe the Seanad, as the Second House continues to perform a very useful function in the matter of legislation, and I believe that that function and the manner in which those duties are discharged by the Seanad are recognised by anybody who takes the trouble to find out what in fact goes on in the Seanad. It is true, of course, that we do not get anything like the degree of publicity from the press which the Dáil does.</P>

      <P>The extraordinary statement always catches the headlines but I do not fault the press for that because the Dáil is the first House of Parliament and the Seanad is the second. When the Dáil is sitting, there is a limited amount of space to be devoted to political goings-on and inevitably what is of secondary importance is pushed out by that which is of primary importance. That is regrettable because the Seanad does not then appear to the public to be doing the kind of things in fact it is doing in its own way. It is true to say that those who examine the record of the Seanad and those who participate in its work appreciate that the Seanad makes its contribution to public affairs, but I would wish, speaking from here, that those of the Seanad who do not make a contribution as often as they ought to would for the future make the contribution I am quite sure they could make. It is refreshing on occasions to find that the views which are expressed on this side of the House are shared in other quarters and when that happens, and I have seen it happen on <Col N="770" /> occasions, I believe the eventual product is much improved.</P>
      <P>I hope that for the future there will be in that regard at any rate a higher degree of productivity from the Seanad as a whole than there has been up to the present time. Finally, may I say this? The effectiveness of the Seanad as a House of Parliament would be greatly enhanced if some Ministers of the Government were to pay a little more deference to the views of the Seanad. It is quite clear, if one examines the record again, no matter how justifiable a particular view is and how well authenticated and documented it may be, there are some Ministers who on principle will accept no amendment from the Seanad.</P>

      <P>That is entirely regrettable. It frustrates the Seanad and brings it into contempt in the public mind. It makes its continuing existence, which I believe to be not absolutely vital, but certainly in the interests of the public, somewhat more difficult to justify. I hope, now that the Seanad are to be remunerated at the rate of £1,500 a year, which I think is a handsome remuneration, that this Government during the currency of their present term of office will make the utmost use they can of the Seanad and that it will be seen by the public, in its reaction to what goes on here, the contributions which I hope will be made from both sides of the House, to be of some value. I want to say, quite clearly, that I support this measure, and I hope that what is said by the Minister and the members here, as well as Senator Sheehy Skeffington and others like him, will help to justify those increases before the public, if indeed that is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker towards the end of his address referred to productivity. I am afraid the level of productivity in this House is not very high this morning. I want to say briefly, on behalf of Labour Party Senators, that we support this Bill. Let me confess, however, that it is hard to be objective on a matter which affects your own pocket. I have had <Col N="771" /> that experience in trade union work. You act on behalf of people; you try to summarise and put forward the views they have expressed; and when you try to put forward views which affect yourself personally, you find you are not probably as well able to do it.</P>
      <P>We support this Bill, I suppose, for two reasons. First of all, we are committed to support of the measure, and I think it might be no harm to underline the fact that adjustments in the allowances made to Members of the Oireachtas are few and far between. This may be difficult for the public to understand if they look at it as simply being a matter of Members of Parliament having the right to vote themselves increases. We all know, those of us who have been in politics for some years, that that is not just the situation. No Government can bring forward a Bill to adjust the allowances of TDs, Senators and Ministers unless they are satisfied that the other Parties will not make political capital out of it. These are the facts of life. This is the reason why adjustments in the allowances have been so few and far between. We, therefore, as the Labour Party, are committed to support this Bill because we are in the Labour Party and I am sure the same has been the position in other Parties who have been dissatisfied for a long time with the level of allowances paid, particularly to Deputies.</P>
      <P>I think I stated previously in this House that three Members of my union have been Members of the Dáil. The three of them are dead now. I expressed the personal view that if they had not gone forward in public life, their families would certainly have been much better off. I in my own union have had to advise people who have been anxious to go forward for election to be a bit cautious and look at their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Seanad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I will explain to the House and to Senator McQuillan that if the people who are in semi-State employment are elected to Dáil Éireann, they have to leave their jobs for the duration of their membership of the Dáil. I think most of us know <Col N="772" /> that in the public sector generally the maximum salary in the recruitment grade, in the ordinary routine repetitive clerical post, is £1,228 and people who are capable of being elected to the Dáil are certainly people who can get promotion beyond that grade.</P>
      <P>The situation is such that if such people were elected to the Dáil up to the present time, they would inevitably be worse off financially than if they stayed in their five day a week, 9 to 5 job, having much more time to spend with their wives and families. They would have much more privacy and much more time to look after their own affairs. I have been disturbed for a long time by people like those who are anxious to take their part in a democracy such as we have, who are anxious to stand for election to Parliament, thinking that if they were elected, their wives and families would not suffer simply by reason of the time they would have to spend in public life&mdash;and this applies particularly to Deputies&mdash;but also financially. That is the second reason why I particularly welcome the proposal to increase allowances for Deputies.</P>
      <P>I referred to the £1,228 as paid to the recruitment grade in the civil service, in the public sector generally, but the House knows&mdash;Members have been supplied with the Directory of State services&mdash;the salaries paid in the Civil Service. I remember&mdash;I do not know whether it was on the Finance Bill towards the end of last year&mdash;and I am sure Senator Sheehy Skeffington will agree with me, when the bar which existed for those at £1,200 was withdrawn. We pressed the Minister that the Civil Service generally should participate in the tenth round. They have since got the tenth round. We are talking about the third round since the lifting of the standstill order on the allowances for Members of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley referred to the salaries of secretaries of Departments and the allowances paid to secretaries to Ministers. I make the point that principal officers in the Civil Service get £3,097 and assistant principals, £2,087 and which of us in all conscience would say that a Deputy who does his job is not worth as much as <Col N="773" /> an assistant principal in the Civil Service. An assistant principal is largely in a five-day week job, with a great deal of permanency, as against a Deputy with a seven-day a week job of not much permanency.</P>
    <P>These are the facts of life. I have a lot of sympathy with the view that the whole situation is wrong where in the same economy, we are paying salaries at that level and at the same time, some manual workers are only earning £10 and £11 per week. That is a bad situation but it is the way it is ordered in the economy at the moment and what we are now doing is trying to adjust the level of allowances of Members of Parliament in the light of the existing situation.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the allowances proposed for Deputies. I have not made any reference so far to the proposed adjustments in the allowances for Senators. I remember in this House previously making the point that I thought the relativity between the allowances paid to Deputies and Senators was wrong, that a Deputy had an allowance of 50 per cent more than the allowance for a Senator. I expressed the view that a much higher differential was justified in the case of a Deputy. This situation is being corrected in this Bill, and a Deputy will now have two-thirds more than a Senator. While waiting to speak, I tried to examine my conscience, wondering whether I would have been more pleased to be on my feet again complaining about this relativity or acknowledging that some correction has been made. Perhaps I would be a little happier in the first instance.</P>
    <P>However, these are the proposals in the Bill, and as I have said, we in Labour support them for two reasons. Firstly, we are committed to do so in order to have something done with the allowances, and secondly, because of our insistence that the allowances paid to Deputies were not such as to permit people who had any sort of reasonable jobs to offer themselves for election, and we in Labour have been particularly hit by that situation.</P>
    <P>My union, which is affiliated to the Labour Party has a majority of members who would also be active supporters of the Labour Party who, <Col N="774" /> if they offered themselves for election to the Dáil would be going forward as Labour candidates. They are in a different position from that of people, for example, who own businesses or farms. This is certainly a terrible situation and the allowances should be at a level to allow those people and many other workers to go forward for election who would otherwise be prevented from so doing because of the financial difficulties that would result in going forward for election to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I referred at the beginning to the question of productivity. I support the viewpoint, and I have put it forward here previously, that a lot more effective use could be made of the time of Deputies and Senators by more Committee work. The Minister, in reply to the debate in the Dáil, expressed the opinion that the Dáil functions very well in Committee. I do not think it gives a good impression to the public who see a situation in which a Minister and his advisers, with two or three people from other Parties, discuss a measure in Committee in a Chamber like the Dáil. We who have some experience of the Dáil know they are doing very useful work and that the other Deputies are about their business as well, but much of that work could be done in what we know as Committee Rooms. That is the position in other Parliaments.</P>
    <P>This would allow Deputies and Senators to get on with other work in proper Committees of both Houses of the Oireachtas. That is why I have a certain amount of sympathy with the view expressed in the first amendment in the names of Senators McQuillan and Sheehy Skeffington, which has been ruled out of order. On the other hand, I cannot support the amendment we are now discussing because of what I have already said about being committed to the Bill.</P>
    <P>This is not any halfhearted commitment. It is a full 100 per cent commitment to the Bill. We in Labour certainly do not support the principle of a means test. It may be true that there is a great deal of justification for paying certain people, who have been referred to £2,500 a year, but we would be dead against the principle of a means test under which the financial <Col N="775" /> circumstances of Members of the Oireachtas would be investigated, to see whether one Deputy should get £X and another Deputy £X plus, and still another Deputy £X minus. That would be a wrong situation and we oppose it.</P>

      <P>It is rather difficult for all of us here to express support for this Bill because we might appear to the public to be supporting our own interests. For that reason, what we must here attempt to do is give some indication of the problems which people in public life face at all levels. We must attempt in so far as we can to mend our ways and make good any deficiency there may be in our activities in these Houses. The one principle we should work on is that, whatever uninformed public opinion may be, it is no excuse whatsoever for anybody in either House of the Oireachtas to downgrade the activity of public life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>What we really <Col N="776" /> should try to put across is the importance of the work we are about and thereby indicate that we are adequate for the work which we face. Let us not here claim on the part of Members of either House or of the Government that we, personally, think we are not being paid enough. It is more than that. It is a clear statement of the fact that the type of work we are asked to do, whether we are capable of doing it or not, warrants more than has hitherto been available or been paid.</P>
      <P>For that reason we must consider particularly the position Senator Murphy has outlined of a person who has to make a decision&mdash;this must happen more often than we are aware of&mdash;as to whether he will go into public life. On numerous occasions recently I have heard the views of young people who have active political interests, not always exclusively on the Fianna Fáil side, who have formed the impression that before they can undertake political activity, their first duty and obligation is to make their homes secure, to provide financial security for their homes. Having done so, their view is they can afford the luxury of active political life. This surely is a negation of what all of us hope to do in our work here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the combination of the impatient young men and the experienced older men that gives our proceedings here and in the other House the importance which they have. If young people, people about to get married or who have recently been married, feel that this is something which they cannot impose on their families, the result will be that by the time these same men become involved in politics the fire of their indignation will have been quenched for the lack of fuel. I would suggest to Senator Sheehy Skeffington and to many outside who may doubt the sincerity of this proposal that young people are becoming more eager and more anxious to participate in political life but that they cannot undertake this when they clearly see that it is going to leave them and their families at a substantial net loss. I wish we could be unanimous in this and thereby indicate to the public that we are not trying to line our own pockets and feather our own nests but that we <Col N="777" /> are trying to encourage the fuller participation in public life of those who wish to participate.</P>
    <P>Probably all Parties need an injection of impatience and indignation to a certain extent, an injection which only the young can give. It is the combination of these qualities that make political activity but, from my own experience of the Fianna Fáil Party, I have no experience of the Fine Gael or Labour Parties, despite the views of many outside who think that the Fianna Fáil Party is a large monolith, I know that these young people who put forward their views, sometimes unreasonable views, contribute quite a lot to the formation of government policy in one fashion or another. I am not suggesting that they are a big factor but it is important to realise that the part is being played, that the part is to be played even more, and that participation should always be made available to those who would play it.</P>
    <P>We in this House and the Members of the Dáil can best prove our case by our activities here and outside the House. I have no standards by which I can judge our activities here, this being only my first term here and so I cannot judge the activity of other Houses that have gone before, but it is fair to say that by and large the House does approach its work seriously and I am sure that the Dáil does the same thing. If anybody has any doubts about our position in this they can solve those doubts by devoting more time, energy and study to the business which comes before us from time to time.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington and the other university Senators can be quite cynical of the other function of the parliamentary representaive, that function of being a direct adviser or assistant to the community at large whether in a constituency or otherwise. I should like to remind the university representatives here that they represent a group of university graduates who, of their very nature, are more financially secure than the general body of the community, a group of graduates who are in general more enlightened and more determined about their needs than the general body and a group <Col N="778" /> which does not put anything like the same pressure on their university representatives as the community in various parts of the country and in this city put on their parliamentary representatives.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the university representatives and Senators should get less but, in fairness to them, I would say the time they spare from the pressure of personal communication with their electorate, they devote more fully to the business of the House. But let them not be cynical of something they know nothing about.</P>

      <P>That is a matter for another argument at another time. I should not presume to discuss the most important aspects of ministerial responsibility and work in comparison with work outside. This is so evident that I am surprised that this readjustment did not take place long ago. What we all hope to achieve is to establish the status of the work of the Member of either House as being that of almost full-time work, that it will be recognised that when Members of these Houses are present in these Houses they will be given full time to the <Col N="779" /> business. I feel sure that the weakness which the main Opposition has shown in recent times is because of the fact that this full-time attention is not being given to the business of the House. I yield to no one in my respect for members of the Opposition and I know that some of them have suffered, that some prominent members of former Opposition Governments have suffered financially by virtue of their political activities.</P>
      <P>I do say that at present the problem just now is the conviction that many of them cannot afford to divorce themselves sufficiently from their other professional activities, which they may share with myself, because of the fact that thereby their contributions in the Oireachtas would not be what it should be. No blame to them for this, because they are faced with the problems I have already outlined, but I think that this adjustment should, in fact, help them to readjust their activities, and if it does so both for them and for every Member of both Houses it will certainly have justified itself. Accordingly, I would with some degree of confidence having listened to Senator Sheehy Skeffington's degree of confidence, ask the Senator in the interests of all of us, of the community and of those who would play an active part in politics, to withdraw his motion here this morning.</P>

I make no apology to anyone for paying what indeed is only a right and proper tribute to Senator O'Kennedy and to his work in this House and indeed also to his opposite number, Senator Garret FitzGerald, another new member who has contributed greatly to this House. Indeed the high point of the House in the present session has been the work of those two freshmen Senators. We hope that in the next Government we will be able to welcome at least one of them back as a Minister.</P>

      <P>Speaking on the present bill it is not very popular, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington and I and others here have said many times, to have to voice what has often been rather a lone opinion, an independent opinion. We feel that that is the chief contribution we can make here, to give our views as we see them as academics. We do not for one moment hold that those views should be held by everyone, but it is our duty as academics to put them forward and to debate them in Committee. We are doing that out of concern for our country and for the part that Parliament must play in a democracy. Also we are concerned with the very grave unrest that hangs all over Europe. We see what appeared to be stable democracies like France and Italy tottering.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with Parliamentary performance in this country. You do not pluck up real courage by whistling passing a graveyard, yet that is what many of our leaders appear to be doing. There is nothing more depressing and more debasing than to bring visitors to see the Dáil in action and see maybe eight or ten live Deputies sitting there. You may make the case that the others are engaged in useful work elsewhere, but visitors do <Col N="781" /> not understand that and they go away both disillusioned and cynical. In other words the system that permits that to happen is wrong and is out of date, and therefore my conviction is that we have now to look at things fairly and squarely, plan for the future and see what reforms are required. One of the reforms is, of course, in salary structures, which has now been brought in, but I think it is much more appropriate to reform our mode of service to the community before we reform our salaries. I would have hoped that at a time when the Government have been contemplating very big changes like joining the EEC with all the resulting changes that would entail, it would be absolutely vital that our institutions should be critically examined. At the apex of those institutions is our Parliamentary system. I would ask the Minister to attempt as soon as possible to take a look at this really seriously.</P>
      <P>We are in an age of mass communications. Our parliamentary procedures are being brought before the public, and yet we still continue in 19th century procedures and those are now being presented to a 20th century public. We have got to modernise and to improve our image. I endorse very strongly the Minister's statement here when he says &ldquo;There is therefore I believe a solemn obligation on the Oireachtas to see to it that the right people are attracted to its service now and in the future&rdquo;. It is in the context of attracting these people, the Senator O'Kennedys and Senator Garret FitzGeralds of the future, that we want to examine the present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Right at the start let me say that on many occasions in this House every time I have had an opportunity I pointed out the ludicrous situation in which Ministers were paid less than their principal officials. That was all wrong. It was calling to be righted, and I heartily endorse the action taken on it, but I think that the Minister's addition was not quite what it should be. The Minister mentions a salary of £3,500 for Ministers but that is in addition to the £2,500 as a Deputy, which adds up to £6,000, a reasonable salary for that level and somewhat in <Col N="782" /> advance of the Secretary of the Department. That is as it should be. Of course there are hidden perks in it. There is quite an attractive pension scheme designed to help Ministers, when they are out of office, to get back to their professions or former careers.</P>

      <P>We wish Ministers to be treated properly, but on the other hand we should get away from special privileges. One I would refer to is the abuse of State cars which I think should be, and probably can be severely curtailed. I appeal to the present Minister to drastically curtail this when the new salaries come into effect. Many of us had seen on television and were elated by the first meeting between the Government and the Government of Northern Ireland, the meeting at Iveagh House between the Taoiseach and Captain O'Neill, but to me the greatest thrill of all was reserved to the good-bye when, having said good-bye on the steps of Iveagh House, the Leader of the Northern Ireland Government then stepped into his own car and drove off.</P>

      <P>Before lunch, I had touched rather briefly on the necessity for reform because make no mistake about it, if we do not reform we are going to find more and more control will slip away from the Oireachtas. We will experience something like what is happening in Europe, which is a grave threat to democracy. We have got to see to it that our work here is efficiently arranged, carried out efficiently and seen to be efficiently done by the public. We are in the public eye in a way in which the Oireachtas was not in the public eye ten to 15 years ago.</P>
      <P>We have got to take cognisance of that. I pointed out in fact the adverse effect it has on visitors to come in and see only a small number of Senators present. In fact, I do not think they would be particularly edified if they came in after the lunch break and found that we had here fewer than 15 or 20 of the total of Senators present. It is even worse when you go into the Dáil. It may be said that there is a reason for this but this is the inefficient image we present to the public. Anyone who has any experience of efficiently organised parliaments will know that this should not be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the privilege of visiting the Senate in the USA and it was really a most impressive performance to see the various committees in action and to see the general air of bustle, activity and work going on, all of which was very impressive to any visitor. One could not but be impressed by the activity and diligence shown in the work in the US Senate, which is the <Col N="784" /> very antithesis of the impression left by Dáil Éireann. I suggest the Visitors' Gallery should be discontinued until we re-organise ourselves.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that in all cases where there is a question of increased remuneration, as is the case in this present Bill, this is always supported by evidence of planning, increased productivity or more efficient use being made of the resources, more efficient performance and perhaps harder work. I believe I am, as the previous speakers have done, giving an opinion, doing some probing and making what suggestions I can for the improvement of the work of the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a very laudable aim to see that the right people are attracted into service now and in the future. Does the present Bill achieve that? I want to turn now to the remuneration proposed for Deputies, which is £2,500 per annum. I do not think anybody can seriously contend that the more successful of our professional people or business people could give up their employment and come into Parliament on that salary. Thus while the Bill improves the situation in many ways, it does not go far enough to ensure that Parliament can be representative of all sections of the community. I am not suggesting that any one section should have a preponderance but we have few professional people, like engineers and medicals who would be prepared to make the sacrifices involved in getting leave of absence from their employment to serve as elected representatives. That is wrong and the way to do it is not that the present proposal of £2,500 should be increased to £3,000,£4,000 or £5,000 because that might attract the wrong type of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can learn from a study of what is done in Europe, particularly the Dutch system, whereunder some type of average rate is struck for Deputies. Eight years ago it used to be £1,500 per annum and perhaps that corresponds to about £2,500 today. But then if the person concerned was in employment, public or otherwise, he <Col N="785" /> would get leave of absence from the employment and the agency giving the leave was expected to make good any deficiency between his existing salary and that which he was about to receive as a Deputy. It meant then that all people on public boards, even civil servants, were able and willing to come forward and offer themselves as candidates, without having to make a serious financial sacrifice in doing so. Neither of course was there financial encouragement in it. We could have something like that even if there is a certain amount of a means test involved in it. You cannot get away from that. If a Deputy has a farm, obviously £2,500 is worth a lot more to him than to a man who has to give up his employment. Lawyers are in the same position as farmers, especially those near Parliament. We had a principle implemented in university grants, that distance from the university centre is taken into account. That can be done in our parliamentary system by generous overnight allowances, paid to Members from outside Dublin city.</P>
    <P>I am making the point that the present £2,500 will not increase very substantially the number of professional people coming forward for election. Neither will it increase the quality. I cannot see it as a way of effecting that. Quality is something we need, and of which all Parties seem to be cognisant. There is a need to improve the type of Deputy to ensure that they are more adequate educationally and in ability for the tasks of modern parliamentary life. I think all Parties are conscious of that but the only really effective way to approach in the selection of candidates. Anyone who wishes cannot put up a plate and say he is an engineer. He has to show qualifications and membership of one of the engineering institutions and the same thing applies in the medical profession.</P>
    <P>There are certain standards to be satisfied. I would like to see Parties making an effort in this direction, showing that they take seriously the duties imposed on them by the present increases, duties to ensure that a better and more uniform type of selection is <Col N="786" /> instituted. I would envisage that any person thinking of presenting himself for selection as a candidate in a forthcoming general election, or in an election to the Seanad, would before that time have to go before his respective Party accreditation committee, and the committee would go into the general level of education of the candidate, his experience in public life and would decide whether he was qualified to seek election as a Deputy or not.</P>
    <P>A Party convention would then have to select its candidates from those who had been accredited by the Party. That would enable the Parties to make a real, positive approach to the selection of candidates. It is no secret that all Parties are often struggling against local selection and the putting forward of relatives of deceased Deputies rather than selecting the best available candidate in the constituency. I think Parties should make an approach along those lines.</P>
    <P>We should examine very carefully the duties of Deputies and Senators and should decide on their primary functions and the allocation of time involved. The primary function is to assist in legislation and in committee work in the Oireachtas, and so on. If that is so, then the secondary function of making representations should be actively discouraged. I know it is a vicious circle at present and it is easy for us from the University panel, who are not subject to the same stream of representations, to look at this problem, perhaps one could say, rather academically. Yet, I think there is scarcely a Deputy who would not appreciate getting away from some of this drudgery at the local representation level, involving consultation on old age pensions or any of the other hundreds of tasks which Deputy Flanagan outlined in the television broadcast. It is up to the Government, with the assistance of all Parties&mdash;to set up an all-Party Committee on this&mdash;to try to make the citizens aware of their rights and also to dissuade them from using their Deputies as messenger boys; in short, to convey to the ordinary citizen through television that the main function of his Deputy is to attend Dáil Éireann and take an active part in <Col N="787" /> legislation and in Committee work.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a deplorable increase in the pressures acting on Deputies. Some specialists in that line&mdash;all Parties have them&mdash;set the standards for other Deputies. The thing is a vicious circle which can be broken only by concerted effort by all Parties, acting through an all-Party Committee. I urge the Minister to do something about that. It would probably call for the introduction of an ombudsman system which has been mentioned by earlier speakers. That institution has proved its worth elsewhere and would be highly valuable here. The citizens would get used to it as their first port of call in which to get advice.</P>
    <P>In his introductory statement, the Minister said the allowance to Deputies was not all clear to pocket, that there was the question of secretarial expenses. That is wrong. Secretarial assistance should be made available freely and I should like to see efforts made along those lines in the immediate future. It is part of the parliamentary system in every advanced country that adequate secretarial backing is regarded as essential for each Member of Parliament. We are very much behindhand in this respect.</P>
    <P>On the question of the allowance to the Opposition of some £15,000 a year for secretarial and other assistance, I go along fully with Senator O'Quigley in holding that this allowance is not adequate. On the other hand, before voting an increased allowance, I should like to see a plan setting out the proposed structure of the organisational needs of each Opposition Party to discharge their functions as Opposition Parties. If that came before us, I am confident that it would be sympathetically received and acted on. In any Opposition Party there should be a certain number of key people who would devote most of their time to Parliamentary work. That might mean supplementing their Dáil allowance by some compensation grants from the allowance made for the running of the Opposition Parties.</P>
    <P>These are all part and parcel of modern parliamentary life and the <Col N="788" /> organisation of a modern Parliament, and it is high time we had a serious look at these. It is necessary that we should revolutionise our work and our system before we begin to revolutionise salaries.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the most controversial of all the allowances proposed &mdash;the one I find myself in disagreement with&mdash;the increase to Senators. The challenge to the Government should be either to abolish the Seanad or put it to work, because there is no future and no use for the Second Chamber as it is today, when it acts merely as a pale replica of the Dáil. On the other hand I should be very much opposed to its abolition because it has a very useful role to play and in the development of a modern Committee system it could play a leading part.</P>
    <P>Seriously, can anybody contend that we are giving good service at present? The Seanad debates may be of a somewhat different turn and emphasis from those of the Dáil but if we are to judge by the impact the Seanad has had on legislation&mdash;by the number of amendments accepted here during the past four or five years&mdash;the Seanad must appear to be the most costly means ever devised of making minor amendments. We usually find great reluctance by Ministers to listen to reasonable amendments in the Seanad. There are, of course, honourable exceptions. One of the greatest of all was the late Minister for Education, Donogh O'Malley, whose approach was always refreshing and open and we always felt when we put a strong case that he would listen to it and act on it. We remember him very much here for that. There are a few other Ministers also of the same disposition and the Minister for Finance usually treats us in a reasonable manner.</P>
    <P>However, we are looking for something more. We are seeking to be involved more efficiently in the process of government. We do not want to be merely a purple patch in the structure of Government, especially seeing the way life is developing in the country and seeing the big gulf opening up between officialdom, on the one hand, and the ordinary plain people of the country, on the other. It is here the <Col N="789" /> Seanad can show its usefulness. It is only if given responsibility in this way that the proposed increases could be justified. We cannot give them to Senators merely for 25 days sitting in the year, with little or no Committee work attached thereto, and as for the representations and so on that many Senators have to make, that is not envisaged in the structure of the Seanad &mdash;it is not part of the Seanad as conceived and must be described as extraneous activity. the need, if the Seanad is to play its</P>
    <P>I cannot but feel very conscious of proper part, to rationalise its election system. It is not possible to devise a more complicated or a worse form of election than the present electoral system for the Seanad which, on the one hand, is supposed to be vocational, to represent vocational interests, but for which the election is purely that of a political college. It is about time we got down to thinking about this and got away from the past.</P>

At a particular time one of our members fell ill and I remember it being said to me that there was going to be a by-election in West Cork. There was a by-election but it happened that it was a member of the Labour Party who died as he was making a speech. He was only three years a member of the Government and in order to let his widow qualify for a pension the time-limit was cut down to three years. Up to that <Col N="793" /> it was ten years.

You must get the most popular man in the district or he will not be elected. A lot of these people who are not educated can teach us all.

I suggested it once to a friend, who got the opinion of one of the highest legal men in the State, and he said that I was perfectly right, but then I was defeated at the next election.</P>

      <P>I should like to begin by saying that I hope that I was not unduly abrasive this morning, and I would like to express my regret to you, Sir, if I gave <Col N="794" /> way to the temptation to interrupt more frequently than I should have. I must confess that I get a little bit restive at being lectured by people like Senator Sheehy Skeffington and others on various matters on which I think by <i>bona fides</i> are just as good as theirs. Senator Sheehy Skeffington held himself up here this morning as an arbiter of public opinion on this question, and it seems that all the political Parties and all the individuals composing those Parties are in error and he alone is fully attuned to public opinion.</P>
      <P>I want to say that I am in constant touch with the people of my own area and know what they think and what they want and what they feel. I have to go before them from time to time and offer myself for re-election. I have no hesitation whatever in going before them on this particular issue either to-morrow or the next day or at the next election. Senator Sheehy Skeffington was inclined to describe the interjections I made as sneers. I suggest that it was his performance here this morning which was a sneer at all the rest of us. He sneered at our motives for doing this and he sneered at the indecent haste with which he said it was done. If I might just take him up on that very point I am afraid he is being less than honest and accurate. This matter is now before the Houses of the Oireachtas for practically 12 months. It is my recollection, that last autumn the Committee on Procedure and Privileges representing all Parties in the House came to me and raised this matter in the first place. It has been going on ever since and it is only now coming to this final and conclusive stage. I do not think that that could possibly be described as indecent haste.</P>
      <P>The measure we have before us now was finally introduced into the Dáil on the 3rd April this year, so that I think that in his endeavour to sneer at the rest of us and impugn our motives in this regard it is he who is doing the sneering and not myself or any of those who agree with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a strange suspicion that Senator Sheehy Skeffington is a humanitarian in the abstract. He is all for people in a general way but I think it stops there. I am more interested in <Col N="795" /> people as people and not in some vague concept of what people are or should be. The fact that he implied that the right sort of person to deal with people's problems is an ombudsman is proof of that. I have no belief whatever in the concept of an ombudsman. I think that no matter what sort the institution is, an ombudsman is never anything more than an official, and I do not think that anybody can ever take the place of the representative of the people, the man elected by the people. I tried to outline my views on that matter in the Dáil. I said that a good public representative is essential in the complex society in which we live, and I think that he is going to become more important rather than less because the machinery of Government, of bureaucracy, is becoming more complex and difficult and all-pervasive, and the necessity for a good public representative to act as a vehicle or a channel of communication between bureaucracy and the people is in my opinion beyond argument.</P>
    <P>A good public representative does not get anybody anything he is not entitled to but he can ensure that people at least get what they are entitled to, and that is important, because the more I see of public administration and affairs the more I realise how little the ordinary man in the street knows about the whole complex apparatus. Very often he has only the vaguest notion of what he is entitled to from the central or local authority, and he needs somebody to explain his position, his rights and what he is entitled to, and very often what he is not entitled to. I said in the Dáil that a Government or a system of Government or administration that moves too far away from the people is heading for trouble. The only way we can keep the channel of communication open between the bureaucracy and the people who are governed by it is through our public representative. I have no patience with this sneer that is levelled at the social welfare type of activity a public representative engages in. I think that it is important and valuable work; that it helps to make our democracy work. For that reason alone I think that it <Col N="796" /> is very important indeed that we get good, honest, hard working public representatives, people of integrity, who will do this vital job properly. Apart altogether from their important function as legislators in these Houses, I think the other job is vital and important, and one which we must always make sure is done properly.</P>
    <P>I also feel very strongly that we should get across to the people in regard to this matter that the allowance which we get, whatever it may be, cannot at all be regarded as something which any of us puts entirely into our pockets. An important part of our jobs as public representatives is to support worthy causes in our constituencies. I think, for instance, in my constituency of a group of people in an area who may decide to start a youth club and want to build a hall or buy a hall or provide themselves with accommodation for the club. They will want to raise money. The first person they will come to naturally is myself because they know that if I lend my weight to the project it will recommend itself to other people. I will be a guarantee of their <i>bona fides</i> and the amount that I give for the purpose will set a level which other people will adhere to. I think that is a perfectly legitimate, valid outgoing on my part.</P>
    <P>I could think of hundreds of other similar types of subscriptions which I must make and should make apart from any particularly personal charitable subscriptions which I might or might not feel like making and which depend entirely on myself. I do not want to make invidious comparisons but I feel that anybody who dismisses these outgoings by Deputies in a facetious way just does not understand the situation or is not doing his own job properly. I feel there is an obligation on any institution, no matter what sort of institution it is, to equip itself to do its job properly and that is what we are about on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I should love to see Senator Sheehy Skeffington coming in here some time and being for something. It seems to me he is consistently nihilistic and negative. Any time I ever brought in a measure here as far as I can recollect <Col N="797" /> he was against it because it was not doing something else instead. I should have thought that as a socialist he would welcome this particular measure because I think that an important part of the socialist approach to Government is that we should have paid and well paid Parliamentarians. If my recollection is correct the first thing that Prime Minister Wilson did when he went into office was to substantially increase all the Parliamentary allowances and salaries. I do not think he, no more than I, would want to preserve a situation where Parliament was the preserve of the rich and leisured classes. I would have thought that was a sound socialist principle.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Quinlan was very foolish to mention America in this particular context because at local and national level Americans are the highest paid legislators and Parliamentarians of all and I would not like to see a situation here where only millionaires could afford to go into politics. I think in the United States of America now a situation has developed where only a millionaire can afford to be a Presidential candidate. That is precisely what we do not want here. I remember when I was in the Dáil first there was a man elected to the Dáil as a candidate of the unemployed. He had a perfect, legitimate right to be elected and to be a Member of the Dáil but that man had to resign after a certain length of time because he just could not afford to be in the Dáil. His personal circumstances were such that he just could not afford to stay. Does anybody suggest that that is right and that only somebody who can afford it, because of his own particular circumstances, should be a Member of Parliament?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this is an egalitarian piece of legislation because it tries to make everybody equal in so far as entry into the Oireachtas is concerned.

      <P>I know of men who died suddenly and because of the neglect of their own personal affairs through being members of public bodies they left their widows and children almost destitute. I know of other cases of men who devoted a lifetime of service to either this House or the other House and who, at a certain stage, were ruthlessly cast aside by the electorate, as the electorate has every right to do and they, too, because of the lifetime of service which they had given to the affairs of the country, were left pretty well destitute. That is not the way to run our affairs.</P>
      <P>I have a number of motives for bringing in this piece of legislation but I think the foremost motive is as Senator Quinlan read out of my opening statement to make sure that the Oireachtas fulfils the obligation which is on it &ldquo;to see to it that the right people are attracted to its service now and in the future&rdquo;. I believe that very strongly. I believe that we could let the situation deteriorate very easily, as I think it has been deteriorating in recent years, to where we would not be getting the right sort of people into the Oireachtas and, of course, the converse of that is that we want to ensure that anybody who wants to come in and who is fitted to come in and whom the people would be prepared to elect to the Oireachtas can do so and will not be prevented from doing so by lack of means.</P>
      <P>I have no belief at all in this suggestion of a means test. I think it is only a gimmick and I believe that this Bill should recommend itself to the House as it is. It is trying to keep matters right, trying to safeguard the future of this Oireachtas and for that reason it should commend itself to all Senators.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for the setting up of a proof house to test firearms. The need for the proof house has arisen from the recent establishment in Birr of a factory for the manufacture of shot guns, principally for export. In some of the countries, to which this factory will be exporting, there is a prohibition on the sale of firearms <Col N="802" /> unless they bear a mark indicating that they have been tested in accordance with recognised procedures and that they comply with specified minimum standards of safety. The testing is required to be carried out, either by one of the recognised proof houses in these countries, or by a foreign proof house established by law and recognised by the authorities in these countries for the purpose.</P>
      <P>The Birr factory is, therefore, at a disadvantage because of the lack of a proof house here as its guns have to be sent abroad to be tested. The Bill will remedy this situation, as it is intended that the new proof house will be capable of securing the recognition of the authorities of any country to which Irish manufactured guns are being exported.</P>
      <P>Senators will, I think, agree that the body to which the duty of proofing guns should most appropriately be given is the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards. The Institute is already charged with the responsibility for testing commodities intended for sale or for use by the public and it has the required experience and technical resources to provide a service of this nature.</P>
      <P>Accommodation for the proof house is already available at the Institute and premises there are being adapted and equipped to enable proofing to be carried out. It is intended, once the Bill becomes law, to lose no time in making the necessary regulations provided for in the Bill prescribing the methods to be employed on the testing of firearms, the mark or marks to be used to designate compliance with the proofing requirements and the fees to be charged for the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no restrictions here on dealing in unproofed firearms, unlike other countries. Because of the dangers arising from the use of guns which may not be up to the generally recognised standards of safety, the power is being taken in the Bill to prohibit the export, sale or hiring of unproofed guns and it is the intention to make the necessary orders as soon as the Bill has been enacted and the testing facilities are available. The power is also <Col N="803" /> being taken to enable me to prohibit the actual use of unproofed guns.</P>
    <P>As an example of the effect of an order made under these provisions, which are contained in Section 4 of the Bill, the hiring-out of unproofed guns on commercial shoots would be prohibited&mdash;or even, if considered necessary, the use of such guns whether hired or not. It will be appreciated that accidents on commercial shoots, especially if they involved out-of-State visitors, could create bad publicity for game shooting in Ireland. On the other hand, it would be unreasonable if, for example, a visitor could not use his own favourite weapon solely because it did not carry an Irish proof mark, even though it carried the mark of a responsible foreign authority. The section, as drafted, will make it possible for my Department to pursue a reasonably flexible policy in such matters.</P>
    <P>The point was made during the debate in the Dáil that the mark used on guns would be of much greater value if it were to indicate the year in which the gun was proofed. The relevant provision in the Bill would enable me to prescribe a mark which includes the date of proofing and, while there are certain technical difficulties involved, I will certainly give full consideration to the suggestion when I come to make the particular order.</P>
    <P>I hope that the proposals contained in the Bill will be acceptable to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems to be a Bill designed to rectify a defect in the Firearms Act, 1964. When I see that the body that will be concerned in the proofing of firearms is the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards, I may say it is a matter which commends the Bill to me straight away because I think there are very few institutes in this country who do so much valuable work in secret, as I rather think, and get so little praise for it, as the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards. On any occasion I have in my professional capacity to observe the work of that Institute, I have always been <Col N="804" /> gratified by the high standard and quality shown.</P>
      <P>I must say it comes as something of a surprise to me that we are becoming a maker of armaments. I have no doubt the socialists among us who will take into account the Vietnam war will regret that this Bill should be necessary at all. It seems to me that so long as firearms may also be made for lawful purposes, and I take it the majority of those made by the factory will be for that purpose, very few of us would object to them so long as there are necessary and proper standards of safety applied to them. It is necessary, of course, to apply safety standards to other things we use from time to time. Accordingly, as I do not know anything whatever about firearms, and do not wish to know anything, it seems to me that this is a Bill which the House can safely accept.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that this Bill is to facilitate the sale of arms or guns in those countries where the proof mark is required. There cannot be any doubt as to the necessity for testing so as to ensure that defective arms are not offered for sale. It is true to say that a number of accidents occur from the bursting of barrels, but more accidents occur through badly constructed trigger mechanism than are ever likely to occur by reason of a barrel bursting. I have some experience in this regard and I would be very meticulous about the state of the trigger mechanism; they are delicate features of equipment and if not properly made, could always be dangerous. I would be in favour of the proofing of barrels but more anxious about the safety of the trigger mechanism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the purpose of this Bill is to produce a gun that can be sold with a guarantee that it is safe. If the purpose of the Bill is to do that, then some consideration should be given to the question of the type of trigger mechanism built into the gun. In nine cases out of ten, accidents occur because of these badly-made trigger mechanisms and the careless use of such guns. If a person goes to a shop and purchases a gun and sees the proof on the barrel, it will not be an <Col N="805" /> indication that the gun is safe&mdash;it may not be&mdash;but if there was a guarantee attached that the trigger mechanism was approved, then I might consider the gun safe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill on behalf of the Labour Party. I think it is essential. The Minister has indicated that we are manufacturing guns in the State and to enable us to sell these guns on the world market, we must have evidence of proof on the barrel. Therefore, it is essential that we give this Bill rather quick passage. I should like to endorse the remarks of Senator Honan when he says that it is not always due to the explosion of the barrel that accidents occur but to defective trigger mechanism and I do think that the Minister should be well advised on that aspect. I am sure he and his Department will ensure that that aspect of the manufacture of guns will be seen to. We have a number of guns licensed in the State at the moment and it is not always realised that when a licence is given for those guns, they may have defective barrels or defective trigger mechanism, or that the gun itself may be unsafe. I would like an indication from the Minister as to what standards are observed when guns are being examined. Are they examined, or is a licence just issued? Perhaps this is not pertinent to this Bill but I think it is something that should be looked into when the Department are issuing licences for guns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point that has been made with regard to the necessity for ensuring that more than the barrel is safe on a gun but I would like to put this matter into perspective. This Bill is primarily an industrial Bill and the proof will be operating only in respect of new guns, not in respect of existing guns, some of which are alleged to be very old and unsafe. This Bill will have no effect whatsoever in regard to those. I understand there are about 80,000 guns of this kind which are licensed each year and the operation of checking them perhaps before issue of a licence, periodically every five years or at shorter intervals, would be very substantial and would <Col N="806" /> involve additional expense on the part of the licence-holders. I am not saying that it should not be done or that this is not the position, but it would be a fairly large-scale undertaking more appropriate to the Department of Justice than to the Department of Industry and Commerce. The Minister for Justice is, in fact, looking at this matter to see whether it is feasible or not.</P>
      <P>In so far as this Bill is concerned with the proofing of new guns, I stated in Dáil Éireann in response to a question that the proofing of a gun would cover not only the barrel but the trigger mechanism. It is correct to speak of a clarification which I should like to make here now. The proofing mark would apply only to the barrel. It could be applied to the barrel and would, in fact, cover only the barrel. This is the international practice but the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards, in exercise of its general responsibility for standards, will check the mechanism of all the guns presented to it but, strictly speaking, the legal proofing will cover only the barrel.</P>
      <P>It could happen, if not perhaps to any substantial degree, that the Institute would be presented only with the barrel and not with the rest of the mechanism. In that case the proof mark would be applied, that the barrel conformed to the necessary standards and the mechanism would not have been checked. This, however, is expected to be only in a small number of cases, if it happened at all. In the normal way, the legal proof will cover only the barrel, but in actual fact the Institute in discharge of its obligation regarding standards, will check the mechanism of the gun.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 17 to 23 inclusive and substitute &ldquo;each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made unless a resolution approving such draft shall be passed by each such House&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The recommendations refers to paragraph (c) of the section which proposes that a draft of the order shall be laid before Dáil Éireann and, if a resolution of the draft is passed by the Dáil within the next subsequent 21 days on which it has sat after the draft is laid before it, the order shall not be made. It came as a shock to most Members of this House to find that the position with regard to the fixing of judges' salaries in the future will not be that the Government will be supposed to make an order and have the draft of it approved by both Houses or, as is proposed in this Bill, by the Dáil only. That will not be the position though it is the normal standard when one thinks of a draft order. What will happen is that the Government will make an order but it will not take effect until 21 sitting days after it has been made, if the Dáil has not annulled it. In other words, it will not take effect after 21 days if a resolution has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one examines the practical application of that, one will see it is the most undesirable way in which to increase judges' salaries. There has been a good deal of criticism, and it is a good thing that there should be criticism, however extravagant it may be at times, of salaries of judges and Members of the Oireachtas. It is right and proper also that there should be debates about this thing and that it should not be made to appear that increases of salaries of judges and Ministers are not awarded in any kind of clandestine way. What the Bill is proposing is just to do that&mdash;to make the increases appear to be made in a clandestine manner by laying an order in draft before the Dáil and then saying that the salaries will not take effect. It is not an easy matter, in practice, for anybody to say: &ldquo;you will not get <Col N="809" /> something&rdquo; to somebody who has been granted an increase. It would be difficult for most people to contemplate putting down a motion.</P>
    <P>I dislike the idea that this is the method which will be adopted. It would be far better if the Government came clean whenever it is realised by the Government that an increase to the judiciary is warranted, having laid the draft order before both Houses, as I suggest in the recommendation, and certainly before Dáil Éireann, seeking for the approval of Dáil Éireann to the increase. That is what should be done.</P>
    <P>It is for that purpose I have put down the recommendation &mdash; to provide that each House should be given an opportunity of passing a draft order before it takes effect. I know the Minister will say that the constitutional position is that in relation to Certified Money Bills only the Dáil can amend them, that the Dáil has the final say in financial matters. That may be so, but I suggest to the Minister and the House that there is no constitutional warrant whatever for saying that the Government shall have a say, the final say, as is proposed in this section, in relation to the fixing of judges' salaries.</P>
    <P>If it is wrong constitutionally for the Seanad to make amendments to Certified Money Bills, with greater force one can argue that it is wrong that what has up to now been done by legislation can in future be done by mere Government order. It is right, therefore, to say that both Houses should be given an opportunity of approving of the order. In the vast majority of cases, if the Government in their prudence and discretion think it proper to increase judges' salaries, it is more than likely these increases will be approved by both Houses.</P>
    <P>I think it is also valuable and probably a good deal more satisfactory from the point of view of the recipient to know that the salary he is getting has received the open approval of the Members of the Dáil and Seanad. For that reason, I would urge the House to accept the recommendation which I think is much nearer to the spirit of the Constitution than paragraph (c), which gives all the power to the Government <Col N="810" /> subject to the approval of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>There is little I can add to what Senator O'Quigley has said, except to appeal to the Minister to allow this order to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As a layman, I would like to remark that the Minister has not given us any good reason for this proposal. I hope he will be able to give us some convincing reasons for the change. It seems to me that the status of the judges in relation to the Legislature is being changed, that they are being put into a different category now from that in which they were formerly. It is understandable that we should have government by order, particularly in certain spheres where legislation would be much more desirable.</P>
      <P>The proposal is to give the Minister power to adjust judges' salaries by order, having given the appropriate notice to the Dáil, so giving the Dáil an opportunity of making an objection. So far, I have not heard from the Minister any good reasons for this proposal or why the previous scheme is considered now to be undesirable, and why this proposal is considered to be a more equitable method of dealing with judges' salaries rather than the scheme which operated formerly.</P>
      <P>This scheme is going to change the status of the judges in relation to the adjustment of their salaries and the Minister ought to explain to the House why it is considered necessary to do this. In the previous debate the Minister gave substantial reasons for the proposal to give increases to judges and justices, although it is not so long since there was an adjustment. This is the second adjustment within a comparatively short time and perhaps the Minister could explain why the procedure now proposed was not considered on the occasion of the last adjustment and why this particular time was selected to bring in the new method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Senator Rooney was not present during the Second Reading debate when I gave <Col N="811" /> some explanation of some of the matters which he has raised. I will return to this later. I would like to summarise the points contained in Senator O'Quigley's amendment by saying that it would give to the Dáil the power to make an affirmative resolution instead of the present provisions which leave it open to the Dáil to pass a resolution of disapproval, if it so wished and it would also leave it open to the Seanad to pass a resolution of disapproval. The substance of this recommendation was discussed in the course of the Second Reading debate and I have already indicated the reasons for the powers provided in the Bill as it stands.</P>
      <P>I may mention again that the limited power of the Seanad in relation to money matters is the background of the situation, now being provided for. Up to now, Bills have been necessary to increase judges' salaries. These are money Bills and the power of the Seanad with regard to them is limited to a delay of three weeks. It would be out of line with the constitutional position if the Seanad were to be given power of veto in regard to orders which deal with money matters. Under Senator O'Quigley's recommendation, a draft order tabled by the Government and approved by the Dáil could not be made until the Seanad had approved of it and the suggestion that the Seanad could thwart the decision of the Dáil is unacceptable to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendation would substitute an affirmative resolution for the provision in the Bill for a resolution of disapproval. The Government have given this matter serious thought and we are satisfied that this is the more satisfactory method of dealing with it. The procedure provided for in the Bill gives the Dáil adequate power and time to disapprove of the draft order, if it so wishes. I suggested yesterday, and I repeat the suggestion today, that under the procedure in this House, if Senators think it necessary to table a motion disapproving of increases in judges' salaries, they are at perfect liberty to do so. If they want an opportunity of discussing this matter, they have their own procedure open to them <Col N="812" /> by tabling a motion in this connection This can be done at any time the issue arises.</P>
    <P>I am completely unconvinced by Senator O'Quigley's suggestion that increases in judges' salaries would be given in a clandestine manner. Indeed, I am quite satisfied that Senator O'Quigley, with his political experience, knows that this could never be so. He is just as conscious as we all are that this is a controversial business, and to suggest for a moment that a substantial increase in judges' salaries could be made by any Government under an order of the Dáil and that this would escape the attention of Deputies is, in my submission, utterly unrealistic. We all realise that whenever this happens, people for their own purposes, some in this House and some outside, will be quoting all the increases that have been given to judges or higher civil servants, which is done in every place from the Labour Court and elsewhere that one can think of, and to suggest that there is a danger of some increase being given to judges that would pass the notice of the public is, in my view, completely unrealistic.</P>
    <P>Indeed in the case of classes of this kind, the very limited number of these very important public servants, increases in their remuneration are, as Senators know, at all times politically unpopular, irrespective of what Government may be in power. There is no Government at any time, in my view, that will be in power that will be leaning over backwards to try to give people in this income group an increase. Indeed they will always find themselves, in the nature of the case, probably rightly so, at the end of the queue, and they will only be considered I would imagine&mdash;and this has been the history of this whole business &mdash;when everybody else has been dealt with.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that Senators will realise that this is the position and that there is simply no possibility of an order of this kind being laid before the Dáil increasing judges' salaries without the matter getting very ample publicity, and indeed without the figures being quoted by all those who could use them for their own purposes in <Col N="813" /> their arguments in connection with other pay increases for different sections of the community.</P>
    <P>Senator Rooney wanted to know why was this change in procedure not done before. I suppose that the shortest answer is that different Ministers for Justice take different views as to how matters should be done. I personally feel that it is utterly wrong that these very important public servants should become a political football to be kicked around the Houses of the Oireachtas for different reasons, in many cases suspect reasons. I think that there is no reason why members of the judiciary should not have their salaries fixed from time to time, the same as is done in the public service.</P>
    <P>There was an objection by Senator O'Quigley &mdash; I think it was he who made this point &mdash; that these increases must be determined by the Government. The Government must always determine what this class of servants is to get, no matter what Government is there. It is true that we are retaining parliamentary control by having this procedure whereby an order will be laid before the Dáil, and it is open under this procedure for any Deputy of any Party to put down a motion to annul it, and no doubt such motions will be put down if it is only for the purpose of discussion from time to time if the matter arises, and, as I have said, the same procedure in its own way is open to any Senator.</P>
    <P>Judges' salaries elsewhere, instead of being dealt with by legislation are fixed, from inquiries I have made, by order just as I am proposing here. In fact in some countries it is not necessary to make an order at all. They deal with them in the same way as with higher civil servants. I do not see why these people should be singled out for special consideration, if you wish, by having to introduce legislation, and, as I explained to the House last night, one of the reasons why they have missed, perhaps, some increases that other high public servants have achieved during the years is the fact that up to now it was necessary to have legislation to deal with them. So we are here this evening reassessing the position of these men, reassessing their <Col N="814" /> salaries in relation to other public servants, and in relation to the community as a whole, whereas if they were dealt with from time to time like other important public servants, there might not be any reason for us to be here with this particular legislation, and they would be caught up with the other sectors of the community and their pay adjusted from time to time.</P>
    <P>It is not correct for Senator Rooney to say that they got an adjustment some time ago. It is over four years since the last adjustment was made in the salaries of the judiciary. In fact, since the foundation of the State, as I told the House last night, there were only five changes made since 1922, five additions made to the judicial salaries. Considering the very important duties which these men perform for the community, having given the matter considerable thought, I felt that it was undesirable that every time these important public servants required an adjustment in their remuneration which other servants get automatically at a certain period of their time, we must have legislation.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that I have suggested this change. I think it is a better and more efficient way of dealing with these men, and I have no doubt at all that whenever any further adjustment is necessary in regard to them, when the order comes before the Dáil, it will not alone be in the national headlines but will be quoted by all those whom it would suit to quote increases given to the judiciary for their own purpose of arguing for other sections of the community. I am also satisfied that the whole history of this business is to the effect that they follow up increases given to other public servants, that they are at the end of the queue. For all these reasons, I am sorry I must reject the recommendations and ask the House to accept the Bill as it stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has certainly gone into great length to argue against the recommendation, and I accept the constitutional position that Seanad Éireann is not on a par with the Dáil and that the supremacy of the Dáil in money and financial matters must be preserved. But what <Col N="815" /> I do take issue on is the idea that the Seanad must not be allowed to say anything at all about increases but at the same time must allow the Government by order, unless it is disapproved, to grant these increases. That seem to me to be taking away from the Oireachtas a power which it has at the present time and has exercised evidently sparingly in relation to judges&mdash;five increases in a period of 40 years&mdash;and probably fairly justly over that period. For that reason I propose to put down a recommendation on Report Stage to get over the Minister's difficulty of the constitutional position of both Houses, but at the same time to provide that the Dáil will approve a draft resolution before the increases can take effect. I think there is much to be said for that.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that increases in salaries for members of the judiciary, and we also know, in relation to Members of the Oireachtas, are not very popular ventures by any Government. That may be so, but I do not think that that is a good reason for making them clandestinely. I feel it is far better for the health of public opinion and for the judiciary themselves that any increases given should be given <i>coram publico.</i> It is far better that it should be done publicly. We are going to pass this Bill today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I certainly will do nothing to prevent it going through. It will go through today and the end result will be that the judges will have got their increases. There has been a <Col N="816" /> good debate on it and I feel it is far better that the judges should say at the end of the day: &ldquo;The public knows what we are getting. There has been a good debate. There have been certain criticisms of us and a good deal of praise of our integrity&rdquo; and so on, and then they can enjoy their salaries from 21st July&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is even better. At any rate, the judges will have their salaries and no harm has been done, but a great deal of public good has been done for the public then know that the judges are paid these salaries and the judges, knowing that the public know what they are being paid for, will act accordingly. I think it is useful for all classes of public servants to be sensitive to public opinion and members of the judiciary, like members of the Roman Rota and others, become insensitive to public opinion if things are done in secret over a prolonged period. I think it is good to have debates from time to time about these things, about judges and how they should act. I think that is good for the health of the community and for the health of the courts and for our system of government. For that reason I think that when increases are to be made in future, we should deal with them as I suggest.</P>
      <P>I accept the constitutional position as outlined by the Minister, but at the same time, I still think that there is merit in the principle of my recommendation. I now ask leave to withdraw it so that I can put down a recommendation on Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to speak on the first recommendation but on the second which, of the two, I favour anyway, for this reason that I can see this query about the constitutional position of the Seanad in regard to Money Bills and the spending of public money but there are perfectly good precedents for the Seanad being involved. The Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, in section 4, provides that anything done will be subject to 21 <Col N="817" /> day orders; in other words, following the line suggested by Senator Quinlan that the Seanad should be brought in. There is this to be said for bringing in the Seanad: as the Minister knows, the Seanad has a Statutory Instruments Committee. Its function is not to query the amount granted under an order of this type but to query the way in which it is done and to ensure that everything is done in accordance with the statutes. This does not always happen. It happens now and again that Departments slip up in the machinery they use and the language used in an order and it is most important that these should be carefully examined.</P>
      <P>At the moment only one House has a Committee which examines Statutory Instruments and that happens to be this House. If an order is not laid before the House, then the Statutory Instruments Committee cannot consider that order, and if the Minister wishes to refer back to the various reports made by the Committee, he will see that the Committee has exercised a very useful function and in fact the preciseness with which orders are now drawn up compared with the way they were drawn up at the time the Committee was set up is much improved so that the Committee has had the effect that very much greater care is taken in the drafting of orders. Surely it is important that this should continue? I disapprove entirely of this step, which apparently is proposed in the Bill, that a precedent will be set for removing this type of order from the Seanad. That is very wrong and I am entirely in favour of Senator Quinlan's recommendation. What possible harm can happen I do not know. The Seanad quite recently passed a superannuation order granting increased superannuation to secondary teachers. No one said that the Constitution was being torn to shreds in the process. I cannot see what possible harm can be done, and in fact I can see a great deal of good in ensuring that these orders should be laid before the House which has a Committee which deals with this precise point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not very long since a particular order came before the Committee and it turned out that apparently three <Col N="818" /> distinct methods of doing a certain thing were available and the odd thing was that the Minister for Finance who was the operative Minister had agreed to the whole three. No clarification was ever got on this, but at least attention was drawn to it and one can hope that in future such an error will not be made. This type of thing may seem fiddling and it certainly takes up a lot of time pursuing these orders and, I hasten to add, with the help of the staff of the House. The Senators do not go into the precise details themselves but they have the machinery available to do it. It is highly important that it should be done and that mistakes do not occur, and with all due respect to those who draft orders, mistakes can occur and they ought not to be ignored and forgotten about and then possibly brought up as a precedent in the future when someone says: &ldquo;This was done years ago and nobody amended it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I feel it is most desirable in the public interest that the closest watch be kept on the way orders are worded. Far be it from me to suggest that the Seanad Committee should query the amount in an order fixing the salaries of judges. This would not be right at all: it would not be within their terms of reference. However, I do think it is important that where legislation is done by order the public interest must be watched and at the moment there is only one body to watch it, that is, the Statutory Instruments Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Sheldon. As a member of the Statutory Instruments Committee, I can corroborate for the benefit of the House the statements the Senator has made. The incident he referred to is not, in fact, an isolated one. The records of the Committee will show that on quite a number of occasions the Committee succeeded in pinpointing either errors or, if you like, breeches of what would otherwise be good conduct. I think Members of all sides of the House would agree that we have a responsibility here, not only to ourselves but to the people at large, to ensure that all these matters, whether <Col N="819" /> it be the salaries of judges or the importation of potato seed, or anything else where we must exercise control, that control should be exercised at least in a legal and proper manner. I, therefore, add my voice to that of Senator Sheldon as I think this is one field in which the Minister should be prepared to listen to the voice of the Senators in this House.</P>

      <P>This amendment, if it were accepted, would mean that a draft of the order should be laid before Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann and if a resolution approving the draft is passed by Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann its effect shall take place as soon as the order shall be made. In addition to what I said already on the other amendment, I cannot accept what Senator Sheldon contends about the Statutory Instruments Committee in this instance. The order, whenever it may be made, unlike the other Statutory Instrument ones referred to by the Senator, will not be of a technical nature. It will simply set out that judges of the Supreme Court shall get so much and judges of the High Court shall get so much and so on.</P>
      <P>The Statutory Instruments, which Senator Sheldon had in mind, are in many instances of a very technical nature. They refer to very technical matters and may need very technical interpretation and the wording of those can be, as the Senator rightly said, of the utmost importance to the public and to the court. In this particular instance, however, the instruments that will be made in future, if this legislation passes the House, will be of a completely different kind. They will be very simple factual statements of increases in the salaries of the judiciary. I suggest, therefore, to the House that the arguments Senator Sheldon has advanced in connection with the Statutory Instruments Committee and the interpretation of various Statutory Instruments, do not apply although I agree with the Senator, as far as this is concerned, that many of these instruments are of a very technical nature and, of course, they all have the force of law.</P>

      <Col N="820" /> This is just as important as an Act of the Oireachtas or the passing of legislation, as if they were brought before the House of the Oireachtas in the form of a Bill. As I pointed out to the House, Seanad Éireann has its own procedure for bringing matters before it by way of motion. Indeed, I do not accept for a moment that somebody like Senator Sheldon, who is known for his eager beaver performance on Committee Stages of Bills&mdash;well I know it since I was a long time before this House on the Land Bill&mdash;will not keep his eye on matters like this, as many Senators do. If the matter calls for debate in this House they have their own procedure whereby they can have any such increase discussed in public.</P>
    <P>I think that is the real answer to those Senators who have some fear that there will be something clandestine about future increases under this order procedure. Let me emphasise again that all our experience down through the years in this field has been that those people are not considered until the last, although I do not say that that is not right and proper. At all times I feel this is due solely to the cumbersome procedure we have because it is known that it is necessary to introduce special legislation to deal with judges' salaries. As I pointed out last night, there will never be a suitable time for the introduction of a Bill of this kind. Of course, the time is never right for this class of legislation and it never will be. I am sure we are politically realistic enough in this House to realise that. Instead of providing, perhaps in the last four years some annual percentage, as was given, for instance, to higher civil servants, we have now made a complete reassessment and, as I pointed out to the House, the question of working out percentages on this is utterly unrealistic.</P>
    <P>This is a reassessment of the whole position and it is largely due to the fact that those men have been the victims of the system whereby special legislation must be brought in for them each time there is any question of giving them any increases. I think from a commonsense point of view that those <Col N="821" /> considerations are overwhelming. I suggest to the House that the safeguard is there in Dáil Éireann, in the first instance, by having to table this order whenever the judiciary gets any increase. I am sure the House appreciates just as much as I do that there is no Government at any time in this country or in any other country for that matter who will be breaking their necks to give an increase to high public servants of this calibre. Again, if it is an inopportune time, as it always will be, there will be Parties in the Dáil and individuals there who will make very sure, either by way of discussion or by way of question or, as I have already said, by way of citing it to the Government that: &ldquo;You gave so much to the judges. What about so and so?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that the Members of the House are sufficiently experienced and sufficiently appreciative of that factor. Again, I certainly reject the argument that it could ever happen that increases to the judges in Ireland would go by clandestinely without the whole country and the Dáil in particular being fully cognisant of the fact that they were made. I am sorry to disagree with Senator Sheldon. If at any time such an order is made, I am quite sure that people such as he and other Senators, if they so feel, will fully utilise their own procedures here in the House to express the view that the increases given were unjustified, that they were too much, that they should not have been given or that they should have been greater. This procedure is open under the rules of this House and I have no doubt that there are many Senators here who will avail of this procedure should they feel they are justified.</P>

      <P>What the Minister says very much reassures me and looking closely at it I am quite satisfied it is the very area the Statutory Instruments would not wish to interfere with. However, it very often happens that orders go a little wider than the Act permits. One of the committee's functions is to make sure that this does not happen. On the question of drafting, I hope the Minister is quite satisfied with what is here. On the top of page 3 it says &ldquo;The Government may, whenever they so <Col N="822" /> think fit, ... make an order&rdquo;. They can make an order to grant an increase but they cannot decrease those salaries. There is no provision for amending such an order or revoking it as there is in the case of others. This is a difficulty which arises in other cases where a Minister or the Government set out to make an order and discover they cannot do it because the Act, being badly worded, provided permission to make an order only and there was no permission to amend or revoke that order. I hope the Minister is satisfied with the terminology used in this new sub-section (9) (a). It says that the Government may by order increase the sums and nothing is said of the future amendment of that order. It seems to me that there may be a possible difficulty, that once having increased the judges' salaries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment. It is asking for little and it is a case that can afford reasonable protection. It means that the order gets the Statutory Instruments Committee to work as outlined by <Col N="823" /> Senator Sheldon. We are very jealous to see that our powers are not whittled away. This is a small thing that could have a big effect. This could form a pattern for the future laying of orders before the House and in this case we appeal to the Minister. We are not asking much and I think the Minister should go some way towards meeting us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's amendment goes to the root of the whole business. We might as well leave the position as it was. I can well understand people being jealous of their powers, and so on. Leaving aside all these technical arguments, I am convinced, having gone over the history of this during the years since the foundation of the State, that the procedure we have is wrong, that it is cumbersome and that as a result we have the backlog situation we have had here.</P>
      <P>There is an aspect of the matter that was pointed out in the Dáil and nobody has referred to it here. It is conceded that these people were passed by for a number of years on a number of increases. Some of them have since died. If they were entitled to this four years ago, and it is generally accepted that they were, the widows of those men have suffered. Those who have been pensioned have suffered. You have the anomaly that these men suffered because they were at the end of the queue. They suffered financially through pension allowances and gratuities for their wives of one year's salary. A case was made to me in the other House about the inequity and that I should consider this because these men and their widows had missed the bus, whereas other important public servants had caught it. It was pointed out to me there that that was because of cumbersome legislation. Anybody who has experience of government procedure knows how long legislation takes. It has to be circulated to different Departments. Cabinet time is taken up and that is why I am called upon to abolish legislation of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For all these reasons I feel we should do here as is done in other countries as a rule. There is no reason why these <Col N="824" /> important public servants should not be capable of being dealt with if it is necessary to deal with them and that their renumeration should be increased the same as the other top echelons of our Civil Service, State boards and so on. They must face legislation brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas by whatever government may be there at that particular time.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to them. I feel that the protection is left there now. This procedure whereby if somebody thinks&mdash; and I can never visualise the situation arising&mdash;that they are brought in before their time the Dáil has the right to annul the order. I strongly feel that this rule is a reform that is long overdue so far as these public servants are concerned.</P>
    <P>If we had this business as suggested by Senators, outside the constitutional issues I pointed out, it would leave us back where we were. We might as well go through the whole gamut of legislation as it is. These men because they are public servants are, as has been pointed out on both sides of the House, important public servants. They are concerned with the most important arm of the State, running our courts and giving justice to all men. It is unfair to them from the point of view of remuneration that they should be treated unfairly and discriminated against in contrast to the way other important public servants are dealt with and it is to cure that situation that I have brought this machinery before the Dáil and Seanad.</P>

      <P>We all accept what the Minister has stated about the desirability of doing it in this way, by order, and so on, but we cannot for one moment see that acceptance of the amendment will cause any additional delay or be responsible for any of the disadvantages or other drawbacks the Minister has outlined. What we are asking is simply that the order should come to this House. It is put before the Statutory Instruments Committee. There will be a debate in the Dáil and a shorter one in this House. I do not see that that will lengthen it and it will guard a right we have in this House. We should be slow to surrender that <Col N="825" /> right and I do not think it affects the judiciary in any way. It is simply a slight elaboration of the procedure as recommended by the Minister. On this ground, unless the Minister can indicate that he might reconsider this between now and Report Stage, we have no option but to press the recommendation.</P>

      <P>I should like to move an oral recommendation which I suggest will resolve all the difficulties we encountered during the afternoon. Seconded by Senator FitzGerald, I move:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;, if&rdquo; in line 17 to the end of paragraph (c) and substitute &ldquo;and the order shall not be made unless a resolution approving such draft shall be passed by Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House. The purpose of the amendment is to provide that before judges' salaries are increased a draft of the order increasing them shall be passed by Dáil Éireann. At this stage I am abandoning the powers of Seanad Éireann to meddle in these important matters of finance because the Constitution does <Col N="827" /> not give us such powers, does not put us on a par with Dáil Éireann, as my original amendment intended to do. I object, of course, to the Government being put on a par with Dáil Éireann in this matter. I now wish to provide a situation which accords with the spirit on all sides of the House, if I am any good at estimating it. It is to provide that the Dáil shall first approve of the increases before they take effect.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that people should get to know about these matters and talk about them. That is so, but it will be delayed action knowledge if the Bill passes in its present form: there will be a long delay after the time the increases have been made before Deputies, Senators and the public will get to know about them. It is bad for the judiciary in that they will at that stage be brought into political controversy. Increases were given to numerous higher civil servants during the past few years and these increases had already taken effect. If I am not mistaken, moneys had been voted by the Dáil in the various Estimates to give effect to them and there was not a word about it, nobody knew a thing about it, until Deputy Dick Barry of Mid-Cork put down a question. It was only then that even Deputies got to know about the increases which had been given by ministerial order. It is for that reason I say that these increases can be given in the way I suggest and nobody can say it was an outrageous thing, that the public know nothing about it&mdash; what were the Government hiding? That is what will be said after judges get increases if the present procedure in the Bill is enacted.</P>

      <P>A little nonsense is relished by the wisest men and the Seanad should not put itself outside the category of wise men. For that reason I urge the Minister, who has paid great attention to the debate, to accept this amendment which can do nothing but good. It will preserve the power of the Dáil over financial arrangements in relation to the judges and it will be to the benefit of the judiciary in the long run because it will be done perfectly openly&mdash;these undesirable discoveries will not be made by some alert political or other correspondents of the press&mdash;something unwholesome will not happen or be seen to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevant paragraph as it stands reads:</P>
      <P>(c) Where an order is proposed to be made under this subsection, a draft thereof shall be laid before Dáil Éireann and, if a resolution disapproving of the draft is passed by Dáil Éireann within the next subsequent twenty-one days on which it has sat after the draft is laid before it, the order shall not be made.</P>
      <P>This has been taken from some other legislation, I cannot give chapter and verse, but it is in the form of orders already enshrined in some different statutes. In effect, it means that the Government cannot make the orders giving any increases until this specified time has elapsed after the proposed draft order has been laid before the House. Senator O'Quigley referred to higher civil servants getting some increases which the people did not know about. I do not quite accept that but if that was so, surely the Senator realises that this is a completely different matter. There was no draft order to be laid before the Dáil about increases for higher civil servants or any others. This was done as a matter of negotiation between the relevant organisations and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this particular instance, and this is where Parliamentary control is being <Col N="829" /> retained, this draft order will be laid before the Dáil for 21 days before it can be given legal authority by the Government. I do not think that a matter of this kind, which is of such political interest, can appear on the Order Paper in the Dáil without anybody knowing about it. A motion can then be put down by some of the Opposition Parties to have the matter discussed and they can then make suitable comparisons with people for whom some advocates may be seeking increases. There can never be anything clandestine about this business. The draft order must appear before the Dáil and there is no attentive Deputy in the Dáil who will not be conscious of it. The main Opposition Party will be conscious of it and other people who see these increases being given to members of the judiciary will not be asleep in quoting them before the Labour Court and in other places.</P>
    <P>All this procedure is open to the Dáil and I am quite sure most Senators will readily appreciate that this is the kind of thing that must always and will always make headlines in this country. Suppose that the judiciary is the highest salaried group in the country, any change in their salary and in their status will always be news; it will always be news and will be a political embarrassment to the Government of the day which will have to make these adjustments. For all these reasons I regret that I cannot accept the amendment which, in effect, reverses this procedure now proposed and this would mean that you would have to have a positive debate in Dáil Éireann before an order could be made. If we had that procedure we might as well go back to the procedure of having a full discussion on legislation specifically drafted for this purpose. That debate would obviously relate to the status of everybody in the community, each individual Deputy riding his own political bicycle for his own political purposes.</P>
    <P>If we were to adopt that procedure we might as well go back to the legislative system we have had up to this change. There is a specific position here whereby any Party or any <Col N="830" /> Deputy can put down a motion to annul the order which cannot be made until the specified 21 sitting days have elapsed. That is sufficient safeguard from the Parliamentary point of view; it is the most effective way of dealing with the matter and if the judges feel that they are at the end of the queue; and if the Deputies feel it is due to the judiciary to have their salaries increased, when such an order is introduced they can let it go through without putting down a motion to annul it. This is the most effective way of dealing with these men. It takes them out of the category of being used as a political football from time to time. The judificiary are entitled to be treated in this way and there is specific provision to annul the draft order if Deputies so think fit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree on the undesirability of judges' salaries being treated as a political football and in the past they have been so treated in one or other of the House of the Oireachtas. But that does not justify the procedure proposed in this Bill. It has now become explicitly clear from the concluding remarks of the Minister that the purpose of the procedure is to try to avoid a discussion taking place by adopting a procedure under which it appears that the draft order will not be known until it is through the specified time, when nothing can be done about it. That is the very reason why this procedure should not be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision has been made that the order will be before the Dáil for 21 days but who is going to be so naive as to suggest that anyone will know what the order is about? What is this order to be called? Will it be called the Courts Supplementary order? There are many orders on the Dáil Order Paper, the names of the orders are not very explicit and they do not indicate what they are about so that it is necessary to examine each one of them. There have been cases in the past where things happened in this way. If every Member of the Oireachtas was as attentive as he should be every order would be fully noted but every order is not so noted. An order on a matter like this could slip through and <Col N="831" /> not be noticed either by press or Deputies.</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister is prepared to give an undertaking of some kind that such an order will be accompanied by the appropriate publicity, I do not think we can agree to this procedure and unless such an undertaking is given we must press this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case I am on the Minister's side. This is not the ordinary case where 21 days notice is given.

      <P>I would urge the Minister not to accept the amendment. The suggestion underlying it is that for some reason it is desirable that the salaries of the judges and the amount of the increases given to them should be debated in the Dáil and Seanad. I cannot see why the judges, alone of all the people in the country, should have their salaries debated in Parliament. I agree that the salaries of Ministers, Deputies and Senators should be debated but the suggestion is that the salaries of the judges alone of all other sections of the community should be so treated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion is that before any such order can come into force it must be debated in the Dáil. That does not seem to me to be conducive to the prestige of the judiciary. That practice has obtained up to the present and the result has been that Governments quite candidly preferred to let these salaries remain for years on a low level rather than run the risk of having a free-for-all on the subject. The average gap between increases for the judges has been nine years and it has been a ridiculous situation in which District Justices, people of the greatest importance, until now have had the ludicrous salary of £2,500 in the country area.</P>

      <P>It has been pointed out that there is provision for notice of 21 sitting days of the Dáil before the Government can make this order and it has been suggested that this time could elapse and that the draft order could escape notice. That would be quite impossible. I do not believe that Senator FitzGerald believes, if he is familiar at all with Dáil Deputies, that an order increasing judges' salaries would escape the notice of Members of that House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no order before Dáil Éireann necessary to increase Civil Service salaries as the Senator well knows. In this case there is a specific order that must be placed before the House and must be there for 21 sitting days before the Minister of the day can give effect to it. If the Senator thinks that the whole Dáil is asleep on matters of this kind he is certainly very wide of the mark. There is another matter I should like to point out and that is that these draft orders are accessible to newspaper reporters and these questions of increases in judges' salaries will always be news to these men. The apprehensions Senator FitzGerald professes to have that an increase to the highest public servants we have which has to be brought before Dáil Éireann and be given to them until this order is made is going to escape the attention of all the press and of all the Deputies in Dáil Éireann and of all those who are obviously going to use it for their own purpose I think is utterly unrealistic. I have no doubt at all that whenever this is before the Dáil it will be in the headlines of the national press the following day and it will be used and indeed quoted in many instances particularly if it is around election time at every cross roads in the country and the Senators know that damn well.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not answered my question. How, in fact, will people know what the order is about? I begin to suspect the purpose of this manoeuvre when I <Col N="833" /> see the Minister's attempt to suggest that every journalist will immediately see it. If the Order is not entitled &ldquo;Increases in Judges Salaries&rdquo; what will it be entitled&mdash;&ldquo;Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Order&rdquo;? If it is, then with the many other scores of orders which pass unexamined by members of the press and, indeed, by many Members of the Oireachtas, nobody may know it has been made because nobody may have taken the trouble to look at all the orders with obscure titles. I would therefore, ask the Minister is he prepared to assure us that copies of the order will be circulated to all Members of the Dáil or that the order will be entitled &ldquo;Increases in Judges' Salaries Order&rdquo; plainly showing it relates to Judges' salaries or that he will make a public announcement. If he is not prepared to do so then the purpose of his manoeuvre becomes patently clear and objectionable to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is part of a package and I think this has happened on previous occasions. I think that the sort of pressure that is put on the Government to do something about allowances <Col N="834" /> usually builds up by way of pressure from the judges to adjust their salaries and on previous occasions there has been a combined package. We have had a debate on this and we will have a further debate on the allowances for Members of the Oireachtas and now we are proposing that for the future adjustments in the salaries of judges might not necessarily give rise to any debate at all and might, in fact, slip through without anybody knowing anything about it. I wonder are we inadvertently leaving ourselves a bit powerless for the future when we will not have any sort of pressure on the Government.</P>
      <P>I said this morning that any Government are very reluctant to promote a Bill just for Members of the Oireachtas. That is why they have been so few and far between. I just wonder how we are going to stand in future years now that we are re-assessing judges' salaries and having this done by way of an order, which may not be noted, and which does not need the approval of the House. This, as I said at the start, is a rather mundane point but I would not be too happy about such a situation.</P>

      <P>He was in great order. The real purpose, and the Minister has been very frank this afternoon, of this particular device is to prevent public discussion in the future about increases in judges' salaries. That is a retrograde step for reasons I have already given and which I do not want to repeat. I also think the idea that we must increase the salaries of our judges in this way because every time is always an inopportune time to increase judges' salaries does no tribute to our maturity as a people. I believe we have reached the stage in this country, and <Col N="835" /> our development as a State, that if a Government are in a position to show that a salary increase is warranted for members of the Dáil, the Chairman of CIE, the Chairman of the ESB or members of the judiciary and comes to the public and say: &ldquo;Yes, that is the increase we propose&rdquo;, and they have the figures to justify that increase, it will be approved by the public.</P>
      <P>In the same way, I rather believe, if the same thing is said in regard to the work of Deputies and Senators, the sacrifices they make, the inroads it makes on their lives and health, they will in time accept that the salary increases which we have voted for ourselves today are justified. I believe we have developed to the stage when we can say that everybody else has got the second, the third, or the fourth round of wage increases over a period of years, that judges have not got them and that now we propose to give them. I am convinced we are mature enough as people to say that that is so. There has not been all that great fuss about those increases from the Dáil, the Seanad or the public on this occasion.</P>
      <P>When people like Senator Sheldon talk about research and say that those orders should not pass unnoticed, may I say that so far as they are orders laid before Seanad Éireann, they always come before my scrutiny because in regard to all the regulations made I have, after great trouble with the Stationery Office and other people, had arrangements made to have every Statutory Instrument made sent to me and I scrutinise them. I have no doubt that if this order were laid before Seanad Éireann it would come before me, although whether it will or not in future, I do not know.</P>

      <P>I believe it is better for public opinion and for the political health of this country that the salaries given to judges should be given openly and after public debate. The Minister takes a different view and says that it is never an opportune time to grant those increases. Senator Yeats is a great man for research and he <Col N="836" /> loves to taunt people who are inaccurate. He says that the only salaries which are increased or sanctioned by law are those of Members of the Oireachtas and the judges but he is not right in that. I will not tell him who else is.</P>

      <P>As Senator Garret FitzGerald suggested, every time a draft order was being made, instead of being in that widely read journal, <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, if a statement were made that the Government, after consideration with the judges, made an order to increase their salaries, everybody would say there was nothing secretive about it, but I do not think the Minister is prepared to do that. It will just appear in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and it will be put on the Order Paper. If I know civil servants, it will be put on the Order Paper for the first day the Dáil will sit after the summer recess and then will be included among 378 other Statutory Instruments on that Order Paper, and it is very easy for the research officers to miss that out.</P>
      <P>I would, however, take issue with the Minister because I know of no precedent for this present draft order. I know of a precedent where it has to be approved. That is certainly to be found in many Acts we have passed in recent times and in many orders under the Social Welfare Act, 1952. I would love the Minister's officials&mdash;I do not like to call them backroom boys&mdash;to see if there are any precedents for this because I do not know of any. This is the first and this creates the precedent. However, I will not delay the House further on this. I think the recommendation should be accepted and accordingly it is being pressed.</P>

      <Col N="837" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few remarks I have to make. There are certain things I think should not be left unsaid. During the debate on the Second Stage of the Bill, there was some reference to the delay in getting actions to trial. It is right to say that whereas the procedure up to some years ago was that if you did not have a notice of trial served for the early on sittings, Michaelmas, Hilary or Trinity, then you had to wait for the next sitting, but that absurd regulation has been dispensed with and the procedure is that whenever notice of trial is given, it comes on for trial whenever it is permitted to be tried.</P>
      <P>Senator Nash referred yesterday to the desirability of later sittings in the country as if later sittings were not a common feature of the courts at the present time, both High Court and Circuit Court. Indeed, during the foot and mouth disease outbreak, one saw where a learned district justice was sitting down in Achill late at night, dispensing justice in candlelight, from the description of the court given in the papers at that time. There is a definite practice for all judges to sit until 5 o'clock, 5.30, 6.30, 7 o'clock and after 7 in the evening. That has been my experience and the experience of many other barristers.</P>
      <P>In addition, in the High Court, judges, depending on the convenience of jurors, whose convenience has to be taken into account, sit oftentimes until 4.30 p.m. or 5 o'clock, but there are many occasions when it does not suit the business of jurors who are in attendance to sit beyond 4 o'clock and often jury actions have to be curtailed so that businessmen can get back and do something in the afternoon. In spite of that disability, it is true that courts do sit frequently, particularly Chancery, and I have had experience of sitting until 12 o'clock at night to cross-examine a witness who wanted to get back to the Continent.</P>

      <P>I do not want it to <Col N="838" /> go unsaid that they do sit late: they do. I want it said that they do exercise themselves in the way some people say they do not. The salaries they are getting are not merely for sittings from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., as some people suggest, and I want to say that the salaries paid to them under this Bill are, in fact, earned in a way which many members of the public, and apparently Senator Nash included, do not realise.</P>
      <P>Finally, I want to say that in so far as costs of trials in court are concerned, if Senator Nash has been engaged in a case in the High Court where the cost was £1,000 per day, that may have happened to him once in a lifetime. It is nothing like that and it is complete extravagance to parade that exercise the Senator had in that particular action. The Minister may have some experience of that. It never amounts to anything like that for our judges and I hope they will continue to try to facilitate us as far as possible. More witnesses than are necessary in a particular day are released though subject to being on call. This is something that is being done and, to relate myself more to the Bill, it is one I hope will continue to be done. There are many other things I would wish to say to correct the wrong impressions given but your stern ruling and the late hour prevents me going further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>This very brief measure, whose object is to bring the standard time observed in this country into line with that in Western Europe, is on the same lines as a Bill at present before the British Parliament. Our present standard time which is the same as that observed in Britain, is one hour behind that <Col N="839" /> observed in Western Europe. The effect of bringing our standard time into line with that in Western Europe will give us what is referred to as &ldquo;summer time all the year round&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>An examination of our position in this respect was prompted by the proposed change in Britain and Northern Ireland and the views of interested organisations and individuals were sought. Formal advertisements inviting comment were inserted in the daily newspapers. The vast majority of the organisations that offered views, which included industrial and employers' organisations, chambers of commerce and semi-State bodies, considered that we should move into line with Britain and Western Europe. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions indicated that it would not object to the change. About 130 letters were received from individuals and a little more than half of these were in favour of the change now proposed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am fully conscious that there are some disadvantages in advancing the clock throughout the Winter in that the normal working day will begin in darkness during some months of the year and this can give rise to inconvenience for some sections of the community. We are one of the three European countries that are wholly west of Greenwich and, because of this, our time by the sun is behind that of Europe as a whole. In this context I think I should mention that in the Dáil one Deputy feared that the extension of &ldquo;summer time&rdquo; throughout the Winter would be detrimental in the case of very young children, who would be going to school in darkness. I have had this point put to the Department of Education and I understand that if experience showed this to be a problem consideration would be given to making some change in school hours, though there might be difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view, however, of the great and growing intercourse, commercial and otherwise, between this country and our close neighbours, in Europe, the advantages of having a common system of time are obvious. The Government, as I have said, have sought to elicit <Col N="840" /> the views of the public on this question and are satisfied that the weight of opinion is in favour of the change now proposed. They are confident that the balance of advantage for this country lies in observing the same time system as Britain and Western Europe.</P>
    <P>The new standard time, proposed in the Bill, will be one hour in advance of Greenwich mean time. The Bill also proposes the repeal of the existing legislation on this subject. The legislation to be repealed includes the Statutes (Definition of Time) Act, 1880 and the Time (Ireland) Act, 1916, which together make Greenwich mean time the standard time in this country. It is also proposed that the Summer Time Act, 1925, be repealed.</P>
    <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962, provides that licensed premises may remain open until 11.30 p.m. on weekdays in the period of official summer time as compared with 11 p.m. during the rest of the year. Subsection (2) of section 1 of the Bill proposes to preserve this difference in the hours of opening. The period during which opening until 11.30 p.m. is to be permitted is roughly mid-April to early October. The period of summer time has been somewhat longer than that in recent years but that was simply because the British were experimenting with the period of summer time and we made special orders to keep our period in line with theirs&mdash;the effect on the Licensing Acts was purely fortuitous. The period provided in the Bill is the normal period of summer time as it has been since 1926.</P>
    <P>I trust the Seanad will accept this Bill as a progressive and non-controversial measure, and I ask the Seanad to give favourable consideration to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of summer time always gives rise to some concern for parents, particularly parents of small children. It seems to me an odd view of affairs that we are going to provide that the drinking classes under this new Summer Time Bill during the winter time will drink during the non-summer time period. In other words, they will drink in the winter time according to the old time, or one-half the old time, whatever it is. We are cutting them back but doing <Col N="841" /> nothing at all about the children. I am concerned about the children, particularly those who have to rise early to catch one of the new buses because they cannot go to school two miles down the road now. They have to catch a bus and then go to another parish and arrive in time and get home at 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening.</P>
      <P>I want to know what has taken place between the Minister's Department, the Department of Justice and the Department of Education in relation to this real problem for many parents. It is an odd thing that we are concerned about the drinking classes. We want to have them out at 11.30 p.m. on week days in the official summer time period. Under this new Bill they will have to stop drinking at 11 o'clock during the rest of the year. There is a similar provision for Sunday nights but we are doing nothing about our children. This is a matter about which the Minister might give us some information, together with the views of the Department of Health, public health authorities and the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>Of course, when the Bill is law, CIE sets its timetables and the great machines of the different State concerns get moving but the children will be left out and parents will be left to bemoan the introduction of standard time. If I thought in terms of standard time in relation to children, I would think the kind of standard time we ought to be concerned about, among other things, is the fixing of a standard time for lunch time, especially in cities and towns. At the moment, the position is that in some households one child will come home for lunch at 12.30 p.m., another at 1.15 p.m. and yet another at 2 o'clock, the result being that in many homes in our cities and towns luncheon goes on for over a period of hours. That is the kind of standard time many parents in our cities and towns are interested in and I think something should be done about that. It does not appear to be dealt with in this Bill, unfortunately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to put fairly heavy pressure on the Department of Education to deal with this situation. I accept that once Britain and particularly Northern Ireland went over to this permanent summer time, we have no choice but to follow. However, we should make clear why we are doing so, in face of considerable disadvantages resulting from it. The time zone under which we are operating originates on the fringes of the Eastern frontier of Russia. It must be the widest of the world's time zones. In real terms it means we shall zone ourselves about three hours earlier in the West of Ireland than the time on the eastern fringe of the Russian frontier. Therefore, we are going completely outside the normal scope of the time situation as it existed in this country. In the winter, in December and in the first part of January, we shall find it pitch dark in most parts of the country up to about 9.30 a.m.</P>
      <P>If this decision were left to ourselves and were not forced upon us by the fact that Northern Ireland, in particular, has changed I think it would be considered as probably too high an inconvenience to adopt this system. Small children of four, five and six years of age will be walking along the roads in town and country in pitch darkness in the morning trying to get to school. It will create an extremely hazardous situation. This is not a matter of the Department of Education's waiting to see how things go. The Department will have to make up its mind in advance of the situation that at least the lower classes in the primary school start at least half an hour later than at present. It is not good enough to wait until a few children are killed by lorries when crossing the road in the morning on their way to school before we take steps to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once we are on the same time scale as places as far east as Moscow, and once, in our case, the sun will rise so late in the morning, we must deal with the situation created by this question of darkness in the morning, particularly <Col N="843" /> for small children going to school. However, once our neighbours have taken this decision, we have really no way out of it ourselves.</P>

      <P>In regard to school children, I do not think the argument should be that we should change our time standard from the British and European standard simply because of that aspect of the problem. Surely it can more simply be dealt with by changing the school hours? We come up against the problem of the finishing time at school. The hours of sunlight in this country in the dead of winter are limited.</P>

      <P>With the bus services, you will find that a lot of children do not get home until four or five p.m. Nevertheless, I think a lot is to be said for a later start in the morning during the dead of winter so that the children shall not be out too early. Especially in the city, I think it would relieve the traffic pressure at the peak hour from 8 to 9 a.m. I should think it would be to the benefit not alone of <Col N="844" /> the school children but of everybody concerned that they would start a little later in the morning and finish correspondingly later in the afternoon. I hope the responsible Minister will deal with that quickly and certainly before we get into the winter of this year.</P>
      <P>In regard to the other public mentioned, the drinking public, I had expected, with previous experience on an intoxicating liquor commission, that when the summer hours were extended recently, following the British practice, there would be an outcry about it from the workers in the trade and the publicans in Dublin, particularly&mdash;but, strangely, there was not. We had the situation that the later closing hours, to 11.30 p.m., extended for quite a longer portion of the year than was envisaged at the start but this did not lead to any outcry and I think was rather generally welcomed. Now, because of subsection (2) of section 1 of this Bill, we are reverting to a situation in which the public houses will be required to close at 11 p.m. from, I think, roughly speaking, October to April every year. I think that that is probably going against the tide here. There has been a liberalisation in this direction. I have always supported the workers' viewpoint on this but I was pleasantly surprised that the accidental liberalisation in recent years did not lead to any great outcry. I am sorry, really, to see that we are reversing the trend here again.</P>

    <P>Our drinking habits in this country are bad. One of the causes of that is the enforcement of the hours, the opening and the closing hours. We have built up a situation with people who take a drink&mdash;I am one of them&mdash;that the tendency is to go to the public house one hour or half an hour before closing time, or whatever that is. On the Continent, the habit is completely different. People there go to a café, or whatever it may be, for a drink at a time which suits themselves. The closing hour here leads to the bad drinking habits of the Irish public. Therefore, I do not particularly welcome that section of the Bill which confines the later closing hour from April to October, which is going back on what it has been in recent years which, as I said, slipped in rather <Col N="845" /> accidently and which has been found to operate successfully. I am sorry to see that change.</P>

      <P>Regretfully moving away from the fascinating subject of the licensing laws and coming back to the Bill, I would say, in the first place, that I am out of sympathy from the beginning with the Bill. I can remember being completely puzzled as a child by the absurdity of human nature which has required us over 50 or 60 years to change our time rather than to change our ordinary habits in regard to the time we get up, the time we start to work and the time at which we finish work. It seemed to me as a child to be the most extraordinary topsy-turvy thing. I had difficulty in believing the reason for doing this as it seemed such a ridiculous way of tackling the problem. Now the matter is being rendered more ridiculous and we would appear to be losing daylight rather than having daylight saving. This is a confidence trick we play on ourselves and it is now being carried to a ridiculous position. We are now creating a problem which does not exist at present of schoolchildren having to get to school in hours of darkness and it is even possible that it will be at hours when the light will not be sufficient for them to work in, in certain parts of the country. I do know that the provision of light in many of our primary schools is inadequate or non-existent and this was brought out clearly in the report on Investment in Education. We are creating a problem where it does not now exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To solve the problem it would be necessary to change the school hours and to change the school hours would mean from the point of view of the teacher that he is going to lose one hour of his free time because most <Col N="846" /> teachers, like any of us, do not consider that the hours before we start work in the morning are free time. Most of us would not feel that if we got an hour in the morning, between the time we get up and the time we start work that it was as beneficial as the hour we lost in the afternoon. The position will be that the teachers will start work in the morning one hour later which will be of no advantage to them and they will finish one hour later. As I say, they are going to lose one hour of their free time most of which has to be devoted to school work such as correcting exercises and so on. We have worked ourselves into this position because of the situation we have created in regard to daylight saving and because of our desire to standardise with everyone else.</P>
    <P>The time has come when we must decide that we do not want to do everything the same as everybody else. If we achieve closer relationship with Europe, political and economic relationships, it does not follow that we must copy all that they do. We have come to the point where we cannot tolerate any divergence between ourselves and Britain. Normal divergences exist in certain countries in regard to time such as in Canada, the United States of America or the USSR where they do not consider it odd or impossible or difficult to have different times in different parts of the country. It is part of their normal life. We, however, regard any divergence between ourselves and Britain in any respect as being contrary to the law of nature. In the whole sphere of our relations with other countries we will have to call a halt to this outlook at some stage. We should not propose to standardise everything with Britain or Europe in areas in which this is not necessary or not found to be necessary.</P>
    <P>Some comments have been made about this proposal. The Director of Dunsink Observatory, Professor Weimar, has pointed out the difficulties involved. He pointed out that under this scheme whereas the sun will rise in Munich at 8.5 a.m., which I regard as a good hour for the sun to rise, in Belmullet it will not rise until 10.2 a.m., <Col N="847" /> which I consider to be a regrettable hour for the sun to rise. You cannot standardise an area as wide as that and other countries do not attempt to do it. I appreciate that people in Belmullet will not want to get up at 8 o'clock. The Minister should have some regard for his own constituency and should not be so anxious to standardise them with say the people of Bavaria but should have more regard for the people. This, as I say, is going to create a problem in regard to children but it is not the only problem. I am puzzled as to what consultations took place in regard to this proposal. The Minister in his speech outlined something about these consultations but I am not at all clear as to whom the consultations were with. He said that various interested organisations and individuals were consulted and that formal advertisements in the newspapers invited comment but we all know the kind of response that that evokes. He said that the vast majority were in favour of the proposal that we should move into line with Britain and Europe. He also said that some 130 letters were received of which about 30 were in favour. Presumably then more than 50 per cent were not in favour.</P>
    <P>Did the Minister, or the relevant Government Department consult with the managerial bodies and teaching organisations? Did they express a view in favour of this proposal or was it put to them that this would require a change in school hours and did they accept this? We are entitled to this information and to hear more about this. After the matter was raised in the Dáil the Minister changed his speech somewhat and he inserted words to the effect that if experience showed this to be a problem consideration would be given in regard to making some changes in the school hours although there might be difficulties. This, of course, means that something will be done in about five years time. We know that Deputy Lemass when he was Taoiseach said that it would be very difficult to produce a full economic programme and <Col N="848" /> now we are having the third such programme so that, perhaps there will be a five-year time lag in this case also.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what consultations took place, what were the reactions and if the need for this change has been accepted by the bodies consulted. I cannot accept that it has. Has this point been put to the Department of Education? There was a suggestion in the Minister's Dáil speech that this matter was not adequately considered and even at this stage he has apparently done nothing more than consult other civil servants. If I am wrong in what I am saying I am wasting the time of the House and the best thing is to let the Minister answer my questions.</P>

      <P>The Senator raises a very good point which the Minister will be able to answer. What investigations has he carried out in regard to northern Ireland and what happened there? It is a fair question although the north of Ireland does not go as far west as we do and, therefore, the problem is somewhat less marginally acute. In any event, the problem has not risen there yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As it has not yet been operated in the north of Ireland it is very difficult to know about it. I hope the Minister will enlighten the House about the position in the north of Ireland. I should also like to ask the Minister what consultations he had with the Department of Industry and Commerce in regard to the impact of this on industrial costs in so far as this will <Col N="849" /> involve factories in an additional period of working in the dark, involving extra lighting and possibly extra heating. What is the assessment of the cost of this to industry first of all, and then to the community as a whole? What economic evaluation has been made of the cost? Has the Department of Finance offered any views in relation to the cost that will be imposed on the community? Is it suggested there will be some offsetting saving at the other end of the day? I do not see that there would be even on the basis of our present working hours.</P>
      <P>For industry working on a shift basis this will involve additional costs in the morning with no offsetting saving in those costs in the evening. Perhaps I am wrong. I shall be glad to have some information from the Minister as to what economic assessment has been carried out of the cost to the community before arriving at this decision. What is the reaction of the Electricity Supply Board towards this aggravation of the morning peak load, which could be quite serious, because the morning peak is already quite high. Though I cannot remember at the moment the precise level of the peak period, I wonder if this will carry any dangerous implications from the point of view of the total volume of electricity consumed in the mornings on the network through which electricity has to be geared. What consultation took place with the Electricity Supply Board? These are questions which deserve answers and I am surprised the Minister offered us no enlightenment on these. He has given us no indication of any contrary points of view or contrary conclusions reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I would hope that the debate we have just had on this subject will be reported because it is disturbing that in not one newspaper report of the debate in the Dáil was the question of the schools referred to. Indeed, the only thing that attracted the attention of the Press was the question of licensing hours. In reporting this debate I hope the newspapers will advert to the other issues raised, particularly the <Col N="850" /> education issue, which is, I think, an important one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the advertisements in the newspapers inviting views on this issue there were a number of newspaper articles on the matter. It was certainly brought to the attention of the public. I have a long list here of different organisations which thought it worth their while to communicate with us. All of these were in favour of the change: Aer Lingus, the Association of Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, Ballyconnell and District Development Company Limited, Balymoe, Galway Branch ICA, Bray Area Road Safety Committee, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, Gaeltarra Éireann, Kiltoghert Co-Operative Society, Limerick Employers' Federation, the Federated Union of Employers, the Federation of Builders, Contractors and Allied Employers of Ireland, the Federation of Trade Associations, the Irish Dental Association, RTE, Wicklow and District Chamber of Commerce etc. A quite formidable body of organisations, representing practically every aspect of professional and industrial life in the country, expressed the view that we should adopt the new system. Against the proposal were Clare County Council and Limerick branch of the NFA. I have no doubt that the Limerick branch of the NFA will continue to follow whatever time suits them. There is nothing to compel them to milk their cows at any particular hour.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make inquiries as to that. I want to assure Senator Murphy that the licensing section is included in order to preserve the <i>status quo.</i> This section was put in for the purpose of keeping the licensing laws as they are pending the introduction of a new licensing Bill. I did <Col N="852" /> inform the licensing trade that I had no intention of making any change under this Bill in the licensing hours. That is a matter we will have to consider under a separate Bill. I do not think it is desirable that we should have a discussion on the licensing hours on a Bill of this kind.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley, I think, misread the section because this Bill does not extend the hours in any way. He talked about children having to go out earlier while, at the same time, further time was being allowed to, as he termed them, the drinking classes. No further time is being given to them.</P>
      <P>The only real fears that were expressed were expressed in relation to children. That was the case in the other House also. One aspect of this is that, as far as teenage girls are concerned, there will be an advantage&mdash; this view was expressed by the Department of Education&mdash;in that they will be getting home in daylight and they will be safer from molestation. As far as the tiny tots are concerned, I share the view expressed by some Senators here but this is really not a question for this Bill. I should like to point out to the House that the fixing of school hours is a question for the Minister for Education, for the parents and for those concerned. When this Bill becomes law there is, as far as I know, except whatever problems may be thrown up in the organisation of the job, nothing to prevent any change that is thought desirable for children of tender years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The present hours are not really fixed in relation to the law. I am not quite sure what the present school hours are. I can only say that in so far as teachers' organisations are concerned, we did not receive any objection from them in connection with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Did you ask for their views?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>They are an intelligent body of people and when all these that I have read out felt that they should <Col N="853" /> express a view, I am quite sure that if the INTO felt that they should express a view they would have sent it to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister misses the point. Perhaps I should explain. The first suggestion that has been made in public that school hours may have to be changed is today in the Minister's Second Reading speech. If the teachers' organisations were not specifically consulted and alerted to that possibility how could they be expected to express views on something which had not been suggested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It was suggested in the Dáil. Deputy Byrne made the point that he was concerned, not about the bigger children but about very small children. It is not today or yesterday that I have heard this topic debated, and the desirability of having later hours for small children. Let me say in passing that in the initial educational establishment that was taking the cobwebs off my brains when I was a very small boy, I had to travel a long way to school carrying two sods of turf under my arm. In these days there are buses and transport and a completely different organisation, and rightly so, to cater for young people and they are not subject to the same hardship as was the position 30 to 40 years ago. I am quite sure that this is a question to be settled between the bodies concerned and that this Bill will not prevent the teachers' organisations and the Department of Education from coming to an agreement between themselves if they decide that it is necessary to change the hours for the very small children coming to school for whom, it has been suggested, the change in time may create some problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill was sent to the Department of Education for consideration and I have no doubt that, like every other measure, they considered it fully in so far as it affected their position. Whether they had consultation with the INTO or not I could not tell. All I can say is that the official view expressed to me from that Department was that they felt that the change to the new standard time would, on the <Col N="854" /> whole, be beneficial. For one thing they felt that there would be more time for play in daylight hours for children. Concern has been expressed by the Senator here. If there is a problem with the small children referred to here and in the Dáil, there is no reason why such a problem cannot be solved by those concerned. Certainly, this Bill will not stop any change being made in school hours should such a procedure be felt desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether so many parents do agree with the view expressed by the Senator or by the Deputy who expressed the view in the Dáil. I say that if there is a volume of such opinion, there is nothing to stop these changes being made.</P>
      <P>I pointed out, as some Senator did, of course, that the north of Ireland will be on this time; the British will be on this; Western European countries will be on this, with the exception of Iceland. The volume of opinion in business circles throughout the country has been overwhelmingly in favour of adopting this measure. They, at all events, are quite sure what they want. So, in so far as we could ascertain public opinion on this issue, it has been overwhelmingly in favour of bringing in this measure and it is for that reason that I am asking the House to accept it.</P>
