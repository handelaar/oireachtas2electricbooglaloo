    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran) Michael Moran">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide salary increases for the various branches of the judiciary. The Bill proposes to increase, with effect from 1st April this year, the salary of the Chief Justice from £6,360 to £8,000; that of Judges of the Supreme Court from £4,950 to £7,000; that of Judges of the High Court from £4,400 to £6,000; that of Judges of the Circuit Court from £3,640 to £5,000; that of the President of the District Court from £3,190 to £4,500; and that of Metropolitan and provincial District Justices from £2,690 and £2,520, respectively, to a new flat rate of £3,750.</P>
      <P>Before deciding on the new salaries to be provided for in this measure, the Government gave long and careful consideration to the general level of judicial remuneration. The nature of the duties entrusted to judges, and a number of other factors, make it impossible, or at least very difficult, to equate them in the matter of pay with any other group in the public service, and the Government accepted the need for a broad approach to the question and for a fundamental re-assessment. I am satisfied that the salaries now proposed are fair and reasonable and are necessary to reflect adequately, in current circumstances, the status which our judges should have in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the capacity and suitability of our judges is <Col N="619" /> of vital importance in the administration of justice. It follows that the level of judicial salaries should be such as will ensure that the widest possible field of selection is open to the Government. Experience over recent years shows that the present salaries, which were last revised over four years ago, are decidedly unattractive to potential appointees, and that in itself would be sufficient justification for the salaries proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, mention one point in relation to the salaries now proposed for Circuit Judges and Justices of the District Court. The Government will shortly consider proposals to raise the level of jurisdiction of these two courts, and I expect that the necessary legislative proposals will be introduced fairly soon. As judicial salaries are increased infrequently, the Government have taken the impending increases in jurisdiction into account in deciding on the new salaries for Circuit Judges and District Justices.</P>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill also involve the abolition of the differentiation which has existed up to now between the salaries of Dublin MetroPolitan District Justices and the Cork City Justice, on the one hand, and all the other district justices on the other hand. This discrimination is more or less a survival from an earlier era when what was called &ldquo;provincial differentiation&rdquo; operated in other services.It has no merit in the eyes of the Government, and I am personally gratified to be associated with the abolition of it so far as the district court is concerned. The proposal for a common pay rate for all district justices no matter where they serve, has the support of the District Justices' Association, which is representative of all the justices. Common pay will make for greater mobility by facilitating transfers, and will thus contribute to greater efficiency.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of the efficiency in the district court, I may also mention that, with Government approval, arrangements will be made for a general close-down of sittings during the month of August next year and thereafter. Adequate provision will, <Col N="620" /> of course, be made, by way of &ldquo;vacation&rdquo; sittings in each district, to cater for criminal cases and especially custody cases.</P>
    <P>The closing-down of the district court for a month during the vacation period will facilitate the public generally and also improve the efficiency of that court. August, especially the first two or three weeks, is a holiday period, and it suits neither litigants, nor defendants in summary cases, nor their legal representatives, that their holiday plans should be interfered with by the necessity to attend court during August. This is proved by large-scale requests for adjournments. The professional bodies concerned are in favour of the August close-down, which will also facilitate the taking of annual leave by district justices, and at the same time ensure the holding of scheduled sittings throughout the year.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains a provision that any future increase in judicial salaries may be granted by Government order, instead of by Act of the Oireachtas as heretofore. It will, however, be necessary for the Government to lay before the Dáil a draft of any such order, and if the Dáil disapproves of the draft order within twenty-one sitting days, the order shall not be made. In this way, reasonable provision is being made for parliamentary control.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt but that this change is highly desirable. It will avoid the various formalities and delays which go with the preparation of a Bill. By substituting a Dáil debate on a motion, should a motion be tabled, for the various stages which a Bill has to go through, the proposal will make the time of Parliament available for more fundamental and more complex issues. There is no reason why judicial salaries should not be dealt with by Government order, subject to Dáil control as I have indicated, and I am satisfied that the new arrangement represents a business-like approach.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before proceeding with the Bill, I should like to welcome the Minister for Justice to the House on the first occasion on which he has <Col N="621" /> come here of his own volition. I should like to take the opportunity of welcoming him to the Seanad and to express the hope that his period as Minister for Justice will be a fruitful and successful one. The Minister has great experience in the pursuit of law and I hope the bringing to bear of this rich experience will be of great benefit to the country, to the courts and to all associated with the administration of justice.</P>
      <P>I want to say that we in Fine Gael support this Bill to increase the salaries of the judiciary. Judges are not in a position where they can themselves advocate increases in their salaries or improvements in their conditions of service. In determining the salaries of judges, we should err on the side of generosity rather than of meanness. There are many things from which the members of the judiciary suffer and very often have to suffer in silence. I am particularly glad to see that the increases which are being given to the district court are going to be of such a nature as will raise the salaries of all district justices and give the same salary to all no matter where they may be employed.</P>
      <P>There has been some criticism of the increases to the judiciary but it is well to point out some of the factors involved.The members of the judiciary are precluded by the Constitution from holding any other office or position of emolument. They cannot, unlike many other citizens, be a director of a company or do any of those other things to increase their income which nearly every other member of the community can do. It is right that at all stages we should err on the side of generosity rather than of meanness in seeing to it that in the discharge of their duties they do not want and also to see to it that all members of the judiciary are above temptation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes people think that judges are not all that they should be&mdash;that they are not fair. The plain truth of the matter is&mdash;and all of us who practise in the courts of justice every day know this&mdash;that half of us must all the time lose the cases we are engaged in but the view of all of us is, and it is widely accepted by all, that our judges are what judges should be <Col N="622" /> in every respect, impartial and independent and concerned only with the administration of justice according to the law. Very often the law seems unjust. Judges often have to remark that they wished the decision could be different but that they are bound by the law. That happens not infrequently and judges oftentimes make that remark but it sometimes leads to the impression that judges are not being fair. We can thank God that we have a judiciary which is in every respect what everybody would want it to be.</P>
    <P>It is also right to point out that the judges are frequently available and made use of for the purpose of discharging important public business. In this country we have not got a wealthy aristocracy but we have an intellectual aristocracy. Only recently we have been discussing the Report of the Commission on Higher Education, a most excellent document. The chairman of that Committee was the Chief Justice and the amount of time he must have spent on that work outside his ordinary working hours must have been very substantial. The amount of day to day work that had to be done in between sittings of the Commission was exacting and time-consuming. One can think also of the Landlord and Tenant Commission which is almost in constant session and which is presided over by Judge Conroy&mdash;he has almost made this subject his own; and the Mental Health Commission, which was also presided over by a High Court Judge; and the Itinerants Commission, which was presided over by a Judge of the Supreme Court. The Commission whose Report laid the basis for the establishment of a television service in this country was also headed by an eminent High Court Judge. The Bankruptcy Committee is also headed by a judge. And there are many others.</P>
    <P>Because we have not in this country an élite class or an aristocracy with inherited wealth we have to find people who will command the respect and confidence of the public to do these important jobs. When we pay our judiciary the salaries we do we ought to bear in mind that they are all rendering and ready to render public service outside the scope of their judicial duties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="623" /> In addition, it is well to remember that judges are not completely bound by rules and regulations where they can avoid them. In recent times, in the last ten years or, perhaps, more but especially in the last five to six years the work of reform in the courts has been progressing at all levels and the amount of time which is now saved, and which is not lost because of this reform, is very considerable. It is quite true to say that the number of actions being disposed of by the High Court now as compared with ten years ago is vastly increased and that is because of a new arrangement made with regard to jury actions. Equally so, it is true to say that the number of actions on the non-jury list and on the Chancery side now being heard has also changed because of arrangements made by the President of the High Court to assign judges on the jury side to deal with non-jury lists and Chancery lists.</P>
    <P>In relation to the actual rules of court, the rules which have been recently revised have contributed a great deal to the speeding up of procedures and the elimination of wasteful processes. A great deal of work still requires to be done in that field and it will fall into the domain of the members of the judiciary to spearhead the work of reform in that area together with the members of the two branches of the legal profession and other interests such as the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>In relation to the district court justices who are now getting a fairer deal under this Bill, it is right and proper to have regard to the great body of law which they are called upon to administer. They are, as always, subject to the supervisory regulation of the High Court by way of cases stated on appeal from their various decisions, certiorari to certiorari and so on. Because of that supervisory power which is exercisable by the High Court, district justices who administer justice in a summary manner have a great responsibility and the number of cases which fall to be taken on appeal to the Circuit Court or to the High Court is very small relative to the very large <Col N="624" /> number of cases that come before the district court.</P>
    <P>One of the most valuable reforms that has occurred in recent times in the district court has been the appointment of a President of the District Court. As a result of his appointment the work of the Dublin Metropolitan District Court has improved considerably and instead of having every case listed for 10.30 in the morning a new procedure has been introduced by having cases listed for different hours&mdash;10.30, 11.30, 12.30, 2 o'clock and 3 o'clock so that people are not wasting time waiting around for a case to be called. Other district justices might well consider adopting&mdash; and be exhorted by the appropriate authorities to adopt&mdash;that kind of facility for the public and litigants who attend the courts.</P>
    <P>I gather that in the district court at the present time, and I rather think it comes about through the work and energy of the President of the District Court who was appointed for this and many other purposes, that new and revised regulations and rules relating to the District Court together with an appendix of forms used in the District Court will be issued shortly. It will I understand be a substantial volume when completed but it will undoubtedly assist in the speedy and more effective administration of the work of the District Court and will be of the greatest benefit to everyone associated with that Court.</P>
    <P>I want to advocate one thing on behalf of our district courts and circuit courts. It is something the Minister for Justice will be well aware of. We have a Factories Act dealing with the conditions of employment, the physical conditions of employment of our factory workers, introduced in 1955. There was, of course, earlier law which this Act replaced. We have an Office Premises Act of 1958 or 1959 to deal with office premises for office workers but there is no law requiring any standard of hygiene, of cleanliness, of heating or of lighting for district and circuit courts in this country. Every Member of the Seanad will know well what I am talking about. The places where District Justices and Circuit <Col N="625" /> Court Judges have to sit and where citizens are obliged to come on witnesses' summons are nothing short of a disgrace. Nobody can justify the condition of these premises for an instant and it all arises because of the old now long-forgotten procedure whereby the old Grand Jury were required to provide courthouses for the Grand Jury and they had such things as Grand Jury cess and a whole lot of terms now obsolete and which we do not understand to raise the money for the building, equipment and maintenance of these buildings. That system taken over by our county councils is completely out of date and the district and circuit courts around the country are in a shocking and disgraceful condition, not alone for the judges but for members of the public as well. It is correct to say that there are many of them which have no kind of sanitary convenience for the justices or for members of the public.</P>
    <P>This is a shocking state of affairs. We would not allow a dance hall without sanitary convenience. We would not allow a marquee for dancing without having proper sanitary accommodation.One reads from time to time of district justices sitting in out of the way places administering justice in badly heated, badly lighted and badly ventilated courthouses, and there will be perhaps a paragraph about it in the <i>Evening Herald</i> or the <i>Evening Press.</i> The Minister will probably say that there is a section in his Department which are planning to deal with this state of affairs. Unless and until the provision of courthouses, however they will be provided, by way of letting rooms in some hotel or decent hall, becomes the responsibility of the State and not of the local authority we will not have appropriate places in which to request particularly justices of the district court to sit and members of the public to attend to have their affairs discharged or dealt with.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Minister, knowing full well as he does the kind of courthouse there is in Achill or Belmullet and other places like these will take energetic steps to rectify that position beginning, perhaps, with County Mayo.</P>
    <P>Apart from these observations I <Col N="626" /> have only this final matter to say about the Bill. While it is a good thing that the Constitution provides that salaries of judges of all courts shall be a charge on the Central Fund and that they cannot be open to reduction during the term of office of any particular judge, I do not like the provisions of this Bill&mdash;I am sure Members of the House will share my dislike&mdash;which provides that in the future the salaries of judges will be adjusted by order of the Government. Down to that point I do not mind it, but the order of the Government will be laid in draft only before Dáil Éireann; and Seanad Éireann will no longer come into the picture. I consider that to be a regrettable departure from what has been done up to the present time and I hope that the Minister should consider accepting a recommendation to enable this draft order, like others, to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I cannot see, at any time, any difficulties arising from laying such orders before Seanad Éireann. It is right and proper that the Seanad should be given, periodically, the limited opportunity it has of commenting on the administration of justice and the manner in which we treat our judges and, perhaps, the manner in which our judges treat us. After the passing of this Bill, if it is passed in its present form, the Seanad will have said goodbye to everything pertaining to judicial offices for all time. I am sure the Seanad will not be happy if that is to be the position and I hope the Minister will find it possible to accept a recommendation to this Bill, in due course, to enable these orders to be laid in draft not only before the Dáil but before this House as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can welcome the principles contained in the Bill because we appreciate the necessity for an independent judiciary and the important part it plays in every independent State. We can welcome also the fact that the differential has been abolished between Dublin and country district justices. These are all progressive steps. The salaries proposed, though they look high in our context, are only in line with what <Col N="627" /> good-class men can earn in the legal profession otherwise.</P>
      <P>However, the timing of the Bill is unfortunate. It comes at a time when there is talk of increasing the power and the scope of the work of the circuit and district courts. It is a pity this legislation did not precede this Bill so that we could have seen what the new powers will be. Many of us have rather strong views on this. We consider there is a great need for increasing the power of these courts so that as many cases as possible should be kept at the lowest level possible. That is all very well but the country would be happier voting these new salaries if the people had seen the scheme for the fuller utilisation of the lower courts.</P>
      <P>The country would be much happier also in the present circumstances, in which an effort is being made to give equality of opportunity to all. That is really what marks the present decade, the feeling of equality of opportunity. It is wrong, then, that in the middle of this feeling of equality that we have the most worthwhile, most influential and most respected positions in the State&mdash;the various ranks of the judiciary&mdash;still remaining under political patronage. That is to be deplored and if this is the last time this House will have an opportunity of speaking on judicial salaries it is well that a call should go out from this House, as a matter of urgency, for the creation of an impartial appointments commission to be responsible for judicial appointments.</P>
      <P>It is wrong in respect of these highest offices in the land, whose occupants are expected to be well above Party politics, to think that the only avenue into these posts is through political patronage. On behalf of the graduates of the university which I represent, I say that we should feel lacking in our duty if we did not voice our condemnation of the present system of judicial appointment and call for the setting up of an impartial independent commission to make such appointments. Other important appointments in the community, like those of county and city managers, county engineers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very relevant because I should feel happier if we could show the public that there is a new period coming in which no longer will the public, when an appointment becomes imminent, sadly shake their heads and say: &ldquo;He was in the right political Party&rdquo;. No longer would we have the spectacle of lawyers already on their marks like athletes waiting for their Party to get to power in order to get their turn at the spoils. That is not proper and I call on behalf of the graduates of my university&mdash;I am sure those of Trinity College will endorse the call&mdash;to put an end to this system of political patronage and to appoint a proper impartial commission to appoint our judges.</P>
      <P>In doing so, I must pay the tribute to the present judiciary that, despite coming up from the Party platform, as it were, they at all times have done their utmost to administer impartial justice. That is as it should be and we welcome it. It is an asset we should prize, an asset we cannot take for granted unless we improve our system of appointment. Our judiciary members sit at the apex in a trinity. On the left should be a good Civil Service&mdash;I do not know whether Senator Sheehy Skeffington will agree with the position &mdash;in the centre a live and virile Parliament with an adequate committee system appropriate to the 20th century and not based on a 19th century model, and at the right an active and informed system of vocational organisations in which each recognises its part; and then, over and above these, should be an independent judiciary to ensure that justice is done to all.</P>

It is the first order I can remember that has been treated in this way and during the Committee Stage the Seanad will fight hard to ensure this is amended. Indeed, on every previous Bill increasing judicial salaries we in the Seanad called for some alternative provision to enact. Here we welcome the Bill but it is one which we hope to have amended. At the same time, one wonders why the Bill has been introduced at the beginning of a round of wage increases for all groups. Why has the Bill been introduced at the beginning of a wage round rather than the end?</P>

      <P>There were a few items which I wanted to raise. I felt that they would, perhaps, be out of order but, in fact, they have already been raised. I welcome the fact that there is an element of productivity in these increases but the Minister did not fully explain it. He has talked about lifting the jurisdiction of the circuit judges and the district justices in the near future. I do not know what is meant exactly by this, but if it is simply lifting the jurisdiction by way of the money involved, in other words, taking account of the change in the value of money, this does not seem to be of very great importance. Let me confess right away, and the Minister appreciates this already, that I am not an expert in anything about the legal profession and my approach must be by way of that of a layman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the second criticism, and this is the apparent <Col N="630" /> slowness of the courts. I have again and again met instances in my own trade union work where getting involved in a court action meant that you were probably tied up for two or three years before the matter was finally disposed of. Senator O'Quigley has said that better arrangments have been made recently. I have no experience of them but I hope that this is the case, because I have often felt that it brings the law into some disrepute when you find that you cannot have a matter disposed of. People generally get fed up with the whole legal process. I hope that this has been changed and that when the law has to take its course it will be at least reasonably quick. I do not know whether the extent of the vacations in the legal profession may to some extent affect these delays. In the little experience I had I have found sometimes that, well, it was not on the list for this term and it may be on the list in six months time, and there is probably six weeks or a month or so holiday in between&mdash; and we are not talking about the August holiday in this respect.</P>
    <P>It may be said, of course, that the Houses of the Oireachtas have pretty long holidays as well, but I do not think anybody would imagine that when a Deputy particularly finishes in the Dáil, say at the end of July, he is free then from any responsibility or work in the political field until the following October. We know that this is not the case. I do not know whether the judges are swotting up in between times when they have their vacation, but it seems to me that we have inherited this sort of system when the law was slow and possibly we did not have litigation to the same extent. We have not in the main made real efforts to improve productivity&mdash;a terrible word to use in regard to the law&mdash;I am afraid, and in regard to our legal processes.</P>
    <P>I wanted to mention also the question of the appointment of judges. The Labour Party is not happy about this situation. I do not think that the public generally are happy about the same situation. In the United States of which both Senators Quinlan and <Col N="631" /> Ó Maoláin are admirers, in agreement on something, when there is a change of Presidency I believe that they change from judges down to the postmen.</P>

There should be an all-Party agreement on evolving a better and more satisfactory system that would be more acceptable to the general public, and I think to the profession itself, than the present arrangement. We have all met the situation in by-elections where you have people from the legal profession, and, with respect to my colleagues here, you feel that some of them have made a choice of which Party is likely to be in office in five or six years time when they would like to have a judgeship and their political convictions then go to that Party and you will find them making speeches, when the real aim is the eventual appointment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say, as has already been mentioned, that I am not happy, nor are many people happy, about the situation. I accept the Minister's point that the salaries may be at such a level at the moment that they are not attractive for the best qualified people with the most learning in the legal profession. I have met such instances, of people who are obviously very successful as barristers and senior counsel, and you often wonder why they do not change to the High Court or whatever it should be, and the answer, of course, is that economically <Col N="632" /> It would not pay them. It seems to me with due respect to everybody concerned that it must then follow that you do not get people of the highest level&mdash;in other words, you do not have the best qualified people to take these jobs. That is not a good situation.</P>
    <P>The courts around the country have been mentioned. The only experience I have had of this&mdash;some of my colleagues have had the same experience&mdash;is that these places also tend to be the establishments where the county councils meet, and we sometimes knock into one another during an election campaign, and to me they are horrible places. In these years when we are building such sumptuous office buildings in the city of Dublin surely as civilised people we should do something about our courts. They bring the whole judicial process into disrespect and the judges, I know, have been complaining. There is something here of an association for them. If this is a properly constituted trade union I would not be surprised if we had a strike some time because of the deplorable working conditions they have.</P>
    <P>It probably is not relevant to this Bill but as it has already been mentioned may I add my plea to that of other Senators to the Minister that something should be done urgently for some general programme in regard to improvements of the courts throughout the country?</P>

      <P>In common with the previous speakers I welcome the Bill and its provisions. However, I might make a somewhat different distinction of the arms of State, so to speak, from that outlined by Senator Quinlan. I think there is a clear constitutional division which operates both in this and other States between the Executive, and here I think Senator FitzGerald will be happy that they are really included, the Legislature, which is Parliament, and, of course, the judiciary. Those are the organs of the State as such&mdash;Parliament which, in fact, passes the legislation, the Government which puts it into effect and the judiciary who apply and interpret the laws made by Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="633" /> Each of those three have a constitutional position, a vital constitutional position to fulfil and I think any discussion with regard to the judiciary and their functions here should be in the light of their established constitutional position. They are all protected in their office from removal except by a joint resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas so it is vitally important that those men who are appointed should be of the highest calibre and should implement the responsibility which is given to them under the Constitution. I should like to say immediately, as a member of the profession who practises before those judges, that I think, as Senator O'Quigley has indicated, that we are utterly fortunate to have a judiciary of such high and independent ability and calibre.</P>

      <P>More about that in a moment. Senator Quinlan may be a little misinformed on the political background of some recent judicial appointments. I do not want to go into any recent case. Anybody who has had any experience in recent times particularly of testing what I might call constitutional cases before the court will say that the Constitution and the law have been upheld without any regard whatsoever to anything but the absolute legal position, that the judges who interpret those laws do not under any circumstances consider whether or not their decisions would be favourable or unfavourable to that Government which appointed them.</P>

      <P>There is a suggestion that those men are appointed on the basis of political patronage. If the basis of their appointment is wrong then surely the method of operation might also be wrong. I am merely indicating in the first instance that from the point of view of the independence and the high standards applied what Senator Quinlan says is certainly not true. Somebody, of course, must accept responsibility for appointing judges. Unless and until <Col N="634" /> lawyers are precluded in their profession from taking any activity in our political life&mdash;I think history is against Senator Quinlan or anyone else who proposes this&mdash;inevitably lawyers will have an active political interest and even have active political affiliation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The responsibility for making these important appointments cannot be really delegated to any commission or other body but a sanctioned body of the Constitution. There is no other suitable body than the Government to do this job. This is a matter which has been considered many times. I should like to say on this point that I have personal views on the method of appointment as well. This matter was considered by a former Taoiseach, Deputy J. A. Costello, who is a very eminent member of the legal profession. The same suggestions were made in his time and I understand the Government at that time, and on this I am not quoting him, considered some such appointments bureau as Senator Quinlan indicated. As soon as they did they had representations through every single channel who would have consideration given in favour of A, B or C, as the case might be, so, irrespective of the appointments made, you will always have the suggestion that it was done for the wrong reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Senator Quinlan looks over recent appointments to the Supreme Court, the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court, in respect of which he says that the only avenue through which appointments were made was on the basis of political patronage I <Col N="635" /> would have to tell him (a) he does not know the actual case or (b) that it was patronage of the wrong Party because some of the very highest standing are not known to be supporters of the Government Party. While there will always be doubt, because of human nature, it is wrong that we should engage in this same kind of speculation here. I would like to put that on record and Senator Quinlan can have an opportunity of correcting me if I am wrong.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Government to continue in this tradition of appointing people who are by far the best suited for this high authority. After having said that much I want to say it is very important, and I am glad the House has taken the view so far, that this is very desirable. Senator Murphy seems to be under the impression that it is necessary to pay those increased salaries to get the very best men. There may be a certain element of truth in this but I do not think people should go away with the impression that barristers are earning salaries greater than in line with their appointments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not referring to a young slip of a lad like myself or my colleague Senator O'Quigley but at any level in the legal profession few would be earning that money. If they do they have gone through a long number of years with very poor earnings and a very small income which cannot be compared with other professions at all. The main reason why those salaries should be applied is so that the judges will be allowed to remain as independent as they have always been, and as I am sure they would be even if such increases were never allowed. It is important that the public should be aware of the fact that the judiciary have a right to be financially independent and that no effort of any sort will be made under any circumstances to influence them in any particular issue. I think, generally speaking, <Col N="636" /> the public are fully aware of that and so that the judges will be allowed to continue in that position this Bill is desirable because other countries have seen many attempts to interfere with the independence of the judiciary and, human nature being what it is, I suppose financial inducement is one of the first ones that would be offered. I feel, in fairness to our judges, that we should ensure that any such inducement would not even be considered by the public.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that he intends to increase the jurisdiction of the district courts and the circuit courts and we will have an opportunity of discussing this matter later on. I only wish to say that such a change is very desirable and will serve two very valuable purposes. It will serve to decentralise the law so that it will be more readily available to all parts of the community. Cases that up to now could only be dealt with in the High Court will be available to be dealt with in the circuit court and the district court will be available to deal with others which are now dealt with by the circuit court. This will mean a substantial saving in costs and expenses and will have a desirable effect all round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to join with the Senators who have expressed concern at the conditions of our courtrooms. If we had the necessary respect for our public buildings we would so arrange that they would be properly maintained. Apart altogether from our respect for public buildings, if we had respect for the health of litigants, witnesses or the court itself we would have long ago pulled down many of them and constructed more modern and serviceable buildings. I have heard hardy farmers, who think that lawyers are a soft race of men, complaining of standing around for an hour or so in the cold. I have heard them complain of the waiting and discomfort of attendance at many of these courts. If these hardiest of our citizens find an hour or an hour and a half in these courtrooms an intolerable burden we should surely consider the men on the bench who have to sit there from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. three, four or five days a week. <Col N="637" /> The general feeling in the House in this matter should encourage the Minister to take early steps to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>I will join with Senator O'Quigley in suggesting to the Minister that he should give the House an opportunity of considering the matter when orders are made and laid before us in relation to the salaries of the judiciary in future years. It is proposed in the Bill, whether by omission or deliberately, to confine the laying of these orders before the Dáil but I think that both Houses should have an opportunity of considering them. It would give us the opportunity, at least once every decade, of reviewing the system of appointments and I hope that on such future occasions Senator Quinlan will be satisfied that they have been properly made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing appointments and judges' salaries at this high level there is always the danger that egalitarianism of a certain kind will raise its head and that criticism will be levelled at these appointments and salaries because they are at a high level. This has not been the case in this debate up to the present and I hope that it will not be the case when the debate continues. The quality of our judiciary at every level is of the greatest importance both to the litigants and those who present their cases but when wide national issues of a constitutional character are at stake it is important that we should have the best legal brains in the country both to present the case and to adjudicate upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has been made of the defects of the present system of appointment and this is a matter that concerns all of us. It has been stated that previous methods to obtain a better or alternative system have failed but I am convinced that it is a problem that can be overcome. The fact that other efforts to find a solution to it have collapsed should not deter the Government from continuing the effort to find an alternative method. Such a method would be the setting up of a group of people to recommend an appointment consisting of the Chief Justice, some representative of the Bar and some representative of the public <Col N="638" /> interest. These could recommend to the Government. The appointment must be made by the Government and it would be open to them to reject a recommendation as long as this was done publicly and not privately.</P>
    <P>It is important that this problem should be got over because it is bad that at this high level political patronage should be seen to operate. Political patronage has been removed from many aspects of Irish life. That was done by the first Government when it set up the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission.The instances in which it still applies are relatively few and mostly at the lower level but it still applies at this most important level. If it is seen to operate at this high level it leads the public to believe that in these important appointments political considerations are all that matter. The fact is that while many appointments to the courts have been first class there have been some that are not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the system of appointment. The method of appointment is one which has not been based on the high qualifications but it has also been the case that those who have been appointed have shown themselves able to rise above political considerations. In this country we have not had cases of political judges making political decisions.However that may be, I think the case that has been made for a change in the method of appointment is a valid one and one that should be faced up to. Senator O'Kennedy sought to counteract this offence by stating that appointments had been made contrary to political affiliations. In one notable instance recently this has been the case but I am not aware that it has been the case in more than one appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Kennedy does not admit that there has been an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It does appear so to some people. Senator <Col N="639" /> O'Kennedy mentioned cases where political boundaries had been crossed. I am only aware of this happening in one particular instance at the highest level. It may have happened at the lower levels but I think that to get a solution of this problem it is necessary to get away from the traditional method of appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the salaries, the Minister might have pointed out more clearly the extent to which judicial salaries have fallen behind salaries of other groups. I will not suggest that all salaries go up hand in hand over the years regardless of the nature of the work done and of the nature of the salaries in question. Certainly there must be a narrowing of differentials at every level of our society and, therefore, the fact that some salaries at a higher level have risen less rapidly than salaries at a lower level is not something which is <i>prima facie</i> objectionable.It is fair to comment in this instance that the rate at which these salaries have risen does not bear any reasonable relationship with the increases now proposed and does not bear any reasonable relationship with the comparable increases for other people, whether they be civil servants or politicians. It is my information, and the Minister can correct me if I am wrong, that a Supreme Court Judge's salary before the war was £3,000. It is now £4,950 and it is proposed to make it £7,000. When this legislation is put through, the salary of a Supreme Court Judge will be two and one-third times that which it was before the war. The cost of living has increased three and a half times during this period. Therefore, the purchasing power of the Supreme Court Judge's salary which before tax is today less than half of what it was before the war will, through this generous legislation, be raised to the point where its purchasing power before tax will be only one-third less than it was before the war. If one allows for tax &mdash;which I do not think we should do but people make that comparison&mdash; even after this legislation his purchasing power, after tax will be little more than one-half of what it was before the war. This contrasts markedly with <Col N="640" /> what has happened in other areas. It contrasts with the Civil Service where the remuneration of the higher posts has increased more than <i>pro rata</i> with the cost of living over this period, so that the people concerned are better off. The civil servants on whose advice the Minister is acting in regard to this legislation have clearly made recommendations in respect of their own positions which are substantially more generous than those in respect of the judiciary.</P>
    <P>The Minister's salary which before the war was £1,500 will follow on and legislation currently being put speedily through the Houses of the Oireachtas will give him a salary of more than four times that which it was before the war thereby giving Ministers some small purchasing power increase on their salaries before tax, though they may be worse after tax. The contrast is marked. Before the war a Supreme Court Judge had twice as much as a Minister had. He will now have one-sixth more than a Minister. I should like to hear the Minister's defence on this different treatment of different groups. I should like to hear how the case was put to him, so convincingly apparently, that the judiciary should be singled out for treatment different from people at the same, or approximately the same, levels.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest for a moment that their salaries should be raised <i>pro rata</i> with those of industrial workers, or clerical workers, but I am not clear as to why different treatment should be meted out to them different from people at similar levels in the public service and people in political life. Perhaps the Minister could explain the reasons. There may be reasons but when such discriminatory arrangements are proposed we are at least entitled to know the reasons for them.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know why this legislation has been so drastically proposed to narrow the gap between the Chief Justice and that of other judges of the Supreme Court. There is a difference at present of £1,410 between these two. If they are increased <i>pro rata</i> it will become a difference of £2,000. The Chief Justice should have £2,000 more than a judge of the Supreme <Col N="641" /> Court. Instead it is being cut to £1,000. The Chief Justice's increase is much less than that of any other judge. We ought to be told the reason for selecting the Chief Justice's office and treating it differently.</P>
    <P>In other cases the increases range from 36 to 49 per cent; that is, in the case of provincial district justices. For the Chief Justice, however, the increase is 26 per cent, notably less than in the other cases, very much less than those proposed for judges of the Supreme Court. The Minister might tell us on what basis this discriminatory treatment is proposed. There may be good grounds but one wonders what they are. Could it have anything to do with the question of the salary of the Taoiseach?Could it be that whereas the Chief Justice at present is remunerated higher than the Taoiseach somebody decided that nobody is to be remunerated higher than the Taoiseach in future? Is that the reason? If not, perhaps we could be told what the reason is.</P>
    <P>There is no proposal here for retrospection, whereas when the Civil Service claims were put forward and handled the retrospection paid ranged up to two years in some cases. In this instance when the increase is very belated there is no question of retrospection.I would here correct what Senator Quinlan said when he deplored the fact that this increase is being given at the start of a wage round. I think it is being given some years after the wage round to which it relates. It is extraordinarily belated. I do not think that there was any tenth round increase for judges. I am not even sure that when they got the ninth round it was not related to the seventh or eighth round. It is, in fact, belatedly occurring several years after a round, and several years after the matter was first raised and after the most prolonged discussions. I should like to know on what basis the principle of retrospection, which the Civil Service accords itself, is not recommended similarly by the civil servants in relation to the judicial salaries. What is the basis for this distinction?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that as Senator Murphy said, if the judges had been <Col N="642" /> affiliated to the ICTU they would not be treated in the way they have been. I should like the Minister to get information on the remuneration of court officers. On an inspection of the Book of Estimates, which may have been unduly cursory, I got the impression that court officers' remuneration is not voted by the Houses of the Oireachtas directly; they are settled separately.</P>

      <P>What I was trying to ask was that it you have a system under which you have judicial salaries changed in this way and a proposal made that that be done by order of the Government in future is this perhaps assimilated by the Minister in the method of settlement of court officers' salaries. Is this at present done by court order, and is it the case that the Government are proposing to employ a method already used for court officers' salaries for judges? This is a fair question.</P>
      <P>There are officers whose position seems to be intermediate between that of civil servants on the one hand and judges on the other, who are semi-judicial officers such as county registrars.What is the position about their remuneration? I mention this matter because it is something about which there is some dissatisfaction. There is a feeling among these judicial officers that there is an attempt by civil servants to whittle away their positions and treat them in a discriminatory manner. As they are judicial officers of a sort, how, in fact, is their remuneration, and conditions, determined? Is any change proposed in this matter in the future? Could they be brought within the framework proposed in the system here, if they are not within it at present? I should like some information on that in view of the fact that there is clear dissatisfaction in this group of officers as to the manner in which they have been treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the role of the Seanad, I understand that the purpose of Senator O'Quigley's remarks was that the Seanad should have power to annul&mdash;effective provisionally&mdash;an <Col N="643" /> order made under this Bill and that such annulment would be sent to the Dáil to be affirmed or otherwise. It was never suggested that the Seanad should have absolute power of annulment, only that it should have the power provisionally to annul an order which would be referred to the Dáil which would be required to consider it and decide on it. It is only reasonable that the Seanad should have an equivalent power under this Bill and that this type of power should be incorporated in the legislation. This had the support of Senator O'Kennedy on the other side and I trust that the Minister, before Committee Stage, will reconsider the point.</P>
    <P>There is the point about increasing the jurisdiction of the courts and I should like to know if this is something on which the Minister will be coming to the House with legislation. Will he be bringing legislation to the Houses of the Oireachtas or is this point something that can be settled without legislation?I suggest it is something which should come before the Oireachtas for consideration and the Minister might tell us something about his intentions when he is replying.</P>

      <P>I rise to strike a discordant note. To me this Bill is not welcome. With all due respect to the judiciary, this is a matter that should go first before the Labour Court. I should like to hear what the Labour Court would think of a body of workers, however senior, who expect increases of 25 per cent, 30 per cent, 40 per cent and 48 per cent. I should like to hear also the views of representatives of the Federation of Employers. I should like to know whether they feel this level of increase, at this crucial moment in the development of the economy, at a time when it is necessary to go very carefully in relation to the Civil Service pensioners and widows, is wise; whether it might be setting a bad example, and whether, if the matter were referred to the Labour Court, they would consider it justified now to set this example to trade unionists, among other, who might now consider they can go forward <Col N="644" /> and ask for 40 per cent or 50 per cent increases in wages, in view of the Government granting these large-scale increases to the judges of our various courts.</P>
      <P>It is the amounts of the increases that I am objecting to. In each case I consider them too high. The other day in the Seanad we agreed that any parent who was to benefit from a grant under the education grants scheme, any parent who had more than £1,800 a year, was quite wealthy enough to put 10 or more children through the university at his own expense.That was the view of the Seanad last week. Yet now the view of Senators seems to be that £1,800 a year is a paltry sum. This may be due to some extent to the legal training of some of my colleagues who feel this is a good place to pay tribute, and also to add financial support to that tribute, to our judges.</P>

      <P>I am looking forward to his speaking in my support afterwards. I notice, however, that this same society of ours, this House and the Oireachtas as a whole, says to a widow who is wondering whether she can get a non-contributory pension: &ldquo;You have more than £169 a year. So you get nothing. If you have one child and £195 a year you get nothing. If you have five children and £260 a year, you get nothing&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That is the kind of rate which is regarded as a reasonable living rate for a widow by the same society. An old age pensioner must have less than £169 a year from other sources, if he is to get pension benefit. The same applies to a blind pensioner except that the first £65 of his earned income from other sources will be disregarded. This is the measure of the generosity of our society towards widows, old age pensioners and blind pensioners. In the matter of unemployment assistance, if a man has £214 a year from some other source, he is regarded as having plenty to live on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="646" /> We should not necessarily forget these figures when we are being asked to vote increases of very considerable proportions to judges who are now getting £4,900 a year, £6,300 a year, £3,600 a year and £2,500 a year. These figures are relevant. In the case of the Chief Justice, whose salary is £6,360, we are being asked to increase his salary to £8,000. Senator O'Quigley made the point that this is a less increase, proportionately, than the others. It is true it is only 25 per cent, but that is quite a big percentage if we think in terms of old age pensioners or trade union wage applications before the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>A Supreme Court judge is to be given 40 per cent more, an increase from £4,950 to £7,000. In the High Court the percentage is rather smaller, about 30 per cent, the increase being from £3,640 to £5,000. The district court, the lowest grade, is to have an increase of nearly 50 per cent&mdash;something like 47 per cent or 48 per cent&mdash; the salaries there being increased from £2,520 to £3,750.</P>
    <P>My point is that these increases are too much. There is a sort of mystique about the judiciary&mdash;they must remain above us all, so lofty in status that we can hardly meet them. They must be isolated from us, and the distressing thing for me is that the generally accepted view is that the only way to do this, the only way to increase their status, is to increase the amount of money paid to them.</P>
    <P>I think I am correct in saying that judicial salaries went up in 1964 though I am open to correction on this. Senator FitzGerald seems to feel that this increase now is four years too late, if I understand him correctly, but if they got an increase in 1964 I suppose he is contending that that was already four years too late. I think that they are doing pretty well. I have great respect for them, and I know many of them, and I entirely share in the view of their integrity and their honesty and their judgment, and I share the view of those Senators who say that it always happens that even a judge who may owe his promotion to political patronage seems to have his judgment greatly improved once he sits on the <Col N="647" /> bench. If I am right that they got their last increase in 1964, we had a devaluation since then reducing the value of money by about 14 per cent, but the increases compensate for a good deal more than that.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised to find the Minister in his opening speech saying, and I quote: &ldquo;I am satisfied that the salaries now proposed are fair and reasonable and are necessary to reflect adequately in current circumstances the status which our judges should have in the community.&rdquo; Status, as if the only way to give a man status in the Irish community was through money. The Order of Mammon is the order that we really respect. When King Gustav of Sweden used to go around on a bicycle in the streets of Stockholm he had all the status necessary. He was a great man, a fine man, and he was respected for his personality, not by reason of the money he drew or the vehicle he propelled. I do not believe that it is a simple matter of money, and I do not believe that the independence and the honesty, which are certainly attributes of our judiciary, would be impaired unless salaries were brought up by astronomical proportions.</P>
    <P>I am old enough to remember the Republican Courts in this country. They were underground courts. It is true that many of the judges were not lawyers, but the fact is that the judges in the Republican Courts were not paid. They sat regularly and brought in sentences which were respected by the litigants, and I think that they have an honourable place in the history of our judiciary. I do not think anybody talks about them now, or remembers that they were entirely unpaid, and their status depended not on the cash brought in by the post, but on the integrity of the people who filled the post.</P>
    <P>I am entirely convinced of the integrity of all our judges at every level, and I say that entirely sincerely and with some experience of various courts. I couple with that statement a declaration of my view that I do not think that this springs at all from the amount of money which they draw. <Col N="648" /> We get people of quality, we have people of quality, and I do not agree with the Minister when he says, and I quote again: &ldquo;Experience over recent years shows that the present salaries, which were last increased over four years ago, are decidedly unattractive to potential appointees and that this would be sufficient justification for the salaries proposed in the Bill.&rdquo; The Minister is asking us to believe that the salaries that I have quoted are &ldquo;decidedly unattractive&rdquo; to the impoverished lawyers about whom we have heard from Senators O'Quigley and Yeats. I do not see how this adds up. I do not believe at all that the question of impoverishment or wealth makes a post attractive to a person of integrity coupled with ambition.</P>

      <P>That is quite true, but I am suggesting that we already have people with very big salaries who might be prepared to make a sacrifice in order to serve the country, just as many lawyers make sacrifices to serve in this House, or the other House, or in the Cabinet. The better the society, the more people would be prepared to make such sacrifices, but the more Mammonised our society the fewer such people we shall have. I do not believe that more money is the answer to the problem. I do not believe you will get more integrity by paying out more money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that. I do not believe that you add to the quality of our judiciary according to the amount of money paid to them. We are told, of course, that a judge cannot be a director of a company and so on. This is very true, but we recognise that a judge can be an unpaid director of some voluntary organisation, and that almost without exception all the judges of our judiciary serve very actively in a wide variety of capacities unpaid, and I would say that their service in such circumstances&mdash;I do not want to be <Col N="649" /> too specific here for obvious reasons &mdash;is every bit as much of as great integrity and quality as their service on the bench, for which they are paid. I do not think, in other words, that the money factor is the prime factor or the sole factor in relation to the quality of the work done.</P>
      <P>I feel that in asking for such very big increases in judicial salaries we have got our priorities wrong. I do not think that our Civil Service pensioners are paid enough. I believe that the time has long since passed when parity of Civil Service pensions should be granted to those men and women who have retired from the Service, parity with present salaries. We do not even give any pension to widows of civil servants; and yet we are bringing in, with a lot of talk about what is necessary for the status of these men, proposals for increases in salary as much as 48 per cent for people earning £2,000, £3,000, £4,000 and £5,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel, therefore, that we have got our priorities wrong, and that when the Minister says, and I quote: &ldquo;The nature of the duties entrusted to judges, and a number of other factors, make it impossible, or at least very difficult, to equate them in the matter of pay with any other group in the public service, and the Government accepted the need for a broad approach to the question and for a fundamental reassessment.&rdquo;When the Minister says that, I am disappointed to find that this &ldquo;broad approach&rdquo; to the question means simply more money. I feel that a more objective approach would be an approach that depends upon the quality of the people involved. I am in sympathy with the principle to which Senator FitzGerald paid tribute of the necessity for &ldquo;narrowing the differentials&rdquo;, as he said, but having paid tribute to it he spoke against it in this particular case. Until we can treat our old age pensioners, our widows and blind pensioners, our unemployed, the Civil Service pensioners and the widows of Civil Service pensioners better, I feel that we should respectfully ask the judiciary: &ldquo;Would you mind waiting, or would you accept something more in accordance with <Col N="650" /> the sort of increases which the Labour Court and the Federated Union of Employers would regard as reasonable in relation to demands by organised trade unionists?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I had not intended to speak on this Bill because it seemed to me to be a straightforward Bill that would meet with general support and on which there would not be a great deal to be said. But I am driven to say a few words by the mealy mouthed approach we have just heard from Senator Sheehy Skeffington. His views on this seem to me to express the sort of viewpoint I thought had receded into the past and which we do not really hear so much nowadays as perhaps we would have had ten, 20 or 30 years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington's mealy mouthed approach really belongs to a former age when people thought of our country as being a sort of potato patch not able to afford to give very much to anybody. I think the views expressed on this Bill are not such as ought to commend themselves to many people in this House or outside it. That is not a question, as he puts it, of the Mammon approach of assessing everything in terms of money. We must remember with regard to the judiciary, from the district justice to the Chief Justice, as Senator FitzGerald has rightly pointed out that even under this Bill they would be considerably worse off than they were before the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the social welfare classes upon whom he expanded at such length, while nobody would suggest they are doing as well as we would like them to do, if you compare their conditions to their rates and allowances before the war they are very much better off. We are, in fact, improving ourselves in this country to a much greater extent than the salaries suggested in this Bill. It seems to me that the greatest safeguard not merely in regard to the independent integrity of our judiciary but in relation to the standard of people you will get as <Col N="651" /> judges is to ensure that people are not asked to assume office at undue sacrifice. At the same time, Senator Sheehy Skeffington appears to think the ideal situation would be where people who are qualified to become judges would make sacrifices and would live at more or less subsistence level to show how patriotic they were. I do not feel it is right that we should call on people to serve in positions of honour and importance at a sacrifice of this kind to them.</P>
    <P>I do not see any point to this at all. While you would get some people willing to do it you would get others who are not able to and it seems a disastrous situation would come about. If at some time in the future an individual is asked to take office as a district justice or Chief Justice and having regard to his family and other commitments he has to refuse the offer it would be a disastrous situation. We should be able to get the best people for those offices and ensure that they will accept office when it is given to them, that they will not feel because of their commitments they are unable to take it on.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington spoke of the high range of salaries of the Chief Justice and judges of the Supreme Court and so on but he might also have regard to the rural district justices who are getting lower salaries. There must be hundreds of civil servants not in very important positions throughout the country who are making more per year than district justices yet the district justice, because of his profession, holds a very important position and holds very great power over a large number of people with regard to the decisions he makes, yet he has been asked until now to serve at a ludicrous salary. It is a great tribute to those people that the standard of district justices at those ludicrous salaries has been as high as it is.</P>
    <P>The increases in this Bill are no more than absolutely essential. Again, at the higher levels, while it is obvious, as Senator O'Kennedy has said, that the vast majority of barristers make nothing like those salaries, at the same time people who are qualified in recent <Col N="652" /> times earn in certain cases very considerable salaries. Perhaps Senator Sheehy Skeffington would say that the law should be arranged in such a way that they should not be able to earn those salaries.</P>
    <P>I am not as satisfied as Senator O'Quigley that the legal system as it stands at this moment is efficiently run but the fact remains that that is the way it is. Eminent barristers can earn great salaries and so long as it continues we should not tolerate that a barrister who is qualified, after many years, if he was offered a high position, would have to refuse because of the salary offered. This is quite a ridiculous situation and belongs to the past. I am sorry Senator Sheehy Skeffington has brought in this viewpoint which has no relevance at all to the present situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear any objection at all from any Senator who spoke to paying the judiciary for the work they do and paying them well but I think there is an onus on the House to see that if the judiciary are well paid they work for it. That is a most important thing. If we even asked the judiciary at the present time to work three days instead of three half days a week it would be an improvement.The criticism levelled outside this House at the moment with regard to the judiciary is quite justified and that will mount considerably when the public see the very big increases in salaries that have been given without any apparent increase in the amount of work to be done. A Senator made passing reference to the fact that there was some question of built up productivity involved. Where is it? We have nothing concrete but the fact that the Minister is bringing in legislation to increase the functions of the lower sections but that so far is in the air. The only concrete thing about it is that the Minister referred to the fact that the legislation is in the course of preparation. Is that the only means the Minister has at his disposal to increase the amount of work that should be done? I am aware and I think other Members of the House are aware that there are many in the <Col N="653" /> judiciary who sit from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and no further. Some of them would contemplate with horror the idea of an afternoon sitting to perform their duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make this point. In Dublin you have a number of judges who sit much longer than the average sitting. The average sitting throughout the country in my opinion is not more than three hours on any day. Some of the individuals involved might sit longer but the average involved is only three hours and we must make mention of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am expressing an opinion and if the Minister wishes to refute it I would be very interested to hear him and also what Senator O'Quigley has to say. The fact is that many in the judiciary refuse to sit on Mondays and Fridays. Have they got the right to decide this? This is supposed to be a democracy. We mouth about democracy and equality for our people but at the same time we suggest special treatment for those who administer the law as if they were above the rest of the community. They should be seen by example to carry out their work the same as anybody else. I do not believe at all in this idea of elevating people in our minds into some mysterious position where they cannot be criticised and we cannot say anything about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Mother of Parliaments across the water, and I hope nobody is going to criticise me for using that expression seeing that a prominent member of the Government made certain wishful remarks in that connection in recent weeks, there is quite free criticism of the judiciary. In the last two years the British press have been free to criticise where necessary the actions of members of the judiciary. It would be wrong for us to allow ourselves to be silenced by people who suggest <Col N="654" /> that members of the judiciary are above criticism. There is nobody above criticism in the world today and the young people who are growing up to criticism will not be told that anybody is or can be above criticism. If we believe the religions that are in the world today we are told that everybody is born with an equal soul.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Minister's suggestions contained in his speech in the Dáil and in his comments here that he has more work on hands for the district courts and the circuit courts, I would like to hear from him some further suggestions as to how he is going to increase the amount of work that these particular people are doing at present. He must either increase the number of people who are there to carry out the law or he must make those who are there work harder or give better service. If I suggest to the Minister that in certain courts there is a delay not of one or two years, but of four, five and six years before cases come to hearing what is his answer to that? I do not suggest that the fault lies completely with the judges but they must take part of the blame.</P>
    <P>When we come to the Minister's suggestion that August should be kept completely free of all court cases I would ask him whether that idea has been fully thought out. In other walks of life we have what are known as staggered holidays and there is no reason in the world why itinerant judges or justices should not carry on during the month of August. If it is so in every other profession and walk of life there is no reason why it should not be so in the legal profession and in the law courts. The Minister says that he hopes as a result of the changes being made that the position will be eased with regard to the transfer of judges and justices. If that is going to happen there is no reason why you cannot have the courts sitting during the full 12 months of the year.</P>
    <P>I welcome the end to the differentiation in salaries as between the district justices in Dublin and outside. I was amused at the statement that the Government considers this a relic of <Col N="655" /> the past, that it is old hat and that it is gone everywhere else. It has not gone in the Civil Service. There are important civil servants working in the country who are paid a lower salary than those working in Dublin and some of them do much more important work than their opposite numbers in Dublin. I hope I will be in a position to make certain people eat those words as far as civil servants in other parts of the country are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is another differential with which I disagree and that is the mummery that goes on in certain of our provincial towns. A judge in Dublin gets off his bus like any other citizen and goes into his court or he may drive up to his court in his own car but when such a judge goes down the country no fewer than 12 or 16 ablebodied gardaí are lined up in the morning with their buttons polished as a guard of honour. They have to hang around the town hall all day to provide a guard of honour when he goes to lunch and when he finishes for the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true. It is correct that a guard of honour is provided in the morning but there is no guard of honour in the evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In all seriousness I think it is high time that we got rid of that. Apart from the fact that it means nothing as far as respect for the law is concerned because there is no one who has more respect for the law than the people of this country, there is very heavy cost involved and we have never got the cost of the man hours lost by the Garda Síochána in this servile kind of duty. If we are getting rid of the differential as far as pay is concerned there is no reason to keep up this differential as far as provincial Ireland is concerned. I hope it is going to disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has been made of the system of appointment and I am amused at this. I do subscribe to the views expressed on both sides of the House that, on the whole, the members of our judiciary are excellent men. Somebody said : &ldquo;Thanks be to God that they are&rdquo;. I am afraid that it is God we have to thank or somebody <Col N="656" /> else outside the system. Why leave this very important matter to Providence? If we have been lucky up to the present in securing the services of good men, surely we are tempting Providence in keeping to that system. It has been said by Senator Sheehy Skeffington that in spite of the fact that the majority of these men are political appointees, when they are appointed they do rise above their former views. That is perfectly true.</P>
    <P>However, what I want to put to the House is that as far as the public mind is concerned that is not sufficient. When it comes to the appointment of a rate collector we all know what happens. Such an appointment is subject to political influence and the people associate such influences with appointments to the courts. They believe that the same thing goes on. There is the old saying that justice should be tempered with mercy but it would be better to say that justice should not be tempered with politics. That is what we want to achieve in the future. As Senator FitzGerald said, the time is now ripe when the Government should have another look at the system of appointment.</P>
    <P>I have spoken on this matter <i>ad nauseam</i> in the other House but there does not seem to be any change in the attitude of the Government in the matter. Having listened to Senator O'Kennedy and others on both sides of the House I feel this House should set an example by speaking out strongly on this to the Minister. If we want to keep up the high standard which has obtained here we should now proceed to improve the system of selection. I do not suggest that the method I have in mind would be the best one but I would agree with the idea proposed by Senator FitzGerald and I suggest that that should meet with the approval of the Government.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to make&mdash; in fact, as far as I am concerned it is probably the most important one&mdash; is in regard to the timing of the Bill. The Government timed it well because of the fact that Members of both Houses are themselves about to get an increase. Whenever the question of <Col N="657" /> an increase for the judiciary came up there was a long discussion, and a rightly prolonged discussion, especially in the other House. That discussion did not take place this time. This was the shortest discussion that ever took place on the question of increases for the judiciary and I can only suspect that the other Bill on the Order Paper, namely, increases to Oireachtas Members, had some effect on the shortening of the discussion of the judges' salaries.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons put forward by the Government to eliminate&mdash;and I deliberately use the word &ldquo;eliminate&rdquo;&mdash;such discussion as has taken place here today and which took place in the other House is that the necessary legislation to give increases to the judiciary takes too long to prepare. It is too awkward. In fact, the increases should be bigger when the increase is dealt with. I do not accept that and I do not think either House should accept it. If the Government are serious about giving fair play to the judges a simple Bill could be brought in at any time to the Dáil and dealt with. We know that. Having some knowledge of procedure in that House, I know that it will take a long agonising period before an increase for the judiciary can come before the House.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that by adopting this new system the Government of the future could put its thumb on the judiciary. That is the danger I see in the new approach. Somebody said that the Seanad will now be precluded from discussing such a measure. It is true; the Dáil will also. The Dáil can have an opportunity of examining an order made by the Minister. We all know what happens with ministerial orders. They appear on the Order Paper and nine times out of ten they slip through the House and become legislation. At that stage it is up to a Deputy who has his eye on the Order Paper to cop on what is being slipped through and if that eye on the Order Paper may not be keen at times still the onus is now being put on an individual Deputy to pick out on the Order Paper a motion which purports to give an increase to the judiciary. It is up to the Deputy to move that that increase should not be given. It <Col N="658" /> may not be the intention at all to give the increase but in the public mind he is branded as against the increase, whereas when a Bill is being discussed the various views of Members of the House can be expressed before the increase is given.</P>
    <P>I would settle for this. If the Government were prepared to set up a commission, to deal with the appointment of the judiciary and take it out of the hands of the politicians where it lies at present there would be a case for taking out of the cockpit of politics the question of pay, but so long as we have the system as it is I believe both Houses should have the opportunity of discussing the proposed increases, not an opportunity of discussing them when the increases are made.</P>
    <P>The Minister as a further excuse in the Dáil said that if somebody was dissatisfied with the increase he could always raise it on the Estimate. Members in this House know well that raising a matter of this importance on the Minister's Estimate is of little use. It is a minor matter and it is smothered in the volume of words spoken by other Deputies. I would appeal to the Minister, who is in many ways a democratic man, not to fritter away the rights of Members and to restore to the Members the right to speak on this and the right to express healthy criticism of the judiciary. If this measure goes through it is goodbye to criticism. If this goes respect goes and that position would be worse.</P>
    <P>I conclude by appealing to the Minister before this measure is finally passed to safeguard the right of both Houses to discuss this matter in future, not through means of an order in the Dáil but through the normal channels which have worked, that is, through legislation or a Bill.</P>

      <P>There is more truth than ever as far as I can see in the old axiom that eternal vigilance is the basis of liberty. Listening to the speeches of Senators Quinlan, Sheehy Skeffington and now Senator McQuillan and, indeed, some of the views propounded by Senator FitzGerald, makes me realise how dangerous the mentality which those people possess is for the interests of this country, <Col N="659" /> and makes me realise how dangerous is the example which they are giving to the young people of the present generation. It also puts a thought into my head. The thought is that fascists, communists and anarchists have some things in common. They seek in pursuit of their aims to first undermine the authority of the police. Then they seek to undermine the authority of the judiciary and then to bring the existing Government and institutions into contempt and ridicule. If that is not what those who have spoken on this subject here are trying to do, then I do not understand the meaning of the English language.</P>
      <P>This continued béal bocht is creating the impression that there is something wrong, that there is something crooked in the public life of the country, something at which the Dáil and Seanad are conniving and of which they should be ashamed; and when Senator McQuillan, for instance, takes as one of the products of this Bill that it will enable the Government to put their hands on the throat of the judiciary in the future because the judiciary can never be discussed again in the Seanad, that this is an indication to the young people, whose minds are not as mature as some of the Senators, there is something radically wrong that permits a situation like that to develop.</P>
      <P>I urge very strongly on these Senators, who are people of education and ability, that they should stop this dangerous trend in their speeches and at least try to set a good example to the young people. When Senator McQuillan makes a declaration that young people today will not listen to anybody, will not listen to this sort of stuff or anything like that, he, too, is conniving at the sort of mentality which has created riots and trouble from one end of Europe to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington compared the judges of the IRA courts with the situation which exists today but he forgot to mention that in those days during the War of Independence the IRA courts were set up as part of the struggle to destroy British power in Ireland and that they functioned as part of the war effort. They were <Col N="660" /> manned, in the majority of our judgeships and offices, by men of the Volunteer Army. As I have said, they were part of the war effort.</P>
    <P>It is a different situation altogether today when three-quarters of this nation is free with the rule of the Irish people running without question over three-quarters of the national territory. Surely, after all these years, as Senator Yeats has said, we should stop this béal bocht preaching and stand on our own feet, being proud to be an independent nation with the possibility of showing that we comprehend what independence means and what the dignity of our public officials means and how they should be treated in the state of freedom we have achieved.</P>
    <P>I personally believe that there are certain classes in the public service to whom we should pay the highest possible amount of money the community can afford. One such class is the judiciary because without an independent judiciary to interpret the law, support the Constitution and see that justice is done to the poorest person in the country, there is no integrity in the way of life and no preservation of the weak against the strong. I believe also we should pay to the Garda Síochána, our police force, the highest amount of money we can afford because without a proper police force, an incorruptible police force, there can be no genuine protection for the people, no interpretation and no preservation of law and order.</P>
    <P>We should also pay to the Army, our guardians in times of emergency and stress, the highest possible we can afford; and we should pay to the public servants, who will guarantee the rights of the people by the efficient discharge of their duties, the best possible salaries the economy can afford. Therefore, it is time we got rid of the béal bocht which we hear so often expressed. It is time we stood on our own feet as a free people and acted up to a standard which will show an example of dignity and appreciation.</P>
    <P>Senators Quinlan, FitzGerald and others spoke of the system of appointment of judges and this reminds me very much of criticisms which are <Col N="661" /> made here from time to time in respect of many proposals brought in by the Government, suggestions that this and that could be done better, but there is never any detailed plan submitted to show how it could be done better. It is quite easy for the hurlers on the ditch to talk about patronage being a bad thing. It is easy to say that a commission should be appointed and it is simple to suggest there are other ways, but none of these geniuses can come forward with a concrete proposition which would give us a better system than that in existence which has given us, from the lowest court to the highest, the finest judiciary any country could wish to have.</P>
    <P>I do not think any Senator here will accuse any of the judges who were appointed by any of the Governments which have served here during the last 42 or 43 years of being partial or of abusing the high offices to which they have been appointed in the interests of any past political opinions they may have had. Until somebody shows me where there is a system of appointment which will exclude from the appointing board people who have opinions on the way things go in the country and on the way of life of the people, I will stick to the present system. It is not that easy to get a commission which will not be open to some criticism, because any man worth his salt, in any country, has political opinions. If he has not he is no damn good, and, therefore, those who constitute a commission would be open to criticism that any appointment recommended to the Government was made because of political beliefs of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it is time we stopped that nonsense. I agree with Senator O'Kennedy in his hope that the trend which has been shown by the present Government in the appointment of men to the Bench, irrespective of their political beliefs&mdash;men appointed on merit and ability alone&mdash;will be continued.It is refreshing and healthy, in spite of the doubts of Senator FitzGerald, who did not appear to know of recent appointments, to see that this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I hope this will be continued because thus we shall have a judicial system which will command universal acceptance and approval. This is a good Bill. I welcome it and I think the Minister is to be congratulated on it and I hope the smoke screen which has been attempted by Senator Sheehy Skeffington will not delude anybody. He will probably attempt to throw the same smoke screen around the Oireachtas Allowances Bill forgetting that the people of this country are not fools, that they will not be deceived by this pseudo concern for the people who are not as well off as they should be and who are not getting as much as they should get. We know very well there are such people; we know a lot more has to be done but all cannot be done in a night and the sooner Senator Sheehy Skeffington stops that kind of nonsense, which he thinks is deluding the people, the better for himself and the country.</P>

      <P>While I do not go so far as to oppose this Bill outright as some Senators have done, my welcome for it is subject to certain reservations. In certain circumstances, I do not think I would be human&mdash;I would be angelic&mdash;if I did not entertain these reservations because I cannot help contrasting the generous treatment of this particular segment of the public service with the treatment meted out to another important segment whose interests I represent in this House. Here in the judiciary we have a group of public servants being offered increases ranging almost to 50 per cent, and this without their having to go through the worrying processes of negotiations to which other bodies are subjected in seeking just and adequate salary scales. We have had no evidence by any speaker, by the Minister or anybody else, of any demand on their part for these increases, and, in fact, the system of increases that has eventuated here would lead one to believe that there has been no organised demand for these increases. If we take the percentages as they have been worked out <Col N="663" /> and if my rather rapid calculations are correct, we find that the Chief Justice gets 25.6 per cent increase, Supreme Court Judges 41.4 per cent increase, High Court Judges 27.5 per cent, Circuit Court Judges 37.3 per cent, the President of the District Court 41.1 per cent, Metropolitan District Justices 39.3 per cent and Provincial District Justices 48.8 per cent. Quite obviously there is such a variation in percentages there that no organised group would be unlikely to accept such an award if there were any negotiations about it.</P>
      <P>As I say, I cannot help contrasting this position with that of the secondary teachers, at present being invited to accept a reduction in salary, and particularly when the very reasons that the Minister adduces in his introductory statement for granting increases to the judiciary are equally applicable in the secondary teachers' case. In fact <i>mutatis mutandis</i> you could read it into the speech all the way through, about the level of salaries, for example, that they should be such as will ensure the widest possible field of selection and being able to attract the best possible people. Of course, this is true of many other segments of the public service as well, and I only mention the particular case of the secondary teachers because they are the only group in present circumstances who are being asked to bear a reduction in salary.</P>
      <P>I do not grudge any public servant a reasonable increase in salary, and I accept wholeheartedly all that has been said about the importance of paying adequate salaries to attract the right people, but I do resent the discrimination in treatment between one sector of the public service and another, and it is on this basis that I must qualify my welcome for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of what Senator Ó Maoláin has said about the system of appointment, I should also like to support the plea that has been made in this House for taking the appointments of the judiciary out of the realm of political patronage. While no one can point to any grave abuses arising out of the method, surely in theory at least the system of selection by an independent <Col N="664" /> commission such as has been suggested would allay public suspicion and be conducive to a greater measure of public confidence. While Senator Ó Maoláin has pointed to the difficulty about having such a commission I cannot see any grave difficulty about it if such a commission were to send two or three names to the Government for appointment. That would leave a little measure of both principles, both political patronage and also independent selection. I think that that sort of thing could be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill involves two principles. One is an increase to the judiciary on their present salaries, and the other is the alteration of the method by which increases should be given in the future. The increases that are given are those which purport to make the positions attractive to lawyers of the best calibre. I personally feel as a practising lawyer that they are in or about correct on that basis. One Senator has suggested that a man will take his place on the bench irrespective of salary and will consider it an honour to serve his country on a reduced remuneration.One does occasionally meet such people but in the hard economic circumstances of today they must be very few and far between. Heretofore the salary of a district justice was on average about £2,500 a year. I do not think that one would get a lawyer who commands the esteem and respect of his clients, whose knowledge of the law is such as to enable him to build up a satisfactory practice, whose ability in advocacy is such as to enable him to hold that practice, who would not be earning somewhat more than £2,500 a year no matter how much work he might feel like doing within reason as an act of charity and in the interests of justice. Two thousand five hundred pounds is not an enormous income in these days to a man with a family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One expects people to accept these appointments in or about the age of 40 cr 45 years, a time when a man might have a large family dependent on him. If at the moment a lawyer is earning somewhere between £3,000 and £4,000 a year one cannot expect him to incur for himself and for his family the <Col N="665" /> sacrifices which would be involved in accepting a position as a district justice. We must remember that if respect for our courts goes the whole basis of our institution is undermined. I suppose there are at least 100 citizens in this State who have experience of the district court to five who have experience of the circuit court, to one who would have experience of the High Court. I should point out also that a lawyer in any court, even in the district court, if he be a good lawyer, may be a far less public expence at a larger salary than an inferior lawyer at a smaller salary, because if he gives a wrong decision either of two things happens. Either there is an undermining of respect for law or there is an appeal to the circuit court which occasions a vast amount of expense. Therefore, the actual difference in salary is the smaller part of the public expense to which litigants would be put, because by and large it is the taxpayer of the country who will lose if further expense is put upon the general public by appeals. The same thing as regards appeals applies to the circuit court and to the High Court and, therefore, I do not think it is reasonable to criticise the increase in salaries to district justices. I personally am quite satisfied that you will not get at a lower salary than that now given district justices of standing, men who would have a thorough knowledge of the law, a mind capable of sizing up a situation, getting to the kernel of the facts and ascertaining the truth of matters.</P>
    <P>As regards the salaries of judges of the circuit court much the same thing applies. A good practising barrister of the Senior Bar you would normally expect or like to have on the circuit court bench will not be got under a salary of approximately £5,000 a year. I would say, however, in regard to those salaries, and having regard to the fact that a man on the Bench possibly has not to work as hard as what we describe the lawyer on the cab rank it should be possible, having regard to the present value of money, to get the most suitable person for appointment to the Bench in all categories, district court, circuit court and High Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> I welcome the tendency recently of appointing people to the Bench on merit only. That seems to have been the tendency in the last two, three or four appointments. I hope that that tendency will continue. There are some flaws in the present method of appointment to the district court insofar as district justices are frequently appointed on a temporary basis of six months. There is no solicitor worth his salt or no barrister worth his salt who can afford to give up his practice for six months, go on the district court Bench for six months and then find at the end of that time that he has to take up the threads of his practice again. Unless that system is abolished you will not get the proper type of person for appointment to the district court. It may be that he has strong hopes he will be kept on but strong hopes are not sufficient.</P>
    <P>A barrister or a solicitor who gives up his practice for six months for all practical purposes should be assured if he is appointed that he can with safety assume that some time in the future he will hold the position to which he has been appointed and that he will be completely independent in so doing and, therefore, will be independent of the Government, the Executive and everyone else.</P>
    <P>I must say I had a certain amount of sympathy for some of the things which Senator McQuillan mentioned. There is no doubt in the world about it that litigation expenses, when totted up, are quite heavy and very often they are completely out of proportion with the amount in dispute. They comprise various items but, as a practising lawyer, I find that the heaviest item is that involving the bringing of such witnesses as engineers, doctors, specialists and others to court day after day. The average court sits for only four hours a day, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. That is the full day. I estimate that whoever loses a High Court action and has to pay finds that the cost involved is £1,000 per day, a good deal of which goes towards bringing witnesses to Dublin, and paying them fees and a retainer. All lawyers are paid by the day.</P>
    <P>It would not be too much to expect <Col N="667" /> that our courts would sit for somewhat longer periods. If the judges found they were overworked or anybody else felt so they could work fewer days but the litigation expenses would be very considerably reduced. If instead of sitting for four hours per day the court sat five hours per day they would be reduced by approximately 25 per cent. It is a great pity that the expense of administering justice must be so high. On the other hand, I would say that I have never yet known justice denied to any person because he had no money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>That, however, is a luxury because of a principle to which lawyers adhere. They feel that they owe a duty to the principle of justice and they feel justice should not be denied to any person, irrespective of whether he has money or not. The lawyers have to bear that expense ultimately because, as a solicitor, I know in some cases I have had to pay £200 to £300 witnesses' expenses on behalf of a client who had no money, not one shilling of which was refunded to me. Even in relation to lawyers the sittings of our courts should be extended for longer hours than they are at present. That would not impose any undue hardship on anyone. I hope and trust in all sincerity that the appointments to the Bench for the future will continue, as they have been recently, and that the same effort will be made to have men appointed irrespective of their political views, irrespective of their religion, and that the only consideration which will be given is whether they are capable of giving, and are prepared to give good service to the community in the position of responsibility which they hold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me emphasise what I said in my opening statement to the Seanad that the figures proposed represent the result of a broad approach to this question and, indeed, a fundamental re-assessment by the Government of the salaries of the people we are discussing here. The Government looked <Col N="668" /> at all aspects of this matter which they felt relevant but, as I said in the other House, the Judiciary are really in a class by themselves. You cannot equate them with people in business or in the Civil Service. They are in a category by themselves and in taking a broad look at this the Government, of course, had in mind the increases, that they have been given from time to time to the public service which those people did not get.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that there were only five increases in the salaries of the judiciary since the foundation of the State. We must always remember that the bringing in of a Bill of this kind is not politically popular. There is never a suitable time for a Bill of this kind. Some Senators said that this was a suitable time but every year for all time is an unsuitable time to bring in legislation giving increases to the judiciary because you will have general comparisons made on the percentage of the increase and the fact that they are highly paid public servants. But let us not forget that they are the most important public servants we have.</P>
      <P>It might be well if I pointed out some figures that we should keep in mind and these have regard to what their opposite numbers are paid in Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland the Lord Chief Justice has a salary of £9,375, a puisne judge has £8,125 and a county court judge has £4,440, he has not anything like the jurisdiction and the responsibility of the circuit court judge here. The resident magistrate in Belfast gets £4,225, so that we are not going all across the earth for comparisons of this kind. These are the figures paid to the opposite numbers of our judiciary in the North.</P>

The Senator can make the same comparisons between <Col N="669" /> what our widows and orphans are getting and what he is getting in this House. That comparison would be just as relevant.</P>
      <P>As far as the appointments are concerned I do not know what system we could have outside the system we have at present. I know that in most countries the judges are appointed by the Government of the day. Certainly that is the position in England where the Lord Chancellor makes the recommendation to the monarch and the Government appoints the judges. Reference has been made to the Appointments Commission but in my experience I have seen some queer fellows emerge from that body and so have many others.</P>

      <P>Some of the Senators did not seem to be aware of recent appointments that have been made and Senator O'Kennedy was very reticent about them. Two men whom I know very well professionally, with whom I have worked professionally, but who would cut my throat politically are recent appointments to our Bench. One of them was a former Labour candidate in this city. Let me say that as far as both of them are concerned they were earning far more before they were appointed than the salaries they have been enjoying up to the passing of this Bill. They were tops in their profession and they were accepted as such. Their standing was very high. One is now on the district court Bench and the other is in the Supreme Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>One was appointed to the Supreme Court and one to the district court in very recent times. I have said that this has been a complete re-assessment and the biggest percentage increases here are on the new scale of the district court. I regard the district court as the most important court in our country, the most important to the public in rural Ireland. The situation was utterly unrealistic. Some Senators do not seem to appreciate the <Col N="670" /> fact that to be eligible for appointment as a justice of the district court one must be a solicitor or barrister of at least ten years standing and for appointment to the circuit court one must have at least 12 years standing. There is no question here of appointing some young man still wet behind the ears, legally speaking.</P>
      <P>In the last fortnight I have seen newspaper advertisements offering young men who have just qualified £1,500 and £2,000 for positions here in the city and when I say that it will be quite clear how utterly unrealistic it was to expect to get very experienced men of 12 years standing to accept a position of this kind.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned that I am bringing in legislation to increase the jurisdiction of the district and circuit courts and some Senators wanted to know if this was a question of making up for the diminished purchasing power of money. It is no such thing. I am completely reassessing the whole issue and I propose to give very substantial increased jurisdiction to the district and circuit courts. This legislation is being drafted at present; it has to come before the House and I hope to have it here before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>As some Senators have said, this is another method of decentralisation. Its purpose will be twofold. It will make the administration of justice cheaper in rural Ireland, ease the congestion we have in the High Court in Dublin and it will enable a very large amount of the litigation that now takes place in Dublin to be dealt with in the areas where the people come from. We have anticipated this extra responsibility in assessing what we believe should be a fair salary for these men who will now be called upon to bear much heavier responsibility than formerly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was posed as to whether the district justices could be made to sit longer hours or for extra days. This can be done by me by order but the position appears to be, from my experience, that the men in the country sit as long as there is work for them to do. I believe that they can do a lot more work and they are going to get much more work to do under the <Col N="671" /> increased jurisdiction. There is a method open to me of fixing extra sittings for them and thereby increase the productivity of the district courts. I share the view of Senator Nash and others that it should be possible and that it is certainly desirable to have longer hours or extra days provided for, particularly in the city. The general view is that there should no longer be what I regard as an anachronism, the long vacation and I know many young barristers share this view.</P>

Perhaps those concerned with this issue in this House will have another look at the matter. I feel, however, that the new increased jurisdiction of both the circuit and district courts will also have a very healthy effect on what somebody described as the proverbial delays. We will have quicker and speedier trials than we formerly had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McQuillan is under a misapprehension about closing down in the month of August of the district courts. It is not done in ease of the district justices in the main but in ease of the public. Most of the experience is that there are very many applications for adjournments by members of the public because they are going on holidays, their lawyers are going on holidays, witnesses are going on holidays and, in factual fact, in many areas in the month of August, in the wicked month, no courts are held. The advantage of having this a permanent fixture as far as we are concerned is that we can be assured that the district justices will take their holidays then because they are entitled to a certain period of holidays and if they can take some, or most, of them during the month of August this will lead to more efficiency because if they take them then they will not have to stagger their court sittings during other periods by taking the holidays to which they are entitled under the regulations. There is a <Col N="672" /> demand for this from the legal profession but fundamentally it will, I think, facilitate the public who invariably find themselves in these cases in some difficulty during the month of August.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley mentioned the courthouses and, indeed, I have had experience of some of the courthouses, as the Senator knows, and they are not edifices of which we should be proud.</P>

      <P>In case the Senator is under the impression that there is no provision for them let me say that there is a relevant Courthouses Act, 1935, which places on the local authority the duty of doing this job. If they do not like lawyers or judges, or whatever the cause is, they are loth to carry out improvements to courthouses in most cases. In many of these courthouses, particularly old ones, people have to congregate on court days and there are no facilities, certainly no desirable facilities, made available. I agree that this system is unsatisfactory and possibly I will try to have a look at it and see whether it is possible for my Department to get some form of agreement with the local authority. It is my experience that this is not confined to one particular local authority. They seem to be very slow all over in taking responsibility under the Courthouse Act, 1935 to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>A Senator raised the question of district court officers. The position is that all salaries up to about £2,000 are determined by an arbitration board which has an independent outside chairman and the salaries of the relatively few civil servants outside the scheme of conciliation and arbitration are adjusted by the Government in a corresponding way with the arbitration board in the case of higher civil servants.So, they are in fact civil servants governed by the complex Civil Service rules dealing with remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley suggested the need for more streamlining of our courts to get down to work in a more efficient manner. When I bring in the new legislation to which I have referred I intend to have a new look at <Col N="673" /> the whole system and to include any necessary measures that might help in attaining the object of undertaking the work more efficiently.</P>
    <P>In connection with the section that deals with the provisions for the future as far as the judiciary are concerned, I note this has been criticised by a number of Senators here. The provision which enables judges' pay to be increased by Government order represents the traditional arrangement. All Bills to increase judges' pay have to be Certified Money Bills under the Constitution.The practical effect has been that the power of the Seanad in relation to a Bill about a judge's pay was limited to dealing with it within 21 days. The relevant Article of the Constitution is Article 21 (2). In view of the position that has obtained up to now, though there would be no justification in a provision under the new procedure which would enable the Seanad to reject absolutely or within 21 days a draft Government Order to increase judges' pay, the provision in the Bill now will be to extend it to the Seanad. The Seanad would have power to disprove of a draft order and thus have power to make an order, which was not disapproved by the Dáil. Any such arrangement would give the Seanad control over money matters in contrast with the limited powers it has now.</P>

      <P>A number of Senators have spoken on this. If I have misinterpreted what the Senator had to say I regret it. What I am pointing out is that even under existing law this is a Money Bill and the power of the Seanad of holding it up is limited, as Senators know. Under the new regulation that will be laid before the Dáil, the Dáil will have the opportunity of rejecting it if they so desire. I do not accept what Senator McQuillan said&mdash; that these orders are put on the Order Paper and nobody pays any attention to them. Indeed, he was a very good hand at carefully studying the Order Paper when we had him for many years in the Lower House. The Opposition <Col N="674" /> Parties and their Whips will ensure that they know what these orders mean.</P>
      <P>So will anybody who has any interest in a particular matter about which an order has been made. Under procedure in this House, if there is some matter like this that appears on the Dáil Order Paper, it is quite open to any Senator to put down a motion expressing a view of approval or disapproval.Therefore, if at any time any Senator felt that the Government were being unduly generous or otherwise to the judiciary he has a way of expressing a view here by way of motion.</P>

      <P>The Seanad has power under its procedure, if the Seanad felt a matter should be discussed, to have it raised. This is done by order, not by legislation, in England. In fact, the more I have thought of the matter the more I have found it difficult to understand how it is that in this country we deemed it necessary to have legislation whenever the judiciary were to be given increases, notwithstanding the fact that we have very highly paid public servants being dealt with in a different way. In their cases we do not have to produce special legislation. It may be that at one stage the big fear was that judges' salaries might be reduced with a possible drop in the cost of living many years ago. Possibly that has something to do with it: judges possibly felt more the danger of a reduction than of an increase 25 or 30 years ago. They are the only class, outside the Comptroller and Auditor General, whose salaries are fixed by legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because of the fact that we had to have legislation that we are compelled to reassess these men at this time; it is because we had to have legislation, for which the time is never suitable in a matter of this kind, that <Col N="675" /> they missed a number of the increases other public servants got; and the fact that the matter can be done quickly and by order, which can be laid before the Dáil in the future, should mean that if in this sector increases are to be given to higher civil servants and people in that category, these people can be dealt with efficiently by the Government of the day whenever the matter arises. Senator Nash complained about temporary appointments. I agree it is a very undesirable thing. At the moment I think we have only one temporary district justice.</P>

      <P>At all events, it is a practice I do not like and I agree that few suitable people in this day and age would be prepared to take a chance of waiting for a vacancy by accepting a temporary appointment. Most Senators seem to accept the desirability of the increases outlined. The Bill took a very short time in the Dáil, not for the reason suggested here but because the House there unanimously accepted the fact that these people were only being brought up to date, having missed the bus, so to speak, during quite a long period, and that the new scales&mdash;I prefer to put it that way&mdash;are reasonable in their circumstances. It was accepted by all sides of the House in the Dáil. They were realistic about it. A point was made about guards of honour at courts in the country. The cost of such guards of honour is infinitesimal. In my experience most of the gardaí concerned were giving evidence in the circuit court anyway.</P>

After all, he does not <Col N="676" /> visit the area very often and I do not see anything wrong with it.</P>
      <P>I cannot say anything about the other matters raised by Senator Ó Conalláin and others. I am dealing here with judges' salaries and judges' salaries only and I cannot enter into a discussion, nor do I think it relevant, on how any other class is being treated. Let me emphasise that there is no class in the public service comparable to this class because, as many Senators have emphasised, these men should not alone be above suspicion financially but appear to be so to all and sundry. I know of unfortunate cases where some men died in the district court bench, leaving young families in respect of whom private subscriptions had to be made. That is an undesirable state of affairs and I hope that with these scales we shall be able to attract the best men for the most important appointments we have, in the interests of our people, in the interests of democracy and in the interests of justice. I am grateful to Senators for the manner in which they have received the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 40 and 41, to delete &ldquo;Acquision of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Land Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845 (as adapted or amended by or under any subsequent Act)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some people who never give up, and when it comes to amendments of this kind, I fall into this category. I do not believe that one ought to give up when one believes in a particular principle. I have no doubt in the world that the Minister will not recommend that the House accept this amendment and I can anticipate the speech the Minister will make as to why the amendment should not be <Col N="677" /> accepted. I think, however, that it is right to say that where the legislature ordains that a particular authority or body should have a right to compulsorily acquire another person's land or part of it we ought to give to the owner of that property adequate compensation.I have said before on the Mines and Minerals Development Act of 1950 or whenever it was and on various other Bills dealing with land acquisition that the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919 is an unjust measure, and that it does not give compensation to the owner of the property for the value of the property to him. It is of course feasible, but I would not waste public money in having printed the amendments that could be made to the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919 to amend that Act in this Bill. It is feasible to do it; it has been done in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 and in other Acts, but it would be of no effect because the Minister will be adamant in refusing to amend legislation or any Bill submitted by him to the House no matter how meritorious the amendments might be.</P>
    <P>I want to go on record as saying&mdash; and let every member of the House know&mdash;that the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, is an inadequate instrument to do justice to people whose property is being compulsorily acquired; and because people might think that my view of the law is not correct, I have brought with me today, a leading textbook, <i>Cripps on Compensation,</i> which deals with the various statutes which govern the fixing of compensation for lands acquired by various local authorities and statutory undertakings. I now propose to read two short excerpts from the eighth edition of <i>Cripps on Compensation,</i> page 172, where he differentiates between the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, and the Land Clauses Act, 1845, to 1895.</P>
    <P>He says: &ldquo;Cases in which the Acquisition of Land Act 1919 apply are far more numerous today than those in which the procedure and principles under the Lands Clauses Acts <Col N="678" /> only apply, but when applying the Acquisition of Land Act 1919 some assistance will be afforded to practitioners by a consideration of the cases decided on the various compensation sections of the Lands Clauses Act 1845.</P>
    <P>This is the particular passage to which I would like to draw the attention of the House: &ldquo;It should however be understood that there is a different principle to be applied to the two clauses of cases. When land is acquired by a statutory undertaking the basis of compensation is the value of the land to the owner at the date of the notice to treat.&rdquo; I underline &ldquo;the value of the land to the owner&rdquo;. It goes on to say: &ldquo;When land is taken by a Government Department or a local or public authority, the compensation is based on the amount the land might be expected to realise if sold in the open market by a willing seller.&rdquo; That ends the quotation.</P>
    <P>There is a difference in principle. Where land is being acquired there are two different sets of statutes and you can apply whichever you like to any particular case. In one case you give the market value; in the other case you give the value of the land to the owner, and, as I put on the Second Reading, the hypothetical case of a person who has a shop and a small bit of land or a shed near it and who wants to extend it for the purpose of enlarging his business, the two prices can be quite different. The value of the land to the owner where he wants to extend his business and build his shop is quite different from the market value. I want to place that on record, and I move this amendment which Senator Garret FitzGerald will second in due course, formally, because I believe, as I have said before, that the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919 does far less than justice to the property owner and those of us who had to operate that Act as legal practitioners or auctioneers know that people under that Act have been shamefully treated in the compensation they got. People will come along and complain to Deputies and Senators but they will then say to the aggrieved owner: &ldquo;it is too bad&rdquo;; and the Minister <Col N="679" /> will say &ldquo;it is provided by the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, which prevents me from doing what you want to do. That is the law.&rdquo; Now is the time to change the law. I have no doubt that the Minister will recommend to the House not to change it. With no confidence whatever do I recommend the amendment to the House though there is every justification for it.</P>

      <P>I would like to reply to the Minister on that. The Minister was not entirely audible on this side of the House. Perhaps he was shy in confessing that I had clearly anticipated and analysed his state of mind and reaction to this most moderate and reasonable amendment. When I said I recommend the amendment to the House with no confidence I meant, as the Minister quite clearly knows, that I had no hope whatsoever that the Minister would recommend his Party in this House to accept this amendment. I had no confidence whatsoever in that happening and I had no confidence whatsoever in the Minister's ability to assess the difference between the Land Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845 or the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919 and it was for that reason I anticipated that the amendment would not be accepted and that the Minister would not recommend it to his Party in the House.</P>

I did not want the House to accept merely my word for it. I went to the trouble of bringing in this tome&mdash;<i>Cripps on Compensation</i>&mdash;so that members of the House would know what they are enacting in this Bill. I hope at some future stage that members of the Minister's Party will in the conclaves they have from time to time, the meetings which different groups have with different Ministers, will try to urge on their Ministers to accept the more just Act, the Land Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, rather than the Acquisition of Land Act, 1919. In doing that they will not be robbing anybody. They will be ensuring that they will not leave any former holder of land with a grievance that will aggravate him.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 51, before &ldquo;after&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or such longer period as the Minister may allow where the claimant for compensation has been ill or out of the country&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment to section 3 of the Bill. It is an amendment which I would hope on this occasion the Minister might accept. The Minister and myself got very unusually close to one another in our views on the frailties of human nature on the Second Stage of the Bill. It is quite clear, no matter what period you lay down for the bringing of actions or any claims that there will always be somebody late. It does not matter what the time is; if it is six years people will make a claim in the seventh year or if it is two years people will make a claim in the third year. There are, however, cases where claims will be made out of time because people are under some kind of disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mind you in the Statute of Limitations Act, 1957 and its predecessors, the various Statutes of Limitation before that, allowance was always made for people who make claims to <Col N="681" /> establish the legal rights outside the period of limitation provided by the statutes if they were ill or mentally incapacitated or they were out of the jurisdiction or were, in the pharse used in those days, &ldquo;beyond the seas.&rdquo; We do not have colonies or anything like that which require the use of that phrase in modern times but we do have emigration and I suggest in this case that where a person fails to bring a claim in time if the Minister is satisfied that the person concerned was mentally ill or merely physically ill and allowed the time to expire or if the person was out of the country, as could happen with people who have gone to England or emigrated elsewhere&mdash;maybe this does not happen often but it could happen&mdash;the Minister should be able to do something about it.</P>
    <P>We should give power to the Minister to say: &ldquo;Yes, so-and-so was sick or out of the country and did not know this order had been made for the acquisition of this land and in the circumstances I will exercise my discretion and extend the time.&rdquo; That is a reasonable power to invest in any Minister and I am sure any Minister would act reasonably in the exercise of that power. We ought to give the Minister this power to meet those genuine hard luck cases. Those are not congenital late comers we are dealing with. Those are people who have genuinely been unable to make the claim in time. They have very genuine reasons for being unable to do so.</P>

      <P>I should dearly love to have something some time or other from Senator Quigley so I could say that this is going to be the time but this is not so with regard to this amendment. The amendment, first of all, does not appeal to me at all in the sense that I do not see where it improves the situation to a degree that would be regarded as necessarily reasonable and, secondly, even if we were to allow it or agree to it, it just would not make any sense. The wording would be meaningless if it was inserted, as is proposed here. If that were not so and any meaning <Col N="682" /> could be taken of it the question of defining illness or proving it would be very difficult. With regard to &ldquo;out of the country&rdquo; what does that mean? How long would one have to be out of the country? How would you show the person had been out of the country or was coming back to qualify this matter which might arise for this extension?</P>
      <P>All in all, the amendment is meaningless.If there was any meaning in it, no matter how you approached it it could not be accepted or I could not recommend to the House that they should accept it. First, last and all the time, as I said on Committee Stage, the position in the Bill seems on all heads to be reasonable and adequate and, indeed, if anything a rather more lengthy period than is, in fact, dictated by the circumstances which really can arise in the operation of this particular part of the Bill. Therefore, I cannot in any way see how this amendment could be accepted and I could not recommend its acceptance to the House.</P>

      <P>There is a common fallacy that the office of Parliamentary draftsman is one to which Members of Parliament have access and that the draftsman is someone who is available to assist Members of Parliament in drafting amendments. Unfortunately, the Parliamentary draftsman is a civil servant whose services are available only to Ministers of State. If the Minister was well disposed to the principle of my amendment, and I rather think the House would agree with the principle of the amendment, he might do what I could not do: he could have said to the Parliamentary draftsman: &ldquo;Would you put that into parliamentary language&rdquo;. The Minister complains, and I was almost beginning to pity him in his complaint, that he could not accept it on the grounds of drafting, but that complaint is completely false and insincere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to his other difficulties, I have no quarrel with the Minister on this, but I would refer to his difficulty about the definition of illness. If the Minister will look at Chapter II of Part III of the Statute of Limitations of 1957 he will find that in that case the <Col N="683" /> Act refers to persons of unsound mind. In that Act there is no way of determining when a person is of unsound mind but the discretion of the court and the common sense of the law itself has enabled everybody to determine whether a person is of unsound mind or not.</P>
    <P>Then there is the difficulty about a person being out of the country. If the Minister was in earnest about this difficulty he could well have put in a provision which would make the matter quite clear but no doubt he was not prepared to accept the amendment at all. If he does not accept it there will be people who will come to Deputies and Senators, people who have been away in England for over a year, and they will say that as matters stand they are not entitled to compensation and ask what can be done about it. At that stage, under the Bill, a letter to the Minister will be of no avail. All I want to do is to give to the Minister discretionary power to extend the time; that is an eminently reasonable suggestion. I had hoped that the Minister would accept the amendment but I have been disappointed in this case.</P>

      <P>In page 10, line 2, before &ldquo;the&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;the Minister after consultation with&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular amendment is a case in which we are providing for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries more power than he has sought under the Bill, section 8 of which provides that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries shall keep the accounts of the five fishery harbours in such form as may be approved of by the Minister for Finance. It is true that on the Committee Stage of the Bill the Minister did indicate that he would be prepared to keep the accounts in the normal form in which the accounts of trading and commercial companies are kept. I do not know if the Minister is aware of the amount of difficulty that is encountered by any Department when dealing with the Department of Finance. There <Col N="684" /> are volumes of correspondence and, in the end, it is the officials of the Department of Finance who always prevail.</P>
    <P>So that they may not prevail in this instance I have suggested that it is the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries who should determine, in the first instance, the form that the accounts will take and that he will then consult with the Minister for Finance to see if that form of accounts is all right. I have suggested in the amendment that the accounts be kept in such form as the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, will decide. The Minister will be the determining authority; he will consult with the Minister for Finance but it is the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries who will have the last word. It is to ensure that no difficulties will be raised by the Department of Finance that I have put down this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that what has probably been overlooked by the proposer of this amendment is that in this case the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will keep the accounts of the five major harbour centres. I think it would be far from rational if we should also stipulate that the person who keeps the accounts should also be the person designated to approve of the method of their keeping. What I have already said is true, that the keeping of the accounts in any manner that will be of value to the Minister will be at his discretion regardless of the format that will be sought or approved of by the Minister for Finance. If the Minister for Finance sought a format other than that desired by the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Agriculture is quite free to keep the accounts in more detail and to his own satisfaction. To give this power to the Minister for Finance is the proper thing to do in this instance and it does not in any way take from the detail or commercial form which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries may desire and have carried out in regard to these accounts which, in fact, are to all intents and purposes kept by him in respect of any or all of these major fishery centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> The Senator will appreciate that since the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will be the keeper of the accounts it is far from being a rational situation that he should be designated as the person approving of the manner in which they are kept, in other words, if given power to approve that which he himself had already done. I do not think that that would be a good precedent to establish either in relation to this particular operation or indeed to any other.</P>

      <P>It is very commendable on the part of the Minister not to require this particular authority. I do not wish to delay the House beyond saying that I do not agree with the interpretation of the Minister of subsection (1) of section 8. I would have hoped that the amendment would have obviated the kind of difficulty which the Minister possibly foresees, that is, where he would keep one set of accounts to suit his requirements and the Minister for Finance would require another set to suit his requirements.</P>
      <P>I would have thought that it would be better that the Minister, knowing the record within the harbour centres, would prescribe the form these accounts would take. At the end of the day no matter who approves or does not approve, they will have to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. That the Minister or manager of the centre will be the keeper of the accounts does not seem to carry a great deal of weight for the reason that in every Department and sub-office there is a particular officer who is the accounting officer, but that does not mean that he can decide the form the accounts take. These are decided by the Minister for Finance or the Comptroller and Auditor General, or both. I think the amendment is a better form of drafting for this particular amendment so that there will be no doubt when the format of the accounts comes to be decided, but the Minister will decide the format and then he will consult with the Minister for Finance to get his views on them.</P>

      <P>In page 10, line 43, before &ldquo;made&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and bye-law&rdquo; and to delete &ldquo;section 2 of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment which I think the House should have no difficulty in accepting. What I am trying to achieve is to bring in the standard form of procedure where regulations or orders made by the Minister shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The section, as drafted, merely contemplates that the order made by the Minister under section 2 will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. There are other orders which the Minister will make under the Bill and there are various bye-laws which he will make under section 4 fixing rates, tolls and other charges for the use of facilities.</P>
      <P>I think it is very desirable, if not necessary, that bye-laws or regulations or orders imposing tolls and charges, and so on, should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. If they are not, there is no way in which parties aggrieved after an order has been made can have it rectified except by the long and tortuous procedure of putting down a Parliamentary question or motion. A Parliamentary question as far as this House is concerned does not exist. What I am seeking is to make it obligatory to have all bye-laws and orders laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>In that connection, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, bye-laws made by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána in many cases were not laid before each House of the Oireachtas. That is now being changed under the Road Traffic Bill, 1967, so as to provide that certain bye-laws made by the Commissioner will be made in the form of regulations by the Minister for Local Government, and all of those will in future be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. In this particular case I am merely conforming to what the norm is in relation to all regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that Senator O'Quigley is not correct in regard <Col N="687" /> to the precedent which he says exists, that this sort of order and its publication are normal requirements, far from it. This type of order and these bye-laws will contain a mass of detail which would not be, and is not, normally required to be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Another very significant thing about this particular matter in the Bill is that the order under section 4 will be made by the Minister or his agents acting as a harbour authority in the future which will be subsequent to his making the orders specified under section 2 which must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What this will bring about now and in future is that where these orders and bye-laws are in question they will be made not by the Minister as a Minister but rather as a Minister acting as a harbour authority, harbour authorities that now exist not only in these five particular major centres designated under this Bill but in all other harbours.Why have these powers? Harbour authorities now have powers to make orders and bye-laws and they are not and never have been required to have them placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Why should the Minister merely because he is a Minister who is taking over from harbour authorities who had powers to make bye-laws and orders in the past in respect of these particular ports be required to put them before the Houses of the Oireachtas when nobody else either now, in the past or in the future, have been or will be required to do so? I would say straight away that this has not been an omission over the years but has been in keeping with the type of matter and details that had to be dealt with from time to time by harbour authorities big and small throughout the country. It was only in keeping with the normal approach to this matter of not presenting them, and, indeed, one might even say cluttering up the Houses of the Oireachtas with orders and bye-laws and minute details of day-to-day administration and, indeed, frequent changes of these orders and bye-laws, that this procedure has been in existence and continuously <Col N="688" /> in existence in regard to the operation of various ports by whatever sort of harbour authority may be in existence at the time.</P>
    <P>This is a point that has not been properly appreciated, and I feel further that it is not recognised that, in taking over from the existing harbour authorities in respect of some of these five centres, it is laid down in the Bill that any orders or bye-laws in existence at the time of the takeover will continue to be enforced as if they had been made under section 4.</P>
    <P>Presumably, arising from that, it may be that it will be a facility to amend those orders. Therefore, we would have the rare situation of bye-laws and orders being enforced which were made by harbour authorities in the past but construed as being in operation from the takeover by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, which Minister thereafter, acting as the harbour authority, may amend these orders, and the requirements of this amendment presumably would be to bring these orders and bye-laws before the Oireachtas. In other words, if they were to be changed by the Minister they would have to be brought here though the original orders never were required to be brought here.</P>
    <P>These are not the type of things that require to be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas and have not been in practice brought before them. Precedence is not there and the reason for this is well grounded in that such orders contain masses, in some cases, of day-to-day detail. There is a distinction between orders to be made under section 2 and under section 4. In section 2 it is the Minister acting as the Minister who appropriately brings them before the House in respect of what he proposes to take over and what he proposes to do. Once a centre has been taken over then what we are dealing with in section 4 is rather the operation of the port thereafter and the substitution of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries as the new harbour authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Minister in not wishing to be subjected to those constraints to which existing harbour authorities are not <Col N="689" /> subjected&mdash;being obliged to lay bye-laws and orders in relation to harbour centres before each House of the Oireachtas. However, there is a distinction.In relation to existing harbour authorities, one will find that whereas these various authorities were perhaps constituted under private Acts of Parliament or under charter, they were at all times, and still are, privately owned bodies. Therefore, there is a distinction between that kind of harbour authorities and the ones we are establishing here in which public moneys are invested. Even if there was not such a distinction there is, in my view, every reason to provide that bye-laws made by any harbour authority should be subject to the overriding authority of Parliament. I can recall, in my experience as a lawyer, seeing some of the bye-laws made by the Dublin Harbour Authority, the Port and Docks Board, and people have been subjected to new landing charges, warehousing charges and so on, on the say so of the board, with no redress whatsoever for those who use the port. It was no use anybody talking to Deputies or Senators because there was nothing anybody could do about it. I know of one instance in which the change in landing charges by a particular harbour authority was so steep as to give rise to considerable opposition among shippers and shipping agents and warehousing people, but there was nothing effective anybody could do about it.</P>
      <P>That is always the position when you have got a monopoly. The existing harbour authorities are like the Irish Turf Club who make regulations about the training of racehorses, the licensing of trainers and jockeys and the admission to enclosures. They are a private concern.We can contrast that with the position of Bord na gCon under the Greyhound Industry Act. What used to be the preserve of the Irish Coursing Club ceased to be the preserve of that club and became vested in the new body, Bord na gCon, and the regulations made by them or by the Minister in relation to them fall into a different category. Their regulations have to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas; those of the Turf Club do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="690" /> All this is the consequence of bringing certain portions of private enterprise within the ambit of the public sphere. What is more important is that in this case we are using public moneys. It gets us back to the whole principle of the accountability of Ministers to Parliament in respect of public moneys. As well as that, it seems to me that where one has a bye-law whose contravention as in this Bill under subsection (6) of section 4 is an offence involving, on summary conviction, a fine not exceeding £100 or at the discretion of the court a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months or both fine and imprisonment&mdash;something analogous to the penalties to be imposed for drunken driving&mdash;when you have that kind of bye-law it ceases to be a matter of private concern for the Minister and his agent, the harbour authority. It is something that should be subject to the scrutiny of Parliament. Therefore, I am not at all convinced by anything the Minister has said. All of these bye-laws, especially that which gives rise to a fine of £100 or/and imprisonment of six months, are of such a character as to warrant their being laid before both or either House of the Oireachtas to be amended or rejected by the Oireachtas. Accordingly, the amendment should be accepted.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulties of the wool trade over the past few years are well known. Credit restrictions abroad and, perhaps even more importantly, competition from man-made fibres brought about a decline in prices. Nevertheless there is a future for our wool but only provided it is of good quality and graded, presented and marketed efficiently. The purpose of the Bill before the House is to improve the presentation and marketing of <Col N="691" /> wool. In the meantime the Government is in no way unmindful of the difficulties of mountain sheep farmers as is evidenced by the Mountain Lamb Subsidy Scheme under which this year a subsidy of £1 each will be paid on suitable lambs of the Blackface Mountain and Cheviot breeds in mountain flocks.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives effect to the recommendations of the Committee on Wool Improvements, whose report was presented to this House in July, 1966. The terms of reference of the committee were:</P>
      <P>To consider and recommend desirable improvements in the quality, handling and marketing of Irish wool, including the question of grading.</P>
      <P>The committee consisted of 12 members representing producers, traders, manufactures, the Agricultural Institute and my Department. It was, therefore, fully representative of the interests concerned.</P>
      <P>The main recommendations of the committee, as incorporated in the Bill, fall broadly under four headings:</P>
      <P>(1)wool to be bought from producers on a graded basis;</P>
      <P>(2)buyers of wool to be registered with my Department;</P>
      <P>(3)exporters of wool to be licensed by my Department;</P>
      <P>(4)a council&mdash;called An Chomhairle Olla in the Bill&mdash;to be established, on which producers and traders will be represented and which will have functions relating to the grading of wool, the standards for registration, the standards to be observed by wool exporters, as well as the promotion of wool exports and the securing of the maximum use of home-produced wool by Irish manufacturers.</P>
      <P>To bring about an improvement in the presentation of Irish wool on both the home and export markets, the grading of wool is clearly vital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, provides in section 11 for the making of regulations <Col N="692" /> for the purchase of wool on a graded basis, and, where such regulations apply, purchases in contravention of them will be an offence. It is the intention that, as the Committee on Wool Improvements recommends, the grading system will be simple and easily understood and that the regulations will provide for price premiums where wool is of good quality, and for deductions where it has defects, but the basic price of wool will not be fixed. It will also be obligatory for buyers to give producers statements giving prescribed details of purchases.</P>
    <P>I come, now, to the question of the registration of wool buyers, which is dealt with in sections 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11. These provisions are very important because, unless buyers have got suitable premises and competent staff&mdash;and these are the broad requirements for registration&mdash;any regulations that might be made for the purchase of wool on a graded basis could be stultified. The advice of An Chomhairle Olla will be obtained on the standards for registration, and, in the light of this advice, regulations will be made dealing with premises and the associated plant and machinery. Existing buyers of wool will be entitled to registration if their premises and associated plant and machinery comply with the provisions of the relevant regulations. Their continued registration will be subject to their compliance with the Act and any regulations made thereunder.</P>
    <P>The licensing of wool exporters under section 7 will not involve any detailed control on wool exports. Existing exporters will be entitled to receive licences initially, but the continuance of their licences and the issue of new licences will depend on the suitability of the licensee as an exporter.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill sets out what is to be done if it is proposed to cancel registration or revoke a licence. Briefly, a month's notice of intention must be given to the person concerned, who has the right to request an inquiry into the matter. Where that happens, a practising barrister of at least ten years standing will be appointed to carry out the inquiry. Wherever the final decision <Col N="693" /> is to cancel or revoke, as the case may be, a statement of the reasons involved will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn, now, to the provisions dealing with An Chomhairle Olla, which are contained in sections 12 to 18 and in the Schedule. An Chomhairle Olla will include representatives of producers and the trade. There has been some misunderstanding of the position about this. I should, therefore, like to draw attention to Article 6 of the Schedule. That lays down the minimum representation on each side and not, as seems to have been thought in some quarters, the maximum,</P>
    <P>An Chomhairle will play a vital role in the successful implementation of a rational system of wool marketing. It will be relied on for advice about grading and standards for registration. It will also fix a code of practice to be observed by exporters. Furthermore, it will be empowered to undertake promotion measures, such as mounting publicity campaigns abroad to stimulate exports, and will consider ways of increasing the use of home-produced wool by Irish manufacturers. It will, therefore, become the focal point of all wool improvement efforts. In the course of time it may become clear that other functions should appropriately be assigned to it. For that reason, provision is made in section 14 of the Bill for the making of orders, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, assigning further functions to An Chomhairle.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the recommendation of the Committee on Wool Improvements, An Chomhairle Olla will not, itself, engage in the purchase and sale of wool. The reasons for this are set out in paragraphs 128 to 134 of the committee's report, which points out that, in our circumstances, a marketing board</P>
    <P>would have to relate its purchase prices for wool to the realised prices on world markets. The only solution to this problem appeared to the Committee to be a two-part price system comprising a basic payment to producers at the time of purchase of <Col N="694" /> their wool and an appropriate extra payment later related to the board's resale receipts.</P>
    <P>The financing of a wool marketing board would involve heavy capital to meet wool purchase and operational costs. Also it has been represented that the operational costs of a board could be expected to be high especially in view of the relatively small size of individual producers' clips in this country and the necessity to operate a two-part price system.</P>
    <P>The Committee while believing that ultimately the establishment of a wool board might become feasible and generally accepted, considers that at this stage it would be preferable to introduce such control measures as are necessary in the short term within the framework of the existing trade.</P>
    <P>The committee also states that &ldquo;should the measures it has recommended prove inadequate in the course of time and experience, a more thorough organisation of marketing under a wool board should be adopted&rdquo;. Two members of the committee, however, signed the report with the reservation that they would not favour the organisation of marketing under a wool board, while, on the other hand, one member thought that &ldquo;the only ultimate solution is a complete marketing board&rdquo;, and signed the report &ldquo;as a stepping stone to such a board&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I accept the general consensus of views expressed by the committee. I believe that the first essentials are grading, registration and export promotion under central authority, and that these objectives can be fully realised without the major, and possibly hazardous, step of taking over the job of buying and selling. In other words, I believe in a combination of private and public enterprise in this particular sector of our agriculture, but my views are not fixed and rigid, and I am prepared to re-examine the position, if necessary, in the light of a few years experience of the functioning of this Bill. My expectation, however, is that the fundamental objective of <Col N="695" /> securing the best possible return for our wool by raising the standard of presentation and marketing can be secured under this Bill which, as I have said, gives effect to the recommendatons of persons who have a detailed knowledge and long experience of all aspects of the trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with mixed feelings of pleasure and disappointment that I read the Bill and have listened to the Minister's speech. I am quite sure that there is no farmer who can ever say that he knows everything about farming, and if that is true it is even more true about sheep production. As the Minister has pointed out in his speech, the last few years have seen the wool business having an uphill struggle to compete with man-made fibres in the great wool producing countries of Australia and New Zealand where, I think, the emphasis is on wool production rather than on mutton and lamb, whereas here we seem up to now to have concentrated on lamb and mutton rather than on wool. Any measure the Minister can bring into this House to improve the marketing arrangements and to improve quality and thereby in the long run benefit the producer must be welcomed.We will congratulate him for doing so and I am sure the farming community will thank him for the end result. Having said that, I suppose the Minister will say &ldquo;Beware of the Greeks when they come bringing gifts&rdquo;. I have some criticism which I will make at a later stage.</P>
      <P>The section dealing with the control of the purchase of wool is something which is long overdue. Some years back a campaign was launched called the &ldquo;Clean Wool Campaign&rdquo; and it endeavoured to do what is now to be enacted in this Bill&mdash;to ensure that the haphazard producer who presented his fleece for sale with daggings and other impurities would be penalised. All the campaign succeeded in doing was to persuade the farmers to discontinue branding their sheep with tar and to use the recommended marking fluids.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all too often heard of the inefficient producers getting the same <Col N="696" /> price and in some cases more than the producer who tried to present his fleece in the best possible condition and in the best possible way to get the higher price. Unfortunate producers who went to the trouble and expense of having their sheep washed thoroughly before being shorn found the sheep lost weight. These people got nothing to compensate by way of price over the producer who did not do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>If the provision in the Bill provides compensation for the efficient producer of wool the measure is to be welcomed. The section in the Bill which really disappointed me was that which deals with the setting up of the wool council, An Chomhairle Olla. The Minister here seemed to set about achieving something. He got so far and failed to complete the job. From his speech here this evening it would seem that with the passage of time this council may materialise into something bigger than is presented to us in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The committee investigating wool production did not unanimously recommend a wool marketing board. We can see the obstacles, the cost, the personnel involved and the various other factors which would have to be taken into consideration. With the passage of time and with the experience which must be gained from this council a full wool marketing board will emerge. Under this Bill we have a council which has neither power nor responsibility. The Minister is to receive recommendations from them. They can advise but they cannot bear any responsibility for anything which goes wrong. They are to be just purely an advisory body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will on their advice have grading experts trained and in that respect it will require a huge number of personnel to carry out that very important job and it will take some considerable time, indeed, to have sufficient men trained in that job. The Committees of Agriculture, to my mind, can play a very important part in this in that they can, should they be provided by the Department with the essential advisers, advise the sheep <Col N="697" /> producers on the best methods of wool production, the best methods of presentation, the standard required and how the grading can affect the price of presentation for sale.</P>
    <P>The small buyer is the person who will merit my considerable sympathy when this Bill is enacted. There are some buyers in the wool trade who have operated for a number of years on a small scale. Their overheads will be very much smaller than the bigger merchants. Their houses and equipment will be quite suitable to their needs and because their overheads are low they are very often able to give that extra penny per pound which is so essential and so welcome to the sheep farmer when he comes to sell the fleece. Is he to be victimised under this Bill? Is he to be receive something by way of compensation or something by way of grant to bring up his premises to the necessary requirement? Are the buyers to become a monopoly so that the farmers must sell to the bigger combines and those small men will be put out of business?</P>
    <P>There is a provision in the Bill that existing exporters will be registered and if they have in time lived up to their requirements they will be allowed to continue but if not they will be put out of business. There are to my mind loose ends in the Bill which I think would be better tackled on Committee Stage. There are many items in it which I certainly welcome and there are a number on which I should like more information. In that regard I think we could leave it until Committee Stage, but, perhaps, the Minister in his reply would indicate why in the Schedule An Chomhairle Olla should have to acquire, hold and dispose of land. This is something I cannot understand. For what purpose would they require to buy, hold and acquire land? Perhaps the Minister would give us a little bit more information on that.</P>
    <P>The fixing of standards will be extremely important and, as I said, it will take a long time to have the necessary personnel trained. In the meantime I repeat that it would be advisable to have the Committees of Agriculture with some officers fully competent to advise and instruct the wool producers <Col N="698" /> on the best methods of production and presentation. The inevitable price has to be paid for all this. We have provision made in the Bill that a levy would be recovered from the sale of the wool to pay for it and I hope that what we are giving with one hand the Minister will not take away with the other. In so far as the Bill will bring about some long overdue improvements in the wool marketing situation I welcome it and I look for further improvement on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, the main purpose of which is to improve the presentation and marketing of wool. We are all aware of the fact that since history was written in this country sheep and wool have been important elements of our economy. It is on record that the Irish were such experts in the manufacture of wool products that the British passed an Act in 1641 to try to destroy the wool trade of the country. It was about that time that flax and linen began to take over from wool in the economy. In the time of the Gobán Saor great value was always put on the fleece and it is encouraging to see the Minister bring in this Bill to ensure that those producing wool will have a fair chance of getting a good cash return for their labours.</P>
      <P>The fact that this country has in the past been so expert in producing wool products should mean that we will reap great benefit from the provisions of this Bill. If we could cash in on the potential on the sale abroad and at home of articles made from wool such as Aran sweaters and carpets, this could be a good expanding industry and those producing sheep and wool would be remunerated for their labours. The scheme recently introduced by the Minister which gave a subsidy of £1 per head for mountain lambs was welcome to all sheep producers and it is something for which they are tremendously grateful. For a long time they were trying to raise sheep under hazardous conditions because of the poverty of the soil, the high altitudes in which they were reared and the serious losses at lambing time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any legislation that will help the producer to get a fair price for his wool <Col N="699" /> will be welcome. In the past sheep owners have had many grievances because of the methods of marketing and presentation then prevailing. Quite frequently one or two buyers went around the country and bought up most of the wool crop at their own prices. The combines and the cartels made their own prices and it was only later that the producers learned that the price they had been given was below the world price. Those people gave to the producer whatever it was their pleasure to give them. That was a most unsatisfactory state of affairs and one that could not encourage people in sheep breeding.</P>
    <P>In many parts of the country sheep rearing is the main way of life and in most of the counties where sheep farming is followed we find the most densely populated parts of the country. The farms are small and the valuations are small because the farms might comprise of large tracts of poor mountain land of not much value. Very often the value of the wool grown on that land is not as good as the value of the wool grown on better land but I think that a market could be found for that type of wool in the manufacture of carpets and other woollen fabrics.</P>
    <P>This matter of ensuring that in future wool will be bought on a graded basis is very important. The marking of the wool with tar was injurious to the wool itself and did not help to get a good price for it. In recent years more interest is being taken in wool and sheep farming by virtue of the encouragement given by the mountain subsidy scheme and because of the new board which is being set up under this Bill which will ensure that there will be better facilities for those engaged in the industry. I welcome this Bill which will be an encouragement to the sheep and wool farmers who in the past were not classed in the upper ten of the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the Government introduced a scheme of temendous benefit to people in the mountain regions by which grants were given for the fencing of large tracts of the <Col N="700" /> mountains and also for the fencing of lambing enclosures. These grants were of great value to those living in those areas and they appreciate them very much. These people are glad to see an effort being made to ensure that the wool will be bought on a graded basis, that there will be registered buyers, that those exporting wool will have to have a licence and that as much wool as possible will be used in the production of woollen goods in this country.</P>
    <P>In some areas the dipping of sheep has become very important in recent years and it is good to see an effort being made to ensure that sheep will be dipped regularly. There have been complaints in some areas from boards of conservators that the effluent from sheep-dipping tanks was causing pollution of rivers but when that complaint was investigated it was found that there was no basis for it. Despite that some sheep baths were closed down and the sheep farmers resented this very much.</P>
    <P>Again I welcome the Bill and I feel that it is another milestone in the advance that is being made and another of the benefits being given to those engaged in this difficult and hazardous form of farming. It is a form of farming always beset with difficulties but the farmers engaged in it are hard workers who work long hours and who, when they feel they are being treated reasonably well, give a good performance.The people of those areas will be deeply grateful for this effort to improve their way of life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is not right for a person who is not a farmer to speak on a Bill such as this but I want to raise a point of criticism. I know enough about history, geography and farming to appreciate that the farming community involved in the rearing of sheep are mostly in the poorer counties and are a section of the farming community that have been most in need of assistance. They are resident in areas where emigration has been worst and we know that many farms have been deserted, farms where the families were formerly engaged in the rearing of sheep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we are dealing with the Wool Marketing Bill 1968 approving the <Col N="701" /> establishment of An Chomhairle Olla and this arises from a report of the Committee on Wool Improvements which report was approved in July, 1966, two years ago. Now we have a Bill in 1968 proposing to implement the recommendations of that committee.I should have thought in all seriousness that there was a measure of urgency about this; that the problems of the farmers engaged in the production of sheep and in the marketing of wool were so serious as to need the urgent attention of the Minister. I imagine that the farmers concerned are probably not as well organised and as forcible in their demands as, for example, the creamery milk suppliers, and that is not in any way criticism of the latter. As the Minister explained in his speech, he is largely implementing what the committee recommended in their report published in July, 1966. I should like to hear an explanation from the Minister as to why proposals recommended, and apparently generally accepted, two years ago have to wait two years before they are put into a Bill and presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is good enough. I think this should have been a matter of urgency. There is nothing in the Minister's speech to explain why two years have elapsed between the receipt of the report of the committee and the promoting of legislation. We are told that legislation takes time to prepare. We have Parliamentary draftsmen of whom we hear such a lot about here, but we have had other cases where legislation has been prepared and has gone through the Houses of the Oireachtas very quickly.</P>
    <P>This is a measure on which there is no opposition at all. It is welcomed all round. While I have that criticism to make I have equally something to say in that I welcome the Bill and I hope that An Chomhairle Olla will be established quickly when the Bill has been passed and that it will meet with the success that similar boards have met with which have been established to increase the wealth of our agricultural community. I would wish that An Chomhairle Olla would be equally successful but I do want to make this <Col N="702" /> criticism and I hope the Minister in his reply will give an explanation as to why two years have elapsed between the submission of the report of the committee and the production of the necessary legislation.</P>

      <P>I just cannot see this as anything but another barefaced takeover bid. The Department of Agriculture are far more concerned with empire building than getting competent groups together to do the job. The last speaker wondered why it took two years to get on to this problem. In point of fact, it has not taken two years but 15 years since the national groups concerned, Macra na Feirme and the National Farmers Association, made it crystal clear that it was necessary to put wool as well as every other agricultural product on a quality basis if we were to compete on a world market. It took 15 years to get that proposal translated into the paltry legislation we have here tonight.</P>
      <P>Macra na Feirme were the first into this field and they and the National Farmers in full co-operation with the Agricultural Organisation Society put their own meagre resources to work in the 50's. The Minister's predecessor Seán Moylan, ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam&mdash;no greater Minister ever graced the Department of Agriculture&mdash; strongly supported the idea of payment for quality. Vested interests of all sorts tried to sabotage the Macra na Feirme scheme but they failed in that design. A great deal of that success was due to both Mr. John Callanan and the Rev. Father Reidy who both did a first-class job on slender resources. It was crystal clear to them from the beginning that wool marketing could only be made to work satisfactorily if a full wool marketing board was set up, the type of marketing board which all our agriculturists have seen to be absolutely necessary in a modern economy. They called for it and it was not two years ago but right through the 1950's and into the 1960's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no excuse to say the amount involved is too big. The value of the wool crop is £3,500,000. That is a small amount in the context of the total production of agriculture, and the question of stabilising that from year <Col N="703" /> to year even if the State had to contribute the lot would cost but £250,000. That would be giving £250,000 to £500,000 to the most deserving sector of our community, the small wool producers, especially if the large wool producers were partially excluded. It would be easy to ensure that State equalisation could take account of the amount sold by any wool producer. Why has it not been done? Simply because there are too many vested interests involved in this, the same vested interests that acted against the NFA scheme. They are still with us, still fighting and they will keep fighting for a long time.</P>
    <P>A wool marketing board is the only sure and complete method, not a marketing board under the Minister and his Department but a board preferably organised and directed by the IAOS, which is where it should be, where the late Senator Seán Moylan would have put it, where any progressive Minister for Agriculture in Europe would have put it, under the central body of the co-operative movement.That is where the Danes have put it, that is where the New Zealanders have organised it. Why should we not learn from their success stories?</P>
    <P>Such an organisation should be completely distinct from the Department of Agriculture. It should be on a co-operative or a semi-State basis and its board should reflect the same independence of outlook and have elected representatives from the wool producers as well as from any other interests who are co-operating with them in handling and marketing. The chief people concerned are the small people producing the wool crop but you cannot have wool in isolation. There are associated economies: there is the question of producing mutton as well and, therefore, it should be integrated in the manner of the work being done by the sheep committee of the NFA.</P>
    <P>I laugh to think of the Minister's glib write-off of the NFA when he says that all they are concerned with is the maintenance of inter-organisation rivalry. The manner in which our agricultural sector is being developed by the Minister <Col N="704" /> for Agriculture would not be tolerated by any civilised country on either side of the Iron Curtain. The sooner the Minister realises the facts of life, that agriculture must be organised and that the only group who have the organisation to do this at present are the NFA, the better.</P>
    <P>The Minister has set out in the Bill the standards that will apply to buyers of wool. Their premises must be adequate.They must have adequate plant and machinery. They must have suitable staff. Why not apply the same standards to any group who attempt to call themselves an agricultural organisation?Why not look at their premises and their approach to the problem and compare them with the type of approach that has developed and has been found necessary and successful in our competitor countries? Surely Senator Murphy would not agree that every group who say &ldquo;We are a trade union&rdquo; should be automatically accepted by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions?</P>

We had better realise that central fact. This is too critical and too serious a time for petty difficulties and if the Minister cannot resolve them it is up to the Taoiseach to see that he is shifted to some other Department which can use <Col N="706" /> his tactics.

There are many Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party, either in the Cabinet or out of it, who could lead agriculture. If the Minister fails to lead his Department, then rightly or wrongly he should be shifted from that Department. The first duty of the Minister is to lead and this lack of leadership is shown in agriculture by the utter neglect of the co-operative <Col N="707" /> movement and by a megalomania to gather all functions under the Department with the most dismal record of organisation. The Department have failed to co-operate with other Departments even to the extent of the production of their second programme for agriculture. Their target failures were even worse than the failures that were reported in the other targets of the second programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am returning to the Bill because it epitomises everything that is worst in the organisation of agriculture in this or any other country. Therefore, I should like from Seanad Éireann to speak out plainly on this measure and let it be seen for what it is. It is going to be totally ineffective because it does not grasp the problem, which is the creation of a wool marketing board in close connection with the sheep committee as organised through the National Farmers Association, the board being developed by the Irish co-operative movement in the genuine spirit of that movement, the spirit of Father Finlay, the spirit of Horace Plunkett and the spirit of Father Coyne and all the other distinguished Presidents of the co-operative movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that if our sheep prices are to increase and to be returned to the prices that were in the country 18 months ago what we and the Irish farmers require is a proper wool marketing organisation, and in <Col N="708" /> my view also this can best be achieved through co-operation. I was glad to note that the Minister in his speech referred to the composition of the proposed wool marketing board when he pointed out that the figures in the Schedule to the Bill were the minimum figures and not the maximum, that is as regards the number of members of the board who were to be selected from the primary producers, the farmers. In this Schedule the Minister now has a glorious opportunity of displaying once again, and it will indeed be more effective than all the assurances that he gives, that he has no quarrel with any section of the farming community and that he will put on the proposed Comhairle Olla sufficient primary producers to ensure that every section of sheep-rearing farmers will be represented on the proposed council.</P>
      <P>There are, indeed, vast differences in the husbandry between hill-farmers in, perhaps, the South of the country or the North of the country and the woolmen we have in the Midlands in the plains where tillage farmers buy in sheep in the autumn and winter them and their work in raising these sheep is altogether different. Again, the mixed farmers in the tillage areas in the Midlands do not qualify for the mountain lamb subsidy scheme and, therefore, they are at a disadvantage in so far as they cannot claim the £1 subsidy per lamb. These people, too, have been losing money on sheep in the past year. This is the main reason why the numbers of sheep have shown such a terrific decline in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot of trouble and controversy throughout the country with wild allegations being made that the farmers are not co-operating with the Minister or the Department of Agriculture.I should like to assert that this is not so. In every instance when Irish farmers were asked to either increase production or increase standards they have done so on every conceivable occasion. Two years ago when the new regulations were brought in about the clean wool campaign and the anti-sheep scab campaign there was tremendous co-operation and the scheme certainly achieved what it was intended to do. I am genuinely disappointed, more especially when we saw the comprehensive <Col N="709" /> manner in which the Minister brought in every angle in the last Bill before the House here, that the Minister did not avail of this opportunity of transferring from the county councils to the county committees of agriculture the duties and functions of the sheep dipping committees. Those are committees that in many counties do not meet too often. Their function is so limited that I feel it would best be carried out by the county committees of agriculture who meet regularly and have the advisory staffs to carry out the work. That could very easily have been brought in in some degree under this Bill as it certainly has to do with the clean wool campaign and the prevention of scab in sheep.</P>
    <P>Looking at the excellent campaign carried out by the British Wool Council&mdash;I do not know what its exact designation is&mdash;those people have, over the past few years, done a tremendous job in bringing back wool into the everyday lives of the citizens of Britain. A lot of that campaign has overflowed into our country in no uncertain manner, and I believe that wool is now again more than ever taking its place and competing very effectively with the man-made fibres. Perhaps the wool is a little dear, or people thought that it was more difficult to obtain, but I notice that in every drapery shop and store you have the well-known, well-recognised wool mark in evidence, and you hear the housewife asking for it more and more. Something on this line should have been introduced into this legislation.</P>
    <P>While the Irish farmer plays a very important part, I have been distressed to hear that there is inferior quality wool being imported into this country and re-exported as Irish wool, at a profit to some trader or other. The complaint generally has been that the middlemen have really been battening on the Irish farmers over the years. The sooner this problem is brought down to some satisfactory level the better. I feel that the only possible way we can tackle this problem is to introduce greater degrees of co-operation in co-operative marketing and selling.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, too, I notice that the <Col N="710" /> Minister proposes to register the premises of wool buyers. This to me raises the very important question of the agent, perhaps an agent or buyer, I do not know what he might be, who carries on his business at a number of depots in various villages throughout the country. If the Minister insists that each wool buyer must register one premises and if that man is confined to buying wool from the Irish farmer only at that premises the small farmer whether he be a hill-farmer or from the central plains is at a direct disadvantage, more especially if he has not got the transport to transport his wool a great distance. I can see small farmers with a flock of a dozen or two dozen sheep being left at the mercy of tanglers and wranglers and not getting a fair crack of the whip. It would be a pity if any upset in the present system was to mean that very small farmers, whom everybody seems to be so interested in, were going to be victimised by having to have their wool taken 20 or 30 miles to the premises of a registered buyer. Perhaps when the Minister is replying he will be able to give me some idea of what he intends in this proposal.</P>
    <P>I notice in section 9 (2) (c) the Minister may withdraw the licence of a person if the licensee should die. This, perhaps, might prove to be a little harsh on the widow of a buyer. Is this something new? I feel especially in the case of a widow if a merchant has equipped his premises for sale for the purpose of dealing in wool that premises would lose quite a lot of value if it was to be left without a licence. I should like to remind the House, especially as earlier on this afternoon we had a very long drawn out debate on the matter of salaries for the judiciary, of the present price of wool. This year many farmers were faced with prices as low as 2s a pound. In my own county the highest was 2s 8d per pound. When we remember the price of wool was 5s and 6s a pound eight or nine years ago we must admit that the quality of wool in the intervening decade has increased in no uncertain way.</P>
    <P>The presentation of fleeces has also improved. I should like to pay a well deserved tribute to Macra na Feirme <Col N="711" /> in particular for the success of the national sheep shearing competition. Those are not just games which young farmers play in the summer afternoons. They are designed to improve workmanship and the craft of shearing sheep and in so doing to provide fleece of the best possible quality. This has proved a very great success and anyone who goes to any of those competitions will see the great interest taken in them. Year after year the standard of the participants rises. In recent times Irish wool has improved and great credit is due to the people who organise those classes, courses and demonstrations but it is regrettable to find that even at that the price of wool is almost halved.</P>
    <P>This is something the Minister will have to take into consideration. It is all right to say that the Government are paying a subsidy of £1 to the hill farmer. Then, again, as I have already mentioned, there are very many small farmers and big farmers in this country who do not qualify for this £1 subsidy. They have a right to expect a decent standard of living for their work and for the improved techniques they are putting into the entire operation.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture introduced some time ago new grants for sheep dipping tanks. The specification in relation to such equipment is, I should imagine, very elaborate. Farm buildings and even equipment such as sheep dipping tanks in this country are of a high standard. When going around the country you often encounter corrals or pens, quite effective and simple structures, which do a very efficient job. Scaled down grants should be made available even in the case of structures built of something other than concrete. I think with the present shortterm agricultural policy it is unfair to expect people whose land does not permit them pursuing one particular aspect of farming only, even with the added grants, to put up permanent structures when, perhaps, less permanent ones would do.</P>
    <P>The ideal solution, of course, would be for the Minister, even at this stage, to introduce a long-term agricultural <Col N="712" /> policy which would allow the Irish farmers to plan ahead for many years and have some chance of reaping a return. According to the Schedule the Minister may at any time remove a member of An Chomhairle from office. At this particular juncture in the relations between the Minister and the farmers we could do without that provision because it would appear that here again the Minister has a stick and it certainly lends force to the argument of people who say that the Minister will not co-operate. I should like to ask the Minister&mdash;I propose to put in an amendment on this&mdash;if he will in the interest of farming and good relations drop that provision and put his faith in the people who will go on the board. When a person is nominated to the council let him serve five years. I think the suggestion that if a man does not toe the line he will be fired is wrong. We need not only more co-operation but also the willingness to accept one another's point of view to a greater extent. For that reason I feel the Minister would be making a good gesture of his sincerity towards Irish farmers if he dropped that final clause.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out that the figures in 6 (b) are minimum figures. I should like the Minister to give an assurance to the House that instead of not less than three, he will increase the categories of Irish farmers he wishes to have represented on the board. There is a small hill sheep farmers' association that does not get itself into the papers very often but they are a significant body and should have representation on this board. The National Farmers Association have an effective organisation inasmuch as they represent a large number of farmers, both hill and vale, and they should have representation also.</P>
    <P>An Foras Tionscal has done wonderful work for all aspects of Irish agriculture. I have been going around to their open days and my admiration for their work and dedication has grown more and more. This institution has the farms and the personnel to carry out trials; they have a proved method of recording these trials and I feel that a member of the sheep section of An Foras Tionscal could help <Col N="713" /> the board and the country very well by their experience which they could place at the disposal of the board.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Minister has a very wide field from which to choose. If Irish agriculture is to succeed we must trust one another and I think the Minister's intentions are good and I have faith in him to appoint an effective council. If he agrees to drop No. 3 in the Schedule he will be displaying his faith in Irish farmers and in the people who will agree to serve on the Comhairle. Anybody who agrees to serve on the Comhairle will go on to it with the highest possible motive. If we accept one another's position from that point of view we will have got off to a good start.</P>
    <P>Corás Tráchtála has a part to play in the export of Irish agriculture. As the Comhairle will not have an expert we should utilise the machinery we already have. I cannot see any tremendous difficulty in an organisation such as Corás Tráchtála establishing a small section to deal with this entire industry, especially since the number of sheep are down and consequently the yield of wool is down. I think the Minister could usefully consider something along those lines. I welcome the fact that the Minister has brought in this Bill at last and I hope that before it leaves the Seanad it will be amended and will be a better Bill than it is now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be off-colour for a Senator whose residence is in Terenure to start talking about the Wool Marketing Board. Sheep raising in Terenure is very small and I do not think there is much chance of building it up, but I am interested in the Bill and I think a great deal of good could result from it. I am inclined to side with Professor Quinlan in thinking that it would improve the Bill if the powers given to the Minister in it were smaller. When dealing with the Fishery Harbours Bill I congratulated the Minister on taking the problem by the throat, and I thought the Minister deserved full support for doing so. Here I am not so sure, and I propose to mention <Col N="714" /> examples from the Bill of cases where I feel the Minister is asking for and being given too much personal power.</P>
      <P>I should like to see the Bill recognising that there are sheep farmers who are organised, who are capable of co-operation, who should be consulted, and the co-operation of whom should be recognised in the Bill. I feel also that participation in the day-to-day work of the Comhairle should be a requisite in the Bill, participation by such sheep farmers' organisations.</P>
      <P>In section 1, I notice that the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; in lines 34 and 35 is defined as meaning regulations made by the Minister in accordance with the Act. I suggest that in the Act, while a &ldquo;prescribed fee&rdquo; is mentioned frequently, there is no clause in the Bill which gives the power to the Minister to prescribe the fee. I may be wrong in this, and I am open to correction, but I read the Bill carefully and while I see the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; defined, I do not see any section which gives the Minister power to prescribe a fee.</P>
      <P>I notice in section 2 that &ldquo;the Minister may by Order appoint a day to be the establishment day for the purposes of the Act&rdquo;; and in section 5 subsection (1) it states that &ldquo;as soon as may be after the passing of this Act the Minister shall&rdquo; etc. I find the use of the different forms confusing, &ldquo;the passing of the Act&rdquo; and &ldquo;the establishment day&rdquo;. I am sure that there is a clear explanation of that, and I am asking the Minister to give it to us. Is the establishment day the day of the passing of the Act or the one on which the Act comes into operation. I notice <i>en passant</i>, in subsection (5) of section 5 that there is reference to the prescribed fee. I do not think that the Minister or anybody else has power to prescribe a fee according to the Act. The same occurs in subsection (2), paragraph A of section 6.</P>
      <P>Then I come to subsection (3) of section 6 which says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever the Minister proposes to refuse an application for registration in the register he shall, before doing so, notify in writing the applicant for registration of his intention and of the reasons therefor, and, if <Col N="715" /> any representations are made to the Minister by the applicant within seven days after the giving of the notification, the Minister shall consider them.</P>
    <P>What this really means is that an appeal shall lie to the Minister against the Minister. If the Minister turns down your application you have to write to the Minister within seven days and he is compelled under the terms of this Act to &ldquo;consider&rdquo; your appeal. I feel that the mechanism of this appeal is not sufficient since it represents merely an appeal to the Minister against the Minister. This is asking for too much from the Minister. The same kind of thing is in a great number of places. In section 7 (1) the phrase occurs:</P>
    <P>...the Minister may, at his discretion, grant or refuse to grant a licence...</P>
    <P>In subsection (3) of the same section it says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, at the time of the granting of a licence under this section, attach to the licence such conditions as he shall think proper...</P>
    <P>In subsection (4) it says:</P>
    <P>The Minister,if he so thinks fit, amend or revoke a condition attached to a licence.</P>
    <P>In subsection (1) of section 8 the Minister is mentioned here in connection with fees. It says:</P>
    <P>There shall be paid to the Minister ...such fee (if any) as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may fix by regulation.</P>
    <P>The fee may be paid and that fee would be such as he &ldquo;may fix&rdquo;. Is this sufficient to give the power to the Minister to fix a fee? I may be wrong in the interpretation of this, but it does not seem right to say that the Minister may fix a fee&mdash;&ldquo;such fee as he may fix&rdquo; with no clause to give him the power. I do not think the power is granted under the Act. Perhaps this subsection is insufficient. I would like a lawyer's opinion on that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="716" /> An odd thing I notice in section 9 (1) is that:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) cancel the registration of any person in the register,</P>
    <P>(b) revoke a licence granted to a person under the Act,</P>
    <P>upon the application of the person or, in the case of a deceased person, his personal representative, or in the case of a body corporate, the liquidator.</P>
    <P>What occurs to me there is that if the personal representative of a deceased person does not apply to have the registration cancelled, the Minister has no power to cancel it. He has power to cancel it on application of the person, or on application of the personal representative of the deceased person, but if the personal representative of the deceased person does not so apply, there does not seem to be any power on earth for the Minister to cancel that registration.</P>
    <P>I notice in paragraph 9 (4) (c) that:</P>
    <P>the Minister shall cause an inquiry to be held...</P>
    <P>in relation to certain notice given, and so on. I think this is a good thing. If I may suggest, I would like to see this principle more apparent in the Act, than the one which provides that the Minister himself alone can inquire into these complaints or grievances.</P>
    <P>In section 10 we fall back into the more authoritarian phrases. Subsection (1) says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, if he so thinks fit, by regulation grant exemption from the provisions of this Act in relation to businesses of a particular class and to which this Act would otherwise apply.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to give very big powers to the Minister. I would not accuse the Minister of abusing such power, but perhaps some of his successors in the forthcoming Coalition Government might do so&mdash;abuse?&mdash; perish the thought! Nevertheless, he has enshrined here certain concepts of arbitrary power in the Minister. Subsection (2) of section 10 says: <Col N="717" /> This Act shall not apply in relation to a business of a class in respect of which an exemption under this section has been granted and has not been withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Again by the Minister. In other words, the entire Act can be torn up by the Minister in relation to certain businesses.Are we satisfied to grant the Minister the right to tear up the entire Act in respect of certain types of businesses?</P>
    <P>I think perhaps in section 11 this might be the place to give the Minister power to prescribe a fee. In subsection (2) it states:</P>
    <P>Regulation made under subsection (1) (a) may&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) provide for either or both of the following, namely, the payment of a specified increase in price in relation to wool of specified quality or the making of a specified reduction in price in relation to wool with specified defects.</P>
    <P>Here might be the place where there might be some reference to giving to the Minister the power to prescribe a fee, if I am right in thinking that he has not been granted that power elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Then we come to section 12 which relates to the establishment of An Chomhairle Olla. Subsection (2) says:</P>
    <P>An Chomhairle shall consist of a chairman and either ten other members, or the number of other members specified in an order under this section and for the time being in force.</P>
    <P>Section 3 goes on to give other possibilities, but I would like to ask by whom will these members be nominated?I am afraid I know the answer. The answer is: the Minister or an adviser of his Department. I am not satisfied that the Minister is the best person to decide the entire composition of this Comhairle. I feel that the organised farmers' organisation should be given the right to nominate the members of An Chomhairle since it has power usefully to advise. The Minister's powers under section 13 will be greatly enhanced if people are chosen from within the Minister's men. <Col N="718" /> Their function will be under section 13 to advise the Minister on this, that and the other.</P>
    <P>Section 14 (a) says:</P>
    <P>assign to An Chomhairle such additional functions relating to wool as he thinks fit.</P>
    <P>One can grant that, perhaps, but the Minister is being given a lot of power. He decides whether they will have additional functions or not, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, but without any reference to consultation with An Chomhairle or advice from An Chomhairle, and I feel again that there is a little too much power being taken into the hands of a single Minister.</P>
    <P>Again, section 19 (3) reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by order amend or revoke a levy order or an order under this subsection.</P>
    <P>I should like to put a question to the Minister here. Why does he need the power to amend by Order, or revoke entirely, a levy? If a levy or an Order is a good thing must we be asked to give the Minister total power to amend it or abolish it. This is in subsection (3) of section 19. Why does he need this power? Is it a wise thing to give the Minister power to abolish the levy altogether? I welcome the fact in section 24 not only that the officer of the Minister has certain powers of inquiry, not only that he must be authorised in writing, but also, even considerably more important, that, as in subsection (4): the said officer shall be obliged to show his authorisation if so required. This is a good thing and it is to be welcomed, because if somebody is coming in to inspect he should be authorised in writing and he should be obliged to show his authorisation. This has been anticipated by the Minister and his draftsmen.</P>
    <P>I wish to make one last point, being aware that many of the points I have made were of the kind which might be more adequately dealt with in Committee.However, they raise questions which the Minister might consider between now and the Committee Stage; and he might wish to put down one or <Col N="719" /> two Government amendments as a result. My last point is that in the Schedule it appears first of all in section 4 (1) that each member of An Chomhairle shall be appointed by the Minister. This means the Minister will choose the lot. I cannot accept this as being a good way to choose An Chomhairle. Section 6 of the Schedule says:</P>
    <P>Of the ordinary members of An Chomhairle&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) not less than three shall be persons each of whom the Minister considers representative of wool producers, and</P>
    <P>(b) not less than three shall be persons each of whom the Minister considers representative of the wool trade.</P>
    <P>This is dynamite. We are being asked to allow the Minister to decide who might be legitimately considered to be representative of the producers and of the wool trade. Personally, I am not prepared to grant the Minister these powers. I do not think the Minister for Agriculture is the person who should decide who is the best representative of the wool-producers. The answer is simple. The best people to decide that are the wool producers. Similarly, those in the wool trade are the best people to decide who is best to represent them. This is the last of many points upon which I feel the Minister in this Bill is asking for too much power for the Minister for Agriculture, not only the present occupant of that office, but his successors, in relation to the wool trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the overall picture of those who have spoken on the Bill as being in general agreement with and extending a welcome to it. That is, with the exception of Senator Quinlan who does not see any good purpose in the Bill nor, indeed, does he credit that there was any intention that any good would come out of it. That is a charitable view of his reception for the Bill. In his talk on it he did not go anywhere near or surrounding the Bill <Col N="720" /> and I will leave these sort of irrelevancies to a later stage, if there is time.</P>
      <P>There were many sensible things said by other Senators and I may not mention every detail because, as some of the speakers have emphasised, many of them would be more appropriately dealt with on Committee Stage when we can probably sort them out much more clearly than we would be capable of doing at this stage. Senator Malone mentioned the small buyer and expressed the opinion that he might be placed at a disadvantage, that he might be driven out of business which, he said, would in turn put many small farmers at a disadvantage. That theme was elaborated by Senator McDonald who spoke about the same matter in similar context. He suggested that a monopoly might develop at a later stage as a result of small buyers being driven out of the wool business.</P>
      <P>There is no intention and no reason why small buyers should be driven out; and there is no effort being made and there is no aid being afforded in this Bill which would be conducive to the creation of a monopoly. That is the very last thing I would stand for if I had anything to do with it and, according to some Senators who spoke here this evening, I have far too much to do with it. As far as a monopoly is concerned, the Bill is not intended to, nor will it be ever allowed to develop into, the creation of a monopoly which I agree would be not only to the disadvantage of the wool buyers but to the producers, who are our primary concern. Rather should I think that the small buyers, and even those who could not be classified as buyers&mdash; people who have not attempted to provide themselves with storage facilities; people who work in small localities &mdash; will have their position improved. Many of these buyers who operate in small localities become agents for other buyers. They may continue to operate in that way and will not have to provide themselves with premises, equipment and so forth.</P>

      <P>I envisage a situation <Col N="721" /> of their moving around, following the same pattern as now, but a situation in which the wool will be given a fair chance&mdash;a situation in which it will be properly graded and paid for on a graded basis, with penalties for bad wool. The requirement is that they have proper storage for the wool but that does not mean that every person will have to have stores. In fact, at some points they will not have to provide themselves with any storage whatsoever.The wool will be purchased in a manner convenient to the producers and will be drawn from there, possibly by an agent, to a person with a central registered store who will have it manufactured or made ready for export.</P>
      <P>I wish to allay immediately any fears about the evolution of a monopoly. There is no intention whatsoever of having a monopoly built up. The intention is that the small useful buyers will be worked into the overall better regulated system of buying and grading wool which we envisage as being capable of being achieved as a result of this Bill. Senator Murphy offered the criticism that we are two years behind with this Bill&mdash; that it is two years since the report of the committee.He welcomed the Bill, however, his attitude being, I suppose, that it is better late than never at all. But then this was strangely in contrast with those who came immediately after him, particularly Senator Quinlan who talked about this matter&mdash;in fact, I rather thought that he went off the deep end a bit. Maybe he had a bit of the sun down south though we did not have much of it here today. He described the Bill not as a Bill related to wool but in the spirit of being another takeover bid, another effort at empire building, this instead of getting on with the job. Then he went on to claim that Macra na Feirme and the NFA saw the need for this 15 years ago. All I can say is that there is something fairly wrong with the Senator when he talks in those terms since the NFA was not about 15 years ago.</P>

      <P>As I am speaking of Senator Quinlan, I also have here his further submission that no matter what is in this Bill, they have not thought much of it even though they did not exist at the time they were allegedly thinking about it, because it is no good unless it is a wool marketing board, so that in any event no matter what is done here by me or by this Government it is no use in the Senator's estimation. This I think is the proper background against which to view anything further that the Senator has said and, indeed, will say with regard to this or any other matter that comes before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He talks about vested interests preventing the full operation of an experiment carried out by Macra na Feirme and the NFA and a whole lot of other helpful people over the years, but he forgets that those vested interests are probably responsible for this sort of measure. I wonder is the Senator really conscious of the fact that the Bill generally is the result of the recommendations of a board, of the wool marketing committee, which, as I have already indicated, was broadly based on the membership of such people as representatives of the producers. I take it that there will be nothing wrong about this or that the Senator would not regard this as a vested interest working against their own financial interests. On the committee there were representatives of the traders. Again, they are surely entitled to a place in the overall working out and examination of recommendations of all the circumstances with their knowledge of what can best be done. We had the manufacturers, again people of some considerable concern because we have to look to them at the moment for the <Col N="724" /> usage of some of the wool and we hope in the future to find further outlets through our manufacturers. Therefore, their voice in this was most helpful. We had the Agricultural Institute, An Foras Talúntais, of which we have heard very high praise here tonight. Then we had the Department of Agriculture represented, but apparently they know nothing about anything, could advise on nothing and should not have a hand in anything except to hand out money to non-responsible people who would be given a job to do.</P>

      <P>Perhaps not but the implications were there. Whether, in fact, they were mentioned or not the record will show. It may be that I am just a small bit touchy about this sort of thing, but I do not think I am; but the committee that has reported has, I am sure, met with the approval even of Senator Quinlan. In any event, I feel that this was a committee representative of all the various worthwhile aspects and interests devolving upon the production and the presentation of wool and the business of wool production and wool selling. On the basis of their report this Bill has been largely built, yet according to Senator Quinlan this Bill is of no value whatsoever.</P>
      <P>It is no good without a marketing board. This is the sort of thing I am sick of listening to. Marketing boards are the answer to everything in this country no matter what the problem, even though it may create more problems in addition to the ones we have had and cause even greater cost than the business may already cost us. This is never advanced to any great degree by people who have any experience of marketing or marketing boards, but is rather advanced by people who know nothing about marketing in their own right and have never been part of a marketing board or a marketing organisation. This is a rather peculiar situation, and it is one that people should take full note of when they hear&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Unfortunately, people have a very awkward habit, and a discouraging one, of asking occasionally what does it cost to do that job. If our competitors are in the situation that the Common Market appeared to be in at the moment, a very large group of countries with very great wealth built not on land alone but on various industrial activities, that they are capable, for instance, of buying the home market production of butter for 750/- a cwt and are prepared to sell it for 150/- outside, then it would follow that we here who are depending so largely on agriculture and on our agricultural production, if we were to follow that to its logical conclusion should be prepared to lose 601/- per cwt on every cwt of butter if those countries are prepared to lose 600/-. If this is the Senator's idea of how marketing should be done, then all I can say is thanks be to God that he is not on the marketing end of the business or it would be gone long ago.</P>

This is something I do not understand. I do not understand how this deduction could have been made by Senator Quinlan, even trying to understand the way his mind works in reverse sometimes and continues in reverse and eventually goes around in circles, but even looking at it in that way how can he possibly make such a statement that this Bill is really denigrating the NFA?</P>

      <P>Probably we will be able to deal with it on some section on Committee Stage. Also, it is stated categorically, and without any qualification, that the NFA is associated with the trade unions. I do not know where <Col N="727" /> the comparison comes in or what the purpose of this is but it would appear that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is to be lined up with the NFA. The Congress of Trade Unions in its organisational structure represents a number of trade unions and it would be far more understandable if the National Agricultural Council were in fact related, organisationally speaking, to the Congress of Trade Unions than the other way round. Should any element, and I mean any trade union, in the Trade Union Congress have power greater than the whole organisation to which it belonged? Should it be superior to the body of which it is only part? Likewise, should the NFA be greater than the NAC? This is something which Senator Quinlan should take home with him and sort out between now and Committee Stage. There may be something in the Bill or in the amendments on which this could relevantly be brought up.</P>

      <P>The NFA were mentioned frequently. How often I ceased to count after they had been referred to for the thirty-fifth time. On the thirty-fifth occasion the manner in which the Minister was not getting on with them was mentioned. There was no talk about how they were not getting on with him or about how other organisations have been getting on with him. That was not mentioned at all. There was mention about <i>The Farmers Journal</i> not getting advertisements and this appears to be tied up with them. I expect the Senator will tell us the NFA do not own it.</P>

      <P>I do not see the connection.It was suggested that An Chomhairle Olla should be representative of the producers but for the third time at least the Senator made it known that his idea was that the producers' representatives on An Chomhairle Olla would be served only and probably vested only, if it was a sheep committee of the NFA, as long as those people were drawn from that they would select them and put them on and they would be sheep farmers representatives of this country. Other Senators have spoken here and made the particular point that <Col N="729" /> a great deal of the sheep farmers and those most needing assistance and help in regard to wool production and marketing are small men. I want to say I come from a mountainy county with quite a few mountains in it and the sheep farmers in it, I am glad to say, are thriving. All I can tell the Senator at this stage is I doubt if the NFA represent them either in their work or in regard to the sheep. The same can be said for the vast majority of the sheep farmers in this country. If I want to find representatives of those people then it is not to the sheep committee of the NFA I go to look for it and the Senator would hardly expect me to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is they who represent some of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be so. I do not know what sort it is. I do not know what type it is. Apparently even before the board was thought of they had the idea it would be better if it was a full marketing board. I will have to go into that. Finally, let me say that the only thing, as time went on, one could conclude, is that Senator Quinlan has a mission and that mission is to further the interests of the NFA and if that is so there are more fertile places to seek members I suggest than in the hallowed House we are now in. I would suggest that in his activities and efforts to further membership of that organisation he is not on a very good stand to get members. There are better places down the country where farmers operate to get members than to come in here looking for them. If he is a Senator who is looking for members of the NFA it is a pity that he does not say that openly rather than posing as a professor yesterday, a Senator today and an organiser for the NFA tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say to Senator McDonald that his suggestion that the power given in section 9 (2) (c) to revoke a licence might be used on the death of a person who had invested a considerable sum in premises, plant and equipment against the widow of such a person, if there was such a widow, is not a tenable suggestion. The reason for this is <Col N="730" /> that part of the requirements for the obtaining of such a licence and the holding of it is that they have the requisite premises, plant and equipment and that they be people with a knowledge of the wool trade and the working of the wool itself. The licence would be issued in the name of such a person and if that person dies the licence should, normally, die with him.</P>
    <P>That does not necessarily mean that the business of wool buying would not be likely to be continued in operation. It would be a question of applying for a new licence in a new name and with the same premises, plant and equipment and, in the circumstances outlined by the Senator, such an application would be received with great sympathy by me. There is no intention of curtailing licences or cutting down on the number of licences in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald mentioned the price of wool some years ago when it was 5s per pound and compared it with the recent prices of 2s 4d and 2s 8d per pound. But the owners of sheep themselves will be aware that the sheep were not worth as much then as they are now. This has to be taken into account and you cannot say that wool is just wool and that sheep are a total loss, wool has been and will continue to be an important part of the trade but, by and large, the sheep is more important than the wool. If the price of sheep and lambs is good and the demand is good and the wool price not so good, the overall situation may be more profitable to the industry than when the price of wool was higher and the price of sheep and lambs lower.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald mentioned the lamb subsidy which was designed to help the people we hear so much talked about. Senator Quinlan and his colleagues give lip service to these people and give them precious little else. I gave them a subsidy for the first time and I doubled that subsidy this year. We did this because we offer them something more than lip service, we did it because we want more sheep on our hills and mountains. There is great potential for them there. Any additional flocks that these people can create there are badly needed by them <Col N="731" /> for their own benefit and it is also well to remember that the sheep feeders and sheep fatteners of the lowlands, about whom Senator McDonald is complaining that they are not getting the subsidy, get their stocks from the people in those areas. These grants that we pay to the people in the hills will sometimes be reflected to the benefit of the lowlanders themselves. If the bounty is paid and the price is not as good as it might be the farmer in the hills can still make a fair profit and the lowland man can buy his stock at a reasonable price and make a good thing during the year by holding them.</P>
    <P>The supply to the lowland man continues.We are not providing a subsidy directly to the lowland man but the supply of his raw material, the stores from the hills, is most essential to him and I am sure the lowland man does not begrudge in any way the hill man getting this little extra at a time when we want to build up the stocks in the hills.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald said that the specifications, regulations and requirements of my Department are too high, too elaborate and too costly. Strangely enough, I am sympathetic with the sentiment underlying that statement. We do seek pretty high standards and we have been examining this aspect of our specifications and regulations particularly in view of the fact that farming is developing in such a way that many of the standards we have today may not operate for as long as a decade and they may, in fact, become obsolete in four or five years and may have to be replaced. We are looking at the whole question with this in mind. I think the Senator and the House will appreciate that my Department, in its insistence on pretty high specifications, perhaps it would be better to say pretty solid specifications, have been looking at it in the light of getting some return for the money the State is putting into the industry by way of grants. These specifications and requirements may be changed if the situation demands it.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald does not like the power given to the Minister to remove members of the board. Neither does he <Col N="732" /> like the power given to the Minister to put the board there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to credit the Senator with such a statement but somebody did say it and if you do not like me putting them there why do you object to me removing them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought this was Senator McDonald's outlook. Do you disown this thing? I thought you disowned the sentiments I ascribed to you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think you should have power to fire a fellow simply because he does not see eye to eye with you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the part where I can remove a member of the board. If Senators do not agree with that I do not think that they can logically disagree with the other power to appoint members of the board. If you do not object to the Minister putting them in there, why do you object to the Minister putting them off? We have the sheep men being talked about and the sheep men are the men from the producers' side I want to get in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>The producers will be the majority in the entire industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that either. I say the sheep men are the sort that should represent the producers and when I say that I do not say men who belong to an organisation that have sheep men. These will be actually sheep men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody asked why should the Minister decide who represents sheep men or who has the interests of sheep men at heart. The Minister has as much knowledge as can be gleaned, as much knowledge as possible, as to who fills that role in this country, and has at his disposal pretty far-flung people to advise him not only in his Department.He has the Department of Agriculture officers, CAOs and officers of county committees of agriculture to <Col N="733" /> advice him on these things; we have a method of finding the right people who not only know the job, who not only participate in the production of wool but who are on a board and are prepared to give their time and voice their opinions, if they can, on a board. These are very important things. In selecting people to be on any such a board it is essential that they not only know the job but are capable of giving time to such a board and when attending a board that they are not only knowledgeable on a board but are capable of putting their views before the other members of the board. We will be able to find that sort of person just as good and better than any other organisation I know of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do not want the kind of organisation Senator Quinlan represents. He talks and talks and talk and talks and never seems to do anything. We have had too much of that already. We also have An Foras Talúntais. It is not, of course, beyond the bounds of possibility that we can have some knowledgeable professor. You never know what the lightning might strike in a case like this but I hope it will not kill when it does strike. I have met a few useful professors, not like that one over there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington had a right run through, with remarks on every section of the entire Bill. He did it in 17 minutes flat and that is a lot faster than I could do it. I do not intend to go through it all tonight as I <Col N="734" /> would put you all to sleep which I would be capable of doing. This is not the time to talk on this Bill in the way we should. Let me say to Senator Sheehy Skeffington that he has raised several important points on this measure but I do not want to take the time to go through them. I know his purpose was to get information or provoke food for thought with a view to getting amendments down for Committee Stage. Having grasped his idea, he may possibly accept that the lateness of the hour prevents me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure the Senator is, and deal with them we will. I just want to say that overall, with the one exception, we have had something presented to this House that is generally accepted. All overtones have been got over and I hope we can get this Bill through fairly soon because then we can get on with the job. Certainly we are a bit late in doing any worthwhile work in time for the immediate clip that will be coming for sale as time is slipping, but next year is near. No doubt we can get the Bill through in the next three weeks and many of the points raised will be dealt with in detail.</P>
