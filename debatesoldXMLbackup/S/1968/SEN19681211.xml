      <P>First of all I should like to thank you for the honour you have done me by electing me your Acting Chairman for today, though we all regret the absence of the Cathaoirleach owing to illness.  I am sure you will join me in wishing him a speedy recovery to full health.</P>
      <P>Unhappily, my first duty is a melancholy one.  During the Recess, Senators will have learned with deep regret of the death of one of our longest serving Members, Senator Máighréad Nic Phiarais.  Go dtuga Dia suaimhneas síoraí dá hánam uasal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The late Senator was the last of a famous family whose members gave their all in the cause of Irish freedom and whose name will be forever cherished by the Irish people.  She first came into prominence as a public representative when she was elected to Dáil Éireann in 1933 as a Member for County Dublin.  On the re-establishment of Seanad Éireann in 1938, she was elected from the Administrative Panel and from that date until the time of her death she was continuously a Member of this House.  For many years she served on the Joint Restaurant Committee and was a member of the Executive Committee of the Irish Parliamentary Association of which she was joint honorary treasurer.  Owing to <Col N="3" /> failing health she was unable to attend meetings of the Seanad for some time past.  Nevertheless she kept up her insatiable interest in public affairs which she was willing to discuss on all occasions.</P>
    <P>Senator Nic Phiarais was a woman of outstanding personality and firm convictions which, when occasion demanded, she had no hesitation in expressing in a forceful and compelling way.  Her great love was the Irish language and she never lost an opportunity to encourage people, particularly young people, to study and to speak it. Of a quiet disposition, she never sought publicity and the immense amount of work of a charitable nature which she carried out was known only to a few. Her memory will be treasured by all those who had the privilege of knowing her and her passing will be mourned by all those who benefited from her kindness.</P>
    <P>I should like on my own behalf and on behalf of the Members of this House to express our deepest sympathy with the relatives of the late Senator.</P>

      <P>Could I inquire from the Leader of the House as to the position regarding other business? We have a good deal of business in the form of Motions, some of which have been on the Order Paper for quite a long time.  I have been disturbed to <Col N="4" /> hear criticisms from a Minister that one of these subjects has not been discussed, particularly as this matter has been on the Order Paper for about a year.  The House has not met for about four months and we ought to have some assurance that time will be given to enable the Seanad to do the work it is paid to do.  We ought to have an assurance that this time will be given in the near future.</P>

      <P>It was hoped to have a meeting of the House earlier than today and for that purpose a meeting of a sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges was to have been held to deal with the Motion which I had down for consideration regarding Motions and speeches in the House.  Unfortunately we were unable to hold that meeting on the date fixed in November and that was one reason why the House did not meet before now.  I can assure Senators that every endeavour will be made to get that Motion discussed so that we can expedite the Business of the House.</P>

      <P>Before we enter into consideration of this Bill, I wonder would the House be agreeable to widen the scope of the debate so as to embrace the discussion that normally takes place on the Appropriation Bill.

I suggest that the time saved by broadening the discussion be made available for this purpose.</P>

      <P>The Bill translates into legislative form the new taxation announced on 5th November, 1968, and provides for the improvement of savings incentives as well.  The reasons for the higher taxes were primarily economic.  The action taken to reduce the prospective deficit on the current Budget had, therefore, a demand-management function as well as a budgetary one.</P>
      <P>During the past eight months, consumer expenditure rose at a faster rate than the economy could continue to sustain for long.  The recent general increase in incomes very much exceeded the growth of productivity.  The balance of trade became more adverse and the estimated balance of payments deficit for this year was put at £15 million, as compared with a surplus of about the same amount in 1967.  This year's prospective balance of payments deficit would not, on its own, give rise to undue concern.  However, the large deficit and accompanying difficulties forecast for next year were disturbing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the many signs of a dangerous inflationary trend developing and of the existence of a real threat to our competitiveness and economic stability, the Government decided to take timely corrective action.  The measures adopted were an increase in postal charges to bring Post Office income and outgo into balance, taking one year with another; moderate hirepurchase restrictions; advice that available bank credit should be reserved as far as possible for productive purposes; increases in the rates of duty on beer, <Col N="6" /> spirits and tobacco; and an increase from five per cent to ten per cent in the rate of the wholesale tax with effect from 1st January, 1969.</P>
    <P>The October trade figures, which came to hand after the Financial Resolutions were introduced on 5th November, have underlined the necessity for corrective measures of the kind taken by the Government.  Our apprehensions about the external situation also were, unhappily, confirmed by events soon after that date.  Fortunately, the action taken by the Central Bank in diversifying our external reserves has increased their value and strengthened our reserves position.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before you is straightforward and is summarised in the explanatory memorandum circulated with it.  Detailed explanation of any points not clear to Senators would seem to be more appropriate to the Committee Stage and I shall gladly provide any further information sought then.</P>
    <P>I look forward, in this House, to an informative debate and hope to hear useful comment.  In recent weeks, some critics have been hinting at better solutions to our economic problems than those advanced by the Government. But they have failed to spell out fully their superior alternatives.  I hope that any courses, fiscal or otherwise, offered for consideration in this House, will be specified in reasonable detail.</P>
    <P>Even more unhelpful than the generalisers are the moaners who foretell gloom and disaster for the country, who for political ends magnify the present problems and risk further inflationary pressure by suggesting another early pay round.  I want to make it clear that while the present situation needs careful management, it is not a crisis.  We are confident that by the measures we have already taken, by constant vigilance, by a general policy of restraint and by timely intervention where necessary, we can bring the nation safely through the present unsettled period.</P>
    <P>I now ask that the Bill be read a Second Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to say that we welcome <Col N="7" /> the Taoiseach in this House, but we regret the circumstances which have required him to take this Bill.  It is most unfortunate that the Minister for Finance should have suffered an accident which has not only inflicted on him pain and discomfort but has prevented him from participating in the work of the Oireachtas for several months.  We have always welcomed him.  He has participated in constructive discussion and we regret that he is not in a position to be here today to take this Bill.  His absence has imposed on the Taoiseach personally, who has many other difficulties, a very serious additional burden which must be a great strain on him.  It is most unfortunate that this should have happened.</P>
      <P>The Budget which we are examining here today seems to me to be the biggest Budget ever imposed in the history of this State.  I am open to correction on this, but from the research I have done I feel that the extra burden of £19.4 million exceeds the burden imposed by any previous Budget.  My calculation of the turnover tax Budget is that the annual burden in that case was about £17 million.  It must be a matter for concern&mdash;and the Taoiseach has to accept this&mdash;that the Supplementary Budget, introduced some months after the main Budget, should exceed any main Budget ever introduced in the history of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly this suggests a situation that must give rise to concern.  Whether it is a situation involving blame on the Government or not will be a matter for discussion on debate.  The Taoiseach may not agree with me or others on this side of the House as to the degree of blame to be attached.  He must, however, accept that it is a matter of serious concern.  If it is not a matter for blame on the Government, and if in fact the Taoiseach's view is that it was completely unavoidable and that nothing he could have done would have avoided the situation, then we must think twice about our system of managing our affairs.  If our affairs are so unpredictable that they impose a need for a Budget of this kind at short notice, then we must consider again <Col N="8" /> whether we are controlling our affairs adequately, whether this Government are doing their job properly or whether the mechanism of Government finance is inadequate.</P>
    <P>We must consider first why this Budget is necessary.  The two main reasons for it are the increase in public service remuneration, which is £9 million, and the agricultural subsidies, which are £6 million.  These are the reasons and they must be examined precisely to see how they have arisen and whether there is anything we can do about them.  We must ask, first of all, whether these burdens could have been forseen in whole or in part.  That is, I think, a fair question to which we have to seek an answer.</P>
    <P>Secondly, given that they were not foreseen, rightly or wrongly, what, in fact, from the purely financial point of view, is the burden of taxation required to pay for these additions?  By how much is this taxation to be increased and is the Budget well judged to yield the kind of results it should yield?</P>
    <P>The Budget imposes taxation not just for five months but for 12 months ahead, because a Budget applies for 12 months.  Does it impose too much or too little taxation?</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the Taoiseach has stressed the relationship of the Budget to the economic situation.  It is an exercise in demand management.  Is it the right exercise in demand management?  Is this the right way to control demand in our economy at this stage?  How is it that demand got out of control so quickly?  How is it that it got to the point where such drastic action was required, apparently for economic reasons?</P>
    <P>First of all, we will consider the question of whether it could have been foreseen in advance or, if it could not have been foreseen completely, could it have been foreseen in a large measure?  Could anyone have known how much the remuneration of the public service would have increased the demand on the Exchequer?  In the system of collective bargaining, you have an element of uncertainty.  I feel that you could not have given a precise figure at the time, when negotiations had not concluded, but nevertheless we <Col N="9" /> are entitled to consider whether the figure could not have been assessed broadly, and whether the likely burden could not have been assessed and provision made for it.  Secondly, in dealing with the agricultural subsidies it is quite clear that the magnitude of these was somewhat due to favourable weather conditions after a number of years of unfavourable weather, but I believe that the burden involved could have been foreseen to some degree but certainly not to the same degree as the public service remuneration.</P>
    <P>In that way, it should have been possible to estimate the bulk of the burden fairly adequately in April last. I do not think it is fair to blame the Government for having failed to foresee in April the necessity for a large part of the agricultural subsidies.  But they should have known something. People associated with the industry told the Department that their calculations on the grain harvest were incorrect and the Department failed to take notice of these warnings.  I do not know how early these warnings were given to the Government or to what extent these burdens should have been foreseen at the time of the April Budget but I suspect that a small part could have been foreseen if they had taken the advice given.  The bulk of these requirements became clear at a somewhat later date.</P>
    <P>I think, taking the two together, probably the majority of the total increase in expenditure was reasonably foreseeable at the time the other Budget, the so-called main Budget or principal Budget, was introduced.  The Taoiseach may argue that even if he could have foreseen this extra expenditure, to provide for it in the Estimates would have damaged the Government's negotiating position with the bodies concerned.  There could be something in this.</P>
    <P>By the time the Budget was introduced it was, however, clear, without any question or argument, that the Government's negotiating bodies could have made provision for an increase of a certain amount for the public servants; the provision of a certain amount could have been made.  But this was omitted, rather deliberately it appears.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="10" /> The Taoiseach might have been reluctant to draw on that particular method of making specific provision in the Budget for part of the requirements, on the basis that he did not know precisely how the negotiations might tend to go.  But even if the Taoiseach felt it was not clear that full provision should be made on this basis, it was clear that an increase per cent, perhaps four per cent or whatever it might have been, could have been provided for at that time, and knowing that this burden was coming up, the Budget in April could and should have been more reasonably constructed.</P>
    <P>There is a leeway in Budgets for a certain amount of adjustment.  This is always the case when Budgets are introduced, though in this country&mdash; for reasons perhaps associated with loyalty to Mr. Gladstone because of his Home Rule policies!&mdash;we do not do this.  Nevertheless, by adjusting the allowances for net errors of estimation, and perhaps also by justifying the estimates of buoyancy of revenue&mdash;though of this latter point I am a little uncertain&mdash;it is possible to produce a Budget which is, in fact though not in name, optimistic or pessimistic, expansionist or deflationary.</P>
    <P>There is room for some leeway, therefore, but the April Budget this year did not leave room for any further expenditure.  Current expenditure was increased by ten per cent.  That increase was planned in the knowledge that there was a major increase due in the public service within a few months, and with that knowledge the Government should have been more cautious.</P>
    <P>The Government should have planned the Budget in such a way as to leave them with as much leeway as possible to meet this extra cost, not leaving themselves in such a position that not even hidden provision was made for it.  It is fair and constructive criticism to make that point.  I suppose if I were speaking in a more partisan manner I could push this further, but I do not want to do that.  However, I think it is fair to make these criticisms on the question of foresight.</P>
    <P>The second question is : has the right amount of money been raised; is it too much or is it too little?  I shall <Col N="11" /> make some criticisms here and the Taoiseach may, in his reply, say whether I am wrong.  He may say I am unfair, but I should like to make the point that in so far as the calculations I put forward to the Government tentatively for consideration are incorrect, if I am unfair it is the Government's own fault.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in presenting this Budget, in this House and the other House, has failed to explain the reasoning behind his calculations.  That has been the persistent failure of this Government in presenting Budgets. There is this tendency, whether it is on the part of the Department of Finance, the Minister for Finance, or in this case the Taoiseach himself, to keep their cards close to the chest, to bring in Budgets and merely explain enough to justify the increase in expenditure but not to express the reasoning behind it.</P>
    <P>No adequate explanation has been offered for this Budget.  Perhaps the right amount of extra taxation was imposed but we have not been given reasons to show that this is so.  I personally doubt it.  The Taoiseach's explanation in the Dáil was superficial. If I recall correctly, and I was present at the time he presented the Budget in the Dáil, his justification for imposing this burden of taxation was that under five main headings.  Expenditure in the next financial year he suggested would be increased by £27 million.  The additional revenue raised by the Budget in a full year is £19.4 million.  This was not disclosed in the Budget; it was only brought out in the course of a reply to a Parliamentary Question, nor was it brought into relation with the natural buoyancy of revenue which occurs every year when revenue rises especially with changes in the value of money.</P>
    <P>All we have got to go on is this figure of £27 million, trotted out with no explanation in relation to anything, as justification for this Budget.  It may be that the Budget is justified, but it has not been shown to be such.  I hope that in this House the Taoiseach will explain the reasoning behind this Budget, explaining how the burden of taxation imposed in it was arrived at. <Col N="12" /> If a Government are introducing a Supplementary Budget, exceeding in magnitude any main Budget in the history of this State, they ought to explain the reason for it.  They cannot merely throw out irrelevant figures and simply pass on to another subject.  We should not allow in this House a matter of such importance to be treated in such a slipshod manner.</P>
    <P>I am putting the following queries to the Taoiseach in the hope that I can extract some explanation from him.  The increase in tax revenue is £19.4 million in a full year, of which only £4.2 million accrues in the current financial year.  This in itself is an extraordinary position&mdash;to have to impose £19.4 million in a full year, in order to get £4.2 million in the current year towards an £11 million deficit in the current year.  It indicates serious mishandling of the situation.</P>
    <P>What it indicates above all is that the Budget was introduced too late, because if the Budget had been introduced in September, as it should have been, the money would have come in earlier.  I say September advisedly, because the Government, from the economic point of view, were entitled to hold off taking action during the summer months to see how the economy would develop.  From the financial point of view, they knew what they would need to do to cover the Budget deficit much earlier, but the Government were justified in holding off dealing with the financial deficit until they had a clear view of the economic situation, and this was not clear until September.</P>
    <P>It was probably from that point of view that the Government were right not to introduce the Budget before September, but I cannot understand why it was not introduced then.</P>
    <P>The burden of the milk requirements, the wheat requirements, the public service remuneration requirements, were known, not perhaps in every detail but sufficiently for the purpose of deciding not to postpone the Budget further, making it necessary to impose a far heavier burden on the economy in a full year in order to achieve a particular sum of money <Col N="13" /> in the year in question.  By the time this Budget was introduced, however, so little time was left in the year that this enormous increase in the overall burden of taxation will only yield this £4.2 million, this little mouse, partly because administrative deficiencies prevented the Government from imposing an increase in the wholesale tax until several months after it was announced.  This seems to be a deficiency in the system and suggests there is something wrong in that area. It certainly is a very inflexible form of taxation if you have to postpone its introduction for several months.  I fault the Government, therefore, in so far as this Budget is necessary, in not introducing it when it became clear that it was economically desirable in September.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach will recall that in the Quarterly Report of the Economic and Social Research Institute in September last, support was given for some kind of action.  If this Budget were necessary to the economy, it was known to be necessary at that time, and financially it could have been much lighter from the public's point of view, if it had been introduced in September.  I, therefore, fault the Government for not introducing this Budget earlier.  I cannot regard it as wholly a coincidence that this Budget was not introduced until after the referendum was held. The Government must be faulted for not introducing it before the referendum. One must reasonably assume that the postponement of the Budget for those two months was for other than purely economic reasons.</P>
    <P>This taxation of £19.4 million will yield £4.2 million in the current year. Therefore, it will yield £15.2 million more next year than it will yield this year.  I hope I have got this calculation correct.  The Budget is therefore increasing the burden of taxation above the level at which it will be this year, after this year's Budget, by approximately £15.2 million next year.</P>
    <P>Adding to that the natural buoyancy of the revenue we get a very large increase in tax revenue.  Foreseeable at this point of time for the financial year ahead my calculations suggest that the natural buoyancy of revenue at existing <Col N="14" /> tax rates in the current year looks like being, on the Government's estimates, around £31½ million.  The corresponding figure for the natural buoyancy of the revenue at the then existing tax level was in the last financial year about £26 million.  That is what the Government got in extra revenue apart from increases in taxation.</P>
    <P>I accept that the deflationary measures taken in this Budget will reduce the buoyancy of the economy, and therefore it would be optimistic to expect a similar buoyancy to the extent of £31½ million in the year ahead.  I find it difficult to believe, however, that the natural buoyancy of the revenue next year could be less than £20 million, and it could well be nearer to £25 million.  The position therefore is that without any extra taxation whatever imposed in next year's Budget, with the taxation imposed by this Budget, we get a picture of the Government planning to get next year as a result of this Budget an increase in tax revenue of between £35 million and £40 million, without any changes in taxation in next year's Budget.  That is a colossal increase, and it is an increase which seems to run beyond the likely requirements of the economy.  If I am wrong in that perhaps the Taoiseach will inform me.  All we have heard from him in justification of this enormous increase in revenue now provided for in the financial year ahead, is that he has the expectation that under five heads expenditure will rise by £27 million, but he has not told us the amount by which it will rise under each individual head.</P>

      <P>It is possible that they were itemised and that I missed that.</P>
      <P>That having been done, we are still left with the situation that we have this sum of between £35 million and £40 million extra revenue and only £27 million of it justified by commitments for increased expenditure.  There will no doubt be increases under other headings, but the main areas for Government expenditure which increase significantly are included in the £27 million that the Taoiseach has mentioned, and I wonder whether the other headings, other than Civil Service remuneration, will rise by more than £3 million in the year ahead?  If I am wrong perhaps the Taoiseach will tell me.  As regards civil servants' remuneration I understand that the expectation from the public financial point of view is that there might be an increase of four per cent next year&mdash;at least that is the figure that one has heard mentioned.  After the nine per cent this year it would be reasonable to expect a figure of four per cent next year, costing about £4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can judge, therefore, and I would like the Taoiseach to tell me if I am wrong, it seems to me that taking into account all the demands likely to arise including the increased expenditure which the Taoiseach has predicted in presenting this autumn Budget, the total increase in expenditure is unlikely to reach £35 million next year.  If that is wrong the Taoiseach will tell me so, but he should have made this clear before now.  If it is not, then we are in the situation under which the Government has not only anticipated next year's Budget but has introduced in November taxation increases affecting the next financial year which are more severe than would have been required in April next.  That is economically unsound as it involves, I would have thought, an excessive deflation of the <Col N="16" /> economy at this point of time.  It is also financially unsound to overtax people now in order to get taxes which would not even be required next April, and it would be politically dishonest to do it if the intention were to do it so that next April an easy Budget could be introduced.  The Government and the Taoiseach ought to defend themselves from that implication which tends to be drawn from the facts and figures before us, and if he had presented the picture more fully and more openly than has been done in the Dáil or in the Seanad so far, such an imputation might not be so easily made.  I would like to press him to put his cards on the table and to explain precisely the thinking behind this extraordinary Budget.  It cannot simply be laughed off in a few remarks as if it were a matter of minor importance.</P>
    <P>Thirdly I come to the relationship of this Budget to the economic situation. This is more difficult and I am a little uncertain myself as to how to attack it.  I must say, however, that the inflationary situation which has given rise to the need for such sharp deflationary action should not have been allowed to arise.  The Taoiseach may say, indeed, that it is easy to say that from the Opposition benches, but less easy from the Government benches.  I am sure that is right, but nevertheless this is a criticism which people in opposition are entitled and, indeed, required to make.  To have allowed such inflation to occur that it requires a Budget which goes beyond any Budget ever introduced previously in this country suggests some degree of mismanagement.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the situation was not a very severe one when the Budget was introduced in April.  The Government would have been wrong to take sharp deflationary action then, but we must ask what went wrong between April and November to justify this remarkable action.  The Taoiseach himself in the Dáil on a famous occasion asked &ldquo;what went wrong?&rdquo; and I now propose to ask him a very similar question.  What went wrong between April and November, and what inflationary situation developed of such a magnitude as to require the <Col N="17" /> most severe Budget ever imposed for economic reasons?  Something very great must have gone wrong, and I do not think that any explanation that he has given to the Dáil or to this House has been sufficient so far.  Somebody somewhere must be responsible for such an extraordinary and rapid deterioration of the situation as is implied by this Budget.  I believe the factors involved were the same as the inflationary factors that applied in 1965&mdash; viz., excessive Government expenditure, excessive credit expansion, and excessive increases in incomes.  These led to the inflationary situation in that year, but now even the magnitude of the inflationary increases at that time has been exceeded.</P>
    <P>First of all, on public expenditure, the problem here arises of the remuneration of the public service, to which we must give a little thought.  My understanding is that the 9 per cent increase in the public service has spread itself throughout the country as so often happened before.  The private sector suffered from the failure of the public sector to control increases.  I understand this started because of a claim in a particular sector in the public service where grievances existed and required as a remedy an increase in salaries larger than the increases appropriate to or desirable in other sectors of the public service, and I am referring to the Post Office.  The Government were right to settle for a higher figure than the proposed 7 per cent in the case of the Post Office.  But the failure of the Government to introduce any kind of incomes policy, and in particular any type of prices and incomes board means that if the Government under any pressure agrees an increase beyond what is nationally desirable, that increase becomes generalised throughout the whole public service and certainly throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We have suffered repeatedly from action of the Government, appropriate in some cases in its own right, but then generalising itself and creating undue problems because of the failure of the Government to prevent that happening. In other cases the intervention carried out was inappropriate.  I refer to the <Col N="18" /> Taoiseach's own intervention as Minister for Industry and Commerce in the ESB dispute in 1961 which was regarded at the time, and still is, as extremely damaging to the economy. The whole of the inflationary pressures on incomes started at that time.  People have said that it followed the later wage round involving 12 per cent, but that is not so.  In fact the 1961 wage round jacked up the level of the two-yearly increases.  The Taoiseach as Minister for Industry and Commerce intervened repeatedly in that dispute to jack up the offer so as to get the dispute settled before the General Election.  We were lucky that when it was generalised throughout the economy it was watered down to 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>Since then we have had great difficulty in getting back from it, and we have had these excessive increases every two years.  Once a 12 per cent figure is set, it is hard to get unions to accept anything else.</P>

      <P>This remark was made by the Taoiseach recently.  I do not understand to what he is referring. If he is referring to remarks I made, if he reads what I wrote at the time he will find that it was not economic hindsight.  We are all subject to the accusation of hindsight.  We all indulge in it but I do not think that accusation is always appropriate and on this occasion it is singularly inappropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are faced with a 9 per cent wage increase throughout the economy which seems to be attributable to the Government not settling in an appropriate way a single special increase.  In Britain this problem has been solved because they have struggled to introduce some kind of incomes policy.  They introduced a statutory incomes policy about which I am not enthusiastic.  But they have one feature which I will recommend to the Taoiseach and that is the idea of a Prices and Incomes board to safeguard claims of this kind.  Such a board could have investigated and identified the particular grievances of this group. They could have said that this group <Col N="19" /> merits an increase beyond the normal amount because they have been held back and held down in the past, and therefore we recommend this 9 per cent as a special case.  The trade union movement, who are generally reasonable men, contrary to the allegations frequently made against them, would accept that kind of situation if it were put to them.  But where an increase of nine per cent is given and spread throughout the entire public service, how can you expect the workers in the private sector to hold back?  They have been trying to hold increases in salaries at a reasonable level as they have been exhorted to do by the Government and they find themselves sabotaged by the Government's failure to control its own affairs in this respect.  This needs to be said because it is one of our critical problems.</P>
    <P>Apart from the agricultural trouble facing this country our biggest problem is this critical incomes policy issue.  It is critical not because of any particular deficiency in our trade unions or on the part of the negotiating arm of management, not because of anything peculiar to the Irish people, but primarily because the Government will not organise its own affairs properly in this respect and is continuously introducing wage increases by its failure to cope with problems within the public service and its failure to have a system under which a particular group with grievances will get an increase without having it generalised to everybody.  So much for the excess increases in incomes, which is one of the inflationary factors.  It must be put clearly on the shoulders of the Government.  You will not find anybody in trade unions or in management outside who is prepared to take responsibility for it. They have become irritated at the Government's behaving in this way and at the Government continuing to give a lead in the opposite direction to that in which its own exhortations point.  A large amount of Government expenditure arises in this particular area.</P>
    <P>I should like now to deal with the <Col N="20" /> problem of credit.  I should like the Taoiseach to explain what has been the credit policy of this country for the past six to eight months?  He has not explained it in the other House or here.  I cannot understand it.  There is no explanation for it and I feel confident it is disturbing opinion by the extraordinary way it is being managed. The Central Bank last May advised the Associated Banks that in the 12 months ahead they should increase credit by not more than the same amount as in previous years, that is £64 million.  This was a reasonably appropriate figure.  I think it was high at the time but the Central Bank knows more about it than I do, and therefore I accept that it seems reasonable enough.  During the following six months the volume of credit was increased by almost the entire £64 million.  The Central Bank said they would increase credit by £64 million during the year.  I should like to know from the Taoiseach was this ladling out of £64 million in the first half of the year all due to seasonal pressures?  Some of the comments in the Central Bank's statement yesterday make it clear that there is more at stake here.  The advice of the Central Bank was not adhered to.  It was departed from and in departing from it credit in this country has inflated at a rate that has no parallel.  Since the end of October, 1967, this increase represents £95 million.  The increase in credit which was inflationary in 1965 was barely £50 million.  We have the experience behind us of a year with an excessive wage round increase and Government expenditure excessively up, as it were.  If you increase credit in such a year by a large amount you are asking for trouble.</P>
    <P>In constant money terms £64 million is the same as the £50 million odd of three years earlier.  Yet the actual increase represents £95 million since end October, 1967, and nothing was done about it.  The Taoiseach had nothing to say about credit beyond the fact that it should be given for the usual productive purposes.  There is no explanation as to why credit is not restrained or what the Central Bank felt about it or what the Government felt about it. <Col N="21" /> Surely this is a matter that should be discussed in the Houses of the Oireachtas. What kind of legislature have we that these things are not probed and properly discussed in full?  In the Central Bank statement of yesterday you have to read between the lines and one sees between the lines what people do not intend to put there very often. But they appear to be saying&mdash;&ldquo;We laid down the guideline of £64 million credit out of which the Government were to get their share.  They grabbed far more than their share because they cannot control themselves.  This means we are faced with either adhering to our limits as we did in 1965, cutting credit to the private sector, or else we have to face abandoning our limits.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In 1965 we insisted on a limit being set and we got that far but deflated the economy too much.  It is obvious that the Central Bank now takes the stand that they cannot repeat this and that all they can do is to accept the fact that there has to be a restriction of credit and to tell the private sector to take it easy and to do their best. The Government ignored what their own advisers were trying to do.  The Central Bank's advice may have been unduly generous in April but instead of adhering to that advice the Government bulldozed their way ahead and grabbed more than their share, so that inflationary pressures from credit are now a powerful force.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency among some economists to play down the importance of credit as an inflationary factor but I believe credit is a much more important factor in Ireland than we appreciate.  The 1965 crisis was largely due to credit inflation.  The breakdown in credit control this year and the breakdown in the system which the Central Bank introduced in 1965 is due to the Government's incompetence in managing their own affairs. I do not know what the banks are supposed to do from now on.  They are supposed to tighten up a bit, but how much?  Nobody seems to know what line of guidance they are to follow, and by how much they are to restrict credit.  They have been told to go easy but that is very different from what <Col N="22" /> they were told in 1965.  This is a matter which needs to be discussed and debated by both sides of the House and it is a matter to which the Taoiseach must give an answer.</P>
    <P>So much for the Budget and the economic reasons for it.  Our economy is sound and I hope that it will be much less affected by these measures than it was in 1965 and very much less than it was on previous occasions.  The trouble is that the Government seem unable to control their own expenditure or even to forecast it.  There are so many open-ended commitments such as those to the public service and for agricultural subsidies, that the Government must bear the blame for the position in which they now find themselves. There is this open-ended commitment to the public service and there is also the commitment to subsidies for agriculture. I do not know the answer to the problem but it is something that must be tackled by both sides of this House.  I agree with the Taoiseach that the situation requires deep concern for the long term future rather than dark gloom about the immediate future, but even with all those criticisms there is one aspect of the Budget on which we are perhaps moving in a more positive direction.</P>
    <P>Given that we have a situation where the economy has been allowed to get out of hand, given that something needs to be done, given that the choice of the Government was to tax and hit consumption or to cut credit drastically as was formerly done, the balance is more nearly right now than it was formerly. Formerly the step taken was to cut back capital investment.  We disrupted the building industry in 1965 by cutting capital investment, on the grounds that it was easier politically to cut investment rather than consumption.  If one can interpret this Budget as having any sensible pattern at all, the decision to cut the growth of consumption rather than to cut capital investment is a step in the right direction, if that is the objective the Government have in doing this.  If this is the policy behind their action, to that extent something good has been done.  It is evident, however, that the Government's approach is so devious and so unclear, that the <Col N="23" /> Opposition have to delve into the whole matter to see what is the thinking behind it.  That is not an efficient and competent approach by the Government.</P>
    <P>I wish now to refer to another matter of current concern, the Free Trade Area Agreement with Britain.  I referred at some length to this matter in the first Budget debate of this year and I commend to the Taoiseach my remarks at that time.  I have been concerned at the tone and content of the Taoiseach's remarks on the progress of this Agreement.  The Taoiseach is generally very careful in what he says and it is not like him to make claims which are not sustainable.  On several occasions recently he has made claims for the Free Trade Area Agreement which he must know cannot be sustained.  The Taoiseach must know well that the increase in the value of our exports to Britain due to the Agreement as distinct from those increases that would have happened anyway, is a tiny proportion of the total increase.  I have done very careful calculations on this matter and gone into it in great detail. I have tried to determine as closely as possible the growth of our exports following the Agreement.  I have given the fullest credit possible for the increase in our exports which followed the removal of the synthetic fibre duties.  I have been generous in attempting to assess the agricultural benefits, using authoritative data, which is also available to the Taoiseach.  I have tried to give credit for every possible benefit, and the sum total of what I got up to the time of the first Budget this year was an increase in the current rate of value of our exports of about £6 million. I defy anybody to produce a refutation of those figures.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, when replying to the Budget debate&mdash;he may not have been well at the time&mdash;referred to these figures rather briefly.  He did not attempt to refute what I had said but made the point that I had said that the balance of the Agreement at this stage was in our favour and that anything I said about the future was only speculation.  The losses up to that time from increased imports amounted <Col N="24" /> to £2 million.  The net gain was £6 million and this may now amount to about £5 million.  In this Agreement all the gains come at the beginning and after that will come the losses.  These losses have not yet begun to hit us but they are foreseeable.</P>
    <P>My figures stand until they are challenged and they show that the Agreement will work against us in the latter half of the period.  I calculate that by 1975 Britain's gain from the agreement will be £70 million, of which £45 million would be at the expense of Irish industry.  With this £45 million would be an extra £25 million caused by the diversion of trade, which we at present have, with other countries, to Britain because of the lowering of our tariffs on British goods but not on foreign goods.  That is a tentative calculation, but Britain's gain at our direct expense can be calculated fairly firmly at around £45 million.  The benefits to us are in the nature of £3½ million from agriculture and these agricultural benefits cannot grow.  Even if our industrial benefits continue to grow, it is difficult to see how the total benefits to this country from the Agreement could exceed £20 million, assuming that there are no losses in agriculture, as now seem to be threatened in the current discussions with Britain.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has referred to these chinks in the Agreement, but even if we do not lose agriculturally, the most we can expect to gain is between £15 and £20 million, while our losses would be in the region of £45 million.  This Agreement is one that should never have been signed and the Taoiseach knows that I was sceptical about it from the beginning.  I spoke against it at the time even in the absence of any particular Party line in the matter. Subsequently I allowed myself to be persuaded in this matter.  Now I wish that I had stuck by my own judgment and that I had pressed my own Party to reject the Agreement.  We should have taken another course of action.</P>
    <P>The Agreement, from every point of view, is a disaster.  It increased our dependence on Britain of whom we should be becoming more independent. I have no objection to Britain as a country to be dependent on if we have <Col N="25" /> to be dependent on somebody.  Britain is perhaps the most liberal of the great Powers, but for a country of our size to be totally dependent on a country much bigger such as Britain is very damaging, and for a Government to set out to increase that dependence without any certainty of a broader link with the EEC is unwise and dangerous. To do so in order to get benefits that amount to less than one-half of what was given in return, is damaging and irresponsible.  To do so in an Agreement which has chinks and loopholes is ludicrous.  We are now threatened with reduction in quotas which were to have expanded indefinitely, and this makes the Agreement ludicrous.</P>
    <P>Having said that, when an Agreement of that kind is breached by the other party, an Agreement which was suspect from the beginning and is working out in a manner even more seriously to our disadvantage than had been foreseen, then, I would have said, this is the moment for the Government to seek to regain some liberty of action in the matter and to put themselves in a position to be able to re-negotiate aspects of the Agreement.  It is no moment at which though&mdash;this is a more difficult point and one where the Taoiseach may have reasonable counter arguments&mdash;to announce that the deposit is to be paid for by the Irish Government, before they start negotiations with the British Government about it.  The Taoiseach can argue that in the mood of panic there was danger for our export orders: that had he not acted quickly orders could have been lost.  He may say that the announcement of the import deposit was justifiable. It may have been justified in the short term, but I doubt whether it was justified in the long-term view.  If the Taoiseach had dealt with this breach of the Agreement as it should have been dealt with I do not think he would have taken those measures.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael asked for nothing of the kind.  I take exception to the Taoiseach misrepresenting, in a manner which can scarcely <Col N="26" /> be described as truthful, the Fine Gael position.  The Taoiseach knows there are sound and good reasons why the British do not want to impose quantitative restrictions.  This arrangement allows them to do the only thing they do not want to do.  That is why it is a protection if we insist on it.  In fact, the British are not prepared to impose quantitative restrictions on the world at large; and they could not impose quantitative restrictions on us separately from the world at large because this would be contrary to GATT.  This traps the British.  It traps them in the position that if the Agreement were adhered to they could not effectively impose restrictions on us.</P>
      <P>They could not impose quantitative restrictions on those investments because they are not prepared to impose them generally.  Having imposed other restrictions on other countries, which are illegal as far as we are concerned, they could not impose quantitative restrictions on us because they are a breach of the GATT agreement. I compliment the Government in getting in such a clause but I do not compliment them on the way they negotiated this Agreement.  I hope that is adequate reply to the Taoiseach on his interjection and on his reply to the Fine Gael statement.</P>
      <P>I do not want to develop this clause of the Agreement in greater detail beyond saying I think the House is entitled to some explanation as to why we are negotiating about cheese.  We were told clauses of the Agreement were such that the British could not impose restrictions on the entry of Irish cheese except in the context of the international commodity agreement through which produce of British agriculture would also be controlled and an agreement which would give us the same claims as the British farmers would get.  If that is the position, why are we negotiating about it?  Why are we having any discussion with the British on this?  Why is it that a few days after the breach of the Agreement by the British we went to negotiate something which is our right under the Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is this one of the chinks the Taoiseach pointed out?  Is it the chink <Col N="27" /> which I pointed out at that time, contrary to the view of the Minister for Agriculture?  Is his exchange of letters with Mr. Peart not governed by other clauses, articles 8 and 9?  I suggested that, in an article I wrote in the <i>Irish Times.</i>  Three days later the Minister for Agriculture replied to that article in the Dáil and said that I was wrong&mdash;that the exchange of letters was governed by other clauses and therefore it would be out of question for the British to restrict imports from Ireland without restricting their own products.  Why contradict me?  Is it that I was right and he was wrong?  Is that the chink which is causing so much difficulty?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has a duty to tell us more about this.  I do not think the House should be left in ignorance of just what is happening under this Agreement.  One point, finally, I should like to make about this Agreement is the most worrisome.  We had agreements with the British which were unsatisfactory and which became so because of an erosion of our position and changes in British policy over the years, but under those agreements we held certain rights in the British market in return for which we gave them certain privileges which cost us virtually nothing.  They were preferential considerations at the expense of other countries.  This was a fairly happy arrangements.</P>
    <P>The 1938 Agreement, reinforced by the 1948 Agreement and modified by the 1960 Agreement, was a basically strong one.  We got certain rights in the British market in return for concessions at the expense of foreigners, not a bad arrangement.  What do we do?  We negotiate an Agreement under which we negotiate away four-fifths of our industrial trade.  We gave the British free access to Irish markets in respect of four-fifths of their industrial goods in return for the same concessions as before, which brings in some £3½ million in the case of agriculture and certain benefits industrially which I have mentioned.  Now, supposing that Agreement having been signed, Fine Gael had pressed in the Dáil for its rejection and succeeded in getting it rejected, and the Government, having <Col N="28" /> signed this new Agreement, faced the difficulty that the rights which we had in the previous Agreement had disappeared, if we rejected this new Agreement after the British Government had signed it, the rights which we had for the previous 25 to 27 years could also have been put in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>A Government which negotiate an agreement giving another country certain rights and by so doing put their own country in jeopardy if that agreement is challenged at a later stage, are a Government which act ineptly, and that is the real concern about this Agreement.  The real concern is that we are now stuck with an Agreement appallingly disastrous to us and from which it would be impossible to get the enormous benefits we had under the previous one.  What are we supposed to do about this breach of the Agreement?  We should be told what the Government intend to do.  We will give them one opportunity of doing that.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's statement was that it was a breach of the spirit of the Agreement which is one of the biggest give-aways in our relations with other countries during the last 50 years. Those are things which need to be said. I do not wish to be unfair in criticism but it is the job of the Opposition to probe such acts.  The Government are not frank on this in regard to chinks and cheeses and I am right in probing this issue and seeking from the Taoiseach an elaboration of what has happened so far and an adequate defence of an Agreement so disastrous to this country.</P>
    <P>There are two other particular matters I should like to deal with before turning to general issues of Government action and Government performance.  One matter relates to Biafra.  We have been frustrated in this House from discussing this issue month after month.  We were frustrated earlier in the year by being told we could not be given time for discussing this matter and we have been frustrated during the last four months because we have not met.  Our policy in this matter has been deplorable and the Irish people think so.  Many Members of the other side of the House, and I <Col N="29" /> suspect many members of the Government, think so but because the Minister for External Affairs is adopting a purely legalistic attitude we are frustrated from expressing our views and playing our role in this matter.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that this war be brought to an early end and it will not be brought to an end by inaction but by action.  We are one of the few countries to have diplomatic ties with both sides in the war.  We are a neutral country not with material interests but with spiritual interests and we have nothing to lose by trying to play our role in this matter.  We are not concerned with preserving oil resources as the Russians are.  We know the British are supplying arms in this war. What motives have prevented us, for well over a year, from protesting to Britain against the supply of arms? How many representations did it take and how many months did it take to persuade our reluctant Minister for External Affairs to mention to the British that this was a matter which was causing us concern?</P>
    <P>Why this reluctance?  What are we afraid of?  What kind of relationship have we got with the British that we are afraid to raise this matter that people of this country are so concerned about?  Irish people feel deep outrage that a neighbour of ours, because of commercial interest, should supply those arms to a country which is at war and which now threatens the lives of 7 million people, people with whom we have close and friendly relations and with whom many of our own people have worked.  We could and should have played a different role here, a stronger role and an earlier role.  We should be playing a part in the United Nations.  I know that the Minister for External Affairs takes the view that any interference by white people in Africa would be resented, but that is not the case.  There are white people and white people, and I do not think it is the case that a helpful initiative on our part would necessarily be resented in the way that he suggests.</P>
    <P>I do not think that we can any longer content ourselves with taking the easy way in this situation, saying that it is better to do nothing in case <Col N="30" /> we might do harm.  We have a responsibility, and a desperately urgent one, and I feel sure that there are people not only on the Government side but in the Government who share my view. I feel that if I raise this matter now without pressing it any further at this point, because there is a motion on the Order Paper, perhaps I may encourage members of the Government to press the Minister for External Affairs on this, to take some kind of action that would satisfy our people that we are doing something to deal with this appalling situation.</P>
    <P>I want to move now to the general issue of the quality of government. What this country needs at this time is an energetic Government, a democratic Government in the sense of a Government not merely democratically elected but a Government which in a democratic manner seeks to extend the area of democracy in our country, a socially progressive Government, and a Government in command of the situation, whose Ministers know what they want to achieve and how to achieve it, and who seek advice on means to achieve their ends from the Civil Service rather than advice on what those ends should be.</P>
    <P>I believe that we have not had such a Government for some time past. What we have is a Government which is lacking in new initiatives and new ideas and which, from its inception in 1957&mdash;I do not say from 1932&mdash;has been dependent on the Civil Service and on outside sources for new ideas and new initiatives.  The Government which came into power in 1932 had policies and ideas, many of which I would have disagreed with if I had been old enough to be taking a part in political life, and some of which were excellent ideas, but in any event they were their own ideas and they set out to implement them, right or wrong. They were a Government of men who knew their own minds, and though many of the things they wanted to do I regard as reprehensible, they were at least a Government in command of the situation.</P>
    <P>Since then, during the last 11 years, we have had a Government which clearly&mdash;and there is no need to produce <Col N="31" /> evidence of this because it is before our eyes&mdash;have been dependent for their initiatives and ideas on the Civil Service and on outside sources.  I challenge the Taoiseach to tell us truthfully what half dozen major changes in policy effected in this country in the last ten years have come from the Fianna Fáil Party which have not been prompted by the Civil Service or by vocational interests outside.</P>
    <P>Where is the fruit of the three years in Opposition from 1954 to 1957? Where are the new policies and ideas that should have been generated in that period?  Remember what happened. The Government came back into office in March, 1957, in very serious times indeed, but nothing happened until December of that year, when Mr. Whitaker, the Head of the Civil Service, wrote to the then Minister for Finance, Senator Ryan, to suggest that some kind of economic programme was needed to set the country on its feet.</P>
    <P>The correspondence shows that the Minister for Finance acted with some promptness, and that that initiative was followed up and an economic development scheme was produced on which the First Programme for Economic Expansion was built.  The evidence we have suggests that the Government's share in the development of that policy was limited to two slight differences&mdash;one about the proposed policy change regarding feeding barley and I have forgotten the other.</P>
    <P>The rest of that First Programme was what was proposed by the Civil Service and initiated by the Civil Service. The Government in office for nine months had done nothing and did not seem to know what to do.  It must be said to the credit of the Government that they published the advice given to them and published this correspondence. In an endeavour to restore confidence in the country, they came clean and told the truth on that occasion, that the source from which the ideas had come was non-political.  It was an honest, honourable and courageous thing to do, and I have constantly commended and congratulated the Government on that action in publishing <Col N="32" /> the correspondence, but at the same time I am entitled to rely on the evidence and to say that it is clear from it they did not have a programme or a policy of their own.</P>
    <P>I have not been aware during the last ten years of any major reforms of any significance which have been initiated and seen to be initiated from the Fianna Fáil Party as distinct from the various public service or vocational bodies and proposals from the NIEC and the Civil Service.  This is not government as it used to be in the 20s. It is not even government as it used to be in the 30s and it is not government as it must be in the 70s.</P>
    <P>The quality of government has fallen to a low level.  This is because the political Party in power did not come in with any set of clear-cut policies which it wished to bring into being and put into force.  The first Fianna Fáil Government was elected with a clear-cut and clearly-stated viewpoint. It knew where it wanted to go, but the country has suffered since then from the absence of such a situation.  The Government has benefited from the good advice given to it by the Civil Service, particularly in regard to economic development, and where the Civil Service Departments concerned were well qualified to assist the Government in securing economic growth, the Government is to be commended on taking that good advice, sometimes politically difficult advice.  But it cannot be commended for any initiative by the Fianna Fáil Party in areas where the Civil Service Departments concerned have not had the imagination and the confidence to produce the policies required, in which cases there is a total vacuum, or has been so far at least.</P>
    <P>We will, no doubt, be told that the Fianna Fáil Party are producing a social programme, but how long have they taken to do this?  It has taken nearly 12 years, and they are taking their ideas belatedly from the Department of Social Welfare.  In fact they could do nothing else, because they themselves have no ideas, and we have not had a social programme because unfortunately the Department of Social Welfare have been lacking in ideas and <Col N="33" /> so this country has waited and waited and got nothing for its pains.  Maybe a social programme will now be scraped together, but there has been no great display of imagination so far which would raise hopes as to the level or quality of policies that we can expect to be produced.  It should not have taken 12 years to get to this point.  There has been no lack of pressure in reference to social policy, but the Fianna Fáil Party have been so excessively concerned, first of all with the referendum and secondly with the gerrymandering of constituencies, that they do not seem to have time to think of anything else, and any social policy which does emerge will have to come from the Government Departments concerned and not from the Government or from the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I do not think the country should go on like this.  The time has come for a change, a change that will enable us to see in office a Government which has its own policies which have been presented or are being currently prepared, in some cases for publication in the near future, by the principal Opposition Party.  Nobody on the other side is entitled to criticise the principal Opposition Party on the grounds that they do not know what it intends to do when it is put into office.  No Party, including that which took office in 1932, has ever presented this country in more detail and showing clearly what it wants to do.  The electorate have never been given before a better opportunity to decide in favour of a particular course of action by a Party with particular policies.  Never before has the intended course of action of a Government been put so clearly on the table.</P>

      <P>I think that &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo; is a rather inadequate interruption, which does not contain as many letters as the policies that this Party have put before the Irish people in the last three or four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need an imaginative Government, a democratic and socially progressive Government and a Government <Col N="34" /> in command of the situation to the extent to which a Government needs to be in command of the situation. We need a Government with Ministers who come into office with clear-cut policies which the Civil Service will help them to put into force.  The fault of the Civil Service is that it places too much emphasis on avoiding any embarrassment to its Ministers.  If the Minister has no policy the best way not to embarrass him is not to produce any policy.  If however a Minister comes in with policies to which he is committed, the best way not to embarrass him is to implement them.  The way to get the most out of the Civil Service is to have the political side doing its job&mdash;determined to put its policies into force. If we have to rely on the Civil Service to prepare the policies, in some cases we get good value but in some cases we get bad value.  But even when they fail abysmally we should not blame them.  It is not their job.  The burden put on them in the last ten years is one that should not have been put on them.  There are many criticisms that may be made of the Civil Service but they should not be criticised for not doing the Government's work.</P>
    <P>It is 11 or 12 years since Fine Gael formulated a health scheme and then it was put out of office.  The Minister for Health came in here I think three years ago with similar ideas.  We pressed him and he said they would be put into operation in some months, but we have not heard of them since.</P>
    <P>What has this Government contributed by way of new policies in social welfare?  I know they have raised social welfare expenditure.  But I also know the proportion of public expenditure devoted to social welfare has constantly and steadily declined.  Would anybody like to challenge that statement? I was waiting for an interruption, perhaps &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo; from Senator Ó Maoláin, but nothing has been said.  Therefore, I shall have to repeat it.  The proportion of public expenditure devoted to social security and social welfare has constantly and steadily declined under this Government in case that was not heard the first time I said it.</P>

      <P>In 1958, the year after the Inter-Party Government left office 24.0 per cent of expenditure was devoted to social security.  In 1964 at the point when this issue was raised strongly and forcibly that figure had dropped by 21 per cent.  In 1968-69 the best estimate I can make, and the Minister will contradict me if I am wrong, is 20.5 per cent.  In the ten years of Fianna Fáil government social security has been so downgraded that as a proportion of current public expenditure it has fallen by 20 per cent.</P>

      <P>The amounts have been increased but by a hell of a sight less than everything else has been increased.  The figures show that in absolute terms social security has gone up by a very big increase. Since 1958 you will see it rose from £33 million to £79 million, but when you look at the increase in the other items there is no comparison.  That is an increase of almost 2½ times.</P>

      <P>I suppose they have gone up by 2½ times.  But subsidies have gone up from £15 million to £66½ million.  That is almost 4½ times instead of 2½.  There is an increase in public consumption from £71 million to £77 million, an equivalent amount.  Secondary education rose from £2 million to £9 million, which is 4½ times.  The increase in social security by comparison with all these increases has been so much less than the increase in the rest of Government expenditure, that it is now downgraded and represents a one-fifth smaller share of Government expenditure than it did when this Government came into office.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about weekly expenditure but the total amount.  The current Government expenditure figures for 1958 is £139 million.  My calculation gives a figure of £385½ million for 1968 but the 1968 figures are estimated to a small degree.  However, you can take them as being accurate, to within one or two decimal points.</P>
      <P>The other side of the House do not like this but the Irish people have a right to hear it.  One of the reasons for this is the Government lack of concentration except on increasing weekly rates of existing benefits which have been done fairly well, and social welfare is at a much better level than in 1958.  The reason why the share is smaller than it was, as a share of public expenditure, is the Government has no energy or imagination to introduce reforms or new areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was prepared to give the Minister two minutes silence for this funeral oration on Fianna Fáil.  Let us move from social welfare and health to local government. Our country is going through a period of economic growth.  We have great changes taking place, regional colleges of technology being built, regional tourist boards being set up, regional hospitals being established.  A whole new area of local government is growing up and both inside and outside Parliament there is complete dissatisfaction with the failure of the Government to devolve authority to the local bodies.  We have a situation here which is totally unsatisfactory.  There is no real local autonomy, no real local control. There is a great need for a whole new regional structure but nothing has been done about that, nothing has been said about it.  Even in Northern Ireland big reforms are being introduced, some of them for particular reasons which do not apply here, but these include reforms which are radical in the structure of local government.  What great reforms are coming forward here? What are the Government's proposals radically to reform the local government structure.  There is no evidence whatever of them, there is no word of them.</P>

      <P>That took up a year of the Government's time <Col N="38" /> but it did not take 11 years, the period during which the Government have been in office.  Take Parliament.  Is there anybody who believes that Parliament is not in need of reform? Is there not widespread dissatisfaction with the performance of Parliament? Everybody knows that Parliament as at present constituted cannot perform its proper role in the light of the nation.  There is a total absence of the committee system which is in operation in almost every other country, but there is no sign from the Government of any proposals for reform.  There is nothing but a determined effort to prevent any development, a determination to retain control of Parliament in their own interests.  Even when certain reforms were suggested by the Constitutional Committee, even if such reforms did not require constitutional action, these reforms were dropped.</P>
      <P>Take the field of industrial relations. Year after year we wait for the Bill that has been so much talked about for so long.  It is 11 years since Fianna Fáil came in and in all that time there has been nothing done about incomes policy.  It is three and a half years since the National Industrial and Economic Council made certain recommendations.</P>

      <P>I am talking about constructive progress.  Where has there been any action about an incomes policy?  Nothing has been done. The Government, to which the responsibility belongs, have done nothing. How are we to control wage and salary increases if we do not control non-wage and non-salary incomes? How are we to persuade wage and salary earners to go along with appeals for restraint if you must have an incomes policy applying to all incomes? The Government do not want to take any steps in this direction because such steps would be unpopular with its more powerful and influential followers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Incomes policy is an area where progress is now most required.  The Government's determination to do nothing is leading to a serious situation here.  Inflation could be brought under control.  Their unwillingness to outline incomes policy for non-wage and salary income is impending progress.  Until we get a government prepared to do something about this, wage inflation is going to be with us.</P>
      <P>What are we hearing about workers' democracy from the Government? What steps are taken to give the worker a say?  What is the Government doing about all these things?  Is the Government leading opinion in this matter? If it is it cannot be doing it very loudly because I have not heard it.</P>
      <P>What about our foreign policy?  One can argue either that we have no foreign policy or two foreign policies&mdash; but certainly not one foreign policy.  In reality we cannot call what we have got a foreign policy.  One can talk about the foreign policy of the Department of External Affairs and about our economic foreign policy but we have not, in fact, got a foreign policy.  We have shuttled back and forward, between different positions depending upon the advisers who might have been there or who might have resigned over that period.  You can trace the evolution of our policy depending on the presence or absence of particular advisers.  Is this Government leadership? What is the Irish position in the world today?  Are we playing a leading role as a neutral country with the western countries?  We are not highly regarded and we are not playing a role. We have not even a foreign policy designed to further our interests.  We are drifting closer to dependence on Britain.  This is something we have drifted into without realising its extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about the Irish language?  Here there is the greatest reluctance to face facts.  The fact is the Government have lost the support of the Irish people for the language by wrong policies with regard to the language.  But they have <Col N="40" /> also lost the support of the language organisations too.  It takes genius to lose both at the same time.</P>
    <P>We come now to agriculture and the best I can do for the Government with regard to agriculture is not to speak about it.  I do not think anybody in this House on the other side is going to make a speech on the Government's agricultural policy and how well it is going and how pleased the farmers are about it.  I have not heard such a speech in the 3½ years I have been here.</P>
    <P>This is the record of the Government in so many areas.  It is the record of a dying Government.  Many people who are not committed to Fine Gael or to the Labour Party want to see the end of this Government.  The people are tired of them and they want change.</P>
    <P>I also said we want democratic government.  We have had democratic government in that our Governments have been democratically elected.  They are, within certain limits, behaving democratically but only within certain limits.  They are bureaucratic rather than democratic.  They are authoritarian. They reject consultation and participation.  It is beneath their dignity as a Government to consult people. They are a Government which retain tight control of local affairs and trust nobody to do anything.  They are a Government which in their arrogance in regard to general educational activity, even in university matters, have alienated the entire body of opinion in these areas.  They are a Government which have irritated the managers of secondary schools to incredible bursts of anger such as we have not seen before in my memory.</P>
    <P>They have shown what they think of the true ideas of democracy by their repeated interference with the freedom of speech on RTE, and their incredible performance in trying to prevent a camera team being sent out to a foreign country without the permission of the Minister.  Even the French Government have not attempted to do that. They have done that most undemocratic thing of all, withholding advertising from a newspaper because it did not agree with their policy.  That is a most damaging thing to do.  I would condemn any Government for that <Col N="41" /> alone even if its performance otherwise was very good.  It has attempted to increase its authoritarian hold through the referendum.  It has now resorted to undemocratic gerrymandering and in order to ensure control of the democratic activities of our people it is proposing a Criminal Justice Bill with measures in it which to my mind are of the kind that the Northern Government are about to abandon.  It is not a truly democratic Government.  They govern democratically or want to bring the people with them or which want participation or consultation.  They resist those instinctively.</P>
    <P>The people do not want that Government any longer.  They put up with it in the past because they felt that such a Government might be more efficient at times.  At times they put efficiency before democracy but they do not do that any longer.  Now people want to run their own affairs.  The growth of vocational bodies and of community organisations is all part of a change which this Government have failed, to its peril, to recognise.  This Government has failed to live up to the standards required for imaginative government, democracy, socially progressive government and a Government in command of the situation.</P>
    <P>My language has been strong, and perhaps too strong, but I think one is entitled to emphasise these points.  At times I feel I must speak plainly.  I speak with as much detachment as I can in this House, but there are times when one should abandon detachment and speak with force, determination and vigour.  It is time for a change. Everyone knows it is the job of the Opposition to provide an alternative. If an Opposition fails to do that it has failed the people.  There has been criticism of the Opposition in the past to this effect.  Often the criticism has been unfair.  But when it has been repeated by people not in Fianna Fáil, but by fairminded people, that criticism must have had some force.  But that criticism is diminishing and it has not been heard in recent months to the same extent as earlier.</P>
    <P>There is a growing confidence in the ability of the principal Opposition <Col N="42" /> Party to provide an alternative Government. This position shows itself in small ways but convincingly.  I have seen it and smiled.  When people who previously regarded the Opposition as of no consequence and not worth talking to but who left everything to the Government, come along and try to find out what the Opposition leaders are thinking and begin to make representations and begin to show they feel they had better hitch their wagons to a different star at this stage, and begin to show a serious interest in the policies of the Opposition; when journalists ring up and say &ldquo;I am writing for my paper abroad and I think it is important we should have an idea how the next government is going to govern&rdquo;, when businessmen come and ask similar questions; and when vocational bodies show a willingness of a kind that we have not known previously to talk to the principal Opposition Party&mdash;these, gentlemen, are the signs of change.  There is a swing now in favour of a change of Government, a swing which was inhibited until recently by the feeling that there was not an alternative Government ready but this alternative Government is now ready.  We have now virtually completed our policies. There are a number of areas which we have not yet covered about which we will be publishing views and comments within the next weeks.  When I say &ldquo;weeks&rdquo; I am not like the Minister for Health.  With him weeks are not weeks but we shall adhere to &ldquo;weeks&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We will now make it clear what we intend to do in areas in respect of which we have not yet made clear our position.  We will ensure that there is no area about which people are in doubt.  There will be no danger that people will not know what they are voting for and what our policies are.</P>

      <P>This debate gives the opportunity of dealing not alone with the taxation policy of the Government but also indeed the general economic situation of the country.  However, in regard to the Finance Bill (No. 2) which we have before us, the Labour Party is opposing the passage of this Bill.  We are against this Bill because of its effect on the cost of living.  We are against it also because no provision has been made to help the unemployed, the sick, the widows and orphans and the old age pensioners to meet the increase in the cost of living.  An increase in the cost of living is brought about not alone by the provision of this Bill but also by the very alarming increase in the cost of living sanctioned by the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="44" /> after the referendum.  We have been building up a tradition in this country of providing for extra benefits to the social welfare receipients to compensate not alone for the increase in the cost of living brought about by budgetary provisions but also for an increase in the standard of living.  I acknowledge this to the Government that we have had this picture of meeting not alone the increase in the cost of living of these people but also of improving even marginally their real standard of living.  We have in this mini-Budget departed from this very good practice that has obtained for quite a number of years.</P>
      <P>We have an increase in taxation, an increase in the cost of living, an increase in the burden on everybody but more particularly on the people who are badly off, the social welfare and social assistance people, without at the same time making any provision to help them because of those increases. We know it will be pointed out that certain benefits are being increased from 1st January but those are being increased by, and flow from, the first Budget of this year.  They were then talked about and announced.  We subsequently had legislation, another beating of drums, and now on the 1st January we shall have another beating of drums when finally those people get the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned this before.  Why should those people have to wait like this?  It is not easy for them to grasp and understand what is going on when they are told in the newspapers and in the Budget speech about an increase in benefits.  We find no increase coming along.  Those people are puzzled. Usually about three or four months later we have legislation to provide for those increases.  Again it is blazoned in the newspapers.  Again the people see there is something coming and very often they have to wait until the 1st January in the following year to get any of their benefits.  The point I am making is that here we have a Budget which increases the cost of living for everybody.  The price of tobacco, the price of cigarettes, the price of a pint is increased as much to those people, and perhaps more to them, as to anyone <Col N="45" /> else.  Here we are increasing those prices and giving no benefits to assit them to meet the increase in the cost of living.  This practice which I have referred to of providing for increased benefits, while at the same time providing for increased taxation and an increase in the cost of living, has been a good one and has enabled the Labour Party in quite a few Budgets to support the Budget proposals, at least not to vote against the proposals.</P>
    <P>Here we are in a situation which is different from that of recent years in that we have provided for an increase in the cost of living but have given no concession to the people who most need protection in the circumstances.  I have referred to the people who are perhaps most in need of benefit, the social welfare and the social assistance people, but the increases in the second Budget are also very serious for those people and for another group of people, those people who have been saving to make deposits on houses.  I am told that as a result of the Budget increases the prices of houses will be increased by £100 to £200.  I have this on good authority.  I hope it can be contradicted because it will certainly put those people who, as I say, have been saving to make deposits on their houses, in a bad way and this will be a serious set-back for them.  Those people who have been planning to get married and saving diligently to make deposits will now find as a result of this measure by the Government that they will have a further set-back and they will not be able to make a deposit.  They will have to continue to scrape and do without a house.</P>
    <P>The Finance (No. 2) Bill is being opposed by the Labour Party for the additional reason that the severity of the imposts is to a large extent due to the neglect of the Government over the past six months.  Most of us will acknowledge this.  Those increases are due because of Government expenditure, during this parliamentary year, in their attempt to abolish proportional representation.  There was a great waste of money, a waste of time and energy involved in this.  It is obvious to most people and it must have been especially obvious to the Minister for Finance that there was need to do something <Col N="46" /> about this increase in expenditure during the summer.  We were all conscious of the situation then but for Party political purposes the Government avoided doing anything about the increases or the introduction of a second Budget until the end of the year.</P>
    <P>This was, of course, to avoid the controversy that would probably result at a time when they were trying to hoodwink the people to abolish proportional representation.  I suppose this must be a problem for any political Party in office, a problem of being caught in a dilemma, where there is need for a Government to do something which is politically disastrous, and at the same time not wanting to do it for fear of loss of votes.</P>
    <P>A Government in a democracy must be prepared to accept their responsibilities in a position like this.  I charge this Government with neglect for Party political purposes, of declining to take action to control the situation since April and failing to take measures to rectify the economy until now.  The economy as a result is not in a good state but I agree with what the Taoiseach said this afternoon, that is that it is not a crisis.</P>
    <P>The Government, dealing with the position, I suppose had a choice.  They had a choice of cutting consumption or cutting investment.  They decided to cut consumption and, like Senator G. FitzGerald, I agree with the principle of this.  I think the Government were right in choosing to cut consumption rather than to cut investment.  It would have been disastrous to cut investment.  It would have interfered with the building programme and it would have led to loss of employment in the building industry.  We all know too well the severe repercussive effects which can flow from that, so I am glad the Government made the choice of cutting consumption rather than cutting investment.</P>
    <P>As I said, we are not in a crisis, but equally we should not be complacement about our position.  No real progress has been made to achieve full employment. This is something which we all agree on but there is no hope whatever, with this Government in office, that we will achieve an incomes policy. <Col N="47" /> I also think the trading position of our economy will be increasingly difficult.</P>
    <P>Let me speak about full employment for a moment.  We have seen week after week, in the employment figures which are circulated to us, a larger increase of unemployment over the corresponding week of the previous year and over the previous week of the current year.</P>
    <P>I suppose we can be told that there is an explanation for the figure in any week being larger than the corresponding week last year, but I am disturbed at the increases week after week.  Every week shows a small increase, not much but unfortunately very alarming.  It seems to me that we are further from achieving full employment than perhaps we have been.  I agree that progress has been made in providing industrial employment, but obviously not at a sufficient rate, not with such speed as to be able to absorb the disemployment created in agriculture.</P>
    <P>In regard to an incomes policy, I agree fundamentally with what Senator FitzGerald said on this&mdash;that it is virtually impossible to expect the trade unions to agree to a policy of wage restraint when there is obviously no restraint on other incomes in the economy.  I do not know whether I would be regarded as violating our laws by making a reference to the increases in allowances to Members of the Oireachtas.  I supported the increases at the time, but as a person who has been involved in trade union negotiations I must say it was obvious that the extent and the timing of those increases were such as to make more difficult reasonable negotiations in the 11th round which is now nearly finished.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party have for a long time been pressing the view that the level of the allowances was inadequate and I think that Senator Ó Maoláin will remember that I acknowledged on the passage of that Bill that the increases were badly needed, and I drew on my own experience of knowing three members of my own union who were Members of the <Col N="48" /> Dáil and have died since I came into political life and whose families would have been in better financial circumstances if they had never taken up political offices.  That was one of the crying needs, to do something about the allowances, but the point was that this should have been done at a far earlier stage.  The mistake was made, and may I make the point that Deputy Corish, in speaking on this in the Second Reading in the Dáil, made a plea that for the future we should have some sort of machinery for doing it instead of the Houses of the Oireachtas doing it themselves&mdash;which is not a very correct description of the position because, of course, we have to depend upon the agreement of the Government&mdash;that there should be some sort of tribunal or body to advise on the level of the allowances and the timing of the various suggestions?</P>
      <P>As I said, a mistake was made, but have we come any nearer to finding a solution for the future or are we to have a situation that the allowances will be left as they are for the next decade?  Now do not let anybody misinterpret me and say that I am advocating further increases at this time.  I am not.  What I am saying is that the position should not be let lie for such a long period that we would again find ourselves in the same difficulty, giving rise to the same criticism and the same outcries from other people in another decade.  We should in the meantime provide some way of doing this at a pretty regular rate, putting the decision on the result of a recommendation from some people outside ourselves.</P>
      <P>On the question of an incomes policy, what I was saying was that I saw no possibility of the trade unions agreeing to a policy of wage restraint at a time when they are convinced that this Government have no wish or will to restrain other incomes.</P>

In the first Budget this year, and in the Budget of the previous year, an estimate was given of surtax payers, of money handed back to them, and we were <Col N="49" /> told that they would not work unless we handed out this to them.  The ordinary worker sees this sort of position, and if you could look over at that hotel across the road I am sure you would see quite a few very grand and expensive cars, Mercedes, <i>et cetera</i>, and I suppose the chances are that you will see passing by those very expensive cars some old man, evidently in want, some child obviously undernourished.</P>

      <P>If I may get back to the incomes policy, with the permission of the Leader of the House, I was making the point that I can see no prospect of the trade unions accepting the situation under the present Government.  If I may also make the point at the risk of rousing the Leader of the House again, the trade unions have no confidence in, or, indeed, respect for this Government.  We saw the position during the referendum when trade union leaders were attacked by advertisements paid for by Fianna Fáil. Through their advertisements they charged trade unions with misappropriating their members' funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>They were paid for by Fianna Fáil and the advertisements further called for a public inquiry.  Are we to have these public inquiries or are you satisfied that having slung enough mud at trade union leaders and having been defeated, you will forget all about <Col N="51" /> it?  A public inquiry can be instituted by the Government at any time.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has to get records of returns of the expenditure of every trade union.  He has available information on how the funds are applied.  He can call for information. An officer in the Department of Industry and Commerce is responsible for it.  Are we to have this public inquiry?  Will the trade union leaders be cleared of this mud-slinging or are we expected to put up with it and tolerate it?  That was Fianna Fáil in the midst of a referendum.  We have had our political arguments, that is accepted, but to charge trade union leaders with misappropriation of their members' funds is a most serious allegation and it is deeply resented not alone by the trade unionists but by ordinary members.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have that assurance from the Leader of the House.  I do not think the Government are in a position to give us the necessary leadership to make progress towards full employment or towards the acceptance of an incomes policy.

      <P>The quicker this Government go out of office and we get real leadership the better for the country and the better will the progress be towards full employment and the other desirable objectives.  I referred to our trading position and the fact that this has disimproved even though we are not in a crisis.  I want to make a point which I made previously, and which has been made by many people, about our dependence on the British market.  Nearly three-quarters of our exports go to Britain. There are two points I should like to make about that.  There is, first of all, the importance of the market and secondly, the need to diversify.</P>
      <P>My interest was aroused by a recent article in the Irish Times about the need for a press office in our Embassy in London.  A better case has been made about our position in London because there, I believe, from talking to ordinary British people, they had little idea about this country, its problems, the progress we have made, and they are inclined to think or talk about anything Irish as if it is something funny.  You are expected to be funny if you are an Irishman.  Any developments in Ireland are expected to be funny if you do not take them seriously.  This is largely because there is some ignorance in England about Irish problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would the Taoiseach, in reply, say whether every consideration has been given to the desirability of improving our public relations in London.  I know the Northern Ireland Government expend a lot of money and have a lot of people engaged on that very essential work in London.  I am saying this in connection with the first point I am making, that is the importance to us of the British market.</P>
      <P>I want now to come to the second point, the need to diversify.  I know I will be told that it is easier to advocate diversification than to achieve it, but I think we can make the point that the growth in our industrial exports has been impeded in recent years on two occasions by unilateral action by Great Britain.  Senator FitzGerald argued that they were acting against the letter and spirit of the Agreement.  The Taoiseach does not accept that they were necessarily acting against the letter of the Agreement, but we will all agree that they were acting against the spirit of it. The most recent example is their decision to impose import deposits on our manufactures and here I join in the tribute to the Taoiseach for the swift action he took to meet that situation. Nevertheless, it will cost the Irish taxpayer £2 million because of the unilateral action by the British.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps we can learn something from the British.  When British interests are at stake they take precedence over those of any other country regardless of agreements.  Perhaps we are too much inclined to abide by such agreements at the expense of our own interests and I want to suggest here that if our employment prospects are adversely affected we should learn by what <Col N="54" /> the British have done on two occasions. They put their own interests first and we would be quite entitled, indeed we would be obligated, in the interests of our own people and of our own workers to take similar action.  We have had the example from the British of the import deposits.  If our interests are affected we should be ready to adopt the same procedure and put import deposits on goods which might affect the employment of our people, always provided that the industries concerned have taken all possible steps to improve their efficiency.  I am not advocating that we should do anything or employ import deposits in a situation where a manufacturer is inefficient and has not made a real effort to improve the efficiency of his organisation.</P>
    <P>Where such efforts have been made, where reasonable efforts with the aid of the appropriate grants have been made to improve efficiency and where there is a possibility of workers being thrown out of their employment, we should act to protect our own interests as the British have acted to protect theirs.  I am not advocating this in retaliation for what Britain has done.  Britain has acted to protect her own interests: equally we should be ready and willing to act to protect our interests.</P>
    <P>In regard to the development of exports to countries other than Britain, I should like to give credit to the work of Córas Trachtála Teoranta.  They are very hardworking and enterprising. They may not be successful in all their ventures but that is not their fault. Further investigation should be made of ways and means to encourage exports to markets other than the British market.  We should give some special encouragement to exports to other than that market in order to spread the risk. We should diversify our exports to get out of the difficult position where three-quarters of our exports go to Britain and a situation in which, when she acts in her own interests, such action can have very adverse effects on our economy.</P>
    <P>There are tax reliefs on exports and it is difficult to suggest what further tax reliefs we could give, but perhaps it might be advisable to provide market development grants to encourage <Col N="55" /> exports to other countries.  We did something like this to offset the British levies on our exports some years ago. I may be told that this will be against the GATT Agreement.  I think we should stop being such gentlemen in relation to these matters.  Most other countries, when their vital interests are at stake, do not stick to the letter and spirit of GATT.  Equally I think we should have more regard to our own interests than to the sancity of any international agreement.</P>
    <P>I have no particular proposal to make on this, but a special study should be made of the question of providing some special inducements to exporters to other than the British market because of the danger of concentrating on that market.  If there are difficulties because of GATT, we should try to find a way around them as other countries do.</P>
    <P>I want to go on to the reference to saving made by the Taoiseach when introducing this Budget in the Dáil and to the extra inducements provided for saving.  We all agree that there is need for more savings if we are going to have more jobs in this country.  The steps to allow the savings banks to provide investment accounts are very welcome.  They may be a bit belated but they will help the savings banks to induce people to keep their money on this side of the Border when it is inclined to go across because of the better facilities provided in Northern Ireland.  I want to welcome the arrangements for savings bonds to be introduced on 1st January.  This is expected to provide an incentive for long-term savings and again it is in the national interest.  The Government have finally acknowledged the case made over many years for an increase in the rate of interest on deposits in the Post Office and in the trustee savings banks. These have been brought up to 4 per cent as from 1st January and will help savings in that part of our economy which is of such great importance.</P>
    <P>There is another improvement which again I think arises from 1st January.  From that date you can withdraw up to £30 from the Post <Col N="56" /> Office Savings Bank, whereas the limit previously was £10.  Many of us who have £30 in the Post Office Savings Bank will welcome this improvement. You still have the difficulty that there is a waiting period of six days before further withdrawals can be made.  I hope that another look may be taken at this.  One often finds that the people who avail of the Post Office Savings Bank are people who are saving small amounts.  I witnessed a distressing incident in a post office recently.  A student was trying to withdraw money.  He had to travel because somebody had died. He had some money in the Post Office Savings Bank but he was told he could not withdraw it because he had withdrawn a small amount some days previously. The poor chap was stuck.  This does not help to encourage saving from such people.  I know that this arrangement is to protect the depositors themselves but one can have a saving account in any commercial bank where you are not subject to such restrictions. I hope another look will be taken at this to see if further improvements can be made and to see if this is the furthest possible step to improve the service being provided for the ordinary people by the post office.</P>
    <P>We have heard nothing about the Giro system.  This has been advocated by the Irish Subpostmasters Union.  It came into operation in Britain in October of this year.  I know Britain have been looking at this and talking about it for years.  It is in operation all over the continent for decades and the British were very slow and lazy about providing the service.  We, of course, had not gone ahead of Britain.  We had not done anything about this yet.  The commercial banks have stepped in to try to capture the market though in fact what they are providing is not really the Giro system.  It is really a modernisation of credit transfers which is a service that the domestic banks could always provide.  They called it the Giro system in an attempt to steal the wind out of the sails of the appropriate Minister.  We have been too slow and too lax and have done nothing about it.  When is anything going to be done about providing the service here?</P>
    <P>In my final remarks I will leave the <Col N="57" /> land and take to the sea.  We are discussing the Appropriation Bill with the Finance Bill and I want to mention what may be regarded as a rather small point but a very important one.  It is a very big point for the people involved. I refer to the almost complete lack of fishery protection around our coasts. Some years ago we extended the limits of our territorial waters for fishing.  We always seem to be slow about doing these things.  We made no additional provision whatever for protecting those extra leagues of sea which we had designated as our territorial seas.  We made no move to protect them for our own fishing.  There are, I believe, two corvettes but there can be only one at sea at a time.  If it is known that a corvette is around Donegal, the foreign trawlers around the south-east coast know they are quite safe for days. Nothing can happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence made a very fair and honest reply to this point in an Adjournment Debate in the Dáil recently.  I think it boils down to this: the Government are considering what should be done.  Goodness knows, they have been a long time considering this. The vital intersets of our fishermen are being interfered with while the Government are still considering the problem. There is not much point in investing a lot of public money in improving fishery harbours and providing grants for the purchase of new boats if we are not prepared to protect our own fishermen around our own territorial waters. There is an idea among many people, and certainly among those dealing with fisheries, that fish is in inexhaustible supply.  They believe all you have got to do is go out and catch it.  Why are we having the invasion of foreign trawlers around these coasts?  Is it that they have fished out their own fishing grounds and the herrings are virtually non-existent there?</P>
    <P>Why do they come within our territorial limits?  They come because the fish are there.  I do not think that the herring fishing has yet started at Dunmore East.  It is very late and they are now wondering whether they are going to get herring around that part of the country this year.  It is alleged that the Dutch trawlers around Dungarvan, when the herrings were coming in, <Col N="58" /> cleaned out the whole place in a few days while the corvette was under repair. The fishermen know more about the herring than I do, but I am told that the fishermen fear that the season has been destroyed by fantastic concentrations of foreign trawlers within territorial limits while the corvette was in for refitting after the very heavy work it did following the crash of the Aer Lingus plane into the Irish Sea.  It is alleged that the people who act as agents&mdash;and I am not using &ldquo;agents&rdquo; in the spy story sense but the people who act in the interests of foreign companies&mdash;knew that the corvette was there and that it would have to be there for weeks, and the way was clear for foreign trawlers to come in and clean out the place.</P>
    <P>Whether they cleaned it out or not is beside the point when we, as a nation, have not protected the interests of our fishing.  Every other country provides adequate protection for its fishermen so that the fishing within territorial waters is maintained for the native fishermen.  I am told that in the Isle of Man they get adequate fishery protection by putting an officer on the local trawlers.  These officers go on different trawlers each day so that the poachers do not know which trawler has the fishery protection officer on board.  In this way they can provide adequate protection.  Surely if the Isle of Man can do it we can at least protect the interests of our people.  I know, as I acknowledged already, that the Minister concerned is aware of the problem and that it is being studied. For goodness' sake, hurry up with the studies and provide fishery services for these people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of Senator Murphy's address I intervended, possibly it may appear inadvisedly, when he suggested that the notion which was abroad, in Britain particularly, of Ireland and its achievements, was that of an undeveloped nation, you might say of undeveloped attitudes.  I think I could start on no better note than to refer to a recent publication on the results of a survey which appeared in the weekly supplement of the <i>Daily Telegraph.</i> This survey was conducted by the noted Professor Parkinson.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the survey was to establish which countries, and in particular, which individual country, could be regarded, after applying both economic, social and general tests, as the best administered country.  I am happy to say that, on the application of a wide variety of tests, Ireland ranked as fourth in the world in this particular contest.  I should just like to refer specifically to some matters which we ourselves may take for granted but which other countries, studying us objectively in comparison with other nations, can see as significant achievements.</P>
      <P>The criteria which were applied were very wide-ranging and in the first instance referred to matters such as too high a death rate, too high a birth rate, low life expectancy, social welfare rates and road safety.  I am not suggesting in any of these spheres the Government can take any particular credit for the fact that we qualified in the qualifying round.</P>
      <P>In the other matters, having eliminated a number of countries that for one reason or another could not meet the test in relation to matters such as life expectancy or illness&mdash;this again was in some way a criterion of the social developments and facilities of a nation&mdash;the standards applied were the minimum standards at that stage, but the following standards were then applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first one can give lie to the myth <Col N="60" /> that we are one of the most heavily taxed nations in the world and that we are getting less return for the taxes we are paying.  The standard of actual tax levied, plus the social security controbutions in proportion to the gross national product, was the next standard that was applied.  In fact on that Ireland was significantly lower than many of those who survived the earlier tests.  It was lower than such countries as Sweden, France, West Germany and Norway, all of whom we regard fairly high here and all of whom take more than 40 per cent of their gross national product in income tax and social security contributions.</P>
    <P>Other standards, were then applied such as literacy, which in this country is almost universal; and crime&mdash;the proprotion of the population actively in prison.  Here is something we should pause for a moment to consider because in this Ireland, with one prisoner per 4,000 almost of the population &mdash; this survey relates to 1967&mdash;was significantly lower&mdash;in fact, five to six times lower&mdash;than any other nation considered at that time.  This is something that indicates to the objective observer a least, if not to ourselves at home, that we have a basically, well-ordered society.  There are some elements at present who would apparently set themselves about deranging this society which is in many ways the envy of many nations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that for a moment.  This is a study which is very intense and must be said to be objective, being by such a noted authority as Professor Parkinson.  Eventually it was conceded also that the four nations which were left for further consideration, Finland, the Netherlands, Britain and Ireland, all had an equally high level of administrative competence.  You could not apply any test in that sphere which would segregate one from the other or which would in any way help to determine the final choice, also in relation to the fact that our administrative competence is achieved by a proportionately smaller administrative staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="61" /> Here in Ireland there is approximately, according to the 1967 survey, one member of administrative staff to every 33 of the population, which is significantly lower than Great Britain and one or two other countries also. The final test applied, which is the one in which we were eventually eliminated, was a test of working days lost during a period of 10 years.  After having survived all the other wide-ranging criteria, Ireland was eliminated on that test.</P>
    <P>I do not propose, in opening on this note, to suggest that administrative efficiency, whether it is the envy of other nations, or economic achievement, is the criterion we should solely concern ourselves with here, but I should like to point out to those who say we have not made any significant achievements that objective steps such as those are, and should be, a source of encouragement to us in continuing on the road on which the Government have set themselves.</P>
    <P>Before I leave this point I express my apology to Senator Murphy in that I think his point was not, even though we are well thought of by those who take the trouble to study us&mdash;there are not enough of them who do so&mdash;that we should try to reach them.  In that I am in agreement with him.  As I say, that, to some extent, confirms, if rather briefly and concisely, the efficiency in the administration and the conduct in the nation's affairs.  I would choose rather to occupy myself this afternoon with those matters which relate to broader social questions.</P>
    <P>Economic achievement is one matter, but the problem of harnessing this wealth to the social benefit of the community is altogether another matter. This is, has been and will continue to be the basic policy of the Government Party.  As one considers the various Departments and what has been achieved in the various fields this can clearly be seen to be the case.</P>
    <P>This annual debate here gives us opportunity for a wide-ranging discussion which does not arise in the same way in the other House, and I trust that in ranging fairly widely I will not take too long.  I certainly will not be in a position to be as precise as Senator <Col N="62" /> Garret FitzGerald on matters of budgetary policy and general principles of finance, but I hope that what I have to say may be of some relevance in the various fields.</P>
    <P>I take first the field of finance, one in which I do not express myself to be in any way competent as to financial policy or programmes.  One of the matters which has given rise to concern in recent times in Ireland is the conviction amongst large sections of the community, in fact at every level of the community, that everybody is paying too much income tax.  I do not mean that any individual thinks that the other fellow is paying too much.  The individual feels that he himself is contributing more than his fair share of tax.  Walk into any reasonable representative group, and every vocational group will be making a strong case for the other fellow sharing more of the burden he himself is now sharing.  This attitude is an unhealthy one in the community because it creates divisions where they should not exist.  I wonder if some other type of taxation might not merely yield the necessary finance but as well help to solve these divisions and to create a greater participation and responsibility throughout the community.  Last year in this debate I mentioned quite inappropriately our method of taxation, and now that I have an opportunity of being, for once in a while, in order and relevant, I should like again to say that I welcome any suggestion on our taxation system, and I welcome particularly anything or any proposals which would spread the burden over the community.</P>
    <P>There are obviously some inflationary tendencies in the TVA system which is applied in France and being considered here.  There are also, I suppose, certain elements of inflation involved in conventional budgetary policy in that when new increases are levied on certain items new wage demands may or may not arise, but what I would hope could be achieved by an extension of a system of indirect taxation which would be related to spending rather than to income is that those who have to spend at a certain level will pay according to what they spend. Those who have nothing to spend <Col N="63" /> cannot <i>ipso facto</i> pay&mdash;I mean, of course, above a certain necessary level.</P>
    <P>There are obvious inequities in the present system which may be inherent in the system of income tax we have at present.  One is that the wage and salary earner is immediately assessable for the actual full income he receives, and this of course means that having been given his due and just allowances under the present system he is then subject to the standard rate of income tax.  There are many others&mdash;and this must be obvious to all of us&mdash;who are relatively much better off and who have a much higher standard of living. Take the case of young girls starting in the Civil Service who may be earning something in the region of £8 a week and paying £4 10s 0d or £5 for digs, while there are many others in the community much better off than they are who can live at a much higher standard but nonetheless are not in any way subject to income tax.  Notable among these&mdash;I am referring generally &mdash;are people involved in the professions, people self-employed in their own right, and indeed the farming community above a certain level.  Surely here is a basic inequity which we should set ourselves towards resolving if we are going to have a situation where some people contribute more than their fair share, particularly having regard to the fact that others contribute far less.</P>
    <P>The solution is very much worth searching for, whatever problems may arise in the actual financial returns. Again from the economic point of view, indirect taxation would have to be&mdash;and this I would leave to the experts since it is not for people like me to make generalisations of this sort&mdash;selective in its application to a certain extent, applying at a higher rate at a higher level and at a lower rate at a lower level.  I think it would have the financial advantage of a built-in brake on spending.  If you are going to have indirect taxation there would be a built-in restraint and one could see that you could have a general pattern of the return over a reasonably foreseeable period.  One would not need, except in special circumstances, to change the cycle or the tempo of <Col N="64" /> taxation as may arise in a conventional budgetary policy.</P>
    <P>This is a matter that should activate the Minister for Finance and his Department, if it were given serious thought and active consideration.  I appreciate immediately that the first matter the Department must concern themselves with is the effort to continue the services being effected in the various arms of Government activity. This is a matter on which they will have to be satisfied before any change is implemented.  It would of course have the desirable end result of seeing the end of community divisions in a country where community divisions are now becoming a matter of concern and yet sharing equitably, in a true Christian fashion, the burden of community responsibility which all too many of us are little or not at all concerned about.  One of the characteristics of recent years in Ireland has been that of vocational interest as distinct from community responsibility.  Anything that will go in any way towards relieving that problem is worthwhile here.</P>
    <P>Before I pass, rather happily, shall I say, from the field of finance in which I do not find myself comfortable, I should like to say that it has been clear that what has been done in the recent Finance Bill and in the credit restrictions of late 1965 and early 1966, was done in anticipation of much that happened in other countries.  In late 1965 and early 1966, we were able to introduce, as we then knew it, the credit squeeze on the advice available to the Government.  As a result, that plan helped us to overcome difficulties in advance of other nations such as Italy and France and other European countries which very shortly afterwards had to take much more drastic steps than we took in advance.</P>
    <P>This type of awareness of the international monetary and trading situation is something which I think has been a characteristic of the Department of Finance and the Minister's advisers in that Department.  It is something, though it may not have been the immediate cause of the Finance Bill, that certainly is more than a coincidence in that it came in advance of <Col N="65" /> other more restrictive programmes introduced in France and in Great Britain.  A Deputy in the Dáil suggested after the mini-maxi Budget that we had no further need of our customs officers on the Border, that henceforth no customs officers would be required on the other side.  I did not hear of him coming back when the British restrictions were announced saying that, in fact, he wanted back the customs officers whom he relieved from their duty two weeks previously.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's job to anticipate all problems before they arise. This is accepted financial policy.  I am sure Senator Garret FitzGerald would endorse that.  Due credit must be given for this anticipation.  One would hope that even if we in future had to again come to some decisions negative criticisms, which sometimes greet proposals of this sort, would not compromise whatever Government may be in power and taking such steps.</P>
    <P>In relation to our general balance of payments, one of the things we have to promote widely in this country is that we all have responsibility, not those of us who sit here if only once a term, or those who sit in Government, or those engaged in the Civil Service.  The community has responsibility.  If any message becomes clear it is the message of the sharing of responsibility.</P>
    <P>It should not be necessary at all times that a buy-Irish campaign be promoted actively.  The people should be actively aware of the necessity for such a campaign.  I am afraid far too many of our select shops and select customers in this city and elsewhere are not in the slightest degree concerned about this problem.  They are concerned, in so far as there is selectivity involved, with choosing the foreign product and anything produced in Ireland is regarded as substandard.  It may be that we have a long way to go to catch up with the design of Italian shoes, but maybe already we have surpassed the quality of Italian shoes.  For those who would like that design and quality they should at least pull down 13, 14, or 15 boxes of Irish shoes from now on before they make their ultimate selection and pay twice or three times as much for the Italian shoes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="66" /> This operates in every sphere.  There are those who maintain that English readymades have the best cut available. This may or may not be true but surely our materials have the same or better standard than English materials. Otherwise, other people are coming here to buy a product that is inferior. The consumer at every level should become fully conscious of his responsibility. It is the halfpennies that make the pounds, and we should not just feel that this is a matter to be worked out by some gnome or expert in a remote office in a remote Department.</P>
    <P>We now come to what I may call the productive fields of activity in the nation.  I take, first of all, the one in which most people are engaged and that is agriculture.  I do not intend to delay long on this because there are others better equipped, and more directly involved, to comment on it than I.  There are some matters which have come to my notice as being matters of significant achievement or of some concern.  First of all, one must commend the wide range of development plans in every sphere.  I do not intend to list them here.  This is no place for commendation of the things which are available in the field of agricultural development.  Senators will be aware of the Land Project grants, the various grants administered in the Department of Agriculture for out-offices, water, and such things, as well as many others such as the heifer scheme, and so on.  I would encourage very much the extension into every sphere of activity in agriculture of this type of grant.  In order to increase the yield of productivity these were badly needed.  Perhaps I might make a precise reference.  I think on the few occasions we lift ourselves above the soil of our own land the first thing that strikes us is the absolute multiplicity of ditches and fences covering the whole country, bordering small farmers possibly but small fields particularly.</P>
    <P>These may have historic reasons but I think there is a higher proportion of Ireland in ditches and fences and banks than any other country.  I know there are grants available for the clearing and demolition of these ditches and making the land covered by them productive. <Col N="67" /> But, somehow or other, it has not had the desired effect, in the fullest sense in any event.  I would hope that the Department of Agriculture and the Minister's various advisers would extend the scheme of grants that apply in this particular sphere.  These grants could increase our productivity in agriculture maybe 10 per cent overnight, and not only that but they should promote as well the idea at local level and through the various farming bodies.</P>
    <P>Having mentioned the farming organisations, it would be appropriate for me to say that, as in any other sphere of activity, the success of any programme in agricultural matters depends largely on the involvement and participation of these bodies and the involvement and participation of the Government. Here I should like to draw a clear distinction between a fallacy which the farming organisations, or at least one of them, have adopted.  I will not say anything that would cause acrimony in a matter in which I am not involved but I refer to the comparison made by that body when they compared the Minister's participation in the National Agricultural Council with a member of the Federated Union of Employers sitting in on a trade union body.  They equated the Minister as an employer with the Chairman of the Federated Union of Employers <i>vis-á-vis</i> a trade union.  There is no such equation.  No Government Department or Minister is an employer of any section of the community except those State servants coming under their control.</P>
    <P>A Government's job is to create an environment to encourage those involved in a particular section of the economy.  If a Minister thought that he would be more actively aware of the problems of the farming community by taking a place on the National Agricultural Council I would have thought that such a step would have been welcomed by the members of that farming organisation.  There may be other factors involved in this but if there is to be an amended National Agricultural Council I would still think it very much in the interests of the agricultural community that the Department and the <Col N="68" /> Government, whose concern is the improvement of the standards of that community, should at least be represented on that Council.  If the farming organisation sees it in another way, and perhaps they do, I still suggest that it is in their interests.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent development in which the farming organisations seek to involve themselves in and control the processing and marketing of their own produce.  The recent attempt with regard to Cork Marts is the type of thing that should be encouraged and I hope it will be successful.  Those who sow the seed should reap the harvest. This is an example of the benefits accruing to those directly involved and such participation may augur well for further developments in this field.</P>
    <P>There are two brief points I should like to refer to in connection with the problems of small farmers.  One is the problem of rates and valuations.  Our valuations were affected in a different environment many years ago.  There were many instances where it was desirable to have a higher valuation because valuations affected and gave certain rights of franchise, or representation in the House of Lords, or perhaps an entitlement to titles.  Many people who have since come into possession of parts of these over-highly valued lands under the auspices of the Land Commission find themselves almost crippled by the valuation. There is in my own part of North Tipperary a significant discrepancy between valuations applying within a radius of five miles of each other.  In many instances one valuation is twice as high as another for the same type of land.  This causes certain dissatisfaction, constant problems and the type of obsession which people get and which is not necessarily a healthy thing. It would be much better if they could forget about their valuations and get on to doing something positive.  I know that the system is under review and the sooner recommendations for its improvement are implemented the better.  The present system is not relevant to present conditions and I hope that whatever new system will be introduced will be much more so.</P>
    <P>There are two final points in connection <Col N="69" /> with small farms.  One of the things that have always been encouraged, and the President in his time as Taoiseach encouraged it, is the provision of dower houses so that the young farmer getting married and having responsibilities of his own could give his best efforts to the development of his farm.  Unfortunately, where this has been done the valuation of the farm has been increased accordingly. Surely this is a case for some form of relief for social and long-term economic reasons.  I would like to have that matter dealt with.</P>
    <P>Finally, in the field of agriculture there is one matter which comes up constantly in rural Ireland.  In the provision of essential services to farmers in remote areas they are penalised to a certain extent by the fact that they live in these remote areas.  I am talking about essential services such as the ESB and, nowadays, the telephone service. We will have to consider well in both Houses and at Executive level whether these services in certain instances are essential services and whether the fact that a person lives in a remote area should be regarded as a necessary criteria.  It is past time when we should consider that a farmer living two miles from the ESB power line or from the main telephone line should have to pay more for these services than a person living in a town or beside the main lines.  This is something on which I have had constant representations and is something that merits the attention of the Departments involved.</P>
    <P>Next, in the order of the alphabet, one comes to the field of education and here I intend to be brief because what has been done here in the last few years is very significant.  What sometimes surprises me is that despite the significance of what has been done in rural Ireland particularly, it is what is left to be done that still causes more complaints than ever existed before anything was done.</P>
    <P>For instance, where no buses ran before, the constant recurring endeavour now where the bus does run is to bring it up the half mile or mile to the front door.  Many people have felt very strongly about this.  Where no free education was available before the problem now appears to be, again in <Col N="70" /> connection with transport, that the route of the bus is not particularly convenient and suitable.  These are all legitimate problems.  I feel that it is vitally important for us to become aware and to promote improvements in these spheres.</P>
    <P>The same applies at university level. It is not what has been done at university level but what others would say we should still do that is talked about.  Even unreasonable as their demands might be, they get most of the prominence.  The result has not been as dire as Senator FitzGerald said it would be before this House adjourned for the Summer Recess.  He said that the universities and the students were in a state of great unrest.  There have been significant rumblings but one must always realise, whether one is a student or a grown man or anybody else, that there is a limit to the application of any benefit&mdash;that there must be a starting point to the application of any benefit.  A starting point at least is much better than having no starting point at all.  If Governments are to be subject to criticism and pressure because they start them, there will not be any particular inducement to start any other programmes.</P>
    <P>I am referring particularly to the university grants system which is a great move in the field of education. I hope that those who press for an extension of it&mdash;I almost feel I am entitled to re-apply for it myself&mdash; should remind themselves of the fact that these benefits were not available last year and that they are available this year and will be available henceforth.</P>
    <P>Coming to the matter of university education, I would like to refer to this because I regard it as being a very important field of activity.  We have had many debates on education in this House and I do not think it warrants any further detailed comment.  A demand is developing in certain regions at present for universities.  I think those who would promote these demands would do well to consider fully first of all the essence of a university. Secondly, problems like the staffing of the university should be considered and, thirdly, one should consider the suitability of a particular <Col N="71" /> area for a university from the point of view of facilities and tradition and other matters of that sort.  It seems to me that recent indications are that far from not having enough universities, those we have are not always adequately staffed or possibly adequately financed.  We have had an indication from the students in the School of Architecture in UCD, through a weekend sit-in, that they consider their standards are not sufficiently high.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to comment very much on that, though from a brief look around the city at the recent buildings being erected one would certainly be led to the conclusion that the standards are not particularly high if one can judge by results.  One would like to see something a little more significant in design and attractive in structure than many of the buildings which may have certain virtues of architecture that I am not aware of, but to me they appear to be entirely funcitional and in 100 years time they will not add anything to the elegance of this city.  For that reason I would say in this sphere that these areas would do well to consider whether there is a demand and which needs for higher education are still not met.</P>
    <P>They would need to assess, particularly, the need in the field of technology, a field in which significant achievements have been made in the schools of technology in Bolton and Kevin Streets.  The needs should be assessed even more in the fields of business administration and marketing, though I have no criticism at all of the facilities available in any of the schools of commerce in Dublin, which are doing an admirable job with limited resources.</P>
    <P>If in one field more than another the Irish economy is handicapped at present it is in the field of marketing and salesmanship, at a time when we are diversifying and reaching into new markets and entering into new trading agreements with other countries.  The one significant handicap on much of our activities is the fact that we have not a sufficient reservoir of skilled sales personnel.  We have not a reservoir of sales personnel who are <i>au fait</i> with <Col N="72" /> the language of the countries with whom we hope to trade.  There is much that an interpreter can solve, but there is a limit to the effectiveness of an interpreter in the ordinary day-to-day negotiations in business.</P>
    <P>You can talk English to a Frenchman, if he wants to learn your English, or to a German or a Swiss, and he is quite happy to engage in English conversation for social purposes and to improve his English, but when you start to introduce an element of business he forgets he ever knew a word of your language.  This strikes me as being a big problem.  We are now faced with this big problem in relation to European countries and the European community, whether we become members of the EEC or not.  We have not enough Irishmen who have experience in living in, working in and speaking the languages of these countries to promote actively our products on their markets.  Until we have, we shall be at a disadvantage.  Here is a field which is not only open but crying out for development. When we look at the American scene with all these higher schools of sales, distribution and business techniques we can see the immense benefit this would confer on us.  I make a plea to those areas which may already be seeking after something which is possibly already exhausted, to turn their thoughts to something much more constructive and something which will achieve more.  These spheres of activity are of much greater benefit for the nation at large.</P>
    <P>Very briefly, I want to refer to the promotion of our goods in America. Here I certainly give all credit to Córas Tráchtála and the other organisations and promotional businesses concerned. One thing is very evident.  Though we may have reached the Waldorf Astoria in New York for major promotional banquets, we certainly have not reached the consumer throughout the United States.  There is something of a breakdown between the Waldorf Astoria and the Mid-West of Missouri and the Mid-West of Los Angeles.  I am thinking particularly of probably one of our potentially best products, that of Irish whiskey.  On a comparatively recent trip I never succeeded in getting Irish whiskey at it was known <Col N="73" /> to me but a brand more appropriately known in the North of Ireland which was always presented to me as Irish whiskey.  Surely, with the immense fund of goodwill available in the USA we should be making a more positive effort to reach that market.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the promoters, both in the industry concerned and indeed the State bodies concerned, that possibly a little less of the Waldorf Astoria banquets and a little more of the hard bargaining with the foreman behind each of the major supermarkets, bars or whoever it is who is dealing in personal terms of commission, will achieve much more in the display of our products on the counters and bars of the USA.  Until such time as we get down to the basic bargaining&mdash;this applies to every level of endeavour&mdash;the major promotional works will not yield the results they would otherwise achieve.  Other than that I do not think in that major field of Industry and Commerce I should delve any deeper, beyond saying that the recent deposit relief scheme, if we can call it such, was certainly done effectively.  It is one which is appreciated very much by those industries whose outlets would otherwise have been in great jeopardy.  I met one man who suggested that while his pocket would not have suffered, as Senator Murphy suggested, if we had been kicked, it was about time we kicked back.  There are other matters involved in this and I certainly am not going to engage in any kicking match at this stage.</P>
    <P>I now come to the matter with which the Minister who is in the House at present is more directly concerned, and that is the social Departments generally.  It is those Departments we should be particularly concerned with because, as I said at the outset, the business of a Government is to create an economic environment so that those who can well help themselves can thereby achieve the economic wellbeing of the nation and also, and more importantly in my view, make available to the Government, by their activities and endeavours, the necessary finance to achieve social justice and enlightenment in other spheres.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="74" /> I welcome particularly, though it is not all that important, the extension of the services in the Department of Social Welfare.  For some time, increases in pensions were the order of the day and those indeed were at all times significant, particularly under the present Government, but I was particularly happy to see that the new sphere of activity had gone beyond the mere financial increase and was also introducing services so far as pensioners and others are concerned. When one thinks of free electricity supply to pensioners, free travel vouchers and even free television licences, in some cases one can see that those things provide for those people, whose problems are so different from the rest of the community, essential comforts and facilities which make their old age in many cases, and loneliness in others, more tolerable than it would be otherwise.</P>
    <P>They are the type of things which a Department should extend as much as possible.  Mind you, I am sure an increase in pension will always be acceptable, but the services made available will immediately have a direct bearing on the environment and happiness of the recipients of those services. I am particularly happy to see that as from the 1st January next a new increase will be available.  This is part service and part increase to old age pensioners whose daughters are looking after them and have to look after them in certain circumstances. Here we are actually providing in the home what would otherwise have to be provided in an institution.  We should not allow ourselves ever to forget that the home is the basis of our society and for an old person to be in a position to stay in his or her own home in his or her old age, is a comfort which many of us at this time cannot appreciate.  The fact that now, after assistance, the daughters of such pensioners in many instances will be the means of an increase in pensions because of the maintenance costs involved, will introduce a lot of happiness and that is what we are concerned with.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister in this House at present to consider extending that not <Col N="75" /> just to those who have been in employment and who had to leave insurable employment and who had at least three years insurance contributions, if not in the first instance at a later stage, to those who may have been insured for only a certain period, and to some people who could not ever go into insurable employment because of the fact they had to remain at home to look after their parents.  Obviously this is a type of development which should follow sooner rather than later and I am quite confident that with the enlightened outlook of the Minister and the Department of Social Welfare, one can expect further development in this sphere.</P>
    <P>For once I should like to refer to a particular sphere where I think finance is being provided where it is not entirely necessary.  That is the sphere of children's allowances.  When you consider the number of widows, for instance, who are subjected to a means test, when you find the number of them who are almost obliged to live on a meagre living because if they undertake any extra work&mdash;I am speaking particularly of widows&mdash;they may disqualify themselves for further pension, and you consider that children's allowances are given to people with a certain income, immediately one realises there must be food for thought.  Let us be quite honest: those widows suffer very great hardship.</P>
    <P>I am sure all Members of this House will agree with me when I suggest that a means test should be adopted, even arbitrarily, in respect of anybody earning £1,500 or more.  This would automatically exclude every Member of this House.  I do not think that would do any injustice to any part of our society.  It can, of course, be graded, as for example university grants were in the sphere of education, according to the number of children, and you could have a sliding application of children's allowances.  I stand convinced that if anybody earning in excess of that figure is in need of children's allowances, then he is spending in excess of his needs.</P>
    <P>I should like to see whatever little might be saved by my proposal being <Col N="76" /> channelled to a direction in which it will, no matter what is done, always be needed.  I do not want to be taken as criticising what has been done, but everybody concerned in the field of social welfare will be concerned not with what has been done but with what more can be done.  I would hope that maybe sometimes the widows particularly will benefit a little from the fact that Senators and Deputies and people like them and many others throughout the country are no longer claiming children's allowances.</P>
    <P>To come to another sphere of activity, at least from the point of consideration mostly associated with social welfare&mdash;that is the sphere of activity in the Department of Defence dealing with Old IRA special allowances&mdash;if ever there was a group of men to whom we owed entire gratitude and recognition it is these diminishing numbers of Old IRA pensioners.  We should be searching for ways, as long as they are with us, to show them as fully as possible the appreciation and recognition we have of what they have achieved and we now enjoy.  Again I am happy to say that there have been significant increases in recent times in that particular sphere of activity. Generosity in many ways when concerned with subjects so deserving as they are should, if possible, know no bounds.</P>
    <P>While I have always found the Minister and the Department of Defence very fair and liberal in their interpretation and application of benefits by way of special allowances to Old IRA veterans, I would say that we should not, as we do at present where they are in receipt of an old age pension calculate that in assessing the amount of the special allowances to which they are entitled.  Unless they have other sources of income one could fairly exclude the old age pension.  Many of them feel somewhat that their services are not fully recognised, and there is a responsibility and a duty on us, and one that we should be happy to accept, to see that while they are still with us&mdash;and it must be limited&mdash;their old age is cushioned with the comforts that their earlier endeavours in their youth certainly deserved.  Here again I would <Col N="77" /> like to say that all of them appreciate what has been done though many of them would like that more could be done, and I would join with them in their pleas.</P>
    <P>In the field of health as in the field of social welfare there are great new signs of a participation between the Department and the Minister for Health and the voluntary bodies concerned in the relief of particular chronic problems such as those of handicapped and disabled children of various types.  This work in co-ordination with voluntary bodies is one of the healthiest signs we have at present in the country's development&mdash;healthy for two reasons, because it shows that the community themselves are fully aware of their responsibility in this sphere and are not waiting, as some would sometimes do, for the Government to dole out assistance for problems of this kind, and healthy also because the Government, and the Department of Health particularly, have shown themselves ready to act in conjunction with each other and to have an active liaison between each other in the relief of so many of these real problems.</P>
    <P>The number of mentally handicapped children around the country that one becomes aware of is very significant by comparison with the numbers one would have been aware of 15 years ago probably, because in those days in the era of less enlightenment people hid a problem of this kind whereas nowadays in an era of more enlightenment people are prepared not only not to hide but in fact to come out in the open with their problems and look for others and prepare to solve their problems with them. Nonetheless there are many homes paying extraordinarily high medical expenses towards maintaining at home in the first instance and in institutions in other instances mentally handicapped children.  Many voluntary societies have great activity in this sphere.  I would like to make a special plea to the Minister for Health for an allowance for the parents of mentally handicapped children whether they are being maintained at expense in institutions or they are being maintained <Col N="78" /> at some discomfort and indeed expense at home.</P>
    <P>Again in the sphere of health one can welcome the co-ordination between the Department and the voluntary bodies engaged in the care of the old. The new scheme announced some time back by the Minister for Health in conjunction with the local authorities which he hoped would be effected with the least formality possible, the scheme whereby voluntary bodies looking after the old were given certain financial assistance in effecting the services they were making available&mdash;this scheme is a perfect example of the type of co-ordination we need to maintain and extend.  It is a happy thing to see a Government Department that is not just waiting for a standard channel or a conventional line of assistance through a State agency.  It is a very significant thing that the Department and the Minister are prepared to give assistance directly to voluntary bodies, because most of these voluntary bodies provide services for the old in their homes and in doing so relieve the State of what would otherwise be an impossible burden to carry.  By this scheme you serve the practical purpose of relieving the problems of the old person and you also thereby save the State significant financial expenditure.</P>
    <P>Lastly in the field of health I welcome particularly the announcement which I trust we will see implemented before too long of the scheme whereby the present system of dispensary treatment and medical cards will be eventually abolished.  I know of few other matters of more concern at that level of the community than the medical card, and enmity which arises from it and the problems it causes, and social divisions in the community which it appears to identify, are things that we would be well rid of as soon as possible. I would hope that the medical profession and those who will be essentially concerned in implementing any new health scheme will see as soon as possible that the people who are basically concerned, and those are the patients, particularly the poor patients who cannot provide these services for themselves, will endeavour to achieve with the Minister for Health a new <Col N="79" /> system of medical treatment for the nation which will replace this old system, and the sooner they can do so the better.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation of the hospital service, as proposed in a recent recommendation, is something that could be left to a later date but I think all goes well for a new era of enlightened and specialised medical treatment.  Perhaps I might come to the field in which we were eliminated in the semi-finals, shall I say, of the best administered country in the world.  That is the field of labour relations.  We have many examples in this country of enlightened areas of labour relations.  We have enlightened industrial relations for a long number of years.  We have, particularly, and I think it is because it is a new creature to a certain extent, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company who have reached enlightened industrial and personnel relations that can be a guideline for any other State body and indeed for all industries throughout the country.  This is based almost entirely on delegation of responsibility, from the chairman right down the line.  With that delegation of responsibility follows automatically a clearing of responsibility, a sense of pride and achievement and indeed a sense of determination in fulfilling one's own particular job.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has any experience of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and their employees and various executives will see immediately a readiness to meet challenges as they arise, a readiness to break out of the heavy containing shell which sometimes exists in other spheres of industrial activity.  Perhaps I might quote an example.  When the now famous medieval tours were being promoted in the first instance one of the problems the company found themselves faced with was the basic problem of not having a sufficient number of people with actual experience, or any type of such experience for that matter.  It is a great thing to know that many of the top executives in Shannon Airport in those early months voluntarily undertook the roles of ancient bards and table servants at night at those banquets, after their work, thereby giving <Col N="80" /> an example to subordinates that where a job had to be done anybody, or any leader, had a responsibility to do it.</P>
    <P>Frequent communications from management, down to the shop floor, and consultations are an example that cannot too often be expressed and certainly not often enough followed. If an organisation as extensive as that company can succeed in implementing fundamentally sound social policies, and this includes as well the implementation of principles of industrial democracy, one wonders why many smaller industries with less complex problems cannot do the same thing in their spheres.</P>
    <P>Here I should like to refer in passing to the interim report on industrial relations in the ESB.  Much of what was recommended as being desirable in that report in fact is being, and has been, implemented for some time in the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  We must be concerned here with the fact that recurring labour disputes occur more often in our semi-State bodies, or at least in some of them, very clearly identifying themselves in a particular sphere of industrial activity.  We should look to the root cause.  What the Fogarty Report did was to search out and find many of the root causes of industrial unrest in the ESB.  We should like to see something similar done in CIE and in any other State body that has more than its share of industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some of the recommendations of the committee on industrial relations in the ESB.  One was that full-time members of the board should exert personal leadership by being widely known by and involved with their staff.  This is so basic that one wonders why it needs to be said but, unfortunately, it is not at all fully implemented.  It should be widely known who their staff are.  The recommendations also state that you would have part-time members of the board.  This is very significant.  This would involve one group representing the community as at present, the owners and the consumers, the community being the owners of the national resources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> More properly, they state that there should be two representatives of the employees of the ESB.  This type of suggestion is something that deserves very careful consideration and, indeed, deserves implementation as soon as possible.  We will have to start thinking in terms of, say, Senator Murphy's people, and I accept what he said entirely.  They will not feel that other sectors of the community have all the perks while they have all the burdens. We will have to launch on a programme which will give a return in the investment to the workers, not just in terms of wages but in terms of the sharing of responsibility&mdash;indeed, as exemplified in this report, a certain sharing of ownership.  This is the type of proposal&mdash;which is qualified obviously, and it must be&mdash;which will heal some of the divisions that are all too obvious in the community.  It has been done in Shannon Airport and these people on the board are people who have come right from the floor in many instances.  Maybe they have not come right from the floor but from the circles of lower management.</P>
    <P>This can help in the channels of communication that exist.  This was suggested in the ESB and it could equally be suggested to many of the semi-State bodies, particularly those who have problems with personnel.  The report also states that you would have an executive board who would be responsible for management for the full-time members of the board and who would have a supervisory board who would comprise the part-time members. Their job would be to represent the community and the employees who would inquire into and check on the work of the executive board and, particularly, approve all major changes of policy.</P>
    <P>If I bore the House with this question of involvement, I think these proposals alone would go a long way towards achieving this type of involvement and the healing of divisions that are all too evident in the community.  The report also had something to say in connection with the union structure within the ESB and this is a matter which the trade unions must obviously have well considered.  The report states that <Col N="82" /> this must be the first principle as far as union representation is concerned&mdash; that it would be desirable to have one representative union for each category of ESB employees for negotiation purposes, one and one only.  It went further and stated that four groups of unions for negotiation purposes should be sufficient for the whole staff.  This has immediate and obvious advantage and while there may be&mdash;though I fail to see it&mdash;some advantage in one union over another which can provide the same negotiation and services, certainly from the point of view of the health of the industry as a whole, it is important to rationalise as suggested in this report. There is also a recommendation on full-time officers for negotiating, organising and training in the work and&mdash;this is something the unions would be concerned with&mdash;specialist services in job evaluation, education and training.</P>
    <P>All these ideas are far removed from what now appears to the public to be the first concern of trade unions and that is the hard fact of table negotiations. Table negotiations are only the last stage.  All these proposals and activities are the proper responsibilities of the unions and the others need not follow if these are implemented.</P>
    <P>Finally they suggest, in the light of what has gone before, that there should be strict adherence to agreed procedures. This would be entirely in line with the policies implemented in European countries generally.  They conduct, at an early stage each year, negotiations between the major unions and the industrial employers and they enter into agreed procedures and fixed target prices or incomes.  This is the general pattern of the European community policy which is related more to targets than our present programme.  When these targets have been fixed they are binding, certainly in principle if not in law, and the sooner we enter into that type of preliminary agreement in relation to each major industry the sooner we will solve many of our recurrent crises in the field of our industrial relations.</P>
    <P>I now come to the Department of Local Government.  As our economy develops one of the matters to which <Col N="83" /> we must give foremost attention is our road development programme.  Historians will tell us that right back to the Romans and up to the present time of the Americans, the Germans and the Italians, if you want a thriving economy you must have a good road system. Our main roads are already showing signs of breaking under the weight of their present transport burden.  I was very glad to see that a proposal I made here last year for the introduction of a regional road board system is being implemented but could I make this suggestion to the Department concerned, that they do not wait until the road construction programme in a particular area is under way before they acquire the rights-of-way which are necessary?</P>
    <P>Many countries have wasted millions of pounds in waiting until the job had begun before acquiring the necessary rights-of-way.  In America they have wasted money in acquiring factories which they do not want and which have to be demolished, houses which they do not want and which have to be demolished in order to get their road programme going.  When the Regional Planning Boards are set up they should at once undertake a programme of acquisition of the rights-of-way which they consider necessary to achieve their objective.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of air pollution and possibly of water pollution. On morning after morning driving into this city I see clouds of black filth being poured forth from many industrial chimneys.  I see a grey cloud descending over Dublin and I also see clouds of the same type of pollution coming from our various transport vehicles.  We have regulations but are we going to wait in this country until we have spoiled the purity for which we are envied by so many people?  Now is the time to rid ourselves of these pollution problems.</P>
    <P>I have noticed that most of this exhaust smoke comes from the vehicles of a certain road construction company which is more guilty in this respect than any others I know of.  This would not be allowed by any other society than ours.  We have not got a reputation <Col N="84" /> for hygiene but, without any thanks to ourselves, we have got a reputation for clear and pure air and the price which other nations would pay for this is something that we should not cast aside.</P>
    <P>The sooner we enter on a designed programme to rid ourselves of air and water pollution the better.  In many of the highly industrialised countries of northern Europe water pollution is so intense that they have to inport water from the Swiss lakes.  I remember the secretary of an international body telling me on one occasion it is not inconceivable that we might some time be exporting what we now consider our greatest national problem but what might become our greatest national asset, that is our water.  Senator McQuillan might be happy then that the Suck has not been drained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us may not be satisfied but eminent objective observers have placed us third in the level of prosperity and growth in Europe.  That is satisfying but we in this Party will always try to achieve more.  I would now like to refer to the Department of Justice and the responsibilities involved in the various sections of that Department.  Far too many people appear to have forgotten that our courts are an essential arm of our Constitution.  We have the legislature making the laws, we have the Government implementing the laws and we have the courts interpreting the laws and seeing that they are obeyed. There have been a lot of airy fairy comments in recent times, particularly in the other House, about the manner in which justice is administered.  From my experience of the courts, not necessarily very lengthy, about nine years, I have never known any justice or judge to be influenced by any representations made to them.  Despite that, there are suggestions that this type of thing happens in favour of certain members or supporters of a certain political Party.  A political Party can take this and must take it.  It is part of the business of politics that you must face up to these things and ignore them <Col N="85" /> but if we start to undermine the institutions that are the defences of our democracy we will pull down the whole structure around our ears.</P>
      <P>Another example is the unfortunate incidents that arose in connection with various parades and farm disputes.  It was suggested that the penalties imposed were being imposed vindictively. Various things were suggested.  The fault may lie here for having introduced the legislation. The courts were being asked to interpret legislation and to put it into effect but the fault did not lie with the courts and judges.  I prefer to refer to them as doing the duty which was imposed on them in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I should like to think that we in this House must realise that the courts are for our protection and if those engaged happen to benefit by certain litigation of one sort or another, that is not the major consideration.  I would offer this as a matter of thought for the present Government: we have gone far enough in taking certain matters, that were formerly for consideration by the courts, out of their jurisdiction and giving them to various bureaucratic bodies.  The greatest protection the citizen has is the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that anything done on this side of the House will ensure that that will continue to be so.  If there are complaints in relation to the courts they should be related to facilities and procedure.  If the citizen is not getting the necessary facilities from the courts this is a just complaint.  I hope that the proposed Bill recommended by a Commission on this matter will be introduced shortly so that the facilities and the defence of rights, which are available only in our courts, will be available throughout the country in a way which they are not at present.  I welcome the proposal to increase the scope of the district courts and the circuit courts.  I welcome it for many reasons but basically it is making available to the citizen the rights to which he is entitled.  It will be a great saving of expense which will follow from having the facilities available throughout the country thereby ensuring that expert witnesses will not <Col N="86" /> have to spend two or three nights in Dublin increasing the costs of litigation, which are already severe enough.</P>
    <P>One matter in the sphere of criminology, or penology particularly, which must engage the concern of all of us&mdash; I say this in the light of my introductory remarks&mdash;is that we have one of the lowest rates of prison population in the world and certainly one which is greatly envied by many nations, and our job is to keep it so.  We all appreciate and commend the great work being done by the probation officers in the Dublin area.  We have not enough of them.  We realise that and admit it. Their problem is so big and their area so large that we need many more officers to achieve effectively their first purpose which is the prevention of crime and the investigation of the environment that creates crime.  We may have a lower crime rate but it is higher in the cities than in the country. Anything that can be done to promote further improvement in that direction is desirable.</P>
    <P>The garda, and the probation officer particularly, have proved in recent times that they deserve well of the community.  They must be the envy of many of our neighbours, particularly those in Northern Ireland, in the conduct of crowd situations and other difficult situations.  Recently I watched the Young Socialists parading through Dublin and I was happy to note that not only were the gardaí parading with them but they were engaged in chat with them as they paraded.  This type of human association with the demonstrators is the type of enlightened approach for which our gardaí, partinoted and I commend them for it.  It is possible to think that gardaí, particularly in crowd situations, are always good for a joke or a butt, in places like Dalymount Park.  People should realise that they are endangering themselves, and maybe they do not wish to do so, if they make the job of the gardaí more difficult than it is.  We can all feel proud of the conduct of the gardaí outside the British Embassy. One hopes that with the expansion of demonstrations the gardaí will be able to conduct them in that particular manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="87" /> Finally, I have some general comments here which I will endeavour to conclude as briefly as possible. Having ranged at some length, though not in detail, over the general sphere of Government activity, I should like to say once again that the Fianna Fáil Government committed to economic development are committed to a policy of social justice and social enlightenment. This is based on what is enshrined in our Constitution, on the principles of Christianity and community responsibility.</P>
    <P>If I have bored anybody with the question of participation and responsibility I have no apology to make.  This is the great message all of us need to learn at present.  We are basically a happy and well-ordered society and the envy of many, and we are founded on Christian principles.  There are those who are apparently concerned with essential freedoms and they regard absolute freedom as freedom of speech and freedom of association.  They see these things as absolute but they are in no way qualified to speak for the community good.  I do not wish to take issue on this.  If hundreds of thousands of people wish to parade through Dublin and if they think that is the way their society should be conducted, that is their view.  All a Government can do is continue to do their best in the interests of the nation. Could I remind them and anybody who would think that if a Government act against unruly demonstrators they are accused of dictatorship&mdash;the Opposition have done that&mdash;of the Nazi policy in Germany in the early 1930's when Goering or Goebbels was the Minister for Propaganda.  When he was addressing the Nazi Party at Nuremberg he said: &ldquo;Let us control the streets.  Get our people on the streets. When we get control of the streets we can ignore the ballot boxes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This more than anything else, this control of the streets, is what leads to dictatorships as it did to the most oppressive dictatorship we have known in recent times.  Despite that, many people would say when action is taken with regard to the control of the streets that we are introducing dictatorship. <Col N="88" /> The Government have a responsibility given to them by the community.  No section should take control of the streets.  If people have a just cause, such as matters of civil rights which go across the whole spectrum of human activity but in the interests of the particular section of the community, no Government can be accused of dictatorship when in fact what they do is the very opposite&mdash;to ensure that the ultimate decision will rest with the people and that this can only be expressed by the elected representatives of the people and not through any crowds or otherwise under any particular leader on any street.</P>
    <P>I also say to those who are concerned&mdash;they are among our younger people, some of whom are in Dublin at the present time&mdash;with promoting dogmas and plans of what they would regard as social reforms, which were formed in other times and on the anvils of other nations: let them think well before they would deprive this nation of the very liberty they shout about, before they find themselves in the position that possibly Czechoslovakia and Hungary found themselves in.</P>
    <P>Let those people realise that while they are impatient we are also impatient, but let them consider and think well whether in the societies which they hope to introduce here could they enjoy the same measure of freedom as they are enjoying in this country.</P>

      <P>I would offer to them, as I would offer to any section of the community, the proper, effective means, through the right channels, but I would advise them, in their own interests and in the community's interests, against the procedure of street protesting, because if they accept that a particular man in charge of 5,000 or 10,000 people is going to be in power on a particular day, they are accepting something which is contrary to the very basic principles of democracy.  I do not intend in this to reactivate problems which arose and spread this problem across the whole community. <Col N="89" /> If we have problems to solve and cases to raise, let us raise them in the proper channels but not through street protests which have now become so fashionable.</P>

      <P>They are, the same as anyone else is.  This is a matter for the economy to decide. There are many principles of other nations whose political doctrines we cannot a present accept, because in my view they are entirely against the fundamental liberties which are the birthright of every Irishman and of every free man; but many of their principles can be adopted.</P>
      <P>There are principles we can look towards implementing so that we can have happier community relations.  I should like to refer to one of the great problems in public activity which has been commonly referred to.  It is the overstressing of the personalities of the people involved in either Government or Parliamentary activity to the detriment of the office.  I feel that this is something which is a cause of some concern.  The office is the basic bulwark of the nation and if people hit too much at the bricks of office they will pull down the whole house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been a lot of innuendoes in the Lower House with regard to certain alleged activities of certain Ministers or otherwise.  This type of negative slant is one of the greatest disservices they can do to this nation. The sooner the people who engage in <Col N="90" /> this realise they are doing a great disservice to the nation, not just to the Fianna Fáil Party because they are strong enough and resilient enough to survive that kind of empty hysteria, the better.  Those people hope that sometime in the future they will hold office, but I want to say to them the sooner they leave off those general allegations of improper conduct and all this kind of thing the better.</P>
    <P>I hope particularly that press commentators and television commentators, while they are fulfilling a great function and a very necessary one, will learn, because there is rather too much of this nowadays, certainly more than in previous times, that it is not whether a man walks in a certain fashion or wears his hat in a certain direction we should be concerned with but the business he has and the way he goes about doing it.  I feel some members of the press are promoting and presenting a certain side to the public of certain people involved in political activity and they are doing a great disservice.  What we must secure finally and strive for in every level of activity is increased participation and increased involvement at every level.</P>
    <P>We have at present some of the strains of a developing nation in which economic progress has been significant. We have had some of the distresses which arise but we have a well ordered society.  I say to all Senators, and particularly to many Opposition Members in the Lower House, that if they think their function is to pull down the very office and the people engaged in that office, then the sooner the Irish political scene is rid of them the better because the office will continue long after the man has gone. Our Government have set their programme firmly against divisions in the community.  Anything I have said at length this evening is set in this same direction and I hope that those who say there are divisions within this Party and the community will look at what has been achieved and I am sure will continue to be achieved.</P>

      <P>I was racking my brains for a while, if I could describe them as such, to see what Senator <Col N="91" /> O'Kennedy had left out in his little sermon or homily, and the only thing I can think of is the pill.</P>

      <P>Perhaps he will give us his views on that at a later stage.  The Taoiseach, in his capacity here as Acting Minister for Finance, graced this House for a few minutes this afternoon on the occasion of the first sitting of the Seanad for months. I should like first of all to say that though the Taoiseach is very welcome I much regret the unfortunate illness of the Minister for Finance himself. I personally wish him full recovery and a return to his activities as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>That does not take away from the fact that this House is treated with the utmost contempt as far as the Government are concerned.  One would have thought that on this first sitting we would have had some indication from the Taoiseach as to the Government's second thoughts on this mini-Budget and the methods by which the taxation is being raised.  We had a casual visit from him and he departed and left the House to its own ends.  These comments of mine are not meant as criticism of the Deputy who has taken his place, namely the Minister for Social Welfare, whom I would like to welcome, but I feel that there is a distinct air of unreality about the proceedings. While it is the duty of each individual Senator to express his views, I feel that less and less heed is being taken of the views and outlooks declared in this House that would give an opportunity to the Government, as part of their spring-cleaning and their new policy, to think deeply on the future of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have two items under discussion&mdash;the Finance Bill, and in the course of discussing that we have taken liberties with the Appropriation Bill the terms of which are being discussed here today as well.  That gives an opportunity to widen the scope of the debate, and I propose to deal in particular with one aspect of Government services, namely the penal impositions <Col N="92" /> on the public through the post office charges.</P>
    <P>Before I come to that, I should like to take up the Taoiseach on his remarks that he would like some suggestions as to how the Government could avoid this savage Budget and as to future activities that might ease the burden on the community.  We are told that the major causes of the Budget levies are two&mdash;agriculture and the increases in salaries for public servants. As far as agriculture is concerned the two main items in this are wheat and milk.  I will not delay at all on this, but most Members of this House would agree with me that it is not now or next week that the Government should have prepared their wheat policy.  For years in the other House some of us advocated the necessity for a wheat policy and the growing of wheat under a contract system on the same lines as the Sugar Company conduct their contract campaign for the growing of beet.  I do not favour, and never have favoured, handing over the implementation of this contract system to the millers. We know that they have sought the running of this system themselves. Instead of handing over the contract system to the millers, the Government should step in, declare their wheat policy and take over the milling industry. If they do not the community at large will be saddled with this burden whenever God is good enough to give us fine weather.  There is no question about it that there are various alternative crops which would be a greater benefit to the community than this surplus production, which does not favour the majority of the farming community at all.  It is beyond denial that over 40 per cent of the subsidy available in this grant for wheat goes to less than 5,000 farmers out of a total of some 200,000 and the remainder goes to the millers.  To achieve that subsidy the small farmer and the community at large is now being taxed&mdash;the very people who could best afford to be taxed and should be taxed are being subsidised at the expense of the small man who is being cleared out.</P>
    <P>The milk problem is much more difficult.  It is one about which I would hesitate very much to offer concrete <Col N="93" /> suggestions because I am not familiar with it to the extent that other Members of the House are.  But we would all admit that there is quite a vested interest involved.  It is terribly difficult to get a movement in certain areas which would in turn help to solve this problem of the milk surplus.  A minor point that I would hand over to whoever is responsible for looking after this particular surplus is that I believe we could double the consumption of liquid milk in this country tomorrow morning if a proper campaign was conducted and milk itself was made an attractive drink.  In my limited experiience outside this country I have seen milk being sold in the form of an iced drink with various flavours&mdash; raspberry, strawberry and vanilla and so on.  The milk itself was sold in tremendous quantities in milk bars in many European countries.  Why such an idea is not taken up in this country is something that I do not know, but the limited information available to me on inquiry is that when such an idea was put forward before it met with strong opposition from certain people. I do not know how true that is, but I feel that we could double the consumption of liquid milk within the country, and that would be a far better proposition than to export milk on which you would have to pay subsidies.</P>
    <P>We have had a lot of talk from the Taoiseach and others about hindsight and people being wise now after the events.  But this so-called mini-Budget is such that people are entitled to wonder how did it come so suddenly. Why was it so severe?  What kind of forecasting was available to the Government that apparently this crushing load had to be accepted so suddenly and so soon after the former Budget? That is something that has not been satisfactorily answered.</P>
    <P>Added to that we have this second blow brought about by the action of the British Government in restricting imports.  What strikes me as rather peculiar here is that every time that the British Government find themselves in trouble, according to our people, our Government here, they proceed to welsh on the agreements and to <Col N="94" /> break their treaty arrangements with Ireland.  As somebody said to me, this seems to go back to the Treaty of Limerick.</P>
    <P>Every time we make an agreement with Britain those who make it arrive back here and boast each time, whether it is inter-Party or Fianna Fáil, about the wonderful trade agreement that they have made and how they put one across on our neighbours and had the best of it.  Perhaps, then, within six or 12 months we find that we have not the best of it.  Then we all say that the British broke the agreement.  That is the only answer we have.  The latest we have now from the Taoiseach is that he sees chinks now in the most recent agreement.  I think that we should not immediately assume that because things do not go our way the other group who made a bargain with us are breaking a particular agreement.</P>
    <P>It is no use at this stage in chambers of commerce, or industrialists, or trade unionists, or any other group saying to the Government: &ldquo;Look, let us not accept this; let us take punitive measures&rdquo;.  What measures can we take in so far as our imports and exports are concerned?  If we take measures, if we impose restrictions, who will be affected?  Will it be Britain or this country?  If we say we will not send our exports to Britain, we have no alternative markets available.  If we say we will not export to X, Y or Z, whom are we hurting? Can we say our goods will go to any part of Europe?</P>
    <P>Let us be frank about it.  We have no bargaining power in that regard and that is because our policy has been slow down the years.  I am not saying that Britain is not a great market. It is.  It is conveniently placed, geographically.  It is an island and we have a lot in common with the British. We have close connections and close trading relations with them, but that should still leave us sufficient freedom to go anywhere we like to try to get additional markets.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála are limited in their efforts.  There is a restraint on the activities of Córas Tráchtála and other trade groups from exporting to Eastern <Col N="95" /> countries.  Why is it that we are not prepared in 1968 to go to the Eastern countries and say that we are prepared to do a deal with them the same as any other community?  Why can we not explore these markets?</P>
    <P>At the present time we are doing a certain amount of trade under the counter with Eastern countries.  We pretend it does not exist.  We are trying to say that the Government have no hand in it, that they cannot be held responsible for private importers or exporters who do a certain amount of trade.  In these Eastern countries trade is not carried out on a basis of firm to firm between particular countries. They have export boards which are under the control of the respective Governments.  We will have to send accredited trade missions with full diplomatic rights to these countries. When I hear Members of the Opposition say&mdash;and I am not blaming the Government&mdash;that the Government should diversify, it makes me think of Dáil debates and of Seanad debates I have heard.  I have not heard one Senator say that we should diversify.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I read my own and it was enough.  I am inclined to take the view that if the Government do not declare tomorrow morning that they are prepared to recognise Eastern countries for trade purposes, certain opposition groups will try to exploit this trade for ulterior motives.  The people of this country have grown up sufficiently to forget about this Red bogey, or whatever it is.  If we want to diversify we will have to go to those countries as well as to the Fiji Islands. There are people who argue that the EEC will give a solution to our problem.  Far from it.  I do not want to repeat what I said years ago.  No matter what scope we are given in legislation in the EEC tomorrow morning we will not get our goods into the EEC because what we have for export is already available in greater quantity in these countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> An act of welcome into the EEC means nothing.  If the granary is full of goods what we have to offer will not get into it.  No European country will reduce its quota for the sake of allowing us in.  There is a surplus in EEC countries of all agricultural produce, possibly with the exception of beef.  Why then all this talk about our getting into the EEC and that it is the way out of our difficulties?  I do not want to pursue the matter further because I want to get down to the particular item which I should like to discuss in this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in his capacity as Acting Minister for Finance, is responsible for the taxation which is being imposed in this Supplementary Budget.  It takes two forms, general taxation, which is the normal way of handling taxation, and the second prong of taxation is carried in the charges imposed on the users of the Post Office.  I want to make it clear that in this respect it is the Minister for Finance who is the responsible authority for the budgetary proposals which affect the Post Office.  It is not the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. He in fact, let it be clearly understood, is a mere puppet to adjust the strings pulled by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>When the Budget proposals were being announced the Taoiseach had this to say:</P>
      <P>Details of the revised charges, which will be brought into operation on 1st January next, will be announced by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I shall refer here only to the principal changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words the Taoiseach in his capacity as Acting Minister for Finance is responsible for the impositions and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs <Col N="97" /> was given the boy's job of the telling the public at a later date.  The Taoiseach went on to say:</P>
    <P>This year's Christmas shopping, posting and telephoning will not be affected by the increases proposed in the wholesale tax and post office charges.  Because the greater part of the financial year is already gone and these particular proposals come into effect only on 1st January, the extra revenue accruing to the Exchequer by 31st March from all the changes proposed is not expected to exceed £4.2 million.</P>
    <P>The emphasis I lay is on the extra revenue accruing to the Exchequer.  In other words, the Post Office is being used as a flogging horse to bring in money to the Exchequer.  It is not the Post Office that is making the money. The Department of Finance, as the controlling influence, are utilising the Post Office to bring in further money.</P>
    <P>I read the Dáil debates on this matter and I was amazed that major taxation of this nature, which has affected what is one of the most important Departments of State, received such scant attention in the Lower House.  The Post Office deals with banking and it is an agent for major Government concerns such as social welfare and others.  Yet, when it came to new impositions on the Post Office, I suppose less than one full column in the entire day's debate in the Dáil was devoted to the significance of this form of taxation.</P>
    <P>Deputies and others appeared in the public press and elsewhere dealing with the increased charges on beer, cigarettes and so forth but they all failed to deal with the increased Post Office charges.  I do not pose as an expert on Post Office affairs but in the last 18 months I have made it my business to learn as much as I could about them and what I learned made me feel disturbed at the fact that the main Opposition Parties showed themselves to be so lacking in knowledge of what was taking place.  I would have thought that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which states that it has at its disposal research officers and experts in financial matters, would have made available to their spokesmen <Col N="98" /> in the other House the necessary data which would bring home to the public how the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are being misrun, mismanaged, misused and exploited.</P>
    <P>I do not feel that I am capable of doing this job properly because many people more skilled than I am in making an analysis of the situation have been befogged by the statistics produced.  In that respect I would recall to the Members of the House that Deputy Childrens&mdash;I presume he is Minister for Posts and Telegraphs although he sometimes says that Deputy Lalor is&mdash;carried out the Taoiseach's advice and held a press conference a few days after the Budget statement. The Minister produced statistics and graphs and justified as far as he was concerned the increased charges.  He made such a good job of the case that the <i>Irish Times</i>, a paper noted for its intelligent approach and analysis of Ministerial statements, praised the Minister the following day.  I searched the other papers and there was no analysis or attempt to break down or dispute any of the figures given by the Minister so he got away with his press conference.  If the newspapers, which employ experts in these matters, are not able to bring out the facts how is the general public going to know what is happening?  If the major political Parties, with the research facilities at their disposal and the new funds made available to them for research, are not aware of what is happening how can we expect anything else than a mismanaged State concern as far as the Post Office is concerned.</P>
    <P>I want to refute the accuracy of the statements made by Deputy Childers in his capacity as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and I challenge him to deny the charges I propose to make in this House.  He is reported as saying at his press conference on 2nd November that he challenged as dishonest propaganda statements that the Post Office which accounts for half of the people in the Civil Service, is bearing the entire cost of the Civil Service.  He said that this was untrue and was a scandalous statement to make and added that there was no cross subsidisation in the Civil Service.  He said that the plain <Col N="99" /> fact is that there is no cross subsidisation in the Civil Service.  I have stated outside the House that cross subsidisation does take place and the Minister has described this as dishonest.  I now want to make available the evidence of the cross subsidisation that does take place.</P>
    <P>Incidentally that statement at the press conference should have been made by an official of the Department of Finance because all funds coming into the Post Office are handed over to the Department of Finance and the Post Office officials have not a clue as to what happens to them afterwards. All the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was doing on that occasion was acting as a mounthpiece for the Department of Finance.  The Post Office is responsible for the savings services which are handled by the Post Office on behalf of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate for the year 1967/68 the Post Office estimates the receipts from the sale of saving certificates and stamps and other such matters at £74.2 million.  For its work as agent of the Department of Finance and for the administration of that sum the Post Office receives £490,000.  That is ¾ per cent for the administration of the £74.2 million which is entailed in the savings service.  The administration of that service requires the provision of staff and buildings, the printing and distribution of stocks of various forms and the responsibility for the accounting procedures involved in the administration of public money.  For that responsibility less than ¾ per cent of the turnover was given to the Post Office by the Department of Finance. Who is subsidising who there?  Is the Department of Finance giving a reasonable figure of the Post Office for carrying out that important task which the Post Office carries out so efficiently? Show me any other business with a turnover of £74.2 million where less than ¾ per cent is allowed for the running of that business.</P>
    <P>Another service which falls on the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is the social welfare service.  The payments paid out by the Post Office in <Col N="100" /> 1967/68 on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare amounted to £44 million, the sale of stamps and other matters amounted to £13.5 million, making a total of £57.5 million paid out by the Post Office on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare.  As an agent for that Department of State, which is a vital one, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were paid £630,000, which is 1½ per cent.</P>
    <P>It is interesting, when we are dealing with these matters, to recall the statement of Mr. Seán Murray of the Institute of Public Administration when he analysed the cost of administration of the Department of Social Welfare in a Sunday newspaper and said that the administrative costs are six per cent of the total expenditure. The people who do most of the work in handling the business of social welfare are the Post Office people and the amount given to them for carrying out that work is 1.5 per cent.  Who is subsidising whom there?  Is it not a fact that the Post Office is being exploited by the Department of Social Welfare as their agent?</P>
    <P>I could go through all the Departments in turn.  I shall give one as an example. It is a minor one but it will indicate to the House what I mean. I refer to the Department of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  He is described as the bloodhound in the public service.  The cost involved in running his Department is £82,000 and the cost of postage charged to that Department for 12 months is £15.  It amounts to approximately three letters per day, if you take a five-day week and a working year of 250 days.  This refers to incoming and outgoing letters.  This is the sum that is levied on the Comptroller and Auditor General but the man who buys his stamps, the unfortunate man who pays at the counter, will pay the full price.  The Government service is subsidised by the outside user, which is the general public. I suggest that if the Government were serious about a realistic assessment in this particular field they would instal franking machines at the posting points in each Government Department where what was posted could be recorded accurately and exactly.</P>
    <P>Let us take another Department <Col N="101" /> much nearer to ourselves: the cost involved in the free postage for the Deputies and Senators.  I am not for a moment criticising the fact that this very important facility is available to the Members of this House.  What is the Post Office allowed for it?  Who is carrying the burden?  Is the Department of Finance paying the subsidy or is the Post Office carrying the load? There can be no doubt whatever that the postal service is not given credit for the work it performs on the postal side, in particular for other Government Departments.  One might say that as it now stands, if the commercial as well as the ordinary users of the Post Office are asked to pay increased charges for the service of having their letters delivered, they are in addition subsidising the delivery of letters to and from Government Departments.</P>
    <P>On the evidence of an examination of the postal charges on one Government Department which I have described, I think that the Minister should do what I suggest&mdash;arrange for proper franking so that a clear indication of the volume of postal work would be given.  It is because of the totally unrealistic costings of the work done by the Post Office for the Department of Finance that the public who use the Post Office services are discriminated against by having to pay higher postal rates than the service they get would warrant.</P>
    <P>If the Post Office services for other Departments were realistically costed, the Post Office services would be cheaper and the deficiency now attributed to Post Office working would be transferred to where it properly belongs &mdash;the other Government services.  If nothing else happened, cheaper Post Office services would attract more business and the Minister for Finance would have available more realistic figures on which to base his Budget proposals.</P>
    <P>Another statement made by Deputy Childers in his press conference was as follows: &ldquo;The Post Office have used modern techniques over the years to ensure economies and improvements&rdquo;. I challenge the accuracy of that statement. In support of the challenge I should like to quote from a very important document.  It is a report which <Col N="102" /> has been out for a number of years now.  It is <i>Science and Irish Economic Development</i>, volume 1.  It is not the first time that I had to quote from this report which was made by a survey team set up by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in November, 1963.  The body concerned were in association with the OECD and made an investigation into a number of Government services, including the Post Office.  On the Post Office the report stated:</P>
    <P>The level of technology is low in some post offices, particularly in many urban areas where the load factor is highest.  Queues are common. There are many different types of forms including duplicates to be handled.  Automatic franking for use by the public, apart from that used by some business offices, is nonexistent and many of the post offices themselves are apparently sited without regard for vehicle parking or customer convenience.  There appears therefore to be an urgent need for research into the whole working of post offices, with a view to rationalisation of procedures, modern equipment, new methods of speeding transactions, location of office and types of service to be automated.</P>
    <P>The report also states:</P>
    <P>It is now evident that the social and economic changes taking place demand technological changes in services of this type, and some new techniques in research, notably that of operation research, would have particular application in bringing about improvements.</P>
    <P>The Minister had the brashness to suggest that modern and efficient methods were being used so far as the Post Office was concerned to ensure economies and to bring about improvements. If this efficiency and economy was being brought about, and particularly the effeciency, may I ask what has happened in Stillorgan in the last few years?  Members may ask what bearing has this?  As far back as December 1966 I had to ask this very question and there has been no change in the position since.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to emphasise what Stillorgan is like <Col N="103" /> now.  The Government, the corporation and all responsible bodies are suggesting that people on that side of the city should as much as possible do their shopping and their business in that Stillorgan area rather than come into the city and get it into a worse state than it is at the present time. It is now virtually a major city.  When it was being planned the Post Office was invited to participate.  The files on that subject carry a foot of dust in the Post Office at the present time. There was no attempt whatever made by the Post Office to provide the services which duty should have imposed on them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="104" /> What happened?  The Bank of Ireland moved in.  I can only compliment the bank in its search for business and in its go-ahead procedure.  It was one of the first customers there.  The Bank of Ireland is an established unit there today.  People shop to the extent of thousands of pounds there and they do not know where the post office is. This is a Department that should be in a position to bring in funds.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
