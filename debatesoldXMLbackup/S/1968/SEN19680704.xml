    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the floor last night when we adjourned discussion of this amendment. I <Col N="986" /> wanted to intervene briefly on the amendment which suggests that a further consideration to be taken into account when grants are being granted to help people to attend the university should be whether or not they have been accepted for entry to or continuance in a course of study at an approved institution. Really the only point I wanted to make was that if the Minister does not accept some such amendment as this, he might find himself in the awkward position of making grants to enable people to attend the university without their having a university to attend. The presumption would then be that they would be getting their grants all right living in an hotel, doing the best they could, but not in fact attending a university because they had not gained admission.</P>
      <P>I feel there ought to be an onus on the Minister, an obligation, to discover, before making the grants whether the people concerned are accepted in the university. I think the two necessarily go together and I believe this is something upon which the Minister might like time to reflect before Report Stage because it could be an implied absurdity if grants were paid for attending a university when in fact the university did not accept them.</P>
      <P>The only legitimate reason I could see for not accepting them would be if the course they wanted to pursue were already full. It would be possible to have the intellectual qualifications but not to have the space and facilities available, and I feel that either amendment No. 8 or amendment No. 9, which we have not yet reached, would solve that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. B. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in the House yesterday before Senator Sheehy Skeffngton came in, in reply to this point, this whole matter is covered in section 5 where an obligation is placed on the local authority to prepare a scheme annually and under that scheme all the requirements in regard to students and the university are set out in detail. This has been the case since scholarships were initiated in this country and will continue to be the case under the scheme. I <Col N="987" /> might read one particular recommendation which will be mandatory under section 5 for students, university authorities, local authorities and everybody else concerned. We have regulations for the provision of grants, the categories of students, the eligibility of candidates, and we say that he must meet the entrance requirements; a candidate must comply with the entrance requirements laid down by the university college or other approved institution of higher education in respect of the course the candidate will attend.</P>
      <P>If there are further requirements which the university authorities may wish to incorporate in the higher grants scheme, we will be glad to meet them on it. This is a better way of dealing with the matter than writing it into an Act of the Oireachtas. It is better to have these requirements made out annually in the scheme of grants for higher education which the local authority must issue to each candidate for such grant and each successful student will be bound by the scheme, and the local authority will be bound by the scheme and everybody concerned will be bound by the scheme. This scheme has been fully acceptable over the years to the university authorities. If they wish any changes to be made, they can make representations to me and in the future to the Higher Education Authority in regard to the entrance requirements for students coming into their institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this pretty well meets the point and I agree with most of what the Minister has just said. This scheme under subsection (2) of section 5 is pretty well in the Minister's hands. I am not one of those who suspect a deep conspiracy against the universities. I know the Minister would always satisfy himself that the scheme was in accordance with the wishes of these institutions but there is a subsidiary point which I would like to mention. It is possible that in present circumstances a student may satisfy the requirements laid down by the university but might wish to do a course of study at the university which is already full up. That student has <Col N="988" /> fulfilled the requirements of the university as the Minister has said and would be eligible for a grant but it might happen that, although eligible, he could not be accepted for the course of study he desires. It is possible now for the student to gain entry to the university but to be refused entry to the course he chooses. If he is determined to do one particular course and no other, there would be a certain problem as to whether or not he would get a grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has said sounds reasonable enough, but we have to look at it in a practical way against a practical background and that practical background is that the scheme as agreed on can be changed by the Minister with or without the agreement of the council concerned. It does seem very strange that in drafting this scheme the universities have not been consulted at all. Neither of the universities has been consulted and it is something which I feel constrained to raise at the Standing Committee of the Senate next week. There are many features of this Bill I will have to raise at this Committee and in the Seanad later.</P>
      <P>The Minister says, and quite rightly, that the universities can make changes to those &ldquo;for the purpose of protecting their standards&rdquo;, but the universities feel that that is exactly what they did, without any effect, in connection with the proposed alterations in the leaving certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Still we have to judge this against a practical background because the universities were concerned that the representations they made in connection with the leaving certificate, which were shared by all teacher groups and all competent groups outside the universities, were, to quote the Minister, &ldquo;for the purpose of protecting their standards&rdquo; and they were dismissed offhand. Not a comma was changed. Are we then going to walk into the same trap again and hand over those powers to the Minister without safeguard in connection with the grants? I for one will not be a party to that. At the very minimum, we will have to insist on the <Col N="989" /> amendment before us and we will have to be very critical when section I comes back to us in its redrafted form.</P>
      <P>Even at this late stage, I would ask the Minister to defer Report Stage as late as possible in the present session and in that period to have belated but nevertheless urgent consultations with both the university authorities before Report Stage so that he can come here and tell us he has had those discussions and that an agreement has been reached.</P>
      <P>We do not want this scheme to start out with any misunderstanding or any doubts. We want it to go forward as an effort by all. There are three sides to this triangle involved in drafting these standards, the Minister, the local authorities and the university. The third side must be given its due recognition and its due place in putting its experience at the disposal of the Minister and the Department in drafting these schemes under section 5.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>

      <P>I put down this amendment because I felt that the question of entry standard was a matter of such great importance that it might be singled out from one of those things which were expressed in a scheme and should be given statutory effect. The Minister has indicated that he does not agree with this but nevertheless he has indicated that a provision similar to this has been in schemes in the past and is in the model scheme which he has already drafted and I think he is ready to assure us that such a provision will be in all schemes in the future.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) to delete paragraph (d) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) the persons comply with such other requirements as may from time to time be prescribed by the Minister in agreement with the relevant education authorities.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think that is almost self-explanatory. I want to ensure that the requirements here are both scholastic and disciplinary and prescribed by the Minister. I cannot see why there should be any objections on the part of the Minister to having this done in full agreement with the relevant educational authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We would like to see it written in. I cannot see objection to it. I suggest to the Minister to show on the assurance he has given that he accepts this. We do not for one moment suspect or doubt in any way <Col N="991" /> his assurance but surely those assurances are in no way binding on even another Minister from the Minister's Party, much less on a Minister from any succeeding Government. That is why we cannot pass legislation on a series of assurances no matter how welcome for the time being and cannot accept anything in the nature of assurances from a Minister, or even ministerial interpretations of sections of a Bill, because once a Bill leaves the House, all that remains is what is written in the Bill and it is a matter of whatever interpretation the courts place on it. Consequently, I would urge on the Minister to come some distance to meet us by accepting this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what Senator Quinlan has said because I feel this is merely an expression in other words of the assurance the Minister has given us. The purport of the amendment before us now is to add the words &ldquo;in agreement with the relevant educational authorities&rdquo;. The Minister assures us he will always do this. I would like to ask him in what way would he feel inhibited in accepting this amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not altogether certain that this amendment is a desirable one. If it read &ldquo;in consultation with the relevant authorities&rdquo;, there would be some good in accepting it because that would express in black and white in the Bill what the Minister is going to do. I am not so sure it is a good thing to write into legislation that there must be agreement. What happens if there is no agreement? I do not want to go over unfortunate events of the past where&mdash;I am not attempting to snipe at anyone &mdash; things have happened which should not have led to this agreement. The autocratic behaviour of certain institutions with regard to local authority scholarships in the past was of the nature that no Minister should have agreed to certain things which were done in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>

    <Col N="992" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that there might be cases where in the public interest a Minister would have full considerataion but you would have to disagree with him. While, therefore, there is something to be said for writing into the Bill something to say there must be agreement, you thereby give a power of veto to the institution concerned. That is not necessarily good. I know somebody has to take the initiative and while there should be consultation and possibly every effort made to reach agreement, there may be cases where it would not be possible to reach agreement. I think it would be dangerous to put this in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Who are the relevant educational authorities? You could get into terrible trouble if you write things of this kind into the Bill, and Senator Yeats has just postulated other things that might arise. It is beyond me that there should not be mutual understanding with regard to education. We should not tie ourselves unduly in a detail of this kind. This is a Bill primarily to enable the community to give more money to people who heretofore could not avail of higher education, to give more money to them and as a start to ensure as far as possible that the best talent we have should get into higher education. It is providing a flexible basis for ensuring that the community will to a greater degree in the future provide such grants to students in income categories who heretofore could not afford higher education. This is the main purpose of the Bill. It is a matter largely for the community and the people who wish to participate in it.</P>
      <P>As far as Senator Quinlan's suggestion is concerned, that there should be detailed consultation in a matter of this kind, any representations the universities wish to make will be looked into closely by me and my Department, but this is not a matter which entails detailed consultations between my Department and the universities, and any matter which did involve the universities closely, we took in detail indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the structure of the new leaving certificate and <Col N="993" /> to assure Senator Quinlan and the House and the public generally that we spent two years discussing that matter with every body concerned, and a university expert and academician were brought in on our discussions. Teacher organisations were brought into our very detailed discussions on consultations on the structure of the leaving certificate. I want to compliment the university people on their excellent contribution in these matters. They were very helpful. They gave tremendous assistance in the preparation of the various groups which we have set out now as the new leaving structure. I do not want to suggest that universities have no function in this matter&mdash;quite the contrary. I want to say that the universities in these discussions were very helpful and I wish it to remain that way in regard to higher education.</P>
    <P>On this particular amendment, there is absolutely no point in tying down the Minister, whoever he may be, in the manner suggested by the amendment. On the previous amendment&mdash; and I am covering old ground here&mdash; the university authorities, if they were asked to come in here and talk, would be far happier with the situation of the past. I am aware that the governing bodies of the universities would be happier with the provision we suggest in section 5, than a proposal of this kind which would tie the situation down. The responsible people in the universities want that, and what I have is a flexible scheme whereby they can make representations to me in the years ahead, and we do not tie anybody down to an undue degree and this is what the people in charge of the universities want.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be covered by subsection (d)&mdash;&ldquo;such other requirements as may from time to time be prescribed&rdquo;. For instance, I could think of other requirements in university life. There is a rule of attendance at a certain percentage of lectures. If universities have a rule to that effect, here it says the university has this rule and the Minister may not prescribe that as a requirement. On the question of standards at examinations, <Col N="994" /> I feel that the university alone is guardian of the standards. Why under this section, if it is required for a grant that a student must attain a certain standard, not have this standard stated after agreement, not after consultation?</P>
      <P>There is the question of discipline. Again, why not have this in agreement rather than after consultation? In other words, we have not the confidence we should have in the phrase &ldquo;after consultation&rdquo;. I think they do not want to take it in this debate, but the Minister and the public generally will unfortunately hear a great deal more about the leaving certificate and about consultations before we reach a satisfactory situation. I think it is only yesterday there was a strong pronouncement by a leading conference&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate as showing the real confidence between the Minister and the point of view I am expressing, which other organisations outside and many members here share with me. It is an interpretation of the validity of the phrase &ldquo;after consultation&rdquo;. In other words, we do not see the machinery for consultation. We are not satisfied with consultation of the past; rather are we looking forward to it in the future.</P>

      <P>I wish them every success, and I will try to make them a success every time I am concerned with them. It would be unthinkable that the Minister would agree to a requirement that was against what the universities want in that regard; in other words, that he would impose something that would not be covered in the phrase. I <Col N="995" /> appeal to the Minister to reconsider this. Senator Yeats mentioned the autocratic behaviour of some university authorities. I challenge Senator Yeats that the universities are not to be labelled in this way. I have an idea what he is referring to but I challenge him to name the authorities.</P>

I was shocked, I must say, to hear sections of Senator Quinlan's pronouncement and I feel called upon to rise in order to defend the universities' autonomy against Senator Quinlan. He made some quite extraordinary statements, and he was inviting the Minister, in fact, to interfere in matters of university discipline such as the number of lectures a student has to attend and standards in examination results. I was appalled by Senator Quinlan. It was quite fantastic. It seems to me that this Bill has nothing to do with these matters. It relates only to the payment of grants by local authorities. Whether the university decides that a student should reach a certain standard at examinations or attend a certain number of lectures or comply with other matters of discipline is entirely a matter for the university. I was appalled to hear Senator Quinlan suggesting that under this Bill the Minister should be in agreement with the universities in these matters. These are matters which are none of the Minister's business under this Bill. All it relates to is the payment of grants by local authorities. What the universities regard as their internal business is their business and not the Minister's.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that Senator Yeats made a good suggestion when he said that instead of &ldquo;in agreement with&rdquo; the words should be &ldquo;after consultation with&rdquo;. I do not entirely share Senator Quinlan's reluctance to accept that, and I would think that it might be a good idea to withdraw this amendment in the hope that on Report Stage the Minister might consider accepting the wording suggested by Senator Yeats, always assuming that after this is put forward Senator Yeats will still agree with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite agreeable to the suggestion made by Senator Sheehy Skeffington though it is less than I would have hoped for, but at least &ldquo;in consultation with&rdquo; the university authorities or &ldquo;after consultation&rdquo; with them would mean that the university authorities were made aware or to be made aware of the impending requirement that was about to be made by the Minister. That is the minimum we would ask in this regard. I cannot see how Senator Yeats got so mixed up as to believe that I was inviting the Minister to take these powers under the section. I was merely pointing out, and I thought that Senator Yeats as a lawyer would have seen this, that under the section as drafted this could be done. Perhaps at Report Stage we could table an amendment or, perhaps, the Minister might bring in an amendment along the lines suggested by Senator Sheehy Skeffington. Surely there can be no objection whatsoever to letting the university authorities have information as to what the Minister would like and getting their views as to the full requirements under this Act which he intends or thinks it would be worthwhile <Col N="997" /> introducing. I cannot see any objection to that procedure.</P>

      <P>I appreciate this, that here we have a new scheme, which may have features in common with the earlier scholarship schemes, but this is a new one for the payment of grants on a means test basis involving the setting up of standards for determining entry. Have the universities been consulted by the Minister on the proposals contained in this part of the Bill, in this Schedule, in this new scheme? Have they been asked for their views? That is what consultation means at the minimum, though I would have hoped to see much more than that, but at least their views should be given every possible attention and account taken of them. Have the universities been consulted in regard to the whole scheme, and has the scheme been put in front of them? If not <Col N="999" /> surely we are entitled to say that consultation should go into the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be opposed to altering the Bill as drafted in any way whatsoever. Section 1 in subsections (a) and (b) refers to two different types of institutions&mdash;(a) a university or university college and (b) any other institution in so far as it provides courses leading to qualifications which in the opinion of the Minister is equivalent to a university degree. That could be the College of Surgeons, the College of Science, a College of Technology or various other institutions, so I see no reason whatsoever why consultation should be with the university authorities and with the university authorities alone; and if this is going to be more wide than the universities, how are you going to provide for other colleges some of which may still not exist? That would be my first objection. My second objection is the fact that this is a Bill whereby the Minister as representative of the taxpayers of this country is deciding on what basis he as representative of the taxpayers is prepared to contribute to the education of boys and girls going to university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is just the same as a prudent parent will decide on which basis he will pay fees, which, perhaps, he can ill-afford, for the university training of his children. It has nothing to do with universities as such. It is as representative of the taxpayers, of the community, as the Minister said when he spoke here on it. The universities themselves can set their own standards. They may set standards very much higher than the Minister has said. They may say: &ldquo;All right, you may give grants to those people but we do not consider they are up to the standard which we require in our colleges and we will not admit them&rdquo;. The universities can set their rules of discipline and say that the persons to whom we have given grants have not attended such lectures, have not complied with their standards in other ways. The universities can say accordingly: &ldquo;We are sending them down. We are completely independent of you as Minister. We will govern our colleges as we <Col N="1000" /> think fit. We will maintain our own autonomy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is the problem associated with both sides and I am opposed to any further amendment to the wording of the Bill in this respect. The universities, on the one hand, wish to preserve their autonomy, their disciplines and their rules. On the other hand, the Minister, as the representative of the taxpayers, will decide on which basis we the public, the taxpayers, are prepared to contribute to this scheme.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so that 1,000 boys and girls will benefit who would not if we have this prevarication. If Senators want it, then we will have it. Maybe I should put it more plainly. This is a Bill through which the State is giving extra money by way of grants to enable a higher proportion of boys and girls to get higher education. This is a matter of community involvement. It is a matter in which the community, through the taxpayers and the Government as the community's agent, will have 1,000 boys and girls benefiting from student grants where heretofore through the local authorities, in a haphazard way, only 270 boys and girls benefited. We are lifting this from 270 to 1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, therefore, is primarily a matter for the State as representing the community. It is a decision taken in society's interests, in the interests of the community, to ensure that the best talents will get into the universities. Here we are providing a flexible piece of legislation whereby we can extend this in the future. This is not, and I say it positively, primarily a university matter at all. The Bill is designed to make higher education available, it is <Col N="1002" /> concerned with the community's money, with the community giving more money than heretofore to enable more boys and girls to get the benefits of higher education, which means not just university education but other higher education that the Minister of the day, from time to time, may deem to be equivalent to university education.</P>
    <P>I am all for consulting the university authorities on matters of syllabus and curricula, matters concerned with their autonomy and their position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the community. We shall have ample time when the new Higher Education Bill comes before the Oireachtas after the Recess to go into this in detail. This Bill, which I propose to have in the next session, will be primarily a matter for university consideration, for academic consideration, and we propose to have the fullest consultations with the universities on their proposed structure, on the reorganisation of the universites and their places in the community and in higher education.</P>
    <P>But the Bill we are now discussing is not one in respect of which there is any need for me to consult the universities. It is a community matter involving taxation from the community to enable more boys and girls to avail of higher education. We are discussing section 2 and the only matter which concerns the universities arises under section 5&mdash;that we agree that pupils who get into their universities by reason of our scheme under this Bill shall accord to the standards of the universities, and if they do not so accord then we will suspend the grants. From that point of view this is the one university interest in the matter.</P>
    <P>We have here a scheme prepared under section 5 which covers all this matter and which has operated in regard to scholarships heretofore. On this aspect there is no change but there is a very big change in regard to the taxpayers', the community's involvement. In regard to the standard to be observed by the recipients of these grants there is no change. All we are doing is having greater community involvement, but in regard to the standards of the recipients of the grants there is no change in regard <Col N="1003" /> to his or her situation compared with the situation which has existed heretofore. We have here a prototype of the scheme which the university authorities have had during many years and of which they are aware, a scheme which fully safeguards them and to a far greater degree than has been suggested here in amendments put down by Senators who do not represent the real interests of the university authorities. If we had the governing bodies of the universities here they would all agree they are quite happy with this scheme.</P>
    <P>It is a scheme to be drawn up from year to year and if there is any particular point in this scheme as compared with that administered by the local authorities this year, which the governing bodies of the universities wish to raise with me, I will be very glad to meet them and change the scheme if necessary. It is a flexible scheme that can be amended from year to year. If you write something into the Bill all you do is to inhibit the university authorities. The irony is that the people speaking here on behalf of the universities are doing more harm and damage to the university authorities by seeking to write into the Bill something that can be adjusted and amended from year to year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall read it again. I do not like being longwinded or detailed but I shall read it again. It is set out in the scheme which has <Col N="1004" /> been operated for many years in regard to scholarships:</P>
      <P>A candidate must comply with the entrance requirements laid down by the university...</P>
      <P>We are now retaining under the present system that a candidate must comply with the entrance requirement laid down by the university college or under any course which the candidate wishes to attend. I think that is very comprehensive. It Senators want to minimise that, that is their business, but they will be down-grading other aspects of future university authorities. We wish to stiffen that up, to give greater strength to the universities' point of view. We want this in a flexible way. We would welcome views from the universities on all aspects of higher education. The only lack has been the lack of constructive views from the universities. I would like to see these views coming forward. Our trouble is that as far as higher education is concerned, the views are always coming from the political Parties and in my view, particularly in recent years, the main contribution in regard to the matter of higher education and education generally has come from Fianna Fáil Ministers of State since 1957, first the Taoiseach, then Dr. Hillery, then George Colley, then Donogh O'Malley. I am making my little contribution now, but I think that the only forward thinking in regard to education has come from Fianna Fáil Ministers of State and that one of the lacks, during the 1950s particularly, and Senators know this well, was that there was a large silence from the university authorities and no great contribution of constructive thought by them particularly during that period. Any forward thinking was done by Fianna Fáil Ministers for Education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and that is what I am going to deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1005" /> The Minister made reference to the fact that he is anxious to get this Bill through. I would like to make the point that we are anxious to facilitate him in this. We have therefore proposed that the Report Stage be taken today so as to get it through as soon as possible. We appreciate that the debate may be taking longer than the Minister feels happy about and one can appreciate his frustration. We, too, are anxious to get it through, but we are anxious that this particular issue should be adequately debated.</P>
    <P>Senator Nash made a very good point in distinguishing the two aspects &mdash;the community aspect of the grants and the universities concerned with the academic side, but the two are in fact inextricably linked up in ways which require consultation. The Minister has suggested that this is a matter that does not involve the universities because as far as they are concerned, there is no change in the present situation. This is simply not so. There are two major changes which concern the universities. The first one is that the Minister is abolishing the scholarship scheme. As a result of protests, he has now hastily proposed to increase the number of entrance scholarships. Due to the lack of consultation on the matter, great confusion has been caused here. The Minister made it clear that he was unaware of the fact that entrance scholarships are valid for one year only.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have fixed that up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>For that reason and because of the fact that these entrance scholarships are at a very high level and that the colleges are not getting sufficient numbers of people at that level, they do not provide a vehicle for additional scholarships. It has now become necessary because of lack of consultation with the universities to introduce a complicated, cumbersome scheme which is thoroughly unsatisfactory but which is going to be pushed through and accepted because we must have something as an alternative to the present scholarship arrangements. To say that <Col N="1006" /> this is entirely a community matter is untrue. The questions whether there are students coming on scholarships and how the scholarships would be awarded and what role the colleges are going to play are important.</P>
      <P>The Minister is now proposing that they should play a role in the awarding of these scholarships that will impose additional burdens on the universities in this particular matter. The Minister is going to introduce into the university a further 600 or 700 people in receipt of scholarships or grants and this is going to require that the university fulfils certain functions that it at present fulfils in regard to 275 students. Overnight it will have to deal with 900 or 1,000 students, including reporting on the conduct of the students. Here is a matter which very much concerns the university. The burden of reporting is going to be trebled overnight. How can the Minister suggest that this is not a matter for consultation with the universities? Due to lack of consultation, they are having to introduce a makeshift scholarship scheme to get around the abolishing of the existing scheme. They are also facing the burden of handling these extra cases overnight about which there has been no consultation.</P>
      <P>I think I have shown that in this instance the two things are intermeshed. You cannot say the grants scheme is a community matter and that the universities can look after their own side. You cannot say no change is being made in the present situation by introducing a grant scheme which will treble the burden of reporting on colleges. These are matters that concern us intimately. We should have been consulted on them. The Minister will be reluctant to admit that fact. It is desirable to spell out in the legislation that there should be consultation in regard to matters concerned with this scheme. The absence of it is causing great difficulties at the present time and the attempts to retrieve the problems created by a lack of consultation are causing difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to accept this reasonable amendment, the need for which has been amply demonstrated <Col N="1007" /> by the confusion created in the past few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion the wording of the amendment is too rigid. It is not practical to suggest that the section here should depend on the condition that there should be agreement between the Minister and the other educational authorities. A very useful suggestion was made by Senator Yeats and agreed to by Senator Sheehy Skeffington. I feel we should revert to that point rather than go into the broad field of the necessity for consultation.</P>

I would be completely opposed to this amendment as it stands because what the Minister is doing now is what the parent does when he wants to provide higher education for his children. What the universities do is a matter for themselves and their autonomy should not be interfered with and is not being interfered with.</P>

      <P>This is an example of the dilemma a Minister would be in when it comes to consultation with the <Col N="1009" /> universities. From time to time, all sorts of questions arise as to whether a person is qualified or is eligible for a grant. We get hundreds of letters from parents and their children about this, all seeking to ascertain whether a person is eligible for the grants. There may be a flaw in the scheme and some change may be required. That is a community matter because it is the community's money that is being used.</P>
      <P>If I want to change the scheme to meet a certain case, a fairly quick decision may have to be reached. These cases usually arise in September or August when there is very little time before the universities open and I would have great trouble in getting the university authorities together during the long hot summer when Ministers have to work and parents are concerned about their children. I feel that the matter should be left as it is and if in the winter a flaw appears, then the university authorities can bring it to my notice and we can have consultations on it.</P>

      <P>To add to subsection (1) a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) the continuation of a grant for any subsequent year depends on the persons attaining the required standard as prescribed by the Minister in agreement with the relevant education authorities in the appropriate examination of the previous year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that the standard is prescribed in agreement with the relevant educational authorities and I want to know the Minister's mind on the standard. Is it to be based on a pass in <Col N="1010" /> the examination? It is probably not to be based on honours in the examination as it was in the past but surely the Minister will not be prepared to accept just a plain pass in this regard?

As long as they passed the examination, they would get the grant. If they did not pass, the grant would be held up for a year or until such time as they got the examination. If they got the examination, the grant would be resumed. I hope that university representatives here will pursue the scheme as assiduously as they have pursued the debate here. The scheme covers the situation proposed here by Senator Quinlan and if the university authorities make representations to me between now and next year, we will consult with them regarding the amendment of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be clear on the facts, and also if a student has a county council scholarship and fails his examination at the end of the year, 12 months later, is the scholarship repeated if he goes back to the university and passes his examination at the end of the second year? If that is so, it is a matter which the House should consider. It would be a very serious thing if for the minimum standards the taxpayer should incur a vast amount of expense. I also think, and I say it with great respect as there are a number of university professors here, that it seems that since my time at the university even the standard seems to have dropped. Students can get their examinations today in bits and scraps, one subject at one examination, another at the next and the third after that. That is a shocking standard. I should like to know the whole facts regarding standards and this other question in relation to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in disagreement on this. It would be a dangerous policy to lay down that a student who got one of those grants and went to a university and only got a pass in his first year examination was given up. Many students who go to the university for the first time <Col N="1012" /> take some time to find their feet. Conditions are so different and circumstances are so different that in many cases those who get an excellent degree do not do anything like so well in their earlier years. There might also be other reasons in a particular year that they did not do very well in their examinations. On that point they might in effect be sent down from the university.</P>
      <P>Apart from this, it seems to me that the amendment is another attempt on Senator Quinlan's part to interfere with university autonomy. Students go to the university on grants provided by the State and once they do it is a matter for the university in regard to the standards they reach. Under the amendment no longer will universities have the sole voice as to whether students have to continue doing a course. The Minister comes into it and the standard the student reaches must be decided in agreement with the university. The Minister can veto the standard laid down. That seems to be a highly undesirable interference with the university authorities and I am surprised to see Senator Quinlan proposing this. Apart from the grant, students once they reach the university, whether they have grants or not, should be on exactly the same plane. All students should be on the one level and it should be a matter for the university authorities.</P>

      <P>I never cease to marvel at the interpretation lawyers can put on simple statements, but I think Senator Nash has raised a very good point on this amendment, that is the question of standard and that is precisely what I am after. In other words, what standards have to be attained by all scholars? The regulalation lays down that the candidate must attain honours to hold a scholarship.</P>

The general practice is that if a student passes there may be a <Col N="1013" /> recommendation by the university to the authority concerned that he be given a maintenance grant and that some deduction be made in that regard.

We welcome the <Col N="1014" /> decision to spend money to get good students to come to the university and we are anxious at all times to contribute towards the selection and the development of those students. One of the essential features in any subject is that the man who does well in the university course must be rewarded and those who do not must be penalised. In other words, the man who really does his best at the university and gets honours in his examination is entitled to more than the man who simply coasts along and barely gets a pass. We have asked the Minister repeatedly to ensure that in a scheme. We want to encourage real scholars who will do good work and study. We want to ensure that we get the best people into the university rather than those who just coast along and get a pass degree and nothing more. Senator Nash has said quite rightly that he would not favour that.</P>

      <P>I was about to deal with that. I can assure Senator Nash it is getting harder to pass examinations. I feel that the work of students is increasing every day. New lecturers are coming in desirous of putting all their new knowledge into practice and I do not think we need for one moment hesitate to think that standards are higher. The demands are very much higher on students than they have been in the past. Our business is to try to lighten the load on students. This is why in cases of five subjects in an examination there is a tendency, if a student does well in three and fails in the others, to carry those forward to the following examination. That is not unreasonable. I can assure Senator Nash he need have no worries about our standards. Certainly the students themselves are fully conscious of the fact that standards are just as good today as ever.</P>

      <P>We were dealing with amendment No. 10 which makes no reference to honours in any examination. It seems to me if I properly understood Senator Quinlan in the crossfire we had earlier today that he was saying that a person who qualifies under these arrangements for financial assistance to enable him to attend university should have this financial assistance withdrawn if he did not get honours in the yearly examination.

That is another day's work and I am sure we will have ample debate on it in future when we bring in the Higher Education <Col N="1020" /> (Authority) Bill and other measures which I hope to introduce. This particular Bill is on the very narrow social front of community performance in order to broaden the range of people that we are seeking to bring into higher education who heretofore could not do it because of economic circumstances. I am not saying the Bill is the full answer but it provides a framework within which we can work in the future. The Bill is on this narrow front. There are no pretensions in the Bill to deal with examinations or academic matters. These are all matters for future discussion. This is on the narrow front of enabling boys and girls of parents who because of economic circumstances heretofore could not afford it if they have the talent to go forward and reach certain qualifications to enter universities. That is all the Bill is about and I should like to keep it on that level, to narrow it down to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister on this point. Let us clearly distinguish between competitive scholarships, in respect of continuance of which it may be legitimate to impose certain requirements as regards reaching a certain standard, and grants designed to open up the university to students who hitherto were not able to get there. I am not saying there should not be any requirement as regards performance. It may be that there is a case for consultation between the Minister and the university with a view to ensuring that students who repeatedly fail do not indefinitely get their grants renewed. Such a case could be made and I think it could be left to the Minister and the university to consult in regard to that matter. I do not think it should be in the legislation here and I do not think anything like an honours standard should be required for the renewing and continuance of grants. I should like to support the Minister on that. I think Senator Quinlan is confusing the question of scholarships and the question of this kind of grant for a social purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself almost wholly though not entirely in agreement <Col N="1021" /> with Senator FitzGerald in this. It seems to me as a layman that the situation will be quite simple from now on. There will be two types of students, those who have grants and those who have not, whose parents are paying the entire costs of keeping them at the university. I feel, as Senator Murphy does, that both those types of students should be treated exactly equally. Obviously, Senator Quinlan is correct in saying that university students should be encouraged in every possible way to get honours and so on and it is a matter for the university to try to arrange its affairs so that this desirable thing is achieved but all should be treated alike in this respect. It would be entirely wrong to do it on any other basis.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinlan may not mean this but what his amendment says, in fact, whether he intends it or not, is that from now on the Minister should lay down standards of examinations and so forth for certain types of students. This may not be what he means but it is what the amendment says quite clearly, that for these grant-aided students the Minister, in agreement with the university, should lay down standards that these students must reach. That seems to me to be a complete breach of the whole conception of university autonomy and besides that a most retrograde notion that grant-aided students should be treated in a different way and should be required to fulfil higher standards than ordinary students. The whole basis of the success of this scheme must be that all students will be treated exactly alike by the university authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Where the idea arises that all students are not treated exactly alike I do not know because all students are treated exactly alike. In the examinations the same standards apply to all and there are certain awards given, in other words a grant. If I interpret the feeling of the Minister and of the other speakers rightly, the grant student who passes an examination gets a grant and the grant student who fails his examination does not. I was suggesting that we should aim at something more than a pass and yet not as high as honours. I thought that <Col N="1022" /> something could be worked out between the university authorities and the Minister, something like third-class honours or some other designation which already applies in science which could probably be introduced and used as a basis. I think for the first time we have heard from the Minister that all he requires for the continuation of a grant is a mere pass. Therefore, I feel that this will make a very substantial change in the whole form work. The whole form work was based on scholarship and on giving a good performance at examinations. Consequently, I think it highlights once again the necessity for having had consultations on this.</P>

Every local authority in the country heretofore since scholarships were initiated only have the requirement for the scholarship to be paid that a student should pass his examination each year, and we are putting that principle into the field of grants so as to enable a far wider category of people to go on for higher education who could not do so heretofore for economic reasons. We are adopting the same principle as is operated by every local authority in the country. There is no change.</P>

      <P>I do not think this is relevant to the debate on this particular amendment. The condition for a fee-paying student to be admitted to the following year is that he passes his examination. This is the university condition for continuance. I think it is proper that the same condition which applies to the fee-paying student should also apply to the community-aided student who received a grant. Anything other than this is discrimination. We could well get lost in the idea of what has happened in the past in regard to students holding competitive scholarships. It is unfortunate that there appears to be a difference of opinion across the House as to what the position has been in the past but I think this is completely irrelevant to what should be done under this scheme. What should be done now is that the grant-aided student should have to fulfil the requirement which the fee-paying student has to fulfil and no more.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Minister's scheme is based on a minimum of passes but I would ask him to give some extra bonus to the students obtaining honours. He indicated that he was making some extra money available to the universities for scholarships. If that money is going to be on a generous scale, the universities will be able to use it to foster scholarships and I hope the Minister will not be averse from students on grants receiving additional awards, say up to £50, as an encouragement to obtain honours. If that is done, my requirements will be met. I hope the Minister will in this way be able to assist us to keep scholarship alive in universities which is the real reason for their existence.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides for the provision of grants to assist persons to attend or to continue to attend approved institutions and it is on the latter point of continuing to attend that I want to raise a question with the Minister. I do not know if he has read the document issued by the Union of Students of Ireland and if he has had an opportunity of considering that matter. It seems to me that they make a relevant point when they state that people already attending the universities are, because of their financial circumstances and the educational standard they have reached, bound to be as much in need of financial assistance as people coming along from school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> I have a great deal of sympathy with the Minister on questions like this. In trade union negotiations when you make a change, you always have the hard luck cases. I am often in the position of having to try to overcome these hard luck cases and it seems to me that whatever is said in the section about the standard of entry, the Minister does not seem to tie himself down with regard to continuance. There is no particular date set for the scheme to come into operation; the Bill does not say that the scheme will operate from 1st October, 1968 or any time like that. I would hope that the Minister would be liberal in his approach to the problem because it could quite well be that students attending university might, by reason of their financial circumstances, be unable to continue attending their courses. If such a student had attended a university subsequent to the coming into operation of the scheme in the Bill, he would have qualified for financial assistance to enable him to continue with his studies.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy with the Minister in this because when you start to do something good, you always find some people coming along and saying that if this had been done a year ago, it would be of assistance to them. I want to make the strongest plea I can to the Minister that he approaches this problem in a liberal manner, that he should not tie his hands in the matter, that he should not prevent himself from doing something to assist people already attending these institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, particularly paragraph (a), I want to raise the question of the standard of the leaving certificate, the four honours certificate. I do not want to go back over what I said previously about the unsuitability of the leaving certificate as causing grieyance and injustice over which we have no control. What is the attitude of the Minister in cases where a student fails to get four honours? He gets two honours and his means are under the allowable limit. What decision are his parents to make if they have confidence in the student? Will it become the regular pattern for such students to spend an additional year in <Col N="1026" /> the secondary school, feeling confident that if they succeeded in getting two honours in their first year, with a little extra coaching they should emerge with four honours in the following year and so qualify for a scholarship?</P>
      <P>That would seem to me to be a wrong tendency. I would much prefer that the way would be open to such a student whose parents believe in him, so that they could either raise the money or make the necessary additional sacrifice to send him up to the university. If that is not possible under the scheme as it stands, I would ask the Minister to recognise that students who qualify on the means test, if they get honours level in the first year, should qualify for a grant in the following year. This would be preferable to having students returning to do the leaving certificate a second or third time. I would like to know the Minister's attitude on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few small points I would like to discuss on this section. The first one concerns paragraphs (a) and (c). I have been a member of a scholarship committee of a county council for many years and just in passing, I might mention to you, Sir, and to Senator Quinlan that the extraordinary thing about it is that it worked perfectly with the universities and the Department. Once or twice when there were complaints from the university to the scholarship committee, there was no doubt about it and either the council continued to give the grants or the Department discontinued them. It certainly worked.</P>
      <P>The point I would like to make, however, is that one question that was always coming up in regard to those schemes was the day of the child's birth. It was extraordinary that this came up year after year. They fixed a certain date and at a certain time the child was disqualified. Under paragraph (a) of this section, we have the child reaching a certain standard in the leaving certificate examination. I do not know what the Minister's intention can be with regard to (c), that the person is within the appropriate age limit. I think perhaps the child may be limited under this Bill but I do not know. The age limit should not count.</P>

      <P>I am going to send them back but I think possibly paragraph (c) might be very limited. No matter what date you fix, you always catch someone. We have changed the wording of that many times over the years but there was always a case of a person losing a scholarship and not getting another chance by reason of age or circumstances.</P>
      <P>The other point I would like to mention in regard to those schemes is so far as I remember that the county council could grant certain additional sums to very poor parents for clothing perhaps and books. I do not know how far these grants will go towards giving extra to the lowest income group. I do not know how far they will go towards sending that pupil to the university. Would it be possible that a county council, knowing the circumstances, should feel obliged, if they could do it, to give certain other assistance in the case of very poor students? You could have the case of a person with £1,100 in income and the person who is the son of an agricultural labourer and those two people in certain circumstances would get the same grant from the Minister. I know that in the past we had some balance from which we could give a little assistance towards books and clothing over and above the scholarship.</P>

      <P>There are a number of points I would like to make on the section. The first one I will not dwell on because we discussed it on Second Stage. I merely want to repeat how important it is to raise this, in support of what Senator Murphy said in regard to students who are in the university at the moment and who got the necessary standard in the leaving certificate. The Minister has a document, which we have all seen, from the university students in Ireland. I must say I have not been able to go into this <Col N="1028" /> closely because I have not been able to give the time to it since I received it but I am rather puzzled by the magnitude of the sums they mentioned. They give exaggerated costs of doing what they want done. I would press the Minister to reconsider his position on this. If he wishes this scheme to be a success and not to become a subject of unfortunate controversy next autumn, as will otherwise be the case, he should reconsider his position on it. Could he give us some indication of what the cost would be of the scheme in its present form? He does not appear to have done so up to this.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, and perhaps if the situation improves, the Minister might be able to get the extra money. There will be great problems about the means test when this scheme comes into operation. I had a phone call this morning from a woman who is the mother of a potential university student. She rang <Col N="1029" /> from a public phone box and I had to ring her back again. What she had to say arises out of what she read in the papers this morning regarding the debate yesterday. She rang me to express her concern about the fact that the scholarships which existed at present on merit are abolished and replaced by this grant scheme. I explained that there will be other scholarships replacing the existing ones and her child would have a good chance of competing. The point she made was that in her case her husband last year offered to work overtime voluntarily in his employment, as a result of which he had secured an income which by a few pounds puts him outside the limit for getting any benefit under this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not get that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>She said her husband in the last year had worked overtime voluntarily, as a result of which he had secured an income which put him outside the limit. I think the income was over £2,000 and with four children put them outside the scheme. The point she made was that if her husband had known the consequences of doing this in one year, in order to get a couple of hundred pounds extra, that it would deprive their child of the benefit of a scholarship over the years because his income was that few pounds too much above this level, he would not have considered it. She pointed out that that would be very unfair. I would like to ask the Minister how will the means test operate? Is it the case that the means test in a family in the year immediately prior to the time of the grant is taken into account and no change in the means after will be considered? That would be very unfair. Will it not be done on the basis of the income in the current year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People's incomes go down as well as up. This overtime I speak of was fortuitous. In future years the income of the people concerned would be lower and they would be deprived of any benefit simply because of the gratuitous fact that this overtime occurred, that the man worked overtime because he did not know he was working himself out of a university grant by so doing. I <Col N="1030" /> would like the Minister to consider this kind of problem. It seems to me that although there are administrative difficulties involved, it will be necessary to review the means test situation during the period the child is at the university, or to make provision for the matter to be re-opened by the parents, should they be able to show that their income has fallen during that period. I would press the Minister to consider that point and to make as flexible as possible a system of administration for the means test because of the hardship it might occasion.</P>
    <P>In this booklet that came to me this morning by An Roinn Oideachais I notice that students have been told what to do to get the scholarship. To my mind, what is here is conflicting with what the Minister told us last week in an important respect. What he said briefly is that if you are a candidate for the leaving certificate examination and if you pass at that examination the number of subjects necessary to qualify for the award of the leaving certificate and at least obtain four honours in the matriculation examination subjects, you are entitled to participate, provided your parents' income comes within the category set out. If a child sits for the examination and obtains the leaving certificate in five subjects, with honours in four, the parents are notified, on the basis of this document, that they are eligible to participate in the scheme for a grant.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us last week this was not the case, that he proposed to introduce a different provisional requirement and that you must pass a particular subject in that examination in order to qualify. That is not said here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of subjects you must pass in the leaving certificate is five and you must pass in Irish. That is a separate requirement. Anybody who reads the scheme here will see there is no requirement to pass in Irish. I take it what the Minister said is incorrect and <Col N="1031" /> the document issued is something the students stand on and that the Minister is not now going to tell them that if they do not pass Irish, they will not get it and this document is not worth the paper it is written on.</P>

      <P>It is written into that that you pass the leaving certificate. It is not a very meritorious point and I want to refer to points made by Senator Garret FitzGerald, particularly that of the unfortunate man who worked overtime and due to that, now has his child disqualified. Again, if you refer to the booklet in regard to means, on page 5, paragraph (2) under the heading &ldquo;And Again&rdquo; it says:</P>
      <P>If your local authority is satisfied that your parents' income has decreased during the period of tenure of your grant to such an extent that the amount of the grant no longer corresponds to the income category in the Schedule in relation to which it was originally determined, the amount of the grant will be adjusted to that relating to the category corresponding to the new income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from what is written there and written in the Bill, this Bill has been deliberately framed in a flexible way. I said this also in the Dáil with a view <Col N="1032" /> to having such hardship cases as mentioned by Senator Garret FitzGerald covered. In the Dáil it was mentioned by, I think, Deputy Tully. I want to make sure that I, or any future Minister for Education, will be in a position, as it were, to bend the situation to meet these cases. That is why this table of means, while it will serve as a basic guideline in regard to the means categories, is not written into the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>In section 2 (1) (b) the means provision is:</P>
    <P>the means (calculated in such manner and by reference to such matters as may be specified from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance) of the persons, if any, and of the parents or guardians of the persons do not exceed such limits as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>From time to time means tests will be flexible, as far as I am concerned, and I can give an assurance to the House and I gave an assurance to the Dáil, that I will be glad to hear in any such cases as Senator FitzGerald sets out of the particulars, as in the case he has mentioned, which appear to merit inclusion in whatever is the appropriate category. Generally, I feel this Bill should be operated and administered in a humane manner and, as far as I am concerned, it will be. I should like to hear from Senators on particular cases where people may be just outside the qualification limit. None of these matters in regard to means qualifications is written into this Bill. They are all matters for ministerial determination of the Bill or for decision from time to time in a particular case.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy's point I think I have answered already. I am all for this but where do you stop when you start something progressive? You raise a hornet's nest, and I have raised a hornet's nest around my ears from people in all sorts of situations going back ten and 15 years who want to get into the scheme. Where do you start? Where do you end? If you go back, where do you stop there? If you go back to last year, it would cost <Col N="1033" /> £300,000; if you go back to 1964, it would cost £1 million. Then you exclude the really unfortunate people who never started at university because they had no means. There are other people who were at least able to get there, but you have all the people who never got there at all. The scope is endless if you start taking up retrospection, extending, especially in a progressive scheme, facilities to people through the many branches of Government Departments in any form of advanced endeavour.</P>
    <P>There frequently are financial implications which, particularly because of the open-ended nature of this in regard to ascertaining where to begin and end, preclude me from going any further than I have gone in the Bill. I am sorry there are hard luck cases for that reason.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that. This leaves me then to speak on the section in the presence of the Minister which I am glad to have the opportunity of doing. This section is the most important section of the Bill, a section which gives the Minister wide powers. It is a section which enables him to refer to the Bill as flexible because of the fact that it gives him the power not only to frame regulations and to decide what the requirements shall be before the granting of these sums of money to students, but also to alter these. He has said in fact that this is totally flexible. I am quite happy <Col N="1034" /> about this. In fact I hope I will not embarrass the Minister when I say that I am even more happy about this in view of the personality of the Minister as we know him here. I should like to say in all sincerity that both as Minister for Justice and now as Minister for Education, he has shown a combination of strength, firmness, and flexibility, which could stand as an example to one or two of his colleagues who shall be nameless. The Minister does not regard the Bills he puts before us as Holy Writ. He regards them as capable of amendment, as we have seen and on this I am not speaking just about this Bill but I am recalling cases in the past, like the Succession Bill, which spring to mind. I am not talking only about suggestions made just now, but I have seen suggestions made by Senators in the past, to the Minister, first argued and then considered by the Minister, and sometimes the point conceded.</P>

Nevertheless, we feel that he is open to persuasion, and it is therefore worth our while trying to persuade the Minister to let himself be convinced.</P>
      <P>One remark he made&mdash;I was sorry that I was not able to be present when he said it, owing to one of the oddities of our procedure in that on that particular occasion we decided that between 6 and 7 o'clock we would not adjourn&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I regard that as a great tribute. But the House was told, during this period when I could not be present, by the Minister in relation to something that Senator Garret FitzGerald had just raised, that is to say, the requirement of a qualification in Irish in order to get the leaving certificate and these grants. The Minister, I think, used a phrase which I could not actually find in the Official Report, but which was reported in the papers to the effect that to ask an Irish child to speak Irish was no more unnatural than to ask a duck to swim. But this is not the Minister for Agriculture before us, and he is unaware of the fact that you do not have to ask a duck to swim. You do not have to say to a duck: &ldquo;Unless you get into this water and swim, you are not going to get an education grant.&rdquo; Ducks take to the water. I am convinced, without being asked, sometimes rather to the alarm of their parents.</P>
      <P>I am a little bit jealous of Senator Garret FitzGerald and Senator Dooge because they had access to a little booklet about the new scheme, in relation to these grants, to which neither as a university lecturer nor as a Senator have I had access up to now.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Trinity asked for more, and I hope the Minister will now address some of the surplus to me. The TCD copies did not reach down to the rank at which I stand, but I would appreciate it if I were allowed to have a look at the document, and I am sure the Minister would be prepared to let me see it.</P>
      <P>I should like to come to a fundamental point mentioned in the explanatory memorandum itself with reference to subsection (1) and paragraph (b). It says that with regard to the question of means test, it is felt that a parent or guardian with one child who has less than £1,200 a year would require the &ldquo;full financial assistance&rdquo;, and of course I underline this phrase, as I did on Second Stage; &ldquo;full financial assistance&rdquo;. This allows me to come to the document which has already been mentioned and which has been placed before all of us here, the document issued by the Union of Students in Ireland in relation to these grants. My feeling is that however optimistic or pessimistic they may be about certain costs, nevertheless this document based on three main claims is a very valuable document and very carefully put together. The three main claims are: first, that the Bill as it stands, the scheme, does not allow for the giving of these grants to anybody who had this qualification before 1968. They say, and I quote from the first paragraph, &ldquo;the decision to give the grant only to those young people who obtain the four honours in the 1968 and thereafter leaving certificate examinations blatantly discriminates against those people who had reached the same standard in previous years.&rdquo; This point I think has already been made, but the point is a valid one, and they themselves in this document suggest that the Minister might consider going back as far as 1964, and they suggest in an appendix which gives figures pretty carefully worked out that the cost of so doing would be something like £390,000.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <P>It is three times that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that it would cost three times that but I was going to say that I think it would cost rather less, for this reason, and I would put this to the Minister for his consideration, that in fact people who are already established in jobs, who have got their professions perhaps, or who have gone into business or trade or agriculture, and who got four honours in the leaving certificate before 1964, that is to say, five years or more ago, are very unlikely to say: &ldquo;Well now, I would like to throw up all this, and I will now apply for a university grant to go to a university.&rdquo; Not only are they unlikely to want to do it in those circumstances, but they are unlikely to be able to do it. The further you go back the smaller the likelihood that, whatever their rights as conceded by the Minister in this regard, they are going to take them up. Many of them may have got married, settled down, have got their posts or their farms and it is unlikely that they will claim a university grant.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the USI have been overmodest in asking that this should be retrospective only to 1964. I do not think that in practice it would cost very much more if you put it back right to the beginning of time, because the number of people who would actually avail themselves of this in practice would be very few in number beyond the last three or four years. In my mind there is no question about that. I am in agreement therefore with the USI document when it says that &ldquo;such discrimination is indefensible.&rdquo; I do not think that one can argue to the contrary. Perhaps the USI did not go quite far enough&mdash;that they made an estimate which was not sufficient when they suggested that it should go back only to 1964. Without very much more expense in practice, they could have gone back as far as the leaving certificate goes back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That deals with the first point made by the USI&mdash;that these grants should be given to people who qualified as far back as 1964. The second point is that this grant should be given to people at present in the universities. I <Col N="1038" /> quote from the first paragraph of this second submission by the USI:</P>
    <P>There is a significant number of students at present in higher education who fall within the limits of the means criteria of the new scheme. The condition of these is well known to any who have interested themselves in higher education. A recent survey concluded that no less than 70 per cent of all students in higher education relied upon vacation employment to pay for their tuition fees, books, accommodation and meals during term time.</P>
    <P>I mentioned this on Second Stage, in answer to a comment by Senator O'Kennedy that vacation work was possible, and I think we are all agreed here that a small amount of vacation work in industry, commerce and agriculture would be valuable for students, but an obligation on them to work a long time through all their vacations to supplement the money available to them now would be a bad thing for them educationally. Again, the Minister might well reconsider this question of allowing the grants here proposed to apply to people with the necessary qualifications who are at present in universities.</P>
    <P>There is one argument in this document about the figures. It has been suggested by Senator FitzGerald that the estimate of the USI of the cost of such a change is too high, and the Minister seemed to agree with the Senator&mdash;he seemed to suggest that so far from this being likely to cost the figures given by the USI, £1.4 million per year, it would be unlikely to cost more than £400,000. I think I have got that figure correct. If the Minister and Senator FitzGerald are right on this&mdash; that this figure of £1.4 million is a considerable over-estimate&mdash;this strengthens rather than weakens the submission of the USI, that those at present in the universities should be considered in relation to this scheme.</P>
    <P>I might say, in parenthesis here, it applies to my third point on which I shall say two things. One is that the Minister's sympathy here is on the same side as ours&mdash;that to quite a <Col N="1039" /> genuine degree there are few things the Minister would like better than to grant these further concessions&mdash;but the Minister's case would be that the money is not there. In this House we can strengthen his hand by insisting that he insists on getting more grants in order to enable him to do justice, because to give the grants to those pre-1968 people who have qualified, and to those at present in the universities would seem to us a minimum requirement of justice.</P>
    <P>The third point the USI make is based on their contention&mdash;I think they are right and I made the point on Second Stage&mdash;that the grants suggested are too small&mdash;each one of them, the £300, the £175, as the case may be. In answer to that, and in order to supplement the grants, the USI suggest that tuition fees ought to be remitted for students obtaining this grant. They estimate that the cost of this on average would be about another £70 a year per student, and they make the point&mdash;and I shall refer again to the third contention of the students&mdash;that tuition fees should be remitted in full for recipients of grants. They say that the estimated expenses of a student are: fees, average £70; accommodation, £176&mdash;32 weeks at £5 10s a week; meals, £91 10s&mdash;32 weeks at £3 per week. This totals £335 5s. This does not include expenses for books, clothing, pocket money, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>This is a modest figure. On the Second Stage I suggested that a student might well have to calculate his expenses on a 40-week basis, not 32 weeks, allowing for the necessity for reading and working for examinations.</P>

      <P>I do not think I am being unique in this respect, but I take your point. I think the point in question has been sufficiently made. The third point in this submission by the USI states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus, as it stands, the size of the <Col N="1040" /> grant is insufficient to cover even the basic costs of the poorest student.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great confidence in the capacity of the Minister to convince his colleagues that the money required for this particular scheme takes a very high priority. I recognise that the present Minister and his predecessor have succeeded in gaining financial recognition for the requirements of education well beyond what was gained before. Let me say, in parenthesis, that when the Minister was driven reluctantly into paying tribute to Fianna Fáil Ministers for Education, I think the facts in some measure justify what he said. I do not think any of them have gone far enough, but I do remember the Fine Gael Minister for Education in the inter-Party Government telling me that if you had an oral examination in Irish in the leaving certificate it might be the last straw which would cause the collapse of the whole educational system. Therefore, though I have <Col N="1042" /> great reluctance to hurt the feelings of opponents of the present Government, and am even more reluctant to soothe unduly the feelings of the present Government, I feel that when the Minister was reluctantly obliged to compliment his own Party, there is a certain amount of justification for what he said. It may be that in saying this I am out of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Close the bracket. The third claim made by the USI is an excellent one, and it is quite simple. It is that tuition fees should be remitted in full for recipients of a grant. They make the point that this is a very easy way of helping the recipients without in any way handicapping the universities. They give in the first paragraph various expenses of a student, and they go on to say that the size of grant is insufficient to cover even the basic costs of the poorest student. The amount that they say this would take is the sum of £735,000. I am not competent to judge how near accuracy that figure is but I feel that this is something to which the Minister should give attention. Under this section he is given full power to modify schemes and to take into account the necessity for doing this. If it were granted, and I think it probably ought to be granted, that £300 a year to a student whose home is outside a university town is not enough for him to live as a university student without having a supplement to his income, if that is granted, then a neat way of making up the additional sum would be to have tuition fee remission to each of these grant-receiving students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point that the USI ought to have added, and I am afraid have failed to add, is a point that I also made on the Second Stage. It is that the Minister in calculating the sum to be granted of £175 to a student who is living in a place adjacent to a university town and £300 to a student living in a university town, does not take any account of the loss of potential earnings which would allow such <Col N="1043" /> a student if he, instead of becoming a student, were to have entered industry, commerce or agriculture, to contribute to the family income. In other words, it does not allow for loss of potential income, which means loss of potential contribution to the family income. Therefore, the smallness of this sum, and the failure to recognise that this means that class division will, to some extent, still remain even among the receivers of grants. This is a very important point. We could put it briefly in one sentence: some students will be unable to afford the luxury of accepting these grants&mdash;that is a very important fact&mdash;by reason of the fact that their family conditions are so poor, and the numbers of younger children in the family so great, that the family requires a financial contribution from them immediately they leave the secondary or vocational school, and that consequently they cannot afford to accept these grants.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister well enough to know that if there are any deficiencies in this scheme the one about which he is least satisfied is this. I am quite sure that this is something which concerns him, and I should like to feel that under the provisions of section 2 the Minister will devise some way of having a further inner means test which will enable him to give additional grants to people who might, owing to loss of potential contribution to family income, otherwise be prevented from accepting the grants here offered.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that there should be some test at the end of the first or second year, by the universities, of these grant-receiving students, to see how well they are doing. It was suggested by some that they might be penalised if they were not doing well. I will not repeat what I said on this matter on Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Perish the thought. However, instead of thinking in terms of penalisation, could we not think in terms of reward? Could we not say that those who passed with unusual merit might have that merit recognised <Col N="1044" /> by a bonus grant? I am against penalisation and punishment, and I feel that we would get far more from reward and compensation than from penalisation. I put this idea before the Minister in the confident hope that he will give it further consideration.</P>
      <P>Finally, I come to the question of the means test and I should like to acknowledge that in speaking on another Bill I made a mistake which was corrected by Senator O'Kennedy. I said that the limit was over £1,800 for a man with ten children. That is incorrect, a man with ten children can have up to £2,500 and still be helped. The £1,800 limit applies to the man with one child. I can see why a means test is being applied, it is for financial reasons, but I am wondering whether it is really necessary. The original motion put down by some of my colleagues was that university education should be free for all those who could benefit from it. I have a preference for that principle, and perhaps the Minister could consider, as a long-term proposition, whether he could eventually abolish the means test.</P>
      <P>If he does not do this the situation arises that four honours are equal to two honours plus money. In other words, you can buy two honours.</P>

      <P>We are making it three in Trinity College from next September, and this is a good thing. One of the big defects in Trinity College and indeed in the NUI is that we subject applicants to two tests, one intellectual and the other financial; and the financial test is so severe that many people who would benefit greatly from a university education do not get in. That makes us rather embarrassed, the fact that four leaving certificate honours will equal two honours plus the money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Nash is quite right, I said &ldquo;three or four honours&rdquo;. I have since received <Col N="1045" /> many letters and phone calls from former friends and contemporaries in Trinity College, who said that in that case they would never have got into college! These fears are exaggerated. I feel now that three honours is a minimum, and I should be quite happy to accept four honours as a minimum. This being so, under the Minister's scheme, anybody with these four honours would get a grant, but the means test will still apply, and I should like to look forward to the day when it will be abolished.</P>
      <P>This would mean a considerable advance in the amount of money which the Minister is prepared to pay for higher education, but I do not think the Minister or his predecessor were reluctant to spend money, and I feel that this Bill and this section, which is important step forward. It represents only half a loaf, but I am strongly of the opinion that half a loaf is perceptibly better than no bread.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The point which I raised previously and to which the Minister has failed to reply adequately is the change in the requirements for the grants. If one reads the Bill and the regulations, it is obvious that the original intention was to make provision for people getting the grants even if they had not actually got the leaving certificate. It was not required that they should pass the leaving certificate. What was required was that they should reach such standard as was prescribed by the Minister. If it was the intention that they should pass the examination the Minister would have said that the requirement was that they should pass the leaving certificate examination and reach such standard as was prescribed by him. The omission of the requirements of passing the examination can scarcely be without significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording of this document is most circumlocutory. The normal thing to have said was that if you pass the leaving certificate examination and obtain at least four university matriculation subjects you will get the grant. The position now is that a student who took the Minister at his word this year <Col N="1046" /> and decided that he could get a grant to enter Trinity College which does not have the Irish language by passing in five subjects now finds that he cannot do this.</P>

      <P>I raise one point on which I should like the Minister to give some views. What is the Minister's attitude towards having the leaving certificate repeated for the purpose of attaining four honours the following year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people would do it. It depends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister want to encourage that or would he look to the future when such a student could go to the university and get into the scholarship stream by his performance in the university?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>You must have a qualification and decide on it. That is one of the things we are positive about here. There must be a standard in the leaving certificate examination. We have written that into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the advice we, as legislators, have to give to students who qualify on the income <Col N="1050" /> level and who fail to get four honours next September is that they should go back and try for another year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That obviously depends on the calibre of the student. I would say a student of 17 years with ability to do it would probably do it the following year. It depends on the age in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think from our experience we would much prefer to get such a student into the university system and let him take his chance on a first year examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a subject for discussion. I know we are broadening the terms of discussion but there are various views on that. Our entry age to the university in Ireland is in my view rather too low and that is the purpose of proposing the advanced leaving certificate, that we will have this specialised extra year where the students can specialise in particular subjects and then be in a position at 18 years to go into the university. On the continent the average age of entry is around 20 years. Ours is 17 and is probably a year too low. That is my own view and is also the view of educationists. We have had a long debate on this particular section. Senator Sheehy Skeffington mentioned a number of matters. There is no doubt that what he says is tantamount to the idea. I would like to see all of what he said implemented. For the present, within our financial resources, we are making a start in this Bill. It is not possible from the financial point of view to start to go retrospective. As I said earlier, the implications could start mounting and we would be talking in terms of hundreds of thousands and we could go into millions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could do social injustice if we go on to selecting people who are in universities from last year and the year before and the year before as against people who did not get a chance to go to the university. In terms of social justice if anybody deserves help, it is the person who by reason of his bad economic circumstances in the past few years, could not not get to university, whereas there are people who did <Col N="1051" /> get to university. Although their parents made that sacrifice, at least they were in a position to make an attempt at it within their resources.</P>
    <P>If you start thinking in terms of social justice and start thinking of retrospection, there is no end to how far you could go back or where you might stop, and you could run into expenditure of millions. In any progressive measure of this kind we are bound to have these difficulties arising. You are bound to have people who see they have not come in under the scheme and who will naturally complain and seek to come in. You have to set a deadline. People in the previous year will start to complain and then the people in the year before, and the year before that, and so on. Where do you start and where do you end?</P>
    <P>At least we have made a start. We are bringing in people who by reason of their circumstances would never see the light of day in an institution of higher education, and we are bringing people who have talent under the Bill. I deliberately left the section flexible so that if hardship cases, or any cases, arise where I can adjust matters in people's favour they can be adjusted in the future. That is the importance of not having too strict terms here in section 2. The whole purpose of it is that I can adjust the income limits, adjust the standard qualifications, adjust the type of institution for which a boy or girl can qualify. I agree that in time to come we will have to start adjusting the income categories here. I know there will be cases. I know of cases who are outside the income categories here and, mind you, the people concerned are not that well off. I agree with everything said about it in this respect.</P>
    <P>I regard this only as a start and I made that plain in the Dáil and Seanad. As far as I am concerned it is only a start, and I hope future Ministers for Education will do the same thing. I would hope year in year out that whoever occupies the chair of Minister for Education would regard it as one of his cardinal duties to make sure pressure is maintained on the Exchequer to release the necessary funds to expand <Col N="1052" /> and extend this Bill to cover a wider range of boys and girls in our community. That I am certain will be the approach in the future. This particular section, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington said, is the key section, and it is deliberately drafted in that flexible way to allow for a humane approach, to allow for extension and expansion of it in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could raise one other query with the Minister. So much of this is governed by regulation, and so on, especially under subsection (a), the standards that will be required&mdash;whether four honours or three honours and, more important still, whether an honours at 90 per cent counts the same as an honours at 60 per cent. In other words, will you weigh the honours? I think you should. It is something we cannot go into in a long discussion here and on which we could not reach finality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentMcHugh" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In line 7, before &ldquo;in&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;from the rates only&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to assure the Minister that <Col N="1054" /> I speak not as an academic but as a county councillor, and as such I can make my case somewhat more easily than my academic colleagues have made theirs in the past few hours. I am aware that the Minister has made it clear, as stated on Second Reading, that the local authorities will pay only the net amount. Senator Quinlan said here this morning that ministerial assurances are not worth a whole lot, and while I would not like to see the Minister leaving his present position&mdash; although I would not mind seeing all his colleagues leaving their present positions&mdash;nevertheless what he said is quite true, in the light of assurances given in the past. Some of us in local authorities have had rather unhappy experiences with ministerial assurances. I could remind the House and the Minister of what Ministers assured us about the Health Act. It is only two years ago since we were assured that the charges under the Health Act were to be frozen, but we found the following year that they were not frozen, and the next year, and this year they are not frozen either. I would not like to take the Minister's assurance that the costs will be the net costs of the scholarships. The Bill is very specific and says that a council shall provide in each local financial year towards the cost of making grants by it each year from the council's gross amount. This Bill says that they shall provide the same as they provided in previous years. Officials in Clare County Council are quite worried in spite of the Minister's assurances that this is flexible because the wording is not flexible. It says that the councils must provide the gross amount. After that they can be recouped by way of a grant. As I see it, this wording is quite specific: they must provide the same as in the previous year. The explanatory memorandum says also that the total annual local authority contribution shall be the figure allocated by them in the local financial year ending on 31st March, 1968, but the total allocation by the county council in the financial year ending on 31st March, 1968, was the gross amount. I would ask the Minister to insert, as I have it in my amendment, the words &ldquo;from the rates only&rdquo;. This would ensure <Col N="1055" /> that the councils would only provide the net amount. While we have the Minister's assurance that they will be asked to provide only the net amount, the Bill says quite clearly that they shall provide the gross amount. I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment and remove from the county councils the worry that in years to come they will be asked to provide the gross amount they have provided in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider it, but this matter came up after the publication of the Bill in the Dáil on Committee Stage. We actually redrafted it, and it is only a drafting point, to make sure that the Senator's point of view was met. It is purely drafting, and one would want a wet blanket for a while to go into it. As I see it, I think it is quite clear that the Senator's intention is met, particularly when you look at the phrase in the third line about the sum provided by the local authority in the local financial year ending 31st March, 1968. The phrase is: &ldquo;The sum provided by it&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentMcHugh" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">

    <Speaker pid="VincentMcHugh" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>They must provide the amount before they know the recoupment, long before they know the grant. For instance, Clare County Council provided £16,000 and they got a recoupment afterwards of almost £8,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you look at it, it is quite clear that it is not the gross sum provided for in the local financial year. The gross returned for recoupment comes up and in fact the sum provided by the local authority is the net sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentMcHugh" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authorities interpret the word &ldquo;provide&rdquo; as meaning to provide or make available the gross amount and if you speak to a local authority official and ask him: &ldquo;What do you provide?&rdquo;, he will tell you &ldquo;the gross amount&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I can see the validity of what the Senator is saying, but the sum provided by a council in any financial year in respect of assistance to university fees is the sum provided by it in that local financial year ending on that date, which is the net amount because the recoupment has been effected in respect of that financial year. Actually, we improved the drafting in the Dáil to meet the point.</P>

      <P>I hope they are moving to that. I have had the advice of the draftsman on this particular point, and between Second Stage and Committee Stage in the Dáil we clarified the section with the phraseology just mentioned to make certain it was the net amount. The draftsman's advice and his office's advice as far as I can see it in plain English is that it can only be the net amount so I think the Senator can accept the assurance that there will be no intention to extract from the local authorities any more than the net amount.</P>

It seems to me that it makes it perfectly clear to say &ldquo;from the rates only&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I think that there is something in what Senator McHugh says because when the assessments are made, it is this amount that has been provided at that point of time which is involved. The general expectancy is that you will get recoupment from the Department, but it could also happen that the Minister might write to the council and say that because of one thing or another, he had decided not to make any recoupment in that particular year. That never happened, but if this is to be interpreted strictly, as most councils provided without any conditions, it would have to be held that this was the amount they did provide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It occurs to me now, looking at it more closely again, that the Senator's amendment would tend to make the situation worse in that he is seeking to insert &ldquo;from the rates only&rdquo;. Recoupment is not from the rates, and if you take from the rates only, you would lead to a situation in which it was not from the rates only, but the gross amount, whereas if <Col N="1058" /> you leave out &ldquo;from the rates only&rdquo;, the word &ldquo;provided&rdquo; means what the local authority has provided in the current financial year and what it has provided net.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>Before section 5 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) The Minister shall as soon as possible after the passing of this Act prescribe by regulation a scheme to carry the provisions of this Act into effect and shall publish the scheme in such a manner as to bring the provisions thereof to the notice of persons intended to be benefited thereby.</P>
      <P>(2) The Minister may from time to time amend or otherwise alter the scheme made under subsection (1) of this section and shall publish such amendments and alterations in due time and in an appropriate manner.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 5 proposes a rather complicated procedure whereby the scheme will be drawn up by the local authorities and sent to the Minister for confirmation, amendment, <i>et cetera.</i> The Minister has indicated in the course of the discussion that he has already proposed a model scheme which he has circulated to the local authorities and that they in turn can return the scheme to him. In the course of the debate yesterday the Minister used the revealing words &ldquo;This is our scheme which they will have to adopt.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to get away from the circuitous manner in which the Bill prescribes the making of these schemes. We will all agree that one of the features of this Bill which commends itself to us is that we are getting away from the disparity of the scholarship schemes which has existed as between one local authority and another or one county and another, and that we shall have uniform standards throughout the country. The Minister obviously intends that if there are disparities between schemes sent up by the different local authorities he <Col N="1060" /> will take steps to harmonise them to ensure there will be no discrimination in the making of grants between applicants living in the different local authority areas, discrimination merely arising from the place of residence of the grant-applicant.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the reasonable thing is that the Minister should make the scheme. The clear-cut thing to do is for the Minister to make his scheme. On Second Stage, the Minister indicated that the local authorities are being retained in the present scheme for the giving of grants because of the convenience which he alleges exists in regard to the checking of means, and he indicated that this is the only reason they are being retained. At that stage I protested this was misuse of local authorities, treating them as mere agents of the central Government. However, in the Bill they remain playing a part.</P>
    <P>It is clumsy and cumbersome that the making of the schemes should follow the routine. If we are to accomplish what the Minister has set out to do, it will be necessary that all local authority schemes should be harmonised together. That is the reason I put down the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the merit in the amendment but on balance I prefer the section as it stands. It is a good thing to have the local authorities involved, though not involved to the degree in which they were heretofore: it is a good thing to have them interested in the preparation of these schemes. They can come forward in the democratic way from their scholarship committees with suggestions and amendments which may be incorporated in a particular way for a particular area or county. That could arise. It is part of the overall flexible approach we have adopted in this Bill that if a particular county suggests that in particular circumstances a certain approach might be adopted in respect of the preparation of a scheme suitable to that county's needs, a case can be made by the county and I can adjust the scheme to suit it. This could conceivably arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we are aiming at a degree of <Col N="1061" /> uniformity and harmonisation, at the same time I would not throw the local authorities and their advice out the door altogether. They have something to contribute and local democracy has something to contribute. Good ideas can come up from time to time from local authorities to suit particular areas and, as Senator Cole suggested, excellent work has been done by scholarship committees attached to local authorities who have had a certain amount of experience and wisdom, gathered during the years in the operation of the old system. Something can be contributed from this direction.</P>
    <P>On balance, it is wiser to leave the section as it is and to realise that while we want to achieve a far higher degree of uniformity, there may be a situation requiring amendment of the scheme in certain circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is significant that the Minister, though sympathising with what is in the amendment, spoke about the conceivable rather than the probable in regard to the future. Perhaps that is not in tone with the general trend of the debate and I shall not complain too much about it. However, we must face the reality of the situation that the Minister will make the scheme. There is no doubt about that. He will make the scheme and in making it he will take into account representations made currently or in the past by local authorities in different parts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I still suggest that for the Minister to make this scheme after consultation would be a neater thing. I believe no service is being done to the local authorities by the pretence that they have powers which they have not got. Local government in this country is weakened in many instances because it appears on paper that they possess powers which they do not possess. That is a great danger for local government in this country. For this reason I should feel far happier if the Minister were able to adopt the direct approach rather than the circuitous approach which camouflages and covers up what is the real situation. However, as the Minister does not appear to be disposed to that I have no wish to prolong the discussion. I <Col N="1062" /> think much of our discussion today has been long enough and accordingly I will with regret if the House agrees withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the local authorities might be of considerable assistance to the Minister in preparing schemes. I know there was one scheme in the past that we prepared in Cavan County Council and I think it was turned down by the universities. We envisaged in this scheme that it might be possible for parents who could not afford to send their child to university&mdash;it will not arise so much in the future&mdash;could mortgage to the county council by land or take out insurance policies that they would pay in future years after the students had left the university back to the university over the years the amount of money that was lent by the county council. The county council apart from the administration of the scheme would not be out of any money at all. That was the scheme that was worked out in great detail largely by the secretary of our county council who is still there and it was turned down possibly by the Department and the universities but it was a first-class scheme and I was very sorry that it did not work. It is possible that there is reason for such a scheme even still in a different way.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>Before section 9 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Every order and regulation made under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas <Col N="1063" /> as soon as may be after it is made and if a resolution annulling the order or regulation is passed by either such House within the next subsequent twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the order or regulation is laid before it, the order or regulation shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under the order or regulation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There has been a very long debate on this Bill today and particularly on section 2 because Members of the House are very concerned with some of the important details of the scholarship scheme. I think it is true to say that if the section which it is now proposed to insert in this amendment had been in the Bill a good deal of the debate could have been avoided, not, indeed, but it has probably been very useful to have a fairly protracted debate on this particularly important Bill.</P>
    <P>The amendment is designed to ensure that the orders and regulations relating to the working out of this rather flexible scheme will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and if any particular order or regulation calls for debate that it should be open to the Members of the Oireachtas to have a debate on it.</P>
    <P>It is heartening to think that the Minister, who is receptive to new ideas, does not think that all wisdom lies in one quarter and that he can find it not merely behind him but all about him. For that reason I think it is desirable that this amendment which would give this House as well as the other House an opportunity of debating the progress of this scheme which to a large extent will be experimental, should be accepted and that the House should have an opportunity of debating the more important details of the scheme as they come to be devised.</P>
    <P>I feel that this particular section which we are proposing to insert here is standard practice in most Bills and I hope that the Minister will not belie his reputation and will accept it and that we can get to the Report Stage of this Bill in a very short time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this amendment I must go against what Senator O'Quigley has just said. The debate earlier on, particularly on section 2, highlighted the necessity for the greatest possible degree of flexibility in measures of this kind. In effect what the proposed amendment would do would be to circumscribe this very flexibility which I think is the major merit in the Bill. Indeed, in the House here Senator FitzGerald mentioned a particular case to me which posed a certain problem which I promised to investigate for him as to whether or not the person concerned would come within the income limits having regard to overtime that this parent specially earned last year in order to put his child into university and now finds that these extra earnings have put him out of the income category. This is the sort of human problem that always arises in this sort of situation. I get letters in the post every day about problems relating to the need for flexibility in interpretation as regards a scheme of this kind.</P>
      <P>I could not possibly devise an order that would cover every type of conceivable situation that would arise in regard to people's income, in regard to qualifications, in regard to whether certain institutions of higher education are to be brought within the scope of this scheme. Senator Cole mentioned the local authorities and Senator Quinlan suggested a particular type of qualification involving a person who might get high honours in particular subjects, not necessarily in four but, perhaps, very high honours in two, showing a particular bent. There are countless problems that will arise in regard to orders and ministerial decisions that will have to be made under a scheme of this kind and that is why we have left it open and flexible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I have to start devising orders to be laid before the House to cover every situation that could possibly arise not only would I be circumscribing myself but I would be circumscribing the humane approach which I want to adopt in regard to this Bill. I want to ensure that if a case of genuine hardship or genuine educational merit is brought before me, as Minister for Education, or before a <Col N="1065" /> successor of mine, that a decision can be made by me and that a particular order or decision can be made which would be in the right direction. I do not think you are helping that sort of humane direction of affairs by asking us to place an order before each House of the Oireachtas in regard to every such decision. Indeed, the old scholarship legislation recognised this sort of flexibility and now when we are bringing in an expansionist Bill I think it would be retrograde to circumscribe the Minister when heretofore he has had this flexibility in regard to scholarships.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House but I am not at all convinced that the Minister is right for the reason that there are certain signposts which the Minister will have to erect and which will have to be observed by those administering schemes. There will have to be a certain standard fixed from time to time. This is a matter which the Minister could easily fix by order or regulation which could be the subject of debate as to whether the standard was too high or too low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other things. The Minister has given an indication in the White Paper as to means. No doubt that will be subject to change and I rather think the Minister must give certain directives to his officials on the matter. While it is true to say that these things must be left in a very flexible condition, this scheme is not going to be administered in such a way that every person worthy of a grant is going to receive it, irrespective of whether he comes within certain broad directives and regulations laid down by the Minister in conjunction with the Minister for Finance. This broad scheme which the Minister will prescribe should be the subject of some comment by Members of the Oireachtas. How are the Members of the Oireachtas to get to know what are the schemes in operation, what are the grants and what are the changes? The only way they can get that information is from some order made by the Minister being laid before both Houses. I thought the Minister would accept the amendment <Col N="1066" /> in order to enable the Oireachtas to know what was going on.</P>

      <P>Everybody has conceded that the Minister is going to be humane and considerate, expansionist and kind, but the officials of his Department and of county councils will have to follow certain broad directives which will be laid down in circulars, and I feel that these circulars should be embodied in the regulations to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Minister has said that under the old scholarship schemes there were no such regulations but I would remind him that the Department of Education is governed by about six Acts of Parliament, and after that everything is done by circular.</P>
      <P>The salaries of teachers and conditions in primary, secondary and vocational schools are all governed by circulars and the Department has a tradition of unwillingness to put anything where it can be examined. One of the reasons the Department is so backward is that they have not been coming before the Oireachtas to get the geeing-up which they require.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to make some <Col N="1069" /> more elaborate provision in the Bill for the setting up of the Bureau which will be the body concerned with the testing of specimens of blood and urine once the Bill is in operation. As I said last night, it is of particular importance that the Bureau should be so constituted, and be seen to be so constituted, that the public will have no difficulty whatever in accepting its standing. That is highly important for the reason that under section 44 of the Bill, the findings of the Bureau will be conclusive evidence as to whether at a particular time a man was drunk according to the blood or urine test.</P>
      <P>Where one finds that a mere certificate of any person is to be conclusive evidence, especially where so much is at stake, we ought to be greatly concerned with the foundations of the body and the establishment of the body whose evidence will thus be made conclusive. For that reason, I am suggesting in the amendment that the order establishing the Bureau should be laid in draft before each House of the Oireachtas. In doing that, I am not at all offending precedents. On the contrary, I can think of many Acts under which very many State bodies of one kind or another have been established and one finds regularly in the Schedules to those Acts the name of the body, with its various functions and powers detailed, but nothing like that is done in this Bill.</P>
      <P>There may be very good reasons for not doing that. The Minister's Department may not yet be in a position to say exactly what functions should be assigned to this body and what way it should be constituted, but I think that when we do not have the powers of the body and other matters relating to its functions set out in a Schedule, as has happened so frequently in cases of bodies of this kind, we should have the draft laid before each House of the Oireachtas and have it approved before it is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, in relation to amendment No. 23, I would like to have the opportunity afforded to the Oireachtas of pronouncing on the acceptability or otherwise of the regulation which will be made to implement sections 27 to 46. As the House will be aware, those <Col N="1070" /> sections are really the heart and soul of this Bill. This is all that is concerned with drunken driving, drunken charges and how those offences will be tracked down. I would suggest that the regulations which will be made to implement those sections, which regulations will be guidelines for the Bureau, for the members of the Garda and for the courts, being so important, and their implementation being a matter of such consequence to the health and well-being of the community as much as to the liberty and freedom of the drivers concerned, should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and a discussion take place on them.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of publicity, the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, was of the view that it is important. I am sure this Minister will have the same view, that the greatest publicity be given to this measure when it is about to be brought into operation. From the point of view of publicity, this Bill has been overshadowed by a major debate on another important topic. I am glad to see the Minister back after his long and arduous wars in another House. It would be no harm before those regulations come into operation if the Minister and Members of the Oireachtas were familiarised with what is contained in this Bill and how it will be implemented. In that way a further opportunity of publicity will be afforded and once this Bill is passed by the Oireachtas, it will be seen by the public&mdash;I anticipate that they will not give rise to any difficulty&mdash;that the regulations are regulations which have the active endorsement of the Oireachtas and it is a good thing that that should be the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree that it would be appropriate to accept these amendments. The making of a regulation or an order is an executive function and not one for either House of the Oireachtas. The case for divorcing the executive function of Government from the law-making function of the Oireachtas is well known. The time of Parliament, it is generally agreed, should not be taken up with the implementation of policies which have been <Col N="1071" /> embodied in law. A degree of flexibility by way of power to make regulations should be allowed in the implementation of policy set out by Acts of Parliament, particularly in relation to matters of a technical nature which are subject to change. For this reason I think it is not desirable that we should provide that the regulations must be ratified by the Houses of the Oireachtas, as is suggested here, that the drafts should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval. I take it that we are dealing with amendment No. 23 as well?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the regulations under section 47, there is a further practical reason why the amendment should not be accepted. If it becomes obvious that the enactment of the procedures and so on to be prescribed in regulations is faulty, it may be necessary to have a minor amendment of the regulations. That could not be done under this amendment if the Houses of the Oireachtas were not sitting. I pointed out that the drafts of regulations made under the 1961 Act are not required to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas although these regulations deal with very important matters. Similarly, the drafts of establishment orders made, such as the Health Corporate Bodies 1961, do not have to be laid before the Houses, and I think it is not desirable that this should be required to be done in this case either. Provision for the making of regulations is a usual one and I think it is satisfactory.</P>

      <P>The Minister has expressed or adumbrated a philosophy that I think must fall as unacceptable on the ears of Members on both sides of the House when he says that the making of regulations and orders is an executive function and not the subject of day to day surveillance of the Houses of the Oireachtas, that the Houses of the Oireachtas should only concern itself with the legislative process. That is a new philosophy and it certainly is an unacceptable philosophy in the context of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1072" /> Let me say straight away that the Statue Books are littered with provisions enabling Ministers to make regulations in draft and to place them before each House of the Oireachtas. There are customs duties. We have had various orders in draft relating to superannuation schemes. We have had orders accepting or including persons who are not insurable under the Act that are laid in draft before the Houses of the Oireachtas. All of these orders are made and this has never in the slightest degree interfered with the executive functions of the Government. I quite see, and I suppose it is the strongest point the Minister can make, that certain regulations are required without amendment. Does everybody not know that the amendment of a regulation is a matter of wearisome months of toil and work in Departments and the idea of a court decision today saying that a particular regulation does not mean everything that everybody thought it to mean and that the Department of Local Government will fall to and produce a regulation in a matter of weeks is something which nobody will believe? That kind of thing will not happen. It has never happened in the past and I think it will not happen again.</P>
    <P>Under the Planning and Development Act we find there was need to amend a regulation in order to prevent the destruction of habitable dwellings at a time when the houses were fit for human habitation, at a time when there was an acute shortage of houses in the city of Dublin. That particular regulation has not yet been amended to prevent local authorities from destroying houses which are habitable. I understand the Minister has some legislation in view to get that done. It is over a year ago since we discussed this particular matter in this House. I remain convinced that there is a need for immediate action. It may be there but one can be certain the action will not be immediate.</P>
    <P>With regard to the 1961 Act, of course every regulation made under the 1961 Act and every bye-law made by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána under the 1961 Act are allowed, if made under regulation by <Col N="1073" /> the Minister, to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. They are laid and they do not have to be approved in draft form. What I am talking about in this particular case is that the particular regulations to be made under sections 27 and 46 are all concerned with a completely new principle in our criminal law and of an order of importance away above anything contained in any of the regulations under the 1961 Act because the regulations will deal with the mode of making these tests, how they will be certified and all the other things which we legislators do not know about.</P>
    <P>Once a certificate is issued to the officer in charge of the Garda station where the person was arrested, if the person is found to have had a quantity of alcohol in his blood in excess of 125 milligrammes per 100 millilitres, the District Court has to do no more than say: six or three months imprisonment, automatic disqualification for one year, and so on. That will be the effect of the oath and that certificate and the regulations under which this certificate is issued and everything concerning this is of an order of importance that transcends anything made in the 1961 Act.</P>
    <P>This is one thing the Houses of the Oireachtas are entitled to be assured of in advance of the regulations being made. We all know of cases where blood samples have got mixed up in well run hospitals. We know of cases even where the wrong leg has been amputated. We know of errors happening. We would all like to know of the kind of regulation that will be made to ensure that these kind of things will not happen. It all boils down to the human act, to the human fallibility or infallibility. It is rather a matter of considerable importance and of this moment Members of the Oireachtas know very little about the whole procedure that will be adopted in relation to blood tests and urine tests.</P>
    <P>It is a clear case for having these orders and regulations laid before the Houses in draft. Also equally important is it that these very regulations which will establish this Bureau should be the subject of some debate to enable some further education of the public to be achieved in the process.</P>

      <P>Notice of intention to make the regulations will, of course, in accordance with the normal practice which is followed in regard to the road traffic regulations be published in advance for the information of the public and to obtain the views of all parties concerned; that is, before the regulations are actually made. When made they will, of course, be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and either House may move to annual them within a specified time. I do not see that it is either necessary or desirable to insist that there must be a debate on these regulations whether or not there is any reason seen to amend them. The intention is that they will, in effect, have public consideration before they are made, and if the regulations which are finally made are then considered to be undesirable the procedure is there to have them annulled.</P>
      <P>There are various safeguards built into the Bill regarding the certificate as, for example, provision giving power to call for a second analysis in section 45 which we will be coming to soon. What I want to make clear is that there are safeguards built into the Bill which can be discussed here at this stage. I think it is completely unnecessary to provide that there will be a separate debate on these regulations whether or not there is any desire to amend them in any respect. They will be published in draft for comment before they are actually made.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister will the Bureau be a body that will be entitled or will be asked to advise the Minister and the Ministers thereafter and publish the findings thereafter in relation to the kinds of situation in which people are more or less inclined to suffer from the effects of intoxicating liquor. We know that there are people with particular kinds of diseases or that kind of thing who may be more easily affected by small quantities of liquor than other people. Many people get into trouble simply because they do not know what is good for them or what they are doing in taking particular drugs in conjunction with alcohol, whether that will make them more quickly intoxicated or not. Whenever I am prescribed drugs, of the milder character I hope, by doctors, I always ask: &ldquo;Can I have my drink?&rdquo; So that if one wants to know if this is going to affect one this is an area of ignorance among members of the public which I should like to see lighted up, and I wonder if the Bureau will be asked to deal with things of that kind.</P>

I certainly agree that in regard to particular conditions that might make people more subject to being influenced by the effect of the consumption of alcohol, it should be part of the Bureau's function to inform the Minister on such circumstances. I can visualise, the same as Senator O'Quigley, that the Bureau could accumulate valuable information in that respect.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 26 to delete subsection (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment which I move in tribute to the Minister for Local Government. Senators should not look so surprised. I think that the person who is Minister for Local Government at any time, including the present Minister, is a person who is well qualified to handle public funds to the best <Col N="1076" /> advantage and not to use them in a way that would call for adverse comment, and would be economical and sparing in the use of public funds. The Minister for Local Government is provided with large grants which he administers through the various local authorities; he himself is constantly in a position of receiving submissions from local authorities and approving of different schemes and different costings and approving of large expenditure by local authorities.</P>
    <P>In his capacity as Minister for Local Government he has to approve salaries and so on for officials of various authorities. In some cases he has to get in touch with the Minister for Finance in relation to his approval, but certainly once large sums of money are provided for housing grants or roads and so on, I rather think that he is the person who has the final approval and disposal of the particular sum. All the expenses of running this Bureau are not to be at the expense of the general taxpayer. They are going to be paid, if I understand the provisions of the Bill, out of the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>I should be quite happy to see the Minister for Local Government fixing salaries of members of the Bureau and authorising the expenditure of whatever moneys are necessary out of the rate fund. He is quite competent to deal with these matters. I am quite content to leave it to the Minister for Local Government to do this, and not to have this complete waste of time up and down to the Minister for Finance, where somebody in the Department of Finance in order to main his superiority or that of the Minister for Finance over that of the Minister for Local Government, writes down messages and memoranda and goes pin-pricking about an expenditure of £10 or £5 here and there, and wanting to bring certain salaries into line with other salaries in the State service and so on.</P>
    <P>One can immediately see that when they start to fix the salary in order to get it in order, if the Minister for Local Government begins to fix a salary for the Director of the Bureau the Minister for Finance&mdash;and, of course. I am <Col N="1077" /> always referring to his subordinates who do these things&mdash;will then write to the Minister for Local Government and say: &ldquo;That is much higher than we are giving to the State Analyst&rdquo;. It may not be possible to get the kind of man the Minister wants to be the director at the salary now paid to the State Analyst&mdash;I do not know what the salary of the State Analyst is or what it is likely to be for the director. This gives rise to a complete waste of public time. I am satisfied to leave it to the Minister for Local Government to determine these matters in the same way as he has determined and sanctioned the expenditure of large sums of money every week. For that reason I move to delete subsection (3) which requires that the Minister will have to go round to the Minister for Finance and seek his approval to do things that he is quite competent to do and on which he has knowledge which no Minister for Finance can have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>What Senator O'Quigley says may sound very attractive at first sight to other Ministers, but the fact of the matter is that we all know in our hearts and souls that there is need for somebody to take an overall view on this matter of wages and salaries, and there has been considerable criticism about the processes of leap-frogging that result from the independent fixing of salaries and wages and their increase by, for instance, different State-sponsored bodies. I think that it must be obvious that somebody should take an overall view of this matter of salaries and wages in the public sector generally. The Minister for Finance is the obvious person to do that. If individual Ministers are to fix salaries without any reference to the levels obtaining in other comparable employment, chaos may result, and I think there should be somebody to compare like with like in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, if a situation such as Senator O'Quigley has suggested arises where a person cannot be got, then obviously there will be consultations between the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance with regard to the fixing of a more realistic rate for the particular <Col N="1078" /> job in question. But attractive though it might seem to me as Minister for Local Government to be able to decide on my own, I as a member of the Government must appreciate that it is, in fact, highly desirable that there should be this overall responsibility vested in the Minister for Finance. I might occasionally feel impatient about it myself, but, on the other hand, I can see that it would not be desirable if every Minister acted completely independently in this respect.</P>
    <P>It would be very hard to control expenditure unless there was this overriding responsibility vested in the Minister for Finance. I do not think that what Senator O'Quigley has suggested is feasible in these circumstances. There is no question of superiority at all. It is just a question of somebody having an overall view of the whole situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The British are constantly having a look at their Civil Service and its procedure and the latest to have come out is a report on the Civil Service, the Fulton Report. No doubt we shall have something analogous to that from the Devlin Committee but it will be a pale reflection, no doubt, of the Fulton Report. What I am concerned with is the avoidance of waste of time and I am not at all convinced by what the Minister has said because there is not any necessity to have the Department of Finance or the Minister for Finance poking a finger into every State or semi-State body. There is the example of the block grants given to the ESB, Bord Fáilte and others. They fix their salaries without reference to anybody. CIE, subsidised to the tune of £2 million annually, fix their salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The boards of these companies are expected to act responsibly. We can trust the Minister for Local Government to fix the salaries of members of the Bureau. The Minister spoke about the leap-frogging that took place in the public service, and, of course, the real cause was the Department and the Minister for Finance because it was the Department of Finance the first day who erected this important principle of maintain the differentials. Differentials <Col N="1079" /> had to be maintained between clerical officers and executive officers, then between clerical officers and national teachers. Other people got increases and others said: &ldquo;We must maintain the differentials.&rdquo; That is how the leap-frogging began and that is the kind of cod that goes on in our public administration. I thought the time had been reached when the Minister for Finance in charge of the administration of the public service would be prepared to delegate authority. In a case of this kind, involving a body of this sort, the authority should be delegated to the Minister for Local Government. However, the Minister for Local Government is a more humble man than I thought he was or a more loyal man than he need be.</P>

      <P>I am very glad the Minister has resisted the blandishments of Senator O'Quigley. I served 17 years on the Committee of Public Accounts and I know that nothing gives more trouble than block grants, grants-in-aid, which have diminished responsibility in Government. Nobody can answer for how the money was spent. Now, this is the one bit of the Bill which gives me great pleasure to see the Minister coming in with. I am basing that statement on experience of the Committee of Public Accounts, but to compare it with what is happening in England, in that enormous democracy, is quite a mistake. Comparatively, this country is small enough still to keep a firm finger on the expenditure of the taxpayers' money and I am glad it is being continued here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised to hear Senator O'Quigley stating that it was the Minister for Finance who established this principle of the maintaining of differentials between different grades. I am not saying the Senator is wrong but I am surprised to hear it. I would have thought staff associations played quite a big part in this. I know that people watch the progress of salaries and wages in comparable employment in other bodies. The whole thing has been the cause of some worry to the Minister for Finance rather than that he should himself be <Col N="1080" /> trying to maintain this position. It is a fact that bodies such as the ESB and CIE have dealt with salaries and wage claims without consideration of their effect on wage structures generally, but even in respect of those bodies it would be more in the national interest if these things could be dealt with on an overall basis rather than individually by each of the State-sponsored bodies. Because of what has happened&mdash;this experience of leap-frogging action being taken by one State-sponsored body affecting wage rates in other bodies and the determination of staff associations to maintain their parity with similar types of employment&mdash; there is an obvious reason why there should be somebody to take an overall view of the whole matter.</P>
      <P>Certainly, in so far as the State services are concerned, the Minister for Finance is the obvious person to do that, and though this may involve a certain amount of delay and frustration for individual Ministers, I think it is a good and very desirable principle.</P>

      <P>In line 36, to delete &ldquo;wilful&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is to delete the word &ldquo;wilful&rdquo; from the phrase &ldquo;wilful neglect&rdquo;. What is being provided for in the section is that no action or other legal proceedings shall be taken against the director except in cases of wilful neglect or default. I understand what &ldquo;neglect&rdquo; means and I understand what &ldquo;negligence&rdquo; is but I am sometimes at a loss to know what &ldquo;wilful negligence&rdquo; is. One is either negligent or not. One is negligent if one does not take care and if one does not take care it is because one positively refused to take care or omitted to do something. I do not wish either to protect the director from actions by leaving the word in or to make him more liable by taking it out and for that reason I think we should take it out as an unnecessary word in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If this amendment <Col N="1081" /> were accepted it would mean that all negligence arising from the analysis of samples could be a cause for proceedings. This would not be fair to the staff of the Bureau who would be required to carry on the work with the threat of a court action for the least error. It is normal practice in the case of such bodies to provide the maximum protection against legal action for the officers of the body concerned. There is, of course, nothing to stop any person taking action for any negligence against the Bureau itself as distinct from the individual officers of the Bureau.</P>
      <P>In fact section 42 was already amended in the Dáil. I moved an amendment in deference to points expressed by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Fitzpatrick. Up to then the section conferred protection on the Bureau as a body as well as its members and officers. The amendment I moved in the Dáil removed the protection from the Bureau as a body but retained protection for the members. I think that is desirable and it was accepted in the Dáil. It was accepted as desirable that the members should only be liable for wilful neglect and that any neglect can be a cause of action against the Bureau as such. Therefore, I think the public have sufficient means of redress in the case of neglect of any kind. It is surely desirable that the actual staff of the Bureau should not be working in conditions of having a threat of court action hanging over them in the case of making any simple and human mistake.</P>

I think it an extraordinary thing to put a public servant in a position such as this where somebody comes round to the laboratory making inquiries about such and such a sample and asking who did it because he wants to take an action against him.

I would imagine that there would very seldom be a case where action would be taken against the Director or an individual officer or member of his staff because it would be only in a case where it would be possible to show wilful neglect that this could be done. It is not easy to imagine a case in which that would be necessary and I would say that in the normal course, any action that would be taken for negligence would be taken against the Bureau rather than against an individual. I must say I do not see an awful lot of reason for having it in myself.</P>

The Minister will pardon me and I am sure the House will be indulgent with me if I say I did not know the Bureau was liable to be sued because in all of these statutes where one of these bodies is constituted, the characteristics of the new body are set out. One of the things is that they can hold land. I do not know if we have it here. Another is to say that they can sue and be sued in their corporate name. Once there is somebody amenable to a member of the public who may be injured as result of the negligence of some member of the Bureau I am quite happy. Accordingly, I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>On the section, and this is what is bothering Senator Cole, if somebody has been wrongly convicted because in fact he did not have 125 milligrammes, that would probably arise in the kind of case where if somebody had got another sample and had it analysed by another independent scientist. That may not happen always. It may turn out in some other court case that the certificate issued in respect of a person of perhaps the same name is well below the 125 milligrammes, whereas in the other case it was probably 130 or 145. In that case the person who had been convicted and who believed he should not have been would be put on notice and begin to make inquiries. That is the kind of situation one could envisage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One knows that in the Land Registry not infrequently names on folios get mixed up and one has to apply to the court to have the folios rectified. What is important, and I wonder if the Minister can give any indication, is supposing somebody genuinely believes that he was not drunk but nonetheless a certificate has been issued by the Bureau stating that he was above the <Col N="1084" /> prescribed quantity. If he has good reason to believe that he was not drunk, will he be given any kind of access to the documents for a particular period? If somebody should then take an action against the Bureau and if there should be an order made for the discovery of documents, will the Bureau in that case be entitled to plead privilege and say: &ldquo;No, we will not produce these documents&rdquo;? I rather think that under the Bill as it stands they should not be entitled to plead privilege but I can well see them attempting to gain privilege, and of course that will entirely frustrate in a particular case the person who believes he has been injured.</P>

      <P>If he so requests, he or any person nominated by him may be present while the analysis and determination are being made, and if a certificate issued following the second analysis and determination specify a lower level of alcohol than that specified in the original certificate, the original certificate will be read as if the lower concentration of alcohol were specified in it.

      <P>The only thing I want to ask the Minister is with regard to where the section says:</P>
      <P>A certificate expressed to be issued under section 43 (1) shall, without proof of the signature of the person purporting to sign the certificate or that that person was the proper person so to sign, be sufficient evidence in any legal proceedings of the matters certified in the certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister ensure that when certificates are signed the signature will <Col N="1086" /> be legible? When it comes to the signature on some certificates it is just a bit of a mark and one sees from this that it is not the name of any person. I can see this matter being raised in court as a last line of defence if it is not clear to anybody looking at it that the signature is that of a certain person.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Where the defendant gives evidence to establish that the provisions of this section have not been complied with, unless he wishes to do so, he shall not be asked and shall not be required to give evidence about any other matter.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 46 the defendant is going to be entitled to show that certain sections <Col N="1087" /> of the Bill were not complied with. It is provided for in subsection (2) that in any prosecution for an offence under section 49 or 50 of the principal Act or under section 30 (3) or 33 (3) of this Act, it shall be presumed until the defendant shows otherwise that the requirements of this section have been complied with. What the section is doing is taking as done according to law all the various things in relation to the giving of a caution and the taking of samples. In a particular case the defendant may say that the law was not complied with and may give evidence of that fact.</P>
    <P>What I want to ensure in the amendment is that if the defendant wants to go into evidence that he was not given a proper caution or that the doctor taking the sample gave up because the man withdrew his hand once or twice although he did not, in fact, refuse to give the sample, and if he wants to give evidence of that fact he is entitled under section 46 to go into the witness box and so give evidence, but I am trying to provide that if he goes into the witness box and gives evidence of that fact he shall not be cross-examined in relation to any other aspect of the case. Under the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act of 1924 when an accused person goes into the witness box he is open to cross-examination on every aspect affecting the charge. Sometimes it can be unfair to subject a prisoner to that for the reason that the onus of providing his guilt lies upon the State.</P>
    <P>If a person wants to disprove a preliminary matter he should not be subject to cross-examination as to where he was, whom he met and what he did. I think it is in accordance with our admirable code of criminal law that he should not be open to cross-examination on any matter outside the particular aspect which he is trying to disprove in evidence. In prosecutions under the Road Traffic Act 1961, in order to convict a person of dangerous driving a notice of intention to prosecute must be served on the accused person within a specified period or he must have been given an oral warning at the time of the act of dangerous driving with which he is charged. It is assumed <Col N="1088" /> under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, that such a notice was obtained or such a warning given until the defendant proves the contrary.</P>
    <P>In a particular case if it can be established that such a notice was not served or a warning given the charge will be dismissed. It is an absolute prerequisite that the notice should have been given. If in a particular case the accused person says: &ldquo;No, I was never served with a notice to prosecute&rdquo; or &ldquo;I was not given any warning&rdquo;, as the case may be, if he wants to go in and establish that he should not be cross-examined about where he was, what he said to somebody at the time or anything else like that. As the law stands, he is open to cross-examination on many other matters and thereby may convict himself out of his own mouth when, in fact, he should be entitled to establish that the State has failed to comply with the prerequisite essential of conviction. Consequently, I want to maintain the system of fairness to accused persons, that such a characteristic of our system of criminal law exists and in the amendment I want to provide that he should not be cross-examined on any matters outside those matters which he challenges and is entitled to do so under section 46.</P>

      <P>The legal advice I have obtained in regard to this is that there is no need for the amendment, that the court would not allow cross-examination such as is envisaged by Senator O'Quigley. If it would, its decision could be quashed by a higher court so acceptance of this amendment would imply if it were not for this provision being inserted here that he could, in fact, be so cross-examined. That being so, and for that reason only, it is considered undesirable to accept this amendment. I certainly agree that the position should be as Senator O'Quigley says and I am advised that that is the position without this amendment. If Senator O'Quigley insists, I suppose there is no great objection to incorporating this provision in the Bill but I understand if so it would require to be re-drafted from what is there now. If Senator O'Quigley still thinks it should be, I <Col N="1089" /> would be prepared to have it re-drafted before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister is sympathetic with the view I put forward. I can only tell the Minister that I had the misfortune of having a person I was defending given notice of intention to prosecute and the judge ruled contrary to my submission that he should not be cross-examined. The judge ruled that he was liable to cross-examination on each matter in relation to the charge. I had that experience. I did not have in court on that particular occasion the particular Act to which the judge referred. I checked later and found it must have been one of the Criminal Justice Acts of the 1950s. There is no doubt when a person gives evidence on his own behalf that he should not be cross-examined. I thought it was the Criminal Justice Act of 1924 which I have but it must have been the Act of 1951. I checked up afterwards and I found that unfortunate accused was exposed to cross-examination on every matter to which the charge was related.</P>

As I said, to insert a provision in this Bill stating that this cannot be done would seem to imply if the provision was not there that it could be done. That is the only objection I have to inserting it in the Bill. I am prepared to accept it but I cannot accept it in its present form. I will have to have it re-drafted and we can get that done straight away.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is really to provide for simplicity in the administration of the Act. Here what is being said is that this new section be inserted in the 1961 Act.

This is to avoid the cumbersome reference required in all indictments in regard to charges made by members of the Garda and so on. It is much clearer to say that this is an offence under section 49 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968.</P>

      <P>I think that no matter what the Minister says, this is of <Col N="1091" /> course normal drafting procedure but it is the normal drafting procedure to which we normally object most vigorously and everybody criticises it. Lawyers criticise it; judges criticise it; legislators criticise it. Nobody agrees with this except people in certain quarters, and I think the time has come when we ought to face up to this squarely and say we will not have this kind of thing any longer.

      <P>If Senator O'Quigley were to be consistent, he would object in the same way to the drafting of section 50 of this Bill. Sections 49 and 50 of the Bill, together with the existing section 53 of the Principal Act, will deal respectively with the three offences associated in the manner in which a vehicle is driven. Section 49 deals with driving without consideration for others, section 50 deals with careless driving; and section 53 of the 1961 Act which has also been amended by this Bill deals with dangerous driving. Both sections 49 and 50 do their job, therefore, by inserting their respective provisions into the Principal Act as sections of it. This is reasonable because they merely break up the existing section 52 of the Principal Act into two separate offences. That is what sections 49 and 50 of this Bill do. They break up the existing section 52 into two separate offences and we are proposing that this one should be known as section 51 (a) and that section 50 substitutes a new section for the existing section 52, so that the three driving offences will be sections 51 (a), 52 and 53. Section 50 acts in the same way as section 49, and Senator O'Quigley has not objected to that.</P>

      <P>The Minister has accused me of not being consistent, but to quote the Minister for Finance &ldquo;consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds&rdquo;. Let me say I was consistent and I am quite certain that my amendment of section 50 has got lost somewhere along the line. That has happened. I can advance a better reason <Col N="1092" /> and say I wanted to test the Minister's reaction out on section 49. I think by doing that he accused me of lack of consistency. Then if he takes section 49, I could go along cheerfully on Report Stage and I would have no difficulty at all. On section 50 I considered the amendment and I have no doubt this got lost on the way or I felt this would not be the time in the Bill to deal with it.</P>
      <P>I cannot impress on the Minister too strongly how much he will be criticised and how much all of us will be criticised when this Bill comes to be administered by members of the Garda Síochána, judges and members of the legal profession. There is no doubt whatever that the small efforts I have made to try to amalgamate the amendments with the sections of the old Act would be of some value because these are the sections which will be in use every day in one hundred different places by hundreds of different people. It will be a shocking waste of public time and money referring to section 51 (a) of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as inserted by section 49 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968, and section 52 as amended by section 50 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968, on top of the offences we are dealing with in section 29, the section related to drunken driving, where we will be referring to section 49 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and section 29 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968. There is no sense or meaning, logic or justification, or anything else, for that kind of drafting. I do not blame the Minister personally for this kind of product but I do think he ought to try to see the point of view of those who will administer this.</P>
      <P>It will be physically a waste of time in every Garda station, typing out a charge under section 49 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and section 29 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968, instead of referring to it as a new charge of drunken driving referred to as an offence against section 49 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968, and everybody will know that section 49 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968, is drunken driving.</P>

There will be a waste of time every day in Garda stations, and in District Courts, with clerks having to find out and convince some district justices on section 29 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and section 49 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968. There will be a shocking waste of time and drudgery on the part of all those concerned with its administration. It is for that reason I would suggest to the Minister that he should accept an amendment on Report Stage which will amalgamate the more important and more commonly used sections of the road traffic code, which must be brought into this Bill. I will have two such amendments on Report Stage. I want, after all, information to know sections 51 (a) and 52, or 49 and 50 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968. The Minister should realise that there is a real need for this, and that this will cause a lot of unnecessary work.</P>

      <P>I would like, if this is the appropriate point on the section dealing with driving without reasonable consideration, to ask a question of the Minister on the law relating to stop signs, which are being increasingly ignored by motorists. I have in mind a particular crossroads in Mount Merrion which I have passed daily for years. I stop my car in accordance with the sign but the drivers of the following cars just hoot me out of the way, pull out and go around the corner on the double. They consider that the stop sign is out of date. I recollect a district justice making a statement to the effect that the stop <Col N="1095" /> sign means &ldquo;stop&rdquo; and not just &ldquo;go slow&rdquo; and he imposed a fine on the offender. I also recollect, however, another district justice ruling that one need not stop at a stop sign but just merely be extremely cautious. This has caused a lot of confusion. I have reported this situation to the Garda authorities with particular reference to this Mount Merrion crossroads. I even suggested there is a good harvest of &ldquo;on the spot&rdquo; fines awaiting collection there. The position, however, has remained unchanged for years. I noticed a few days ago that the roadway was strewn with broken glass. This may result in an improvement in the position.</P>
      <P>I would also like to say that I do not think that there is any value at all in the &ldquo;yield right of way&rdquo; signs as they are just ignored. I feel, however, that if the Minister would make a clear statement on the matter of the stop signs, it might prevent serious and even fatal accidents.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> 25. Before section 54, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The wording of an approved policy of insurance shall be such as to be reasonably clear to an insured person what risks are, or are not, covered by the policy. The Minister shall, where necessary, request a person carrying on a vehicle insurance business to revise its form of policy so that its scope and effect shall be clear to the insured person.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suppose that on this Bill it would be a bit unfair to attack the draftsmen of insurance policies for the way in which they word their policies, because all they would have to do is to refer to this Bill and to say that it is not a good example of clarity, but I do not think we should say this or that anybody would try to make that case. I do not know that power the Minister for Local Government has over insurance companies, but there is such a thing as an approved policy of insurance. I do not know to what extent the Minister has anything to do with determining the form of that, but I want to say that even the most expert and learned people, and people who are well qualified in the English language, will find the greatest difficulty in knowing what is included and what is not included in the insurance policies we get. They start off and set out the vehicle insured and then they go on to deal with exclusions and then put down endorsements. There are endorsements attached to policies, and the end result of all the inclusions and exclusions, and exclusions unless, and provided always however that, and so on, is that most people reading the policy could not say for a certainty what is insured and what is not insured. We find that every other day. We know that the reason for this adhering to an outmoded form of insurance policy, and what to many people would appear to be an outmoded method of expression, is that a lot of the expressions contained in the policies have been subject to judicial determination in the courts from time to time. But having said that it seems to me that somebody should have some courage and try to get together a form of policy <Col N="1097" /> and wording which would be intelligible to the average motorist and motor-owner. I do not know whether the Minister would be prepared to accept the responsibility for ensuring that the policy will be reasonably clear to the insured person as to what risks are insured and what are not. I think he should take power at any rate and try, in consultation with the insurance companies, to work out a form of motor insurance policy which would be quite clear as to whether a person is covered for particular risks.</P>
    <P>I am thinking, for instance, of a young lad of 17 or 18 who has a motor bicycle and who wants to find out whether a pillion passenger whom he proposes to carry somewhere is insured. He would certainly not be able to find out from reading his insurance policy whether he is insured or not, and will not be in a position to know without resorting to what the insurance agent told him. I know that pillion passengers are not required to be insured, but if one thought that one was or should be insured, one would find great difficulty in finding out from some of the policies whether a person is insured.</P>
    <P>I do not know the attitude of the Minister towards this or whether he has any power under the Bill which he can effectively use over the insurance companies, but I would hope that he would make some kind of plea to them through the Motor Insurers' Bureau to word their policies in such a fashion that they would be reasonably clear to the average motorist.</P>

      <P>This amendment is not appropriate for consideration under the Road Traffic Act. It is appropriate for consideration in the Insurance Bill or in a consumer protection measure such as that envisaged by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. In so far as the Road Traffic Act is concerned, provisions in relation to motor insurance are designed for the protection of third parties, and the interests of persons taking out insurance are dealt with and fall to be dealt with in the Insurance Acts, for which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible. Provisions of road traffic law are designed to ensure that there is sufficient <Col N="1098" /> in a policy that the interests of third parties are properly protected and that is the only function of the Road Traffic Act in this respect. What Senator O'Quigley requires would have to be dealt with under the Insurance Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>Before section 54, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1099" />&ldquo;(1) Sub-article 2 of article 6 of the Road Traffic (Compulsory Insurance) Regulations, 1962, is hereby repealed.</P>
    <P>(2) It shall be an offence under section 56 of the Principal Act to carry a passenger, or to ride as a passenger, on a mechanically propelled vehicle unless injury to such passenger is covered by an approved policy of insurance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This I consider to be a very important amendment. Its purpose in effect is to protect the third parties the Minister has just spoken about &mdash; pillion passengers on motorcycles. Under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, power is given to the Minister for Local Government to make regulations exempting certain persons from the necessity to have insurance in respect of particular risks or exempting them altogether from the necessity to have insurance because they are able to carry their own risks&mdash; bodies such as CIE, the ESB &mdash; but in regulations which the Minister made in 1962 &mdash; they are the regulations referred to in the amendment: the Road Traffic (Compulsory Insurance) Regulations&mdash; the Minister for Local Government has exempted from insurance a passenger being conveyed by a motor cycle, whether in a sidecar or simply riding pillion.</P>
    <P>The reason this has been done is that insurance companies will not insure pillion passengers or persons driving in sidecars because the risk of accident is so high and the experience has been such that they say: &ldquo;The premiums would be so high that people would not pay them.&rdquo; Consequently the regulation is in respect of the owner of the cycle who can ride on that cycle and be covered for running into somebody, the damage to the person run into being covered by the insurance policy of the cycle-owner. In effect, the regulation says to him: &ldquo;If you run into somebody, the damage done by you will be covered by your insurance policy, but if through your negligent driving, you cause the same injury to the pillion passenger, we do not require you to be insured.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the height of absurdity at a time when we are trying to protect <Col N="1100" /> third parties and to emphasise the need for road safety &mdash; to protect people's lives and skulls and limbs. It is wrong to see legislation in this country allowing a motor cyclist to carry somebody on his pillion when that somebody is not covered by insurance of any kind. If one is driving a motor car and one runs into somebody on the road, the consequences to the person injured are not so great, even though there is no insurances' because under the Motor Insurers' Bureau Agreement made between the Minister for Local Government and the motor insurance companies, there is provision that when the risk was required to be covered by law the Bureau would pay the damages. This happens every other week, but in the case of pillion passengers who are injured on motor cycles which do not have insurance, they can get nothing from the owner of the bicycle, from the driver or from the Motor Insurers' Bureau.</P>
    <P>Consequently, this amendment should be accepted because it provides for the repeal of this article in the regulations which allows the driver of a motorcycle to drive it without having insurance cover for pillion passengers. I want the regulation that allows that to be repealed and to provide that people are not to be allowed to ride motorcycles unless they are covered by insurance. This is in the interest of the section of the community which most requires protection in that respect &mdash; younger people who are most inclined to ride motorcycles and who are inclined to hare away at speed. I want to provide for people whose youth does not make them as wise as they might be and I urge the Minister to ask the House to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the principle of what Senator O'Quigley has been saying &mdash; the desirability of having pillion passengers covered or else making it illegal to carry pillion passengers. However, as I explained in the Dáil, it is not necessary to amend the legislation to do this. If it is decided to do it, it can be done by regulations. In fact, this is under active consideration at present and I am hopeful it will prove possible to amend the regulations <Col N="1101" /> in this respect. As soon as a decision has been reached, I will make public my intention to do it. In the meantime, I ask Senator O'Quigley to withdraw the amendment because if it is possible to do this, it can be done by regulations. The Senator's amendment would also make it an offence for a person to ride as a pillion passenger unless he was insured. It would be impossible for the passenger to ascertain whether there was a policy in existence to cover him or her. I also understand that this amendment, in addition to extending cover to pillion passengers, would make it compulsory for the driver of every motor vehicle to insure himself. This is not the position anywhere. I do not think that is what Senator O'Quigley intended.</P>

      <P>The extension of compulsory cover to pillion passengers can be dealt with by regulations. I am at present investigating the possibility of doing that. I appreciate the problem, I think, just as much as Senator O'Quigley. I definitely think it very undesirable that pillion passengers should be carried unless they are insured but, in present circumstances, they cannot be insured because no insurance company will insure pillion passengers except at a prohibitive price. It is a problem that has to be overcome either by making it illegal to carry pillion passengers or else by arriving at some arrangement whereby it will be possible to insure them. I am hoping to introduce an amendment of the regulations in that regard.</P>

      <P>Before asking leave of the House to withdraw this amendment, I should like to say I am glad to think that, in the eyes of the Minister for Local Government, I am not always wrong. It can be encouraging, at times, to find that. What I should like to say is that, if the Minister is making this particular regulation, I gather from what he said earlier today that there is some kind of procedure whereby he gives notice of the making of such regulations and invites comment on them. Perhaps it is my fault or that of <Col N="1102" /> the advertisers but I have never seen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be glad. It would be useful. I read most of the regulations that are made but I have not seen these particular ones and I should be glad to see them.</P>
      <P>If the Minister cannot arrange with the insurance companies for some form of insurance for them, then, in the interests of the pillion passengers themselves, we must make it an offence for them and we must put the onus on them to ask the person if there is a valid insurance. People might think that that is unreasonable but it is not because, if I am going to drive somebody else's car, I have to find out if that person is insured. It should equally be the law that those who ride on a motorcycle &mdash; which has a very high accident risk for pillion passengers &mdash; be required to find out the position for their own safety. We are concerned with the safety of people. I would go the distance of making it an offence for them to ride if the cycle is not covered against risks in relation to pillion passengers. I do not think the Minister can make that an offence by regulation.</P>
      <P>I would say, generally, on the Bill, that if I were in the Minister's position as Minister for Local Government, then, whenever I would find three or four important matters calling for amendment of the road traffic code I should not delay in bringing in short Bills dealing with important matters. Far from the Minister being blamed for that, I think everybody would commend the attitude that where the law, as drafted, does not meet a situation in an important way the matter should be attended to by legislation. In the case of any legislation of that kind, the Minister may be assured of cooperation on all sides of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This section transfers the power of regulating traffic from the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána to the Minister. This may well be a good thing to do. I certainly have an open mind on the issue and should be glad to hear the Minister on the thinking that lies behind this section. There are aspects of the present traffic control situation that are unsatisfactory. I notice that several new powers are taken here, including, in subsection (2) (b), power to specify rules for the parking of vehicles in public places. This is a matter of very general concern. I do not propose to go into it at length at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to urge on the Minister the desirability of re-thinking in approach and attitude to parking traffic control. Any consultations and discussions I have had with the traffic authorities or, indeed, with other <Col N="1104" /> public officials concerned with traffic suggest that the attitude adopted is not that of how to secure that there is no obstruction so that the traffic flows smoothly but, rather, that of protecting existing interests from disturbance.</P>
    <P>There is a philosophy behind the whole approach to the control of traffic and it has very strangely been expressed in the way the present regulations are administered which favour, even at the expense of the law as it is laid down, the delivery of goods, for example, contrary to Departmental regulations. It is impossible to get a policeman to move any vehicle, no matter how big it may be and no matter how much it may obstruct the traffic &mdash; even if, in fact, there are two such vehicles on opposite sides of the thoroughfare thus reducing two or three traffic lanes to one lane &mdash; because there is the philosophy that trade comes first.</P>
    <P>The Minister might take power to ensure that, in narrow streets which are major traffic arteries &mdash; Grafton Street, Dublin, is an example &mdash; deliveries during the daytime, in defiance of existing traffic regulations and which obstruct the flow of traffic, completely eliminating one or two lanes of traffic, will be prohibited and that deliveries will require to be undertaken, as in major cities of other countries, outside the hours of very heavy traffic flow or, at any rate, if deliveries are permitted during the daytime, that they will be permitted in accordance with the law and that exemption will not be given in these cases.</P>
    <P>The criterion in regard to strictness in traffic control should be the degree of obstruction caused. The whole emphasis at present seems to be to penalise people who park for longer than the allotted time because of the philosophy of getting a ranson on parked cars rather than that of penalising people who obstruct traffic, no matter how badly they may obstruct it. The efforts of law enforcement are directed more towards the matter of how long you have been parked than whether you are obstructing traffic. In many places indeed, the regulations preclude parking where there is not any <Col N="1105" /> great flow of traffic. The emphasis seems to be against parking, to prevent people from parking rather than to facilitate them, to insist that they shall not park for any length of time but not to deal with the problem of obstruction.</P>
    <P>For instance, at the bottom of Leeson Street, you frequently find delivery trucks and cars parked on both sides of the street and obstructing two lanes of traffic but I have never seen any garda move these vehicles on. All they are doing is checking up on whether you have been parked for an hour and a half or two hours where you should only have been parked for one hour. I hope the Minister will adopt a more realistic philosophy and do something about obstruction. I should like to hear also the reasons for this transfer to the Minister and whether he hopes that this will lead to a different approach to traffic control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>What Senator FitzGerald has been talking about is again largely a question of the enforcement of the law by the Garda. No exemption is provided for vehicles that are delivering goods and this of course seems to be purely a question of enforcement. I agree that the main object of traffic bye-laws is to facilitate the movement of traffic and that where people have businesses in narrow streets that are main traffic arteries they should be required to arrange their deliveries so as not to interfere with the flow of traffic. What the Senator is speaking about must be purely and simply the manner in which the bye-laws are enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the reason for the proposed transfer of functions in relation to the control of traffic to the Minister for Local Government; in recent years, with the development of motor traffic, the emergence of the science of traffic, engineering, the growth of international traffic, involving harmonisation of the law in European countries, the formulation of rules of the road must be regarded as a matter of high policy. Some of the issues involved, for instance the question of a change to right hand driving, have even been made the subject of special statutes abroad and in <Col N="1106" /> all countries, so far as can be traced the rules of the road are the responsibility of the Minister and Parliament. In these circumstances, and also in view of the fact that the bye-laws made by the Commissioner may, under an amendment accepted by the Minister when the 1961 Road Traffic Bill was going through, be debated in either House, it is wrong in principle that the bye-laws should be made by the Commissioner, The present division of functions has led to some difficulty because inevitably there is some overlapping between the bye-laws and the regulations made by the Minister and this gives rise to various drafting difficulties.</P>
    <P>The regulations, for instance, require vehicles to be fitted with directional indicators and stop lights and include provision against their misuse but it is the bye-laws which decide whether signals from these lamps are acceptable in lieu of hand signals. Certain vehicles, too, are required to carry advance warning devices but it is the bye-laws which regulate the placing of these on the road. This had led to a certain amount of embarrassment, especially where, as has happened, the regulations are made before the bye-laws.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty is that in the case of bye-laws made by the Commissioner, consultation with interested bodies and the public generally on the lines followed where regulations are made by the Minister is not possible. The Minister could, of course, invite public comment before consenting to the bye-laws but this would put the Commissioner in an invidious position. Again, although the Minister has power to alter bye-laws submitted to him by the Commissioner, to do so openly in a statutory instrument would indicate disagreement and would give rise to debate. The Minister consented to bye-laws made by the Commissioner under section 88, although there may have been some point in those with which he may not have been fully in agreement.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the bye-laws should in fact be made by the Minister although he would consult with the Commissioner in regard to what he intended to do. There is an obvious case for having all these matters dealt with by one authority, the Minister for Local <Col N="1107" /> Government in this case. In regard to the question of the parking of vehicles, in certain places there is an obvious need to confine parking to certain periods but there is no point in doing that if it is not enforced. However, I do not see that this matter in any way clashes with the intention to ensure that the free flow of traffic is not disturbed. I would say that the two things need not in any way be contradictory. The bye-laws dealing with obstruction are, I would agree, more important from the point of view of enforcement. I have no reason to believe that they are not being enforced as well as possible. There may be, I agree, some occasions when there is something amounting to a closing of the eyes when deliveries are being made but this should not be if it is purely a question of enforcing bye-laws, and I agree that people who have businesses in places such as that should be required to arrange deliveries at a time when they will not obstruct the free flow of traffic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not solely a question of non-enforcement. Non-enforcement is certainly a large part of the problem and I hope that the transfer of this authority from the Commissioner of the Gardaí and the vesting of it in the Minister will not weaken the enforcing of laws but will strengthen it. I would urge the Minister to take some steps to ensure that regulations he makes will be enforced and that this kind of leniency in regard to obstruction will not continue. It seems to me that we need two different levels of punishment, on the one hand for people who park too long&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator is going rather far into the question of enforcement on this particular section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to deal with this at length. Enforcement would seem to be relevant as the Minister points out that the problem lies in non-enforcement. We should have two levels of punishment, one at a lower level for parking too long and then a penal punishment for anyone who obstructs the free flow of <Col N="1108" /> traffic. By penal punishments, I mean fines of £10 instead of £1 and different parking signs saying that parking is absolutely forbidden here and anybody parking in contravention of the sign would have to take what is coming to him. That is worth considering and the Minister has, under these provisions here, power to make regulations of this kind. I urge him to do so.</P>
      <P>On the question of vehicles delivering goods, the problem is &mdash; this is something the Garda will tell you quite frankly &mdash; that it is morally impossible, if there is not a law forbidding delivery during certain hours of the day, to prevent anyone delivering goods since the individual garda will not take action because it appears unreasonable to stop goods being delivered when there is no regulation saying that deliveries must take place within specific hours. Unless the Minister regulates deliveries, he will not get around the problem. There is also the problem of delivery vehicles being so very large. The obstruction caused by two delivery vans parked parallel on opposite sides of Grafton Street is quite different from the obstruction caused by two cars parked in the same position. I urge the Minister to consider these particular aspects. They are matters we could, perhaps, discuss in more detail on some other occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just one or two brief points I should like to make. The Minister should give early consideration to restricting different vehicles to different speeds. It seems absurd that a mini-car should be permitted to travel at 80 or 90 miles per hour; that speed may be all right for the bigger type of car which has greater protection in the event of an accident. It is absurd to argue that there should not be different speeds for different types of car.</P>
      <P>Secondly, with regard to traffic signals, some of the signals given by the Garda since the introduction of the baton are not too clear. Sometimes it is impossible to interpret the signal.</P>

      <P>Initially, the intention was to give the authorised officer power, subject to regulations, to make <Col N="1110" /> any requirement and do all the things which appeared to him to be reasonably necessary for the purpose of an investigation. It was thought better to put it beyond doubt that the authorised officer carrying out an investigation had the necessary powers set out in subparagraph (d) (i) and (ii) of amendment No. 27 and this is being achieved by writing them specifically into the Bill rather than having them spelt out in regulations. The powers are obviously necessary if the authorised officer is to conduct an effective investigation.</P>

      <P>In the Schedule there are many amendments being made to the 1961 Act. I shall have something to say about that later. The particular amendment I am concerned with at the moment is where the cost of a folio, which consists of some 72 words, is being raised from 6d to 1/-. I am sorry; this is to enable the Minister to prescribe whatever fee he thinks appropriate for a folio. Why is it necessary to increase this fee so soon after the 1961 Act? Surely things have not gone up so much that it is now necessary to give the Minister this power? While the Minister has no control over the cost of Garda reports, the cost of these reports has increased astronomically over the past few years. With all the latest devices for copying, one would think that the price should tend to go down rather than up.</P>

      <P>Yes. The present charge has been the same since 1933 and it is considered desirable to have this flexibility so that fees may be <Col N="1112" /> changed by regulation from time to time in order to take account of the falling value of money and rising administrative costs. There is no definite intention to do anything at the moment but it is considered desirable to have the power to do it by regulation.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Schedule be the Schedule to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a good deal of criticism on all sides of the manner in which this Bill has been drafted and quite a number of amendments are being effected to a variety of sections in the 1961 Act by the Schedule. In some cases, while they were described as being of no great importance by the Minister in his Second Reading speech, the amendments are quite important, as, for instance, the amendment to section 104 in relation to the service of the notice of intention to prosecute under that section. Indeed, if one were debating this at greater length, one would well urge upon the Minister to drop that amendment altogether because I can see great difficulty attending upon the proof that the accused person at all material times knew that he was going to be charged with the particular offence. Very often, statements are got from people on the basis that they are not going to be charged; the Garda officer induces them to make a statement on the basis that: &ldquo;There might be nothing about this,&rdquo; for the purpose of getting something on his records.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I should like the Minister to do &mdash; I do not know whether he would feel that he can do it but it would be a very profitable exercise &mdash; is to take the various sections of the 1961 Act which are amended by this Schedule and incorporate them all in an explanatory memorandum in their amended form. That was done by the Minister for Justice in connection with the rent restrictions amendments in 1967 and, while it has no force in law, that memorandum has been of the greatest advantage to those who have to operate <Col N="1113" /> or to administer and interpret the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960 and the amendment of 1967.</P>
    <P>If the Minister feels unable to do that because there are so many amendments to so many sections of the Bill contained in this Schedule, the next request I would make to him would be to codify the 1961 Act and his Bill in a consolidation measure at the earliest possible date, especially if he rather thinks that there will not be any amendments to the code of a substantial or numerous character in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the interpretation of the road traffic code, consisting of the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 and 1967, with all the sections that were amended, with the sections that are substituted, with the new sections such as the ones dealing with drunken driving that are contained in this Bill, will be extremely difficult. The only way that an amelioration of the position can be achieved is by doing what I suggest in relation to the Schedule and, in the long term, by bringing in a consolidation measure putting the whole thing into one Act which, as the Minister knows, will not involve the lengthy procedure of Bills going through the Dáil; it can be done quite simply by a consolidation committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, it would be desirable to do what Senator O'Quigley says: at least in regard to the incorporation of all the amendments in an explanatory memorandum and I will consider whether it would be feasible to do that or not. One difficulty that comes to mind is that the provisions of this Bill will be brought in in various sections and stages, at different times, and there may be some difficulty in issuing an explanatory memorandum. It is obviously desirable also that the Road Traffic Act, 1961 and this Bill should be consolidated as soon as possible but it would be presumptuous for me to say that there is not likely to be any amendment within any reasonable space of time. I hope that we have dealt with the matter fairly comprehensively but I should not like to say that with any great degree of assurance. However, I will certainly <Col N="1114" /> consider the question of incorporating all these amendments in an explanatory memorandum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 20, between lines 40 and 41 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution of the following section for section 49:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) A person shall not drive or attempt to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place while he is under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a drug to such an extent <Col N="1115" /> as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle, or while there is present in his body a quantity of alcohol such that within three hours after so driving or attempting to drive, the concentration of alcohol in his blood will exceed a concentration of 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.</P>
    <P>(2) A person who contravenes subsection (1) of this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months or, at the discretion of the court, to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds or to both such imprisonment and such fine.</P>
    <P>(3) Subsection (1) of section 1 of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1907, shall not apply in relation to an offence under this section.</P>
    <P>(4) Where a member of the Garda Síochána is of opinion that a person is committing or has committed an offence under this section, he may arrest the person without warrant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amendment No. I and amendment No. 2 may be discussed together because the same principle is implied in both. On Committee Stage I had amendments down which, due to reasons outside my control, did not appear on the amendment sheet in the way in which I had intended. The purpose of this amendment is to weld the amendments provided in section 29 of the Bill into section 49 of the Act, so as to produce section 49 of the Act of 1961 as one complete whole in this Bill. It is desirable to do this for this reason. This is the new section dealing with drunken driving. The amendment produces in one place in one statute all of the law relating to the offence of drunken driving and indeed brings it into this Part V of the Bill we are discussing, which contains all the other sections relating to drunken driving, with the exception perhaps of being drunk in charge.</P>
    <P>Again, in section 32 we are incorporating part of the provisions of section 50, which is being in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle. We are bringing that into section 32 of the</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> Bill and we are bringing within the framework of the Bill before us in Part V as many as possible of the sections dealing with the offence of drunken driving.</P>
    <P>Whatever force the Minister's argument had on the amendments I had in relation to the careless driving section and bringing them all together in a sort of sequence, these arguments apply with even greater force to the proposed amendment. On the Second Stage of the Bill, there was considerable criticism from all sides of the House of the manner in which the Bill was drafted. The Minister was not here at that time and I do not know whether he has had an opportunity of looking at that portion of the debate. I would hope he would accept these amendments. If he does, I think they will certainly make for a somewhat easier understanding and interpretation of this Act and the Act of 1961.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that in theory an amalgamated section such as is suggested has attractions and, in conjunction with the Parliamentary draftsman, we have given considerable thought to this suggested procedure. But I am afraid the decision has been that it would be better to leave the task of amalgamating the two sets of provisions until the time comes for consolidating the legislation. For one thing, it is doubtful if the consequential results which attach to this type of offence at present would attach to the new offence if this were accepted. In addition, if this were to be done, a lot of other consequential amendments would be required and the ultimate result would be to make the whole thing more complex. While I see the desirability of having it clearer, I am afraid this would not help us. In view of the fact in particular that there would be doubt about the consequential results attaching to the new offence, I am afraid I cannot accept this amendment. In addition it would require a number of other consequential amendments.</P>

      <P>It is a great pity the Parliamentary draftsman did not advert to this at the time the Bill was being drafted originally. This particular document is anything but a tribute to the draftsmanship, whether parliamentary or otherwise. I accept all the Minister says. I have not an opportunity of going into it but I can well see that consequential amendments might be necessary in the Schedule when you are dealing with a Schedule as long as this which is as long as today and tomorrow. I suppose some sections are bound to be lost in it at some stage. I can only accept what the Minister says, that it would have that effect, and in those circumstances, it would be very foolish, imprudent and improper for me to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendments No. 3 and 4 are designed to secure the effect of what Senator O'Quigley proposed on Committee Stage. Amendment No. 4 is in the terms proposed by the Senator on Committee Stage, except for the substitution of subsection (1) in line 2 for &ldquo;this section&rdquo;. That is because there are now three subsections in the section. Amendment No. 3 is consequential and effects in subsection (2) the same change as is effected under Senator O'Quigley's original amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Minister for knocking my amendment into Parliamentary draftsman's language and glad that he has seen his way to accept at least one amendment on this Bill, apart from the others which have been accepted &mdash; Nos. 27, 28, 29 and 30 &mdash; which, I hasten to add, are Government amendments. In order to justify what the Minister has done, <Col N="1118" /> might I say, in fact, that what I said earlier today &mdash; that there was need for this amendment &mdash; is correct because I have since had the opportunity of looking up the Criminal Justice Act of 1924 which provided that an accused person could give evidence in his own defence but it went on to provide that a person charged with an offence:</P>
      <P>...shall be a competent witness for the defence at every stage of the proceedings...provided as follows:</P>
      <P>...(f) a person charged and called as a witness in pursuance of this Act shall not be asked, and if asked shall not be required to answer, any question tending to show that he has committed or been convicted of or been charged with any offence other than that wherewith he is then charged...</P>
      <P>So, he can be asked questions relating to the offence with which he is charged. That was the interpretation put on that section in the case I mentioned earlier this evening where the judge said, in relation to a person giving evidence on notice of intention to prosecute, that once he had gone into the witness box to give evidence on that matter, he was liable to be called on to give evidence on other matters.</P>
      <P>I think the Bill is improved by this amendment which is the type of amendment that would arouse less antagonism to the proposals contained in the Bill in relation to drunken driving which I and, I think, everyone else in the House fully endorse. I am grateful that the Minister has put this amendment into a shape that will fit into the other sections of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 28, between lines 27 and 28, but in section 46, to insert the following new subsection:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few brief remarks I should like to make. I am sorry the Minister for Local Government was unable to be present in the House when the Bill was going through the Second Stage and part of the Committee Stage. I suppose that was not his fault but there are some matters on which I think we should all have liked to have heard him because he has a more immediate grasp of the situation than the Minister who substituted for him. There are one or two matters related to the implementation and administration of the road traffic code to which I should like to draw his attention.</P>
      <P>When churches were built in this country, there was not very much regard for the requirements of the road traffic code because it did not exist in those days, and since the road traffic regulations have come in, in quite a number of cities and towns the position has arisen where willy-nilly the road traffic regulations are contravened Sunday after Sunday. Nobody can do anything about that. People must park their cars somewhere within reasonable reach of churches, and they park contrary to regulations about parking opposite white lines or within 30 feet of corners, and a whole lot of other regulations of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the solution to the problem is, but I rather think that some discretion must be exercised by the Garda authorities in the administration of this Bill in not upbraiding people who must necessarily park their cars in places which constitute an offence according to a strict interpretation of the road traffic regulations. There must be some kind of suspension of that during Mass time. I do not know whether one should do that administratively through the Commissioner <Col N="1120" /> of the Garda Síochána issuing an instruction or whether some saver for that kind of parking should be inserted in the road traffic regulations. I prefer that it should be done in the latter way. If it could be done, it would avoid irritation that is caused to members of the public who are chivvied by members of the Garda Síochána on Sunday mornings because they have their cars parked in a manner contrary to the road traffic regulations. However, there is no clearcut view expressed by the Garda authorities as to what ought to be done.</P>
    <P>In the matter of public interest in road safety, I hope all of us who are in any kind of position to influence the public will set a good example. I regret to say when one looks at the parking of cars around Leinster House, one is not reassured. There are certain regulations laid down by ourselves for the parking of cars but they do not seem to be very well observed by Members of the Oireachtas within the precincts of their own House. It is regrettable that we should fail to observe our own regulations. I have seen and other Members have seen from time to time, cars used by Ministers of State parked in outrageous positions two and three abreast outside Government Buildings. I am quite sure that is not any fault of the drivers concerned, that they are told to have the car there and, like the people going to Mass, they must be there. One has heard comments from members of the public that if it were somebody else's car, he would not be allowed to park in that fashion. Example is better than precept or certainly is useful in a case of this kind, and I should be glad if an example were set in that direction.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will get under way as quickly as possible a more intensive course on different aspects of road safety. It is no use having a particular film on television for short periods or having a whole lot of them going on at the one time. We should concentrate upon the more important aspects of road safety over a prolonged period until certain fundamental things relating to road safety get into people's heads.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> I am quite satisfied in my own mind that, apart from drunken driving, speed is the great killer of people and cause of accidents. Research may be necessary and, if it is, it ought to be carried out as quickly as possible. More and more emphasis should be placed on reducing speed. Accidents do occur at 50 miles an hour, but it is a different matter when they occur at 75 and 80 miles an hour. I would urge upon the Minister, now that he has dealt with drunken driving, to concentrate in the future on discouraging speed.</P>
    <P>This Bill was introduced in 1966. The Minister for Agriculture had something to say about the delay in enacting the Bill which certainly has not been driven through the Dáil at a speed or in a manner which was in the interest of the public. I would urge upon the Minister, however, to bear in mind that if it becomes necessary to amend even one or two sections of the Bill, if they are important amendments that should be made, he should not hesitate to bring them before the Oireachtas. Nobody will blame him and say: &ldquo;You enacted this Bill only a few months ago or a year ago and you are now coming in with this amendment.&rdquo; It is impossible to foresee, especially in relation to the way in which this Bill is drafted, what amendments might be needed to various sections. I am sure his advisers will keep the matter continuously under review, and I would urge the Minister to make whatever amendments are necessary in the shortest possible time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this question of parking outside churches where no provision was made for the parking of cars, I think that, generally speaking, the Garda act in a reasonable way. However, we can see that at churches in certain areas the parking of cars at particular times can cause serious obstruction and, indeed, danger, and that in some cases it just may not be feasible to permit the type of parking that people attending the churches would consider almost necessary. There is an obvious case for a movement towards the provision of car parks at churches all over the country, and that <Col N="1122" /> is the only real way in which this can be dealt with.</P>
      <P>I hope that Senator O'Quigley's remarks in regard to the observance of parking regulations in general will be effective and, in particular, in regard to ourselves here. I have not noticed the double and treble parking of Minister's cars outside Government Buildings. If it does happen, I am sure it is only for very short periods while the Ministers are being dropped for a Government meeting or something like that.</P>

      <P>In regard to the road safety campaign, an effort is being made to bring home to the public generally the enormous responsibility that drivers take on themselves when they take a car on the public road, and suggestions such as Senator O'Quigley has made are always welcome. There is a committee of all parties who are interested in road safety which advises on the various campaigns, and I will convey Senator O'Quigley's suggestion to that committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite agree that the factor of driving while under the influence of alcohol is only one contributing factor to accidents on the roads, but it is a factor that should not operate on any occasion. It is something that is within the power of the driver to avoid, and it is obviously quite justifiable to insist that this danger be avoided, and that drivers in no circumstances should place themselves in the position of being a possible danger to other users of the road or themselves through the consumption of alcohol. I agree it is one contributory factor only. It is a substantial factor, but I would not go so far as to say it is the major one. Certainly <Col N="1123" /> I think it is the most culpable one. There are many other factors.</P>
    <P>I agree that the fact that we are introducing new legislation to deal with that particular aspect does not provide any reason for complacency with regard to other things which cause accidents. We must continue to do everything possible to deal with other factors contributing to accidents, and if an amendment to the Road Traffic Acts appears to be desirable, even to effect some small improvement which will contribute to road safety, that amendment should be made as soon as possible. I can assure Senators that as far as I am concerned there would be no question of postponing anything that appeared to be desirable until such time as we have a considerable amount of amending legislation to bring in. Even if there is just one small amendment which would have some good effect in regard to road safety, I agree it should be brought in, even if it is on its own.</P>
    <P>As Senator O'Quigley said, I was not here for the major part of the consideration of this Bill but I should like to thank the Seanad for the manner in which they dealt with the Bill. I am sure we all hope it will contribute in a substantial way to the lessening of the serious damage caused by accidents on the roads, and serious injuries and deaths. As I say, I thoroughly agree that we are dealing with one aspect only of this matter in dealing with drunken driving. We must continue to explore every possibility of ensuring that the roads will be kept safe for the people using them.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Agriculture said, the main thing which will make the roads safe is if we can get every individual user of the roads to appreciate his own personal responsibility in this regard. That is really the only thing which will make the roads safe.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I raised several points and suggested that the Bill should stand over so that they might be clarified. One point arose from the statement by the Minister introducing the Bill &mdash; I am not quoting him verbatim, but I hope I am quoting correctly the tenor of his remarks &mdash; that all the countries in Western Europe had adopted the same time, except ourselves and Iceland. I made the point that this was not in fact the case because Italy had gone off the standard time. The Minister said he did not know that and I suggested that if he did not, he should not make any statement on the subject. On that friendly note, we left the matter until this week. The fact is that it is not true to say that all the countries of Western Europe had adopted the same time. I checked this before coming here in the Dáil library in the Aer Lingus timetables. Italy has again adopted double summer time from 26th May to 21st September which is a departure from standard time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out to the Minister that in the Soviet Union and the US, there are different times in different parts of the country and this does not give rise to difficulty. Apparently that kind of distinction is permissible within a single country, but is impermissible between ourselves and Great Britain because <Col N="1125" /> the Government want to align us with everything done in Britain. I pointed out that this will inflict hardship, for example, on schoolchildren and other members of the community. We have had the experience of having a different time from the time in Britain. During the war there was double summer time in Britain and we had a different time here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We had double summer time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a different time from the time in Britain at one period and it did not give rise to any insuperable difficulties. The Minister will find that in the Aer Lingus timetables. The Minister was factually incorrect because he did not do his homework on the position in Italy.</P>
      <P>The second point that concerns me was the rather bland statement by the Minister in his Second Reading speech in the Seanad, arising out of the Dáil discussion on the question of school hours, that he had taken up the subject of school hours with the Department of Education and that they were looking into the question to see if something could be done about it. It transpired when I questioned him on the matter that there had been no consultations with the teaching organisations. It was proposed, in order to meet the problem of children going to school in the dark, which, apparently, the Minister had overlooked until it was drawn to his attention in the Dáil, that the school hours would be changed without consulting the teachers. The teachers would lose an hour in the evening and gain instead a particularly useless hour in the early morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested that the matter should be left over so that an opportunity would be afforded to Senators representing the teachers to express their views on the subject. I took the trouble of informing Senator Brosnahan, as an individual representing the organisation most concerned, that the debate was coming up here but I am afraid that whatever has happened, he is not able to be here so we cannot have his <Col N="1126" /> views. I should like to hear from the Minister whether since last week he has consulted the teaching organisations and whether he has any reason to believe they will agree to the change in the hours. Is the Minister still in the position of having introduced this measure on grounds which are factually incorrect and without consulting the people who would be concerned and would be affected adversely by it? These are the points on which I should like a reply from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald mentioned that Italy has a period of summer time, and it is true that for a period of roughly four months of the year, Italy is, in fact, out of step with her neighbours. The Minister apparently did interpret something in his brief as being tantamount to an assertion that there was an uninterrupted uniformity of hours throughout Western Europe. That, in fact, was not intended. I cannot, however, accept the Italian situation as a good argument for the proposition that we in this country can afford to go our own way. We must have regard to the realities of the situation.</P>

Any <Col N="1127" /> slight advantages there might be in having a time of our own for a few months in the winter would be greatly outweighed by the disadvantages of being out of step with our neighbours.</P>
      <P>With regard to what Senator FitzGerald said about times in the United States and in the Soviet Union, I think the Minister did not mention those countries. He merely dealt with Western Europe, where we happen to be situated, and the only slight mistake was that he did not when speaking advert the fact that Italy is, for a period of four months, out of step with her neighbours.</P>
      <P>I think Senator FitzGerald said that the Minister had not consulted with the Department of Education on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">

      <P>The Minister pointed out to the House that organisations and individuals were invited by public advertisement to send in their views on this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Senators apparently suggested that the public do not read these advertisements. Quite apart from the fact that these advertisements were in the newspapers, the newspapers themselves in their news columns gave a great deal of publicity to the proposals and to the fact that the views of the public were invited. I do not see what more the Minister could have done to invite people to put forward their views. I <Col N="1128" /> think no organisation in the country can claim that they were not given ample opportunity to comment, and no organisations have claimed that they were not given ample opportunity to comment. It is correct that the Minister did not specifically consult the INTO, nor did he consult any of the other dozen or more organisations that are directly concerned with education in this country, but I think it cannot be seriously suggested that each and every one of these organisations did not know what was happening. I do not think Senator FitzGerald could have been serious in suggesting that the INTO did not know because he later adopted the attitude that it was not enough for them to know of the proposed change but that it should have been specifically put to them that there might be a question of changing the school hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>They were well aware of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The only firm fact about all this is that this Bill is designed to have the effect that clocks would be put on in the winter and that, in consequence, if people continue to observe the same hours as at present, work, school and all other activities will, in effect, begin one hour earlier. This is the only firm fact and it is a fact that it is well-known to the INTO as it is to everybody else. It would be absurd and an insult to the intelligence of the INTO for the Minister to go further and say to them: &ldquo;Of course, it may be that the working day will prove to be too early for tiny tots and that the teachers and the management will get together and decide that it would be better to move back the working day for these children by half an hour or an hour&rdquo;. I do not know what the possibility is that this would happen and it certainly does not rest with the Minister for Justice to decide that it will happen. This is obviously something to be arranged by the people concerned. All this Bill does is provide that clocks will be put on one hour in the winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill, of course, has disadvantages and the Minister <Col N="1129" /> referred to those in his opening speech. One of the disadvantages is the problem of very young children going to school. I say &ldquo;very young&rdquo; children because it is the view of the Department of Education that, on balance, even as far as schoolchildren, taking them as a group, are concerned, the change proposed in the Bill is advantageous in that it will lead to children having an opportunity for open air play after school even in the winter.</P>
    <P>But the problem facing the Government in deciding whether to sponsor this legislation was not whether the change would be beneficial to schoolchildren but whether, balancing the disadvantages and the advantages, it was beneficial to the country as a whole. The answer to that, based on the overwhelmingly positive response to the invitation for comment, and also on the Government's own assessment of the situation, is that the Bill is not only the better choice but, in practice, the only possible choice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a lame brief if ever I heard one. My sympathy actually goes out to the Minister because he is not the Minister concerned. He has gallantly undertaken to deal briefly with this Bill here this evening on behalf of his colleague. I just wonder a little whether, when he took that on, he had at that stage read the brief and knew he would have to trot out this bluff about having to align ourselves with Britain in every respect because, all credit to the Minister, this is not his normal line. The Minister retains something of the tradition of his Party of feeling that this country should retain its identity, that it should not align itself with Britain in every way, and unlike some of his colleagues of the &ldquo;back to the U.K. tradition&rdquo; who think that we should have settled for Home Rule and that national independence was a mistake, the Minister has never adopted that line. I think it was rather hard that he was the Minister on whom the lot fell to read out this stuff about aligning ourselves with Britain in every respect because it would be so <Col N="1130" /> bad for our business relations if we did not do so. Are there no business relations between the different States of the United States of America and within the Soviet Union? Of course, there are. The fact that the hours are different does not create any serious problem. One has never heard that the economy of the United States suffers because of these time differences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Even within our own country this would mean a difference in time just as it does within those countries. The case made is unsustainable and the last person to have to make it is the Minister present. I must say I am sorry for him and for that reason I shall not press it any further. I think he shares my view that we should not align ourselves with Britain in every way. He made the point that it was only for four months that Italy was out of line. Of course, if we did not adopt this Bill, the period for which we would be out of line would also only be for something like four or, perhaps, five months because the period during which, in fact, recently we have adopted summer time has exceeded the six months. It has gone beyond that and, in fact, then we could choose ourselves, as Italy has done, the period during which we wanted our time to be different for the sake of our own people in this country which is situated, geographically, so remotely from the bulk of the areas in which this Standard Time is operating. For those reasons I cannot accept that the case has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of consultations, the Minister suggests that it would be insulting the intelligence of the INTO to have consulted them. This is a concept of government of which we have seen signs from the present administration from time to time &mdash; that any form of consultation with people is an insult to their intelligence. It is one that the organisations concerned do not <Col N="1131" /> generally accept. Most of them are quite happy to have that type of insult made to their intelligence by the Government if it means they are given an opportunity to express their views.</P>
    <P>I should like to make the point that two separate issues are involved. One is consultation on the original proposal that there should be Standard Time; the other is consultation with the teaching organisations on a consequence of this proposal, which emerged at a later stage, that is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to make one point for Senator FitzGerald's benefit. As a result of circumstances beyond my control and, indeed, beyond the control of my Party, I live just a few miles from the Border. I would ask Senator FitzGerald to consider this situation if this Bill was not introduced. In the town of Strabane in County Tyrone, the public houses close at 10 o'clock and if this Bill were not introduced it would then be 9 o'clock on our side of the Border. I thought of this when he was speaking and I thought, from my point of view as a publican, it was a great pity this Bill was introduced because when the pubs closed in Strabane, and all over the Six Counties, it would be 9 o'clock our time and most of the people who would come out of those pubs would cross the Border into the 26 Counties and drink for the next 2½ hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>While this may be advantageous to the publicans, particularly the publicans in the town of Lifford, a few hundred yards away from Strabane, I think that Senator FitzGerald would agree it could be highly dangerous from a driving point of view. Certainly, whatever about Britain, it is obvious to anyone who has connections with the Six Counties that the same time must operate on both sides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The ducks are getting lamer. I hope they can swim. First of all, the point made by the speaker was that 2½ hours difference would be created. This implies there is 1½ hours difference at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, yes. If there is 1½ hours difference I cannot <Col N="1133" /> see that the extra hour is going to make that difference. Anybody in Strabane who, when he is thrown out of the pub at 10 o'clock, as it now is on the calculation, does not go over to Lifford for 1½ hours is not likely to be that much tempted to go over because it is 2½ hours.</P>

      <P>Senator FitzGerald is perfectly right in saying that I appreciate the importance of this country retaining our national identity. Of course, that applies to the Government as a whole and the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>In fact, the establishment of our separate identity as a sovereign nation, such things as the retention of our national language constitute the fundamental reason for the existence of this Party, but we are so convinced of the fact of our separate national identity that we do not see any reason whatever to impose unnecessary difficulties on ourselves <Col N="1134" /> merely in order to prove that we have a separate identity.</P>

      <P>Our separate identity is a fact and we appreciate that it is a fact and that it is not necessary to impose those difficulties on ourselves merely in order to convince ourselves. We realise our separate identity is a fact and that this applies to the whole country. In fact, I think it might be argued that this Bill is particularly desirable because of the fact that it is not a good thing to establish new differences between the two separated parts of our country and that that might be put forward as our justification for adopting this Standard Time. The more differences that grow up between the two parts of the country I suppose the more reality may attach to the pretence of there being two separate States in the country.</P>

      <P>It is an argument often put forward, indeed, that so long as there is Partition we must do exactly the same as the UK because otherwise we would be different from Northern Ireland. It is an argument which I think is inimical to the development of Irish nationality and one I cannot accept, while recognising that we should not in serious matters divide north from south more than they are now divided. However this question of avoiding serious difference in the two parts of the country is carry to its logical conclusion because if that were the conclusion he would not make it impossible for people from Northern Ireland to get employment, for example, in this part of the country by requiring a knowledge of the Irish language. In matters of that kind the Minister is prepared to make a differentiation of a damaging kind, which treats people from Northern Ireland as second-class citizens, but when it comes to having a different time, as happened during the war, and as existed within individual States, then he feels it is a matter of vital importance. I regard the whole thing as thoroughly unconvincing.</P>
