      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann hereby approves of the amendment of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) Pensions Scheme made under section 6A of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act, 1938, by:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) the deletion of the existing sub-clause (4) of clause 5 of the Scheme with effect from 7 July, 1966, and</P>
      <P>(2)  the insertion of the following sub-clause in place of the deleted sub-clause (4) of clause 5:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4) (a) Where a member of the Oireachtas is eligible for a pension under the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Acts, 1938 to 1960, only so much of the service necessary to qualify such member for the said pension under the said Acts shall be taken into account in the calculation of the amount of pension payable under this scheme or in the calculation of the period of ten years referred to in (1) (a) of this clause, as <Col N="844" /> equals in length the period of the member's service from 1 December, 1960, to the day on which he ceases to be a member of either House.</P>
    <P>(b) This sub-clause shall be deemed to have applied to all pensions in course of payment on 7 July, 1966, with effect from that date as well as to all pensions becoming payable after that date.</P>
    <P>Under sub-clause (4) of clause 5 of the scheme as approved by both Houses in December, 1960, no services in respect of which a Member received a pension as Minister or Parliamentary Secretary could reckon for Members' pension.  On 7th July, 1966, this provision was amended to allow the reckoning for Members' pension of any service as a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary during which the Member had paid contributions into the fund. It is now proposed to amend the provision further to allow the reckoning for Members' pension of so much service qualifying for a Ministerial or Parliamentary Secretary's pension, regardless of when this service was given, as is equal to the period during which the Member paid contributions to the fund, i.e., as is equal to length of service of a Member after 1st December, 1960.  It is proposed to introduce this amendment with effect from 7th July, 1966, the date of the original amendment.  I may say, in brief, that the motion is intended to correct a technical hitch in the resolution of 7th July, 1966.</P>

      <P>It is not often that the Leader of the House moves a motion such as this and we must commend him for the admirable clarity of his statement.  This is a motion which deals with pensions and, like all pensions legislation, one sees the hand of the draftsman who drafts all the superannuation legislation in relation to pension schemes for the Defence Forces and so on and, of course, like all other legislation relating to pensions, it is entirely unintelligible.  The Leader of the House has made one thing clear &mdash; that this is really to provide for a drafting mistake or error which occurred in a previous order that was made.  I have <Col N="845" /> less hesitation than I normally would have in assenting to this motion, on the ground that the funds are entirely contributed by the proposed recipients. I understand there is no charge on public funds as a result of this motion. In these circumstances and because of the lucid explanation we have had from the Leader of the House, I have no hesitation in agreeing to it.</P>

    <Title>Industrial Grants (Amendment) Bill, 1967    (Certified Money Bill):    Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators will see this Bill is purely an administrative measure to enable An Foras Tionscal to process applications for adaptation grants made to them before the 30th September, 1967.</P>
      <P>Under section 2 of the Industrial Grants (Amendment) Act, 1966, it was provided that applications for grants for enlargement or adaptation of industrial undertakings had to be made to An Foras Tionscal before 30th September, 1967, and approved by them before 31st December, 1967.  This provision applied whether the application for the adaptation grant came under the Industrial Grants Acts or the Undeveloped Areas Acts.</P>
      <P>The period of three months provided between 30th September, 1967, and 31st December, 1967, was to give An Foras time to process and deal with the applications received prior to 30th September.</P>
      <P>There was a heartening response to the exhortations to firms to undertake adaptation measures to meet free trade conditions and a considerable number of applications was received particularly in the weeks before 30th September, 1967.  This was a welcome development but the volume of cases was more than An Foras could deal with within the time limit of 31st December, 1967, as required by the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At 30th September, 1967, An Foras <Col N="846" /> had 757 grant applications of this kind on hands, almost equal to the number which had been approved in the four years ended 31st March, 1967.  It is now necessary to provide additional time for An Foras to get through these applications, and the sole purpose of the present Bill is to extend the date for approval of those applications, made prior to 30th September, 1967, from 31st December, 1967, to 30th June, 1968.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not touch on the question of extending the time for making applications for grants by existing firms proposing to expand or adapt their undertakings.  This question forms part of the general review of the grant system at present in progress, and will be dealt with when, in due course, and I hope at an early date, amending legislation of a general character is proposed to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the Seanad and look forward to its passing through all Stages so that An Foras Tionscal can continue their consideration of the applications for adaptation grants which they still have on hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no difficulty in welcoming and accepting this proposal.  The Minister said it is heartening that there should be this volume of response to the Adaptation Grants Scheme.  It is a somewhat belated response.  It indicates the merit of having a deadline of some kind which makes people think very seriously as to what they should be doing. The fear of missing the opportunity of getting State aid for adaptation and modernisation makes people consider their situation more seriously than when they feel they can postpone indefinitely consideration of their position. The Government were right to have the deadline.  Its effectiveness is demonstrated by the response it has secured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must be concerned at the lumpiness of the flow of investment implied by this response.  Assuming that these applications are fairly serious and that the proportion approved will be fairly high, the volume of industrial <Col N="847" /> investment implied by this figure is very great indeed.  One must in some degree be concerned that, in these circumstances, one is liable to get a very sudden jump in industrial investment in a period of a year or so of a somewhat temporary character with perhaps a falling-off in that respect afterwards.  This type of distortion in the trend of investment could impose strains on the economy because of the sudden demand for investment in a short perod.  It could impose, also, considerable strain on the Government's capital programme.  Assuming that these grants are of no smaller order than preceding grants, the scale of investment required in the years ahead could be very great indeed.</P>
    <P>What is the total sum involved in the 757 grant applications?  On the assumption that the proportion approved is the same as it has been in recent years, what will the total investment be and over what period is this investment likely to be undertaken? Does the Minister feel that, once these grant applications are approved, investment will take place immediately or have some been put in in order to get approval while the firms concerned may not proceed with the investment for some time to come?</P>
    <P>Is there any requirement under the legislation or in the administrative system which the board is applying which will necessitate this investment being made in a relatively short time or, having sought approval and got this approval for these grants, can firms postpone the investment for some years?  How soon do they have to carry out the investment in order to secure the grant?  The sooner they carry it out the better, if it is sufficient investment to merit the payment of Government grant.</P>
    <P>If all this investment is made together, I think it could impose certain strains.  What is the Minister's policy?  What total sum will be required in respect of Government grants if the same proportion is approved as was approved in the past? How big a sum will have to go into the Capital Budget, approximately, in <Col N="848" /> the year ahead or in the following year to cover this?  The Minister must have assessed what the scale of the investment is likely to be.  I think this House is entitled to know how much is involved.</P>
    <P>I have the fear, which I believe to be quite widely shared in industry now and for some time past, that there has been a certain over-emphasis on these adaptation grants.  Because adaptation grants are capable of quantitative measurement, because this is something that one can add up, so and so many hundred grants were approved and this relates to so many hundred firms which are such and such a percentage of the total number of firms in the country, there is a tendency to regard these grants as a measure of the performance of Irish industry in preparing for the freeing of trade.  But that is only one aspect of the preparations for the freeing of trade, an important aspect but one which should not be taken out of context.  Indeed, there is a danger in the Minister's own Department and in An Foras Tionscal that concentration on handling these applications, which is, of course, a huge job administratively, will divert attention from more fundamental approaches to the whole question of adaptation.</P>
    <P>There has been a tendency in statements from his Department and I think from himself personally, although I would have to go over the record to be sure of that, to equate or to imply the equation of industrial adaptation grants with preparations for the freeing of trade and seemingly to suggest that if only 20 per cent of firms in a particular industry have sought those grants that the industry is not getting ready for free trade or if 80 per cent have applied that the industry is well prepared.  In fact, of course, in all our industries there are firms which will not need adaptation grants, which are already prepared for the freeing of trade or which will not suffer stiffer competition in free trade conditions because of the particular circumstances of what they are producing or where they are producing it.  At the other extreme there are firms which could not survive the freeing of trade no <Col N="849" /> matter how much money was poured into them and in between there are firms which are capable of surviving but do require a considerable investment in modernisation and in those cases these grants are useful.</P>
    <P>However, it would be a mistake to concentrate too much on these adaptation grants and to appear to equate the proportion of firms applying for them with the proportion of firms preparing for the freeing of trade and the general degree of preparation of Irish industry to meet free trade.  There is much more than that required and a much more sophisticated approach is required to the whole problem.  One of our difficulties has been that our whole approach both to fresh industrialisation &mdash; the setting up of new industries &mdash;and the adaptation of existing industries to free trade has been unsophisticated to a degree.  No adequate appreciation has existed, to my mind, in the country as a whole, in industry or, indeed, in the Minister's Department of the fundamental character of the changes in the structure of industry that will be required to meet the freeing of trade.  All of us have made the mistake, the CIO, in which I myself participate, the Department and industry itself of thinking in terms of each individual firm doing a bit of modernisation, doing a bit of re-equipping and then selling what it is now producing in the export markets or competitively in the home market as a result of this slight adjustment when, in fact, what is required is in many cases nothing less than the complete restructuring of industry.</P>
    <P>What is required is that the existing structure of industry, orientated towards the domestic market, concentrated on the production of a very wide range of goods at a relatively low degree of economic efficiency, perhaps technically efficient but economically inefficient because of the wide range of goods produced in small numbers, be re-orientated to the production of a narrow specialised range of goods, the vast bulk of which would have to be sold in export markets.  The restructuring of industry will mean the merger of many existing firms, the disappearance of some firms, the creation of new <Col N="850" /> ones.  We have all taken much too unsophisticated a view of this problem and I fear that in An Foras Tionscal and in the Department there has not been a sufficient appreciation of the magnitude, extent and depth of the changes that are required and that there has been a tendency to think we can meet this problem by tinkering with it. I do not think the Department or An Foras Tionscal are to be blamed particularly for this.  I think we are all to blame.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are involved in industry in any capacity, involved in committees like the committee on industrialisation, the NIEC and all those who have been even peripherally involved in this matter, have tended I think to take this problem in too simplified a form.  We have failed to appreciate sufficiently the degree of technical and economic expertise that will be required to achieve this restructuring of Irish industry and in the Department and An Foras Tionscal and the IDA I do not think enough has been done to ensure that we have the level of expertise necessary to tackle these problems.  What is required here is something which cannot simply be tackled by administrative civil servants without business experience, without the assistance of people with experience in this field or in the consultancy field.  I feel we have to consider a vast strengthening of our administrative forces by the introduction of expertise of a business character if we are to tackle this problem effectively.  It is all too easy to set up a system of adaptation grants with firms applying for them and churning out the grants where firms meet certain minimal requirements, but not taking the problem as a whole.  If I may take an example, you get a case of an industry in which there are half a dozen or a dozen firms producing exclusively for the home market.</P>
    <P>In that industry there is, perhaps, over-capacity.  I am thinking of a particular industry, though I do not propose to name it.  It is clear to everybody in the industry and, indeed, would be privately admitted in the Minister's Department that only three of those firms are likely to survive or, to put it another way, that it is unlikely <Col N="851" /> that an industry comprising more than three firms could be competitive.  It might even be thought that only one firm could survive because the scale of activity would be such that to have more than one would be to operate below a minimum economic level.  I wonder what has An Foras Tionscal done to evaluate that situation.  My own limited experience has been that they have not found it possible to tackle this effectively, that faced with that, they have attempted, not very effectively, to press on the firms that they should get together and sort out what, in fact, would be the economic size of the industry and how many firms there should be in the industry for it to be effective but that if there is an unwillingness to agree as to which is to commit suicide they have simply ladled out grants to all six or eight or ten firms in the industry though they know and the industry knows and everybody concerned knows that of these grants a significant proportion &mdash; perhaps the majority of them &mdash; are going to be ineffective because they are simply pouring money into firms which everybody knows will not survive in free trade.  I do not make this criticism in a carping way because I fully appreciate the difficulty of the situation. My own experience as chairman of two adaptation councils has convinced me that for anybody who is not extremely expert in the industry to attempt to make the decisions involved as to how many firms will survive and which they will be is, in fact, impossible. Personally, I would not be prepared even with the insight which I acquired in regard to particular industries to make that kind of evaluation. I have not got the technical expertise to do so or, indeed, the business experience and I can quite understand why the administrative civil servants in An Foras Tionscal or in the Department dodge that decision.  If I were in that position frankly with my limited capacity in that field I would feel obliged to do so also.  I would not feel with my limited knowledge I had the right to decide which firms should get grants to survive and which should not. However, I do not think we should dodge the issue simply by saying we <Col N="852" /> are not competent to decide.  One must accept the fact that those decisions have to be taken and if some of us are not competent to take them we should ensure that people are employed who can give the expert advice necessary to ensure that money is not wasted because we have not the necessary competence in the matter.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take what I am saying as constructive criticism.  I do not think I am being unfair to the Department or to An Foras Tionscal. The people there are doing an excellent job in their own way but they have not got the business experience to take the kind of decisions that need to be taken any more than I have or any more than the Minister has and I do not think we have taken this seriously enough.  In Italy, in Britain or France the relevant organisations responsible for industrial adaptation or rationalisation &mdash; the IRC in Britain, the IRI in Italy and the equivalent organisation in France and other countries &mdash; are highly equipped to deal with these problems.  They employ people with business experience, people with great experience in the merging of firms, in the rationalisation of industry.  They employ them to help in this work of ensuring that a competitive structure of industry emerges from the work of adaptation, whereas here in this country we are content to leave this task to administrative civil servants who have not business experience and who should not be asked to undertake something which they are not in a position to do.  Even if I suggested bringing in economists it would not help either because this is something which goes beyond the range of experience which an economist or a civil servant has.</P>
    <P>We have not approached this problem properly.  I should like to see a radical restructuring of the existing system so that it would be capable of coping with these problems and that we would get away from the present arrangement under which effectively An Foras Tionscal have very little alternative but to give an adaptation grant to any firm which makes in its own right a reasonable case even <Col N="853" /> though eight reasonable cases individually will add up to one unreasonable case altogether.  Every single individual firm could make a case that if it gets this grant it will survive but if you give the grant to eight firms you are giving it to five firms, perhaps, which are not going to survive.</P>
    <P>An Foras Tionscal is not geared to take that kind of decision.  I do not think much can be done at this stage. All they can do at this point in time is to process the remainder of the 757 grant applications as rapidly, as effectively and as efficiently as possible, as they have been doing.  I think extra staff has been drafted in there and I feel that this is very necessary to get this job done in time because it is bad that those applications should be left hanging over for a period.  Industry may be a little bit impatient at the moment at the slow speed with which the applications have been dealt with but I think industry accepts, nevertheless, that if industry itself is going to shove in in a few months as many applications as in the previous four years industrialists cannot expect them to be dealt with as rapidly as if they had put them in more smoothly and in good time.  It is their own fault that they have come in in this form and that it has taken so much time to deal with them.</P>
    <P>The Minister I think has taken steps to try to speed up this process and it is clear from the Bill that he expects the job to be done within six months.  That is a reasonable target and I do not think we can fault him for having to look for this extension, the extent to which industry lags behind in putting in those applications.  The volume of applications that occurred in the last couple of months was much greater than one could reasonably anticipate and he could not possibly have geared up An Foras Tionscal to cope with this unnatural flow with the same speed and efficiency as they were doing previously. Some time lag is inevitable and the time lag that is involved in this Bill seems reasonable to me and I would not fault him on that.</P>
    <P>I accept it is not going to be possible in the middle of this crisis of handling <Col N="854" /> the applications to adopt a more sophisticated approach.  I would press on the Minister that he would try to get away from the traditional approach under which those matters are handled by people who have not got the experience of business, of mergers, of the industrial rationalisation required in this kind of work and that we adopt a more sophisticated approach to this matter, otherwise we simply will not be prepared for free trade.  We will have many firms with adaptation grants, many firms with new machinery but not firms which can survive.  In fact, it has been the case in the past that in certain industries at certain periods Irish industry far from being under-equipped and lacking modern equipment has had too much.</P>
    <P>I myself was involved in a survey of one industry in which it was clear that the industry had over a long period of about ten years or so equipped itself with modern equipment. Nobody could complain that the industry was badly equipped.  There were, of course, many individual firms who had not moderised but, on the whole, the level of modernisation of the industry compared favourably with other countries but they had, if anything, over-bought.  Every firm had modernised on a one shift basis, whereas, of course, we could not operate efficiently and economically without working at least two shifts. They had, if anything, twice as much machinery as they needed.  If half the volume of machinery they had were concentrated on half of the firms working on a two shift basis it would be far more economical than the over-equipment.</P>
    <P>We can place too much emphasis on the simple business of modernising equipment.  There is more to it than that.  The industrial adaptation grant system, while it was desirable in its time, was certainly useful in generating additional industrial investment, had the defect of over-concentrating attention in this particular area and not concentrating enough attention on the structure of adaptation, which is the fundamental concern.</P>
    <P>Irish industry has largely been founded since 1932.  In fact, it is relatively <Col N="855" /> modern by the standards of other countries except countries whose industry was wiped out in the war and which modernised since the war.  Our problem has not been that we are a very old fashioned industry.  It has not been long enough there to be old-fashioned. Our problem is that its structure is entirely inappropriate to modern trading conditions with free trade.  Adaptation is something which will not be met, and can even be confused, by excessive re-equipment in too many individual units with machinery suited to a large number of small units quite unsuitable to the type and scale of activity that will be required in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, ask the Minister to look at the whole approach to this problem and to be prepared to take drastic steps to review the administrative structure that handles our whole industrial adaptation programme or else we will find that we are left behind and we will find that Irish industry, which is really capable, if properly adapted, of surviving in the free trade conditions and in which I personally have confidence despite what is said by many of its critics in different camps, will face very serious difficulties which need not occur if the problems had been approached and tackled in a more sophisticated manner.</P>
    <P>It is not that we have an industrial structure which it too young, too new, too small or basically too weak to survive. We have an industrial structure, much the greater part of which will survive under free trade conditions if it is adapted to the very different marketing conditions of free trade.  That adaptation is something which it can only undertake if it gets assistance and help from the Government, not only assistance in the form of grants and help for adaptation but assistance and help in the form of a lead, in the form of the kind of lead which has been given to industry in England by the Minister in question, by the IRC recently in regard to several major industries where the direct intervention of the Minister and the IRC have led <Col N="856" /> to mergers which have greatly strengthened English industry, mergers which would not have taken place without that intervention.</P>
    <P>This is where the State can play a useful role in intervening to rationalise the industry and not be pushing people around and telling them how to run their business but in employing people with the necessary expertise to point to where there is a particular change that could be made, a restructuring, a merger, a rationalisation that could achieve results, then to use the negotiation skills of those people or the Minister himself to bring together people who hitherto have not been prepared to work together, to bring them together effectively to achieve those results.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we have begun to attempt this yet.  There is a good example beside us in Britain.  There is a good example also of much that has been done in Italy which has, indeed, faced, because it is the poorest of the Common Market countries, problems very similar to ours and from which we could learn a lot.  I do not think we have begun to face up to this adequately here.</P>
    <P>This is an opportunity, when we are now coming to the end of this adaptation grant scheme and when as the Minister has said other arrangements are in contemplation, to revise this radically.  I hope the new arrangements the Minister will come to us with before long and to which he refers here today are likely to mature at an early date, will be ones that will follow along the lines I have indicated.  I can say now if they do and if they provide a radical breakthrough in this matter than the present totally inadequate administrative structure, then they will be welcome on this side of the House.  If they do not, I shall be repeating in much more stringent terms the criticisms I have been making now, criticisms which I do not press beyond certain points at the moment because we are learning as we go along.</P>
    <P>We are learning from those lessons now and there is no good looking to the past and saying it should have been done years ago.  Everything should have been done years ago but <Col N="857" /> none of us appreciated the problems fully.  We appreciate them now. There are enough people now who understand those problems and I do not think there is any excuse for failing to solve and tackle them now.  If the Government do not come forward with radical proposals along those lines they can and will be faulted and will be strongly criticised from this side of the House.  I hope that the Minister who has now had long enough in his Department to come to grips with the very many and varied problems there will look at this problem in a fresh way and will not be hidebound by precedent, will not feel he has to carry on with the existing structure, will not consider that the present arrangements must not be disrupted because there would be personal inconvenience of some kind or because people will object to changes of this kind but will be prepared to make the necessary changes.  If we can take such drastic, and, indeed, in some respects absurd decisions concerning the policy making functions of Government Departments in towns a long way from the capital city where the policy making functions should be concentrated, we can certainly take the necessary decisions to restructure our organisations operating in Dublin in this field, even if this means some disturbance of some individuals in the kind of work they have been doing. We must let nothing stand in the way of doing it.  Too much is at stake. People have too many jobs at stake here for us to allow the convenience of administrators, to allow the present administrative structure, to stand in the way of radical reform.  We expect from the Minister, therefore, a radical approach to this problem within the next few months.  If he shows signs of that he will certainly receive our support and if he does not he will receive our very severe criticism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no objection as far as the Labour Party is concerned to the measure before the House but it does give an opportunity on this occasion to comment on the Government's dependence over the years on private enterprise and the major idea <Col N="858" /> of contributing to industrial expansion and development in the country.</P>
      <P>This Government have, shall we say, nailed their colours to this mast.  They believe that private enterprise aided by State grants is the best possible way to planned future industrial development. In this particular field they deal with adaptation grants.  We see now the fallacy of depending on private enterprise to carry out this most vital task on behalf of the community.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his opening statement has admitted that he has now on hands over 757 applications for adaptation grants, as many as have been considered in the previous four years.  That would give me, at any rate, the impression that some type of extraordinary mentality obtains among our so-called industrialists.  If the Minister is in a position, I hope he will explain.  Was it, as Senator FitzGerald said, due to the dateline which was laid down in so far as adaptation grants are concerned or was it something else which caused this sudden surge as far as these applications are concerned?  It does denote a most erratic form of planning on the part of private enterprise.  A Government which set themselves a five-year plan and continue to suggest to the public that they have a second programme and will have a third programme of development, even if they had such a programme, would be in an awkward position if they were to depend on private enterprise as shown by their response to the grant inducements over the last four years.</P>
      <P>Members of the Government have in the last two to three years exhorted industrialists to take advantage of these grants.  It would appear that their exhortations went in one ear and out the other.  Can the Government in those circumstances any longer depend on private enterprise to do the job to which I have referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not time for complete new thinking on the part of the Government? Is it not time to realise that the State must bear the burden of responsibility if any major breakthrough in industrial development is to take place? I think the Minister has attempted here to bring it home now to the rest of the Government that they cannot depend <Col N="859" /> on private individuals in industry to deliver the goods.</P>
    <P>The whole problem as far as the Government are concerned is they have nothing clear in their own minds. Deputy S. Lemass when Taoiseach was always talking about private enterprise. Whether he believed it or not I do not know.  Whatever he said goes with the present Cabinet.  They are long enough off the bottle now to think for themselves. When they see this petty thinking and coddling of private enterprise are they men enough to change the adaptation policy, to change it before things worsen further?</P>
    <P>As an instance of the confused thinking of this Government, I might point out that for the past number of years we have heard about the necessity for mergers and that the future of industry depended on major concerns being set up in certain areas.  That has been the line of the Government for a number of years past.  In the middle of that we have this sudden change-over, especially on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the idea that proposed small industries could be the solution to the problem in many areas.  We have this confusing picture. You have big business, big this, big that and big the other on the part of the Government and now we have a special committee created in the last 18 months to deal with small industries.</P>
    <P>Yet, we run the two ideas side by side or is there a volume of opinion which believes that small industries properly planned can be beneficial and help, particularly in the undeveloped areas, to keep people in the provincial towns?  We do not know what the Government view is on this but I do know that as a result of the sudden rush of applications we have a shortage of staff to deal with them.  I do not blame the civil servants in any sense for this.  They cannot be expected to process four times the number of applications they were used to dealing with over the last four years.</P>
    <P>We have this sudden rush of adaptation grants and we also have a sudden rush for small industries, there is a <Col N="860" /> bottleneck and it is not possible at the present time to investigate physically the applications made.  I feel that many of those applications are well worth an immediate investigation.  It is a pity that due to this sudden rush in Industry and Commerce we have a bottleneck occurring and that first-class propositions are to be found down the list and God knows when they will be dealt with. There is no planning there.</P>
    <P>I do not know who is responsible.  I do not know whether the Minister will accept responsibility or whether he will say private enterprise has let him down. I should like him to elaborate on the figure of the 757 applications that have been dealt with.  Could he give us an indication of what proportion come under the Undeveloped Areas Acts and would he indicate whether many of the applications come from, say, the Province of Connacht and the Western seaboard?</P>
    <P>I think Senator FitzGerald asked the Minister to tell the House the amount of capital involved.  I should also like to know whether in some of these industries there would be a question of an increase in the number of employees or a reduction.  Would the Minister be able to clarify the position in connection with some of the applications that have been made?  I am of the opinion that in a number of them the adaptation grants which are sought are for automation which in itself is an excellent idea but we would like to know how many people are being dispensed with.  How many people's services are being dispensed with in the automation programme involved? Is there to be a big reduction in the number employed or is it envisaged that the 757 applications for adaptation and enlargement will give a high employment content?</P>
    <P>Outside of that I do not want to repeat what I have already said except to say that the Government are seriously lacking an industrial development policy, and I welcome at any rate the Minister's statement in his final paragraphs that there is a general review coming up, as he hopes, at a very early date and that legislation of a general character in connection with industrial development is on the stocks <Col N="861" /> at the moment.  Having said that, I should like to urge the Minister to see that priority is given to this matter of industrial development over and above many of the things which are at present getting Government attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill particularly for what is indicated by it, namely the courage and determination of Irish businessmen to take their part in the Europe of the future and their confidence that they are capable of taking such part.  I may say also that while I disagree completely with the policy advocated by Senator McQuillan, nonetheless I admire his courage in stating it.  He states unequivocally, as I understand it, that all private enterprise for all practical purposes should be abolished and that all the means of production, exchange and distribution should be vested in the hands of the State, and that otherwise the country cannot and will not progress.</P>
      <P>I personally believe in private enterprise. I believe in the <i>entrepreneur,</i> his courage, his ability and his determination to plan ahead, knowing that he is gambling with his own money.  I can visualise that there would at this stage be perhaps more applications than usual.  A deadline has been set, but new machines are constantly coming out and what is up-to-date at the present time may be completely out-of-date in three years' time just as what was up-to-date three years ago is completely out-of-date now.  Therefore, the average businessman will not without the greatest consideration and investigation decide the type of mechanisation in which he will indulge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told by Senator McQuillan that in this regard the Government have no policy.  Quite frankly, I fail to see in what regard the present policy of the Department of Industry and Commerce could be improved. To begin with, as regards markets we have the Irish Export Board, and we have seen their report recently. I think that they do a really wonderful job.  I have watched them in action on the Continent.  I have watched them in action in New York.  I have been <Col N="862" /> over there and have studied their methods, and I must say that their complete dedication to their work is something that made me feel proud of them.  For the small industry of which Senator McQuillan has spoken there is a special section in the Department of Industry and Commerce where they can get expert advice at a fraction of the cost which it would take to call in efficiency consultants.  I must say from personal experience that the advice they get is far more objective in many cases and far more accurate than can be got from efficiency consultants to whom approximately five times the fee is paid.</P>
    <P>Again we have had the suggestion that you cannot have large businesses combining with small businesses.  There is in this country, as in every country, an opening both for the large and the small business.  I was rather surprised to hear criticism by Senator FitzGerald that there may be cases where there are at the moment seven or eight industries competing with one another, overproducing, and that they would all be looking for grants.  We must realise that businessmen are not fools.  The maximum grant any industry will get for modernisation is 25 per cent.  For every five shillings that is put up by the State a businessman has to put up out of his own pocket 15 shillings.  If each of those industries requires, say, £100,000 to modernise you are not going to get eight business people to lend £600,000 merely to get £200,000 from the State.  No businessman will do that without the closest investigation, without making sure that he personally will not lose, and if all eight of them make sure that they will not lose then more luck to them, and of course they must look for an export market, for that, too, is most important.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald referred also to the fact that the approach of An Foras Tionscal is to some extent perhaps inexperienced because they have no practical businessmen among them.  I must say that, having on more than one occasion considered the type of investigation in which they involve themselves, if they have not practical business experience they certainly know how to ask the right questions.</P>

      <P>I know from practical experience.  You may as well say that because an inspector of taxes is not a chartered accountant&mdash;he does not necessarily have to be one&mdash;that he cannot catch you out if you endeavour to defraud in your income tax.  I think there are very few inspectors of taxes who are chartered accountants but I know very few accounts which would pass them if they are fraudulent even though they might get through the accountants.</P>
      <P>The approach of An Foras Tionscal, from what I have seen, seems to be on much the same lines.  Certainly from the experience that I have had of them in various industries I would like to congratulate them, if they are not businessmen, on the searching manner in which everything is investigated, their insistence on seeing that the balance of the capital is available, on seeing that either consultants have been called in and on seeing their reports or that if consultants are not called in personally that advantage is taken of the most efficient body of consultants of the lot, that is the independent body associated with the Department of Industry and Commerce.  You have to show them what your possible market is, you have to submit to them costings and to verify your costings, before they part with one pound for every three that you personally have to put up.  They certainly make a most full investigation and I should like to congratulate them in general.  I should like to say a word of congratulation on the general manner in which they co-ordinate with the Export Board, and in particular I should like to congratulate the Irish businessmen of today on the progress they are making, which is reflected in the increase in our exports.</P>

      <P>As I anticipated, there is general welcome for the Bill which, as I said, is really just an administrative measure.  I do not know that the sudden rush of applications coming up to the closing date is a ground for despondency, having regard to human nature and deadline.  We all know that <Col N="864" /> whenever there is a deadline in any field of activity human nature tends to leave the matter to the last minute when you see the deadline coming rather than rushing to meet it.  I would prefer, of course, that the thing had gone on a very smooth basis, but life does not work like that.  You are dealing with human beings, and it is human beings who make the applications, not the machines they employ in their businesses.  I cannot say whether these applications will have any major effect on our financial situation.  I cannot say it positively on past experience. I do not believe it will.  We know from past experience that whenever such applications are approved, the actual implementation of the schemes will not take place at the one time. They are spread over a period.</P>

      <P>I should say that going beyond two years would be unusual. Senator McQuillan asked for some details of the applications which are pending.  I cannot give these details to any extent.  They are applications which are pending, which are not processed, and, therefore, we do not know at this stage the kind of capital investment involved in the applications, whether they would involve further improvement.  I can say that the report of An Foras Tionscal for the period up to 31st March, 1967, gave details of adaptation grants approved by them up to that date. The report shows that the total number approved up to then was 793 and the total amount of grant involved <Col N="865" /> was £13,897,540.  This represented an estimated capital expenditure in the various schemes involved totalling £63,000,000, of which £21,300,000 was in respect of sites and buildings and £41,700,000 in respect of machinery and equipment.</P>
      <P>As Senators will appreciate, this relates to grants up to 31st March, 1967.  It does not relate to pending applications for adaptation grants about which I cannot give details.</P>

      <P>The Minister will agree that if all those applications are similar in character to those already processed, altogether we are talking about a total investment of £60 million approximately, of which the State contribution would be in the region of £14 million, the balance to come from the country's available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot, without processing the adaptation applications, give details of them.  We can operate <Col N="866" /> on the rough basis of past experience. On that basis we are not unduly worried about this.  The suggestion was made by Senator FitzGerald that there has been too much emphasis on physical adaptation and he said he thought that statements issuing from my Department or, perhaps, from me, follow this line of assessing our adaptation to free trade on the basis of whether a certain percentage of firms had obtained adaptation grants.</P>
      <P>This criticism is not entirely justified in the sense that in the first place the only objective way in which one can assess physical adaptation is on the basis of the adaptation grants related to such information as we have from the CIO reports on various industries. During a considerable time past in various statements I have been making, I have been laying great stress on the fact that physical adaptation is merely one aspect of adaptation to free trade and in many cases that it is not the most important &mdash;that such things as rationalisation, mergers and other aspects of non-physical adaptation can be vitally important in certain industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should not like Deputy FitzGerald or anybody else to think that this is a problem new to us, that we are not aware of the difficulties involved in effecting mergers or in trying to rationalise production as between various firms and industries; nor should I like him to think that what has been happening in Britain is a headline.  We have been ahead of Britain.  They, of course, are operating on a much larger scale but their approach to this problem is of quite recent origin, whereas we have been operating on them for a considerable time in the industrial reorganisation of my Department. They have been directly responsible for some of the mergers which have taken place in industry here in recent years and while they have a great deal of expertise, more than might be thought by people not familiar with the work they do, they do not rely entirely on that.  They have been using their influence as far as they can to ensure that in certain groups of firms within a particular industry consultants were called in, recommendations <Col N="867" /> were made for rationalisation in those firms.  In some cases, as Senator FitzGerald has said, some firms had virtually to go out of existence.</P>
    <P>That branch of my Department have gone further in trying to have these recommendations implemented and they have been successful in a number of cases.  More work of this kind is going on at the moment.  I do not say that the scale of activity on which we have been operating is sufficient but I do say it has been reasonably extensive and has been going on for quite a long time.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out also that physical adaptation is in many cases the first stage of adaptation for free trade&mdash;that there will be further stages after that&mdash;but in many cases we can only think of rationalising and mergers because of the physical adaptation that has taken place as a result of this grant scheme.  One cannot do effectively the whole job at one time and we are reaching the stage where we can fairly effectively go into the non-physical stage of adaptation now in many sectors where we could not do it before. The problem to which Senator FitzGerald referred, about adaptation grants being given to a number of firms within a sector of industry where, perhaps, taking an over-all view of the sector, it would be wiser to give grants only to some of the firms concerned. This, of course, is a problem with which we are very familiar.</P>
    <P>Let me say that An Foras Tionscal attempted in one industry to do this. The net effect of their attempt was that, for one and a half years, no firm in that industry got a grant.  In the end, in order to allow some of them to survive, they had to agree to give the grants.  They are conscious of the fact that, in that particular industry, indirectly as a result of grants they have given, there is a certain type of equipment installed in a number of the firms which, put together, is much greater than the capacity we need.  It is a difficult problem.  It will not be solved, in my opinion, by strong arm methods.  I think it can be solved only <Col N="868" /> by inducements and by making as clear as possible to all those concerned where their self-interest lies.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I have over the past few months been meeting representatives of different sectors of industry each week and discussing the various problems arising for industry, particularly in the context of freer trade.  One of the matters which has been coming up and on which I have been laying great stress&mdash;as, indeed, great stress has been laid by the Federation of Irish Industries&mdash;is the weakness of the organisation of Irish industry on a sector basis.  It needs very great strengthening in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is also true that, from the point of view of the State, the kind of assistance we can give to industry could be considerably more effective if there were strong sectoral organisations within industry.  For example, it may well be that, in certain industries, none of the firms concerned is big enough or strong enough to organise and pay for a worthwhile programme of research and development whereas, working together, it might be possible to devise a scheme whereby the State could assist in providing the necessary aid in that sector.  I have pointed that out to representatives of the industries concerned.  Having given a good deal of thought to it, I believe that only by way of inducement or carrot shall we succeed in getting this kind of organisation and that any attempt to force this by way of Government decree, order, or something amounting to that, is doomed to failure.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to dwell unduly long on the question raised by Senator McQuillan with regard to private enterprise versus public enterprise. This has always seemed to me a very unreal approach to business and to life.  I am utterly pragmatic in this regard.  To be dictatorial means to throw away many of the advantages one could have.  My concern is to discover the best way to do the job. If public enterprise is the one to give us the best results, in our circumstances, I shall go for public enterprise. If, in other circumstances, <Col N="869" /> private enterprise is the one, I shall go for that or, in the third kind of case&mdash;a combination of public and private enterprise&mdash;I shall go for that. I do not care which one it is so long as it does the job.</P>
    <P>There seems some contradiction in what Senator McQuillan was saying. In the first place, he said, or seemed to me to be saying, that private enterprise had failed and that this was clearly demonstrated by the rush for grants and by looking at the situation in Irish industry.  The Senator would do well to have a look at the history of mining activities in this country where originally it was under State enterprise and where it is now dealt with on the basis of private enterprise with inducements from the State.  Let me compare the results.  I defy the Senator to say that, in that particular industry, private enterprise is not by far the best way to do the job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Any thought about the mining industry indicates that it is one which requires a great deal of capital and risk-taking and a certain kind of mentality which we cannot expect to get in public enterprise.  I do not say that this is true of all sectors of industry. I say that one should look at the particular industry concerned and determine the best way to do that particular job and not to be doctrinaire about it.</P>
      <P>I am glad Senator McQuillan seems to approve of the small industries programme. It is progressing satisfactorily. I do not think it has much to do with this Bill.</P>
      <P>As far as I can see, the House is pleased to accept the provisions of this Bill to enable An Foras Tionscal to go ahead and process the applications for adaptation grants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his remarks just now, said that very often physical adaptation is the first stage and that this would justify the approach to the adaptation grant in the first instance as is provided in the section which extended the period, leaving over the question of structural reform until later.  I am not happy about that.  The problem we are discussing shows that there are many instances where structural reform should take place first.  It is true that, if it does not, one is faced with the dilemma whether to provide no grants at all or grants for the lot of them, thereby enabling them to undercut and undermine each other.  It is the very fact that that is the case that makes it essential to approach the problem of structural reform first and adaptation grant second.  That is why I fault the Government on having approached the problem basically the other way round when grants would have been more useful if the alternative approach had been adopted.</P>
      <P>The Minister said we are ahead of the British in the work, for example, of the CIO Branch and that the fact that adaptation grants are now being extended under this section is in advance of British initiative.  This is true. We have tended to be quicker off the mark in this country with schemes of this kind, as schemes, but we are very often much slower at putting them through and achieving results. The mere fact that we start something does not prove very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was most concerned&mdash;it is very much relative to this section in relation to extended period so that very large sums of money can be authorised in grants within the next six months&mdash;at the Minister's statement that, while he is not sure that a scale of additional grants which will have to be given under the section will not create problems, the Minister for <Col N="871" /> Finance does not think they will. Should this House, in conscience, allow to pass without protest a section of the Bill authorising the Minister to approve grants on this scale&mdash;which looks like being of the order of £14 million in grants encouraging £60 million of investment&mdash;without any attempt to establish if this is the scale of investment involved or greater, and whether this will be done within two years?  If this step will create problems for the economy and the Exchequer, then it is irresponsible.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that if the Minister were doing his job and if An Foras Tionscal were doing their job they would be accompanying the process of approving grants as fast as they can with keeping a tally of the total amount of grant approvals that are being sought and making an estimate based on the average ratio of grant approvals of grant applications which is fairly constant, they would be making a running estimate of what exactly they are running themselves into.  I would have thought the necessary preparations would be made to ensure that the resources can be made available without overstraining the economy.  To my mind the scale of what is involved here, the scale of investment that we are authorising by agreeing to this section of the Bill, could be of such a character that unless room is made for it within the next two years by re-ordering our priorities the economy and the Exchequer could be overstrained and the whole business of the development of credit in the economy could be overstrained.</P>
    <P>I am horrified and very surprised to hear that the Minister and the Minister for Finance are so irresponsible and so unconscious of the need for forward planning that although they have available to them in 750 pieces of paper which could be gone through in a couple of hours to see what is the total sum involved and although the balance of credit in the next two years may depend on this and although it may be necessary because of the urgent priority of this money this money should be voted, though I <Col N="872" /> believe it may be necessary to restrain public capital expenditure in other areas in order to leave room for this, they have not even bothered to find out how much is involved.  This is disturbing and it confirms fears I had that the Government have no idea of economic planning.  Here they are faced with data readily available to them which in a couple of hours could yield information vital to forward planning, information on which the future balance of this economy will depend in the next two years and they have not bothered to find out what it shows.  I cannot understand how a Government who purport to have heard of economic planning, never mind practice it, could act in such an irresponsible manner.</P>
    <P>One approach would be to refuse to pass the section.  However, I shall not press that point because to my mind this investment is top priority.  I know that some of it will be wasted, some of it will be put into firms which will not survive because of inadequate expertise to deal with the matter. Nevertheless, the bulk of it will be well spent and it is of such vital importance to us that it must be given priority.  Therefore, I do not propose to oppose the section but I urge on the Minister to get one of his officials to spend a couple of hours doing a check on this to see what is involved and then refer it to the economic planning people in the Department of Finance and the people concerned with the capital programme so that they may see what the implications are and consider it urgently both in respect of the year ahead and the following year.  We know we can overstrain our economy by excessive lumpiness of our investment programme as happened in the past.  One of the problems that arose in 1965 was an excessive growth of the building industry in that year which inflated the economy and caused the difficulties we have suffered since. There is a danger that something similar will happen here unless steps are taken to co-ordinate this massive investment programme in industry with the rest of the programme.  The information is readily to hand.  It is simply a matter of carrying out this <Col N="873" /> exercise.  I urge on the Minister if we pass this Bill to take this step and not to act in the irresponsible manner to which he has publicly admitted here today.</P>

      <P>Senator FitzGerald is getting himself worked up into a lather about nothing.  Certainly his concern must be based on a misunderstanding.

      <P>It will not, of course, tell you either the amount of money that you are going to pay on these when they are processed nor will it tell you the period over which you will pay it.  I am sure the Senator will appreciate that it is very likely that in a rush of applications as we have had, there is likely to be a higher percentage of applications which might be rejected or applications which might be exaggerated than one would normally have but allowing for these variations we know from the figures I quoted up to 31st March, 1967, when the total of grants approved was £13,897,540, and up to that time the amount actually paid for adaptation grants on foot of those approvals was £6,112,089; the approximate amount we are going to have to pay in the future and the forward planning for this, in fact, covers a period of three years of our estimate of what it would take is on the basis of a forward estimate of three years.  I may have misled the Senator when I said two years.  We calculate over a period of three years ahead on each year.</P>

    <Title>Smelting Bill, 1966: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to procure that the smelting of ore concentrates will be carried on only under licence.  This control will apply to the smelting of all metals although, as will be apparent as I go on, the immediate intention is to control the smelting of lead and zinc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mining of ores in this country is already on a substantial scale but the processes carried out at our mines are confined to the reduction of the ores into ore concentrates, all of which are at present exported.  Obviously, it is desirable to encourage by all possible means any proposals which would lead to an increase in the extent of income and employment which this country can derive from its natural resources.  The establishment here of <Col N="875" /> a smelter to extract the metals themselves from the concentrates would be a major asset to our economy.  Smelting is, however, an enterprise which involves a very high capital investment and the economics of a smelting project, therefore, require very careful study.  The probable life of a mine or mines to feed the smelter and the feasibility of profitable disposal of the by-products of smelting are among the matters which must be investigated.</P>
    <P>A group of companies, at present involved in the mining of lead and zinc in this country, proposes to study, with the aid of consultants, the prospects for the establishment of a viable smelter here.  This study alone will involve the group in considerable outlay. The purpose of the study is, first, to decide whether the establishment of a smelter in this country would be an economic proposition at all and, if so, then to ascertain whether the necessary financial backing can be procured.  It is hardly likely that this country could support more than one smelter, if, indeed, one proves to be feasible.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to make it mandatory to obtain a licence from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to undertake the smelting of metals from ores.  It is my intention, if this legislation is enacted, to give a conditional licence to the group that I have mentioned.  This will enable the group to carry out the vital preliminary study. If the study should indicate that the erection and operation of a smelter here is technically and economically sound and if, for any reason, the group concerned are not prepared to undertake such a project, I will have power to consider alternative propositions.</P>
    <P>During the final discussion of this Bill in Dáil Éireann, some anxiety was expressed as to the possibility that a mining company not connected with the group might be prevented from establishing a smelter in Ireland to process ore concentrates produced in its own mines.  I said that it was not my intention that a licence would be refused in such a case and I promised to make a statement in the Seanad as to the exact nature of the undertaking <Col N="876" /> I have given to the group to whom I propose to give a licence.</P>
    <P>I indicated that it might not be feasible to lay before the House copies of the actual correspondence in this regard, since this might involve the disclosure of information of a confidential nature about the business of the group and, in fact, this has proved to be the case.  My commitment took the form of an acceptance of proposals contained in a letter from the group of companies.  I indicated to them in writing that provided the necessary study and, in due course, the construction of a smelter was undertaken by the company to be formed by the group, it was my intention, upon the enactment of this legislation, to give this company a licence and to arrange that for a period of 10 years from the commencement of operation of their smelter no other licences for the smelting of lead and zinc would be issued. It was clearly set out in the correspondence, however, that this restriction on the issue of additional licences would not apply to any company which would propose to construct and operate a smelter solely and exclusively for the purpose of smelting zinc and/or lead concentrates produced from a mine in Ireland owned by such company or any subsidary thereof.</P>
    <P>I assure the Seanad that this exclusion from the restrictions on the granting of licences has not subsequently been altered or qualified in any way.</P>
    <P>The particular advantage or incentive which the legislation would accord to the promoting group is that they will be entitled by licence to have the first opportunity to explore the feasibility of having a smelter here, from both the technical and commercial aspects.  Not only can this be regarded as a recognition of the group's enterprise in being the first to declare preparedness to undertake such a project but I am satisfied that, from the commercial aspect, the financial backing for a smelter of the type envisaged will not be forthcoming unless the group can show that they, and they only, will be licensed to operate a smelter in this country which can process ores and concentrates from all sources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> There is nothing in the Bill to prevent mine operators in Ireland, other than those responsible for establishing a smelter here, from continuing any existing arrangements for sending their concentrates elsewhere to be smelted.  I would hope, however, that if the smelter is constructed the smelting company will be able to offer sufficiently attractive terms to induce all operators of lead and zinc mines in Ireland to have their smelting done here.  It would be the intention of the smelting company to provide facilities for smelting on an economic and competitive basis all technically suitable lead and zinc concentrates offered to them and produced from mines in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I trust that I have made it clear that the sole purpose of this Bill is to facilitate the bringing into being in this country of a new and important industry which it might otherwise not be possible to procure.  I, therefore, recommend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There will not, I think, be any serious debate in this House about the desirability of the establishment here of a smelter, if this should prove to be feasible.  There will, on the contrary, be an agreement that the erection of such a facility would be of considerable national benefit.  It would represent a higher degree of processing within this country of a natural resource and its economic benefits would be analogous to those which result from the further processing within this country of agricultural products.  Indeed, much of our economic development in this country has suffered from the fact that it has been piecemeal and that there has been too little linkage forwards or backwards in the whole industrial process to have made those investments as fruitful as they might have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, many of our difficulties in regard to economic development may well be traceable to this piecemeal development.  Therefore, a proposition to insert a smelter which would take the production of a primary industry such as mining and its processing to a high degree and, therefore, make available readily within this country <Col N="878" /> the raw materials for a metal industry, is something wholly desirable.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Oireachtas should be prepared to facilitate the erection of a smelter in order that the country would benefit in this way. The difficulties one has in regard to the Bill arise from the fact that the Minister has stated here, as he stated in the other House, that it is his intention, initially at any rate, to grant only one licence for the erection of the smelter. This, of course, involves an element of monopoly.  While in his speech recommending this in the Seanad today the Minister has more closely circumscribed the commitment which he is prepared to enter into, nevertheless, there must still be reservations on this particular point.  Indeed, any proposition to establish even a quasi-monopoly is something which must be thoroughly justified by special circumstances. Accordingly, I think it is a pity, perhaps even it is to be deplored, that the Minister in introducing a Bill like this Bill, in which there is an element of monopoly, should have done so without producing an explanatory memorandum.  In fact, we find ourselves now discussing this Bill here and it is only now for the first time when the Minister proposed this to the Seanad, after the Bill has been through all its Stages in the Dáil, that a limitation of time appears in the Minister's proposal.  It would appear from the whole of the Dáil debate that many things were confused at the beginning of that debate which were clarified in the course of it.  It was not clear at the beginning of that debate whether people would be entitled to smelt their own ores or ore concentrates.  But even at the end of that debate there was still no word of whether this licence which can only be revoked under certain conditions was to be a permanent licence and whether it would be a permanent monopoly.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the detail that is in the Minister's statement here today was not in an explanatory memorandum right from the beginning.  It would have facilitated the debate in the Dáil and would have facilitated the debate here.  There is an element <Col N="879" /> of monopoly here and there must be special justification for this.</P>
    <P>Some time towards the end of the last century a writer described the growth of the liberty of the individual as something which in the course of history had broadened from precedent to precedent.  I am afraid that at this time the liberty of the individual and the liberty of the group in the community tend to get narrowed from precedent to precedent.</P>
    <P>We have here an unusual proposal and so we should take it carefully and slowly.  The Minister, in recommending this Bill to us indicated that he feels, unless he is prepared to give a strong undertaking to one particular group, feasibility study in regard to a smelter may not go ahead and he feels that this is such a desirable thing that he should be able to enter into a very strong commitment.</P>
    <P>When the Minister comes to this House of the Oireachtas he should be able to say more to us than he has said.  When we are asked to do what the Minister asks us to do here, to put everything into his hands, when it is his declared intention that for ten years he will not grant a second licence in regard to the smelting of this type of ore, I think he should be prepared to give us some more information.</P>
    <P>It would help us if we were to know how much has been spent already on preliminary studies in regard to this matter, how much is proposed to be spent on the feasibility study, not exact amounts but what is the order of the cost.  The Minister has, indeed, now at this late stage, told us of the extent of the Government's commitment. It now appears clear from what the Minister said that the Government's commitment in regard to this particular group of companies is a commitment in regard to lead and zinc only and one which will run out in ten years.</P>
    <P>This, of course, does not show on the face of the Bill, and I think a Bill which will create a situation of monopoly in the smelting of lead and zinc for ten years should show the monopoly situation on its face.  The very least we should have had is an explanatory <Col N="880" /> memorandum which would have indicated to us what the situation was.</P>
    <P>We must, then, be careful in our examination of this proposal.  It is true to say, and we can agree with the Minister, that those who have put forward this proposal have put forward a proposal which we would all like to see coming to fruition.  While this particular group contribute to the development of our economy through the work they have done in regard to mining in a particular area, we must not neglect those others who have made, or are likely to make, now or in the immediate future, similar contributions to this important industry.</P>
    <P>I think it should be quite specific, if necessary specified in the Bill itself, that other mining interests in this country have the liberty to export their ores or ore concentrates.  They cannot do so, I understand, at the moment without a licence from the Minister. We need here a firm guarantee.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said, again at this late stage, in his speech recommending this Bill to the Seanad, that these other mining interests will also be able to smelt their own ore.  This, again, is not apparent in the Bill and does not appear on the face of it.  The Minister may well say that it is not necessary that it should be so but I am not so sure.</P>
    <P>If one of these other mining interests wish to carry out smelting of one type or another in regard to their ores or ore concentrates, the Minister might, in accordance with the commitments which he has given, be prepared to grant them a licence but it may well be that the company which got the original licence from the Minister might well be able to go to the High Court and have it determined despite what the Minister might say that the original licence granted to them, in fact, covered this new operation.  Since the Minister has no power under this Bill unilaterally to revoke a licence he may well find himself powerless in this regard.  Some of these mining interests, for example, would probably if they intended to smelt their own ores do so, not through the mining company or even through a subsidiary <Col N="881" /> company as mentioned by the Minister, but might operate through an associate company which might be associated with the mining company, both being in a holding company.  In such a case there might and probably would be a determination of the division of cost between mining and smelting. It might well be that the structure of these associate companies would be such that there would be real charges between the associate companies and it might well, under those circumstances, be held that such an operation even if done with an associate company was something done as stated in the Act &ldquo;by way of trade or for the purposes of gain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When the Minister is giving an irrevocable licence for ten years these are all matters which must carefully be gone into.  We must be careful here with what is an extremely wide definition of smelting which is included in section 1 of the Bill, which says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;smelting&rdquo; includes extracting metal by a pyrometallurgical, chemical, leaching or electrolytic process</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is so wide that it includes not only all the existing methods of extraction and concentration but, indeed, new techniques which may well be developed within the next ten years.  In fact, some of the techniques covered by this definition do not involve smelting in the ordinary sense of the word.  Many of the processes covered by the definition in the Bill are processes under which the metal is recovered underground in the mine itself.  I think there might be serious difficulties in regard to this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be tied in with the other point but I doubt if it is within the definition on the face of it.  I think that these are all points on which we would have to be completely clear before we would pass this Bill in its final form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is to be hoped, of course, that if this smelter were in operation it would <Col N="882" /> act for other mining companies where this was mutually satisfactory, but, of course, the presence of monopoly always presents the danger of monopoly prices.  Even if the Minister in the conditions attached to the licence had indicated that there were to be certain guarantees in this regard the Minister's power is not very great.  The Minister, indeed, can only intervene to revoke a licence if an offence has continued for six months.  In the short-term here there might be a serious situation which would be otherwise remedied.  However, these are points more of detail which need to be teased out on Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>On the general principle I think it can be said, as indicated at the beginning, that the benefit to this country of a smelter is such that there must be among the Members of this House agreement in principle to the facilitation of the erection of such a smelter. If this involves a degree of monopoly we must, I think, be prepared to accept this under these particular circumstances because of the nature of the project and the extremely heavy capital investment involved.</P>
    <P>But while we are prepared to agree to this with reluctance I think that there is need for clarification in regard to many points of the Bill.  It can be dismissed as merely an enabling Bill to allow the Minister to grant a licence or licences under certain circumstances, but it is a Bill that enables a monopoly to come into being. It may be a limited monopoly but, nevertheless, it is quite a real one and on these points we must be careful, particularly on the wide meaning of &ldquo;smelting&rdquo;, which indicates that either we should narrow that definition or that we should narrow the scope of the licence to be granted. At this point in my notes here I had a remark to the effect that it was highly necessary that the granting of a licence should be limited in time. I would urge the Minister that this should, indeed, be the case, but he has indicated for the first time in his recommendation to us today his intention to let the first licence run unchallenged for ten years.  I myself would have thought that five years <Col N="883" /> might have been a more appropriate period.</P>
    <P>The granting of this initial licence or of any subsequent licence regarding any particular type of ore other than lead or zinc will be a virtual monopoly, and I do not think that we in this House should be asked to pass an enabling Bill to allow the Minister to grant a monopoly licence without the terms of this monopoly licence being laid before the House.  I would urge the Minister most strongly that an Order made by him in regard to either the granting of a licence or the revocation of a licence or perhaps even the transfer of a licence which is provided for in the Bill should be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and subject to annulment within 21 days.  This, of course, is for the purpose not of having the House reverse an undertaking or commitment of the Minister but so that the Members of the Oireachtas and the public would know the terms of the monopoly.  This is not a matter of private business.  It is a matter of monopoly and public interest, and the terms should be published and should be known.</P>
    <P>As I say, the principle and idea of facilitating the erection of a smelter is a good thing, and there would be no difficulty about the House agreeing in principle to it but as regards details of the Bill there are many things at which we should take another look.  Among the amendments that would have to be made on Committee Stage is an amendment to section 10 which now reads that this Act may be cited as the Smelting Act, 1967.  I do not know if we need to make any amendment there immediately but if we find the Minister co-operative on Committee Stage it might only be necessary to alter that to 1968 and not to 1969.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the last speaker indicated, I am sure that there will be almost unanimous agreement in the House that this legislation which facilitates the establishment of a smelter is in the economic interests of the country.  The Minister has indicated in introducing the Bill that it is hoped that the plant, if and when established, <Col N="884" /> will be used as widely as possible by all engaged in the mining, particularly of lead and zinc.  It is proper to say at this stage that, as the Minister has said, this is what we might term the final step in exploiting fully the natural resources of the country, particularly the mineral resources, in which field there has been very signicant development in recent years.  In Tipperary in particular we have seen the immense benefit of the mining development in both North and South Tipperary and we have every reason to appreciate fully, and the interests concerned appreciate fully, the initiative that the Government have given to such mining activity.  It is for that reason that we look forward to the further extension of the mining activity at present being carried on.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister something which might not be immediately his function.  In considering the granting of this licence, which would be limited to a fixed period in the first instance, he should consider the economic advantage of facilitating all companies at present engaged, and for that reason the situation of the smelting centre is a matter requiring immediate consideration to facilitate all the industries concerned.  I would, with a certain degree of selfish interest, recommend to him that in considering this he would recommend to those involved that the town of Nenagh would be of immense suitability for this purpose, in that it is almost equidistant from all of the mining fields at present in operation in Galway, North Tipperary and South Tipperary, it is not far distant from any one of them and is immediately available to one of them.  Secondly, it has, of course, an immediate outlet by rail and road to the great port of Limerick and Foynes through which much of the product of the Silvermines is at present being exported.</P>
      <P>I will reserve further comments on the Bill to a later stage, but I would request the Minister to consider the convenience and facility of all the companies concerned when the question of allocation, which would, indeed, occur to him, is one of the utmost importance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly (Longford) Mr. P. O'Reilly (Longford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Longford):</i> I suppose that one can understand the views expressed quite sincerely by Senator Dooge on this matter.  One can see the Minister's difficulty in this matter of the necessity for making some progress in the establishment of a smelter, that unless there is some guarantee to a company or group or association of companies acting in co-operation, then nothing will be done.  Against that, there is the legitimate feeling, which has been expressed by Senator Dooge and which can be held by myself, by other Senators and even by the Minister, that the Minister ultimately must come down on one side or the other and take some risk.  Mining is a high-risk industry and my view is that the Minister must take the steps he is seeking in the Bill to grant a licence to a company, a group of companies or to an association.  I suggest a little more study should be given to the matter, some amendments may be necessary and the giving of a little time to the consideration of the Bill may help to clarify the Minister.  I feel sure the Minister did not intend that he might get legislation from the Oireachtas under, shall I say, false pretences&mdash; without giving sufficient information.  I am satisfied that was not intended and it would be a pity if any one of us had reason to hold that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, mining is a high-risk industry both as an occupation and from the point of view of capital involved and the mentality of the people who participate in such an activity is geared to that sort of thing.  That probably explains the fears expressed by Senator Dooge.  Therefore, the Minister might indicate in his reply whether the people who will be involved in this smelter undertaking will be an association or a group of companies &mdash; principal and subsidaries &mdash; or a group of companies coming together in a federation to do just this thing, similar to the composition of the operators of the refinery at Cork.  No one would like to see a principal and subsidaries having an absolute monopoly which they could use to crush or thwart the efforts of people who would go into operation in the future and thus render <Col N="886" /> mining a less economic undertaking for small operators.  I know that sort of thing can happen and none of us likes to see it happen.  It would be well, therefore, that the Minister should give us information on this aspect.</P>
    <P>On the question of the ten-year period, to my mind that is not inordinately long, though Senator Dooge suggested that five years would be sufficient.  I should like to emphasise that before anything can happen the licence must be issued and I take it that the period of ten years would operate from the date of the issue of the licence by the Minister&mdash;that it is from that date that the smelter may go into physical operation.  Therefore, I do not think it would be practically possible to provide a much shorter time than ten years.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy raised the question of the location of the smelter and suggested a town in Tipperary as being the most central place.  There are other economic factors involved and though I am not suggesting that the town suggested by Senator O'Kennedy is not the most economic, this is a matter in which the Minister should have a say in the long run as a matter of public interest.  I wonder how far the Minister will have power to attach conditions to the licence governing the point raised by Senator O'Kennedy.  I know that a concern in North and Mid-Longford are engaged in an operation involving the mining of zinc and I am afraid the people of Mid-Longford, if they were consulted, would hardly agree with Senator O'Kennedy.  As I have said, this is a matter in which the Minister must have a say and he should, therefore, have power to attach conditions to a licence.</P>
    <P>That brings me to my concluding point.  I suggest that it will become necessary in the case of mining operators concerned with zinc and lead that they be given the service provided by the smelter without any extra penalty &mdash;that the non-connected operators would not suffer any economic disadvantage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator O'Reilly at one stage, put his finger on the <Col N="887" /> kernel of this matter, namely, that if we want to have any possibility of a smelter in this country it has got to be approached in this way.  Ideally, we would not approach it in this way but, in practice, having regard to the expense involved, the difficult problem involved technically and the various aspects that have to be considered in the feasibility studies, and having regard to the fact that it is unlikely that there will be ore for more than one smelter to operate economically in this country, unless we approach the matter in this way, undertaking with one group that, if they go ahead with the smelter, they will be able to ensure that they will be the only smelter, subject to the qualifications I mentioned when introducing the Bill.  They would not be able to raise the money necessary to finance this because quite a substantial sum of money is involved. Therefore, I approach this matter in the way I indicated when introducing the Bill, on the purely pragmatic basis of trying to ensure that everything that could be done to have a smelter erected in this country would be done. If I had adopted any other attitude and said I would not favour one group rather than another, it might appear very laudable but, in fact, it would effectively ensure that we would never have a smelter in this country.</P>
      <P>The undertakings that have been given and spelled out here are very much narrower in their application than might appear from listening to some of the speeches, especially that of Senator Dooge.  I suggest that what is proposed to be done here can be described as giving a monopoly only if one uses the term &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo; in a very restricted sense.  Some of Senator Dooge's suggestions as to items which perhaps should have appeared in the Bill&mdash;according to him&mdash;make sense only if one accepts that it is proposed to give a monopoly: in fact, it is not.  What is proposed is to give only one licence for a smelter, subject to this, that any firm wishing to erect a smelter to process its own ore is quite free to do so.  Also, any firm wishing to export its ore, as it does at present, will continue to do so.</P>

      <Col N="888" /> At the moment, all the mines of this country have to export because we have no smelter here.  Many of them are operating under a fairly long-term contract for the supply of material abroad and are obliged to do this because some of the smelting companies have invested considerable capital in their operations and it will take time for the various mines-to work off these obligations.  There is no question of restricting the right of any company to export its ore or to erect its own smelter for the processing of its own ore.  In these circumstances, it is somewhat misleading to describe this as a monopoly for a smelter.</P>
    <P>The question raised by Senator O'Reilly, arising out of this approach to it, concerned the possibility that some company which was not one of the group operating the smelter might be victimised.  In my opinion, it could not arise.  If the smelting company here wants business from other mines in Ireland, it must be competitive.  If it is not, the other mine will export its ore to smelters.  If the smelter here is not competitive, it will not get the business.  It is as simple as that.  In these circumstances, it is somewhat misleading to talk of a situation envisaged here as a monopoly when, in fact, people are not obliged to deal with the smelter, to supply ore, and when, in fact, they are allowed to erect a smelter for their own ore.</P>
    <P>Having regard to that perspective, it should be clear that we are not proposing a monopoly.  A number of things were suggested that might be in the Bill.  We must envisage a situation in which the group to whom the undertaking was given might decide not to proceed with the proposed smelter and another group might proceed. We must envisage the situation where some mining company might have a mine with sufficient ore in it to justify, in their opinion, the erection of a smelter for their own ore. The Bill has to cover all these situations.</P>
    <P>What the Bill is doing is providing for the issue of a licence for anybody who wants to erect a smelter and providing conditions which may be <Col N="889" /> applied.  I have indicated to the House the way it is intended to operate this. I repeat that there is no question of granting a monopoly, in the normal sense of the term, to any group and that, in order to have any possibility of getting a smelter erected in this country, it was necessary and is necessary to proceed in this way.</P>
    <P>Some mining groups which are now possibly somewhat interested in this matter did not display any interest in the erection of a smelter at the time when this proposal was put to me. They were not interested in it at all. Indeed, there are some who may be interested in the future who would not be interested now.  It seems to me that, from the point of view of the national interest, we must proceed on whatever way appears most likely to lead to the erection of a smelter in this country at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the line of approach we have adopted in this Bill is the one that will produce the quickest results.  I am satisfied also that the conditions which are been imposed, as made clear to both Houses, are not such as to create a monopoly or to put any other mining company at any disadvantage whatsoever.  I trust I have made these conditions clear to the House.  It is important that it should clearly be understood that we are operating in what appears to be the national interest and that we are not operating to the detriment of people other than the group to whom it is proposed to issue this licence.</P>

    <Title>Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Bill, 1968    (Certified Money Bill):    Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard) Michael Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>Retired pay, pensions and gratuities for or in respect of former members of the Permanent Defence Force (including the Army Nursing Service) and the Chaplaincy Service are prescribed by Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes which are made under the authority contained in the Defence <Col N="890" /> Forces (Pensions) Act, 1932, as amended.  Section 4 of that Act provides that no pension scheme shall come into force until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and has been confirmed by resolution of each House.</P>
      <P>The Bill concerns two types of pension increases which can be described as &ldquo;automatic&rdquo;.  The first is an increase related to an increase in remuneration; in other words, when the remuneration is increased, the pension must also be increased.  The second is what has come to be known as a &ldquo;Budgetary&rdquo; increase &mdash; the type of increase applicable to State pensioners generally and announced by the Minister for Finance in connection with a Budget.</P>
      <P>Up to now the practice has been to give statutory effect to such increases by way of amendments to the Military Service Pensions Acts, the Army Pensions Acts, the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Acts and the MacSwiney (Pension) Acts, and by amending Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes.</P>
      <P>These measures take up a certain amount of parliamentary time, and in the course of the debates on the Army Pensions (Increase) Bill, 1964, reference was made in this House to the desirability of simplifying the procedure for promulgating increases of the particular types I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>The Pensions (Increase) Act, 1964, empowers the Minister for Finance to prescribe such increases by regulations, and it has been found possible to bring within its scope a number of the pensions for which the Minister for Defence is responsible.  Consequently, Budgetary increases in military service pensions, Connaught Rangers pensions and the pension under the MacSwiney (Pension) Acts are being dealt with under that particular procedure.  This machinery, however, was not adaptable for implementing increases in benefits under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes.  Neither was it possible to bring within its ambit benefits under the Army Pensions Acts, but I hope in the near future to introduce an amendment of these Acts which will also enable increases to be provided for by regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="891" /> Accordingly, the object of this Bill is to achieve the desired simplification in procedure in so far as Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes are concerned by providing that a pension scheme which deals with increases of the specific types I have mentioned will not require confirmation by formal resolution of each House to bring it into force, but will come into force as provided in the scheme.  Such a scheme would be laid before the House and would not be debated unless a resolution is moved for its annulment.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress that this new procedure will apply only to Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes dealing with the two &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; types of increases mentioned.  Any scheme relating to matters other than &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; increases will be subject to the existing procedure &mdash; that is to say, the scheme will not come into force until it has been confirmed by formal resolution of each House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There will, I think, be general agreement with the principle of the Bill which the Minister has proposed to us.  I feel we would be in agreement with him that automatic increases should not have to wait on the time of this or the other House for a motion to be put down, a motion which must be passed before the changes in the scheme take full effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, before we consent to the Bill in full I feel we must ask ourselves what is the difference between the situation in the past and the situation which the Minister now proposes for the future.  In the past changes in these pensions schemes required a positive resolution of the House.  Accordingly, these were circulated to all Members together with an explanatory memorandum and on their introduction in the House they were proposed by the Minister for Defence who explained exactly what was involved in these particular changes.  Therefore, the Members of the House were quite clear in regard to these matters.  Not only was the matter drawn to their attention by being specifically on the Order Paper but they were quite clear as to the implications of the change.  In the interests <Col N="892" /> of streamlining the procedures of the House we move from a procedure based on positive confirmation by resolution of the House to a procedure based on possible annulment by a resolution of the House.  There is a difference, a difference to which we must pay attention before we can discharge this Bill.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's proposal is adopted what will happen is that we will be notified in regard to these particular changes in the scheme; we may get an explanatory memorandum but it will be necessary for any Senator who wants to see the full implications of what happened to check it back against the existing scheme.  It might be thought that this would not be a very difficult matter but I am afraid it would.  I would, in this instance, like to draw the attention of the House to a report of a committee of this House.  It is the First Report of the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments which was appointed by this House on the 4th July, 1957.  This particular report was a report of July, 1958.  I quote from page 19:</P>
    <P>In the case of Instruments which have been subject to amendment over a period of years such as the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme, 1937, the Select Committee is of the opinion that there is a need for consolidation and it would be glad to see this work undertaken at a convenient opportunity.</P>
    <P>In its report of July, 1958, the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments, which is a committee of this House, drew attention to the need for consolidation of the very scheme which is the subject matter of the Bill which the Minister is bringing into us here today. I feel that the Minister should inform the House of how much progress has been made in the past ten years in regard to the consolidation of these schemes and the amendments to them. It may well be that the Department of Defence under the Minister has acted with all convenient speed.  It may well be that this scheme &mdash; which he now proposes should be the subject only of annulment and not of confirmation &mdash;is in a thoroughly consolidated form that, would delight the hearts of the <Col N="893" /> Statutory Instruments Committee but if so it has certainly not come to my attention.  If I am wrong in regard to this I would only be too glad to be corrected.  If I am right in thinking that this consolidation has not taken place, then this Bill should not be passed.  I do not think that this House should surrender its power in regard to a change from a scheme of positive confirmation to one of possible annulment unless it does so in regard to a consolidated scheme which a legislator can understand so that he does not have to go through a long paper chase, a sort of treasure hunt from amendment to amendment, until he finds out what is the exact purport of what is in the latest proposed amendment.</P>
    <P>For that reason, while I say we agree with this streamlining of the procedure, I feel that this Bill &mdash; to which there is no great objection in principle&mdash; should not come into force unless the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme to which it refers has already been consolidated and, if it has not been consolidated, should not come into force until it has.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dooge raised an important point but I think any of us who have been in this House for a number of years know that in practice we get these Bills on Budgets <i>et cetera</i> and I have never heard any objection to an increase being given in the pensions.  Usually the increase is announced in the Budget speech.  We might debate it or make a mention of it in the passing of the Finance Bill and then months later we get a Bill which puts in law what we have already possibly mentioned in a Finance Bill and, in fact, has been paid to the pensioners. It is unrealistic to mention at that stage that we do not agree to the increases which were proposed in the Budget and which are being paid to the pensioners.  It is a more realistic operation to put it on this basis.  I hope that the change in the method we have been dealing with those matters is an indication that in future military pensions and other similar pensions will be adjusted annually in order to maintain their purchasing power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill does not deal with this but <Col N="894" /> I hope this is an indication of intent. I remember Dr. Ryan, who is now a Member of this House, when speaking on this issue previously as Minister for Finance, indicated that he hoped this sort of adjustment in pensions to maintain their purchasing value would be a continuing process. Those may not be his exact words but I think they probably express the spirit of the type of undertaking he was giving.  I welcome the Bill as a sensible arrangement and, as I said, I hope it is an indication that he will have those sort of adjustments made annually in order to maintain the purchasing value of the pension of retired public service personnel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather in agreement with both Senators although there is somewhat of a disagreement between them.  I think Senator Murphy is probably wrong in his emphasis. It is precisely in regard to something everyone looks on as very good and not to be over-critical about detail that the House ought to be wary of the disappearance of detail.  If the Minister were to propose reducing pensions then everybody would be on their guard and would watch every possible way of stopping what he was trying to do but when he is doing something special everyone is inclined to say that he is doing something good and we will pass it quickly.</P>
      <P>I am not in agreement that what is in the Bill is an improvement from the point of view of streamlining the manner in which this should be done. I am very glad that Senator Dooge drew attention to the matter of the statutory instruments.  I presume it would be unwise if I attempted to embark on a discussion of Defence Force Regulations of all sorts but my recollection is that this deals with Army Pensions and one is somewhat in the wilderness to find one's way about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be happy if, as Senator Dooge suggested, the Minister would at least bring this part of the Defence Force Regulations into some sort of recognisable state.  Are was to perpetuate the practice of referring, for instance, to paragraph (3) of subsection (2) being <Col N="895" /> amended by the deletion of the word &ldquo;six&rdquo; and the insertion of the word &ldquo;eight&rdquo;?  Because you then have to go back to see behind what was &ldquo;four&rdquo; and originally &ldquo;two&rdquo;.  One has to go back years before one finds out what was meant at the beginning.</P>
    <P>I am glad Senator Dooge referred to it.  This is something which has been a source of worry to the Statutory Instruments Committee.  I understood that efforts were being made in the Department to have something done about this.  We appreciate it is not easy.  So many regulations are amended that it is hard to decide at what point in time to start but in a case like this if any streamlining machinery were brought into use it would be a very good thing to consolidate the Army pension regulations so that in future, as Senator Dooge says, if members of the Seanad are aware that such and such a percentage was to be added to existing sums at least they would know what the existing sums were and what it all means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Following recommendations both in the Dáil and in this House this Bill has been introduced, as Senator Murphy says, as a sensible arrangement whereby two specific types of increases can be implemented without the need for coming to both Houses of the Oireachtas with an amending pensions schemes under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act.  They are automatic increases.  They are specified in section 3 of the Bill and the Bill does not purport to deal with anything more than that.  Any new pensions scheme would be subject to the law as it stands and the Minister for Defence would have to introduce such a scheme in both Houses of the Oireachtas for approval by both Houses before it would become law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are, in this instance, seeking to get statutory authority to pay pensions that are already increased by Budgetary action or arising from increased remuneration.  Some of the increases have already been paid but others have not &mdash; in cases where the £1 a week increase in pay applied and the personnel concerned have finished <Col N="896" /> their time in the army.  In so far as the question raised by Senator Dooge is concerned regarding the consolidation of the pensions schemes, the position is that a certain amount of the work has been done in this direction but it has not been possible to finalise the work.  The Seanad can rest assured that the recommendation of the Statutory Instruments Committee is not being lost sight of, but at this stage I could not give any indication as to when the matter will be finalised.  I do not think any other points have been raised which call for comment by me.  It is a simple Bill, self-explanatory and I do not think that any other points arise.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Social Welfare (Insurance Inclusions and Exclusions) Regulations, 1968, proposed to be made by the Minister for Social Welfare and laid in draft, sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, before Seanad Éireann on the 31st day of January, 1968, under sub-section (6) of Section 4 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, be approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these regulations is to bring the employment of managers of employment offices within the scope of the social insurance scheme.  Hitherto the employment was not insurable under the Social Welfare Acts not being under a contract of service.  Neither was it regarded as employment in the Civil Service which in itself would have made it insurable <Col N="897" /> whether under a contract of service or not.  The method being adopted to secure this position is to include the employment among those specified as insurable in Part I of the First Schedule to the Social Welfare Act, 1952.</P>
      <P>The question of the insurability of the employment of managers was raised by their Association at a conciliation council comprising representatives of the Association and representatives of the Department of Labour.  The agreed recommendation of that council is that the employment be brought within the scope of the social insurance scheme.  Since managers are not pensionable and have no sick pay privileges, I consider that they should be fully insurable under the Acts.</P>
      <P>Article 3 of the regulations would make all employment as manager insurable.  Where, however, the employment is of a subsidiary nature or the manager is not mainly dependent on the remuneration for his livelihood it is proposed to exclude it from the effect of Article 3.  This is being achieved by Article 4 of the draft regulations which adds this type of employment to the list of employments specified in Part II of the First Schedule to the Act as being excepted from insurance.</P>
      <P>I recommend the resolution for the approval of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there will be general agreement with this proposal and it is not a matter which necessitates lengthy debate in the House.  There seems to be agreement among all those concerned that they be included within the scheme and, accordingly, the Minister and the House will facilitate them.</P>
      <P>The only point that arises with regard to inclusions and exclusions of this type is that this development in our social welfare regulations and schemes with the inclusion of people such as the managers of employment offices and the like seems to indicate more and more the necessity that our whole social welfare system should be revised in such a way that both contributions and benefits should be wage-related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the difficulty of whether to <Col N="898" /> include or exclude certain persons is increased by flat-rate contributions and flat-rate benefits.  I merely make this comment in passing on this particular minor change because I think it highlights the more fundamental change desirable in our social welfare legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this change.  I should like the Minister in his reply to tell us approximately the number involved in this and give a general idea as to the salary and rates paid.  I presume these people would not be affected by the £1,200 which operates to the exclusion of people from the full social welfare benefits. I do not know whether it would be fair in such a matter as this to ask the Minister if he has made any progress in his examination of the social welfare arrangements, if that is the proper expression, in this country.  I think they are being widened progressively.</P>
      <P>For many years now the introduction of widows' and orphans' benefits, occupational injuries and this sort of thing, the increase in contributions and the increase in benefits, would make it appear to be necessary to take a fresh look at our situation here.  The thinking originally was that these were very minimum benefits provided only for the lower-paid.  I should like to see a situation included whereby benefits and contributions would be wage related and as well that we would take another look at the exclusion of such a large section of our contributors from the obligation contributions and the cover which is necessary.</P>
      <P>I think the situation is that we largely inherited the arrangements from Britain &mdash; the employment benefit and certainly the national health. These have been merged in the years into social welfare generally.  In principle, we ought to take a look at whether large sectors are excluded from social welfare and I think it would be desirable that we took a fresh look at the situation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many anomalies in the present situation.  This is probably not the time to go into detail on those but perhaps the Minister might give an indication in his reply whether any <Col N="899" /> progress has been made in looking at that and in taking a fresh look at the whole situation and bringing the general arrangements in regard to social welfare more up-to-date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points that occur to me on this particular motion.  The first is that when one receives this kind of document&mdash; in fact, one does not get it, it is laid in draft on the table &mdash; it is very difficult for ordinary Senators like myself who do not possess a detailed knowledge of the Statutory Rules and Orders under the Social Welfare Acts to understand what all this is about.  It would be a good practice on the part of the Minister for Social Welfare and every other Minister in cases of this kind to give some idea in advance as to what the position is.</P>
      <P>The second point arises out of Statutory Instruments of this kind and, indeed, in relation to a good deal of legislation.  I would invite the House to have a look at this mumbo-jumbo produced as a piece of legislation by the Minister's Department.  I object, and I continue to object, to wording of this kind:</P>
      <P>These Regulations may be cited as the Social Welfare (Insurance Inclusions and Exclusions) Regulations, 1968.</P>
      <P>I do not see any reason why we cannot, particularly with our Social Welfare Regulations, begin at the beginning and call them 1, 2, 3, 4, and refer to them in that way saying &ldquo;this is under Regulation 57&rdquo; instead of stating &ldquo;(Inclusions and Exclusions) Regulations, 1968&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In modern times, when we are concerned with streamlining things, this is an extraordinary piece of draftsmanship. We have in sub-paragraph (2):</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare (Insurance Inclusions and Exclusions) Regulations, 1952 (S.I. No. 373 of 1952) and these Regulations shall be construed as one and may be cited together as the Social Welfare (Insurance Inclusions and Exclusions) Regulations, 1952 and 1968.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Ash Wednesday might well be a day on which the Government ought to repent, especially considering what is going on in the other House.</P>
      <P>There is another matter to which I should like to call the attention of the Minister.  If we are going to use English we ought to use it properly.  I am sorry to say that the Minister, for whom we all have a genuine admiration, is being dropped by the Government and employed as the manager of an employment exchange.  It says: &ldquo;Employment by the Minister for Labour as manager of an employment exchange.&rdquo;  I would have thought that if one were drafting it properly one would have said &ldquo;Employment as manager of an employment exchange by the Minister for Labour&rdquo; or &ldquo;under contract with the Minister for Labour&rdquo;. The present regulations seem to suggest that it is the Minister for Labour who is being employed as manager of an employment office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that these observations will carry very little weight with the Minister, because we have been making observations of this kind for quite some time in this House and they have been regarded as the observations of persons who are cranky and difficult.  Might I say that this is like the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Act, 1967. Everybody refers to it now simply as the Occupational Injuries Act, 1967. We ought to drop that kind of thing. The Department of Industry and Commerce have been giving a very good example in this respect, and we have had the Transport Act, 1958, the Transport Act, 1963, and the Transport Act, 1965, which are all amendments of the parent Transport Act of 1950.  I do not see any reason why we should not follow that example, though even that Department have given us this evening a Bill called the Industrial Grants (Amendment) Bill, 1967, when <Col N="901" /> they could well have left it the Industrial Grants Bill.  I hope that the Minister might have a word with those concerned and try to bring some kind of order into these regulations so that people can call them by their appropriate names.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to raise a few questions.  I wonder, if these regulations are adopted, will we have a situation where the social welfare stamps are automatically stamped by the Minister for Social Welfare on behalf of the people who come within these regulations or will they themselves be required to make a contribution towards the cost of the social welfare stamp.  I know that this will refer to persons who are working more than 18 hours per contribution week at these exchange offices.  Any of us who are familiar with these offices can realise that these exchange managers, especially in the smaller towns, would not be getting anything like £1,200 a year.  Indeed, they would be getting a lot less.  I think that the Minister might indicate for the benefit of the Seanad what the salary scale is in relation to these managers whom we are discussing now.  I think that it is true to say that in many cases the managers concerned also provide the premises in which they work, and they are paid, of course, for the service they give as manager of the local exchange.  This proposal now will bring a good deal of benefits to the managers concerned.  They will be able to qualify for a number of the social welfare schemes which the holding of a social welfare stamp will provide for them.  I assume, for instance, that they might possibly benefit under the Redundancy Act from this proposed regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is rather likely.  We will, of course, always have unemployment with the present Government at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been some annoyance caused by arrangements made relating to the issue of payments to old age pensioners and others where local exchanges close down and they have to deal directly with the <Col N="902" /> Department.  In many cases those people have been left to starve down in their villages because the Department does not understand the circumstances in which they are living, and because those persons do not complete the form properly or promptly there is a delay in the issue of payments to them.</P>
      <P>I have old age pensioners in mind where there was a closing down of services in various localities.  I assume it is possible, too, that under the modern system of automation there may be employment exchanges closed down and the services will be given through the post office or just by correspondence with the Department of Social Welfare.  Generally speaking, it would be helpful if the Minister could give us even briefly the skeleton of the set-up so far as the majority of the exchanges are concerned.</P>
      <P>I know that we are not discussing the big city exchanges here or in Cork, Galway or Limerick, where we realise the kind of situation that exists.  But there are scores of employment exchanges all over the country and it would be fair at this stage to ask the Minister to give us a picture of the situation in those areas and the average earnings of the managers.  I assume that the salaries or earnings of those people are related somehow to the population of the area which the particular exchange serves.  It would be useful to know at this stage what allowance is made to the employment exchange managers in those smaller areas so that we would have some idea of the real value of the benefits which it is proposed to give by these new regulations.</P>

      <P>I did not anticipate that the prescribed form of this motion would end up with a discussion of the whole administration of the social welfare code, but I will endeavour to cover some of the points mentioned. This motion merely deals with one specific point, and that is the extension of the scheme of social insurance to one category who heretofore did not benefit, namely, the managers of employment exchanges.  It has already <Col N="903" /> been agreed with their own association and the consultative council that it should be done.  It is open to any category of persons to apply if at any time they think they have a claim and it will be considered in the same way. As regards the remuneration of these people it varies from one to another. They come under not my Department but the Department of Labour and there may be cases where they would be over the remuneration limit and not covered for that reason, but most of them would qualify.</P>
      <P>There is also the case of those who look upon being managers of exchanges as merely a sideline and who have other work which would be regarded as their main source of livelihood and they might not be insurable, as I have stated at the outset.  Those of them who are insurable will be qualified for all the benefits persons ordinarily insurable would be entitled to, including occupational injuries and redundancy.</P>
      <P>The question raised of pay-related benefits is something I have been examining in recent times in relation to what it might be possible to do here and what is being done in other countries, particularly in the six EEC countries.  One finds from the start that there is a tremendous variety of ways of meeting this in various places and it is done in different ways.  In Britain as we know they have overcome this problem by having supplementary benefits &mdash; just a basic rate and then supplementary benefits in which people can participate in relation to the amount by which their remuneration exceeds the basic figure.  Senator O'Quigley said the legal change is something all laymen will agree with.</P>

      <P>The legal profession were never too anxious to have this jargon changed.  I always felt they derived their livelihood from trying to sort out all brackets and the difficult terms for the layman who pays to have it done for him.  I am all in favour <Col N="904" /> of simplifying the legal jargon.  For us, the legal adviser in the Department compiles the draft and he ensures that it is watertight so that it will not be misinterpreted.  That applies to all legislation as we know it.  I cannot see anything wrong with having an explanatory leaflet circulated with the more complicated motions or Bills but not with a motion of this kind.  I do not think it is necessary because, first of all, it has been dealt with in the Dáil and, secondly, it is very easy to ascertain what it is all about &mdash; it applies to a simple matter.</P>
      <P>I was asked whether I had made any progress with the examination in depth of the social welfare code.  I have but I am reluctant to publish anything in the form of a White Paper which would first of all give the impression that we were immediately about to adopt a comprehensive scheme and put it into effect at a particular time.  I rather prefer to have a blueprint and, as time goes on, to implement it as necessary and in an order of priority.  It is not correct to say that there are a great many anomalies in the code.  There are a few.  It is true that the system has grown up but by comparison with any other country we have reasonably good cover.  The cover extends very well.  The rates may be criticised in relation to other countries but in the context of our national income or our gross national product, whichever you prefer, we are paying a big amount in social welfare and in social assistance &mdash; more than £65 million in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things people do not always seem to appreciate when making comparisons with highly industrialised countries is that 43 per cent of our payments are on the social assistance side, entirely a charge on the Exchequer. The remaining 57 per cent is on the social insurance side, paid to those who contribute to the various schemes, with the Exchequer paying approximately one-third.  With a very high percentage of our payments on the social assistance side, it is not always easy to have comprehensive schemes on the social insurance side that would take in all the sections we <Col N="905" /> should like to take in.  We might examine how far it may be possible to extend the social insurance schemes from the point of view of which other sections we might seek to contribute.</P>
    <P>These are matters in which we have made a good deal of progress.  Many of them have been examined already, some of them in relation to the drafting or revision of legislation, and I am endeavouring to compile an examination of them in a broader and more comprehensive manner but not for the purpose merely of issuing a White Paper to be adopted as a comprehensive social welfare policy or scheme but to set out the priorities in relation to any extensions or improvements in the <Col N="906" /> schemes.  We are always concerned, as time goes on, with the problem of increasing rates under existing schemes.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else I am called on to reply to.  I think I have referred to most of the points which were raised by Senators, relevantly or irrelevantly.  Of course, on an occasion such as this I am not prepared to cover the entire field of social welfare.  Another opportunity will arise for that.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 6.5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 6th March, 1968.</P>
