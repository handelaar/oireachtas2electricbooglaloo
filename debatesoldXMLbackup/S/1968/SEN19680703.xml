      <P>The Chair suggests that recommendations Nos. 1 and 2 and 4 to 16 inclusive be taken together. Separate decisions may be had on each.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to agree with the House and with you, Sir, because the principle of these recommendations is substantially the same. I put down these recommendations to alter the amount of the increase in respect of each increase that is allowed under the Bill, and instead of the magnitude of the increases which is proposed in the Bill&mdash;they stretch from the lowest which is a shade less than 50 per cent up to nearly 200 per cent in some cases&mdash;I am suggesting that the increases should be more of the order of ten per cent all round. I move recommendation No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 33, to delete &ldquo;£2,500&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£1,650&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I made the point that if a trade union going before the Labour Court puts in a plea for an increase in salaries or wages, the order of magnitude asked for by organised labour is something like 15 per cent and the reply from the employers is generally that five per cent or six per cent should be enough in &ldquo;these difficult and crucial times&rdquo;. The Labour Court itself usually comes down in the neighbourhood of 10 per cent; and it is with these thoughts in mind that I put down these amendments whereby, by the terms of the first of these, under section 3, Deputies, instead of having their allowances increased from £1,500 to £2,500 would have them increased by 10 per cent only to £1,650. This seems to me to be a legitimate amount to allow, even if we accept all the arguments put forward for these increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be prepared to concede the point in argument that a stronger case can be made for some Deputies and Senators than for others by reason of <Col N="860" /> the fact that they may have heavier commitments and also that in relation to their total incomes the Parliamentary allowance represents a bigger proportion than in the case of others. However, in order to apply this principle we would have to accept the principle of the means test. I tried to have that principle accepted on Second Stage but was not successful; I tried to put down a means test amendment here but it has been ruled outside the scope of the Bill, and I do not contest that ruling. If I want to have the increase reduced to 10 per cent instead of 66? per cent or 200 per cent within the scope of the Bill, I have to suggest an overall percentage which in some cases would hit Deputies and Senators harder than in others. That is the result of the scope of this Bill which was brought before us without any discrimination being made between those who may be severely hit and those less severely hit by reason of the fact that their other income is higher.</P>
    <P>It has been said, and it was said by the Minister, that unless substantial increases are made in these allowances we shall not be able to attract the best talent into the Dáil and Seanad. In another connection it has been said in the other House that with higher allowances they are likely to get a better type of candidate in elections and consequently a better type of Deputy. This seems to me to be a little offensive to the present Members of the Dáil and the Seanad, because of the implication that our quality can be greatly improved and that this can be achieved by holding out the glittering prize of more money. I objected to that on Second Stage, and I am giving effect to that objection by suggesting that we ought all be quite satisfied with a 10 per cent rise. The result of accepting my amendment will be that in each case.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that members of certain professions are not attracted to politics, by reason of the fact that in those professions they can earn quite a lot more than they could earn even as a Minister in the present Dáil, and that, therefore, the allowances for Ministers should go up by much more than the ten per cent that I am suggesting in <Col N="861" /> these amendments. It occurs to me that this competition with, say, the fees earned by senior members of the legal profession which are perhaps too high within our present society, is most harmful. In saying that I know that I am treading on dangerous ground. In this House or, indeed, in the other House, if one says anything in the slightest degree critical of the legal profession one is likely to get into trouble on all sides. Lawyers spring up all over the place to tell you (a) that most lawyers are earning very little, they are an impoverished tribe, and (b) to confirm the fact that present ministerial salaries would be unattractive to them compared with the very little they are now earning.</P>
    <P>It is true, of course, that there is a large disparity in the legal profession and in other professions between what is earned at the top and what is earned in the lower reaches, but I would ask the House to consider whether we are happy about this comparison. We are told that all of us must be paid more, and TDs must be paid more, and Ministers must be paid more, because otherwise we will not be able to attract people who can, in fact, earn £5,000, £6,000 or £10,000 a year practising as barristers, for instance. I speak of the legal profession, but there are others in a similar situation. Are we quite happy about that? Are we satisfied that the way in which our society distributes rewards which can be measured in money is equitable? Are we satisfied that we are succeeding &mdash;and I adopt the phrase of Senator FitzGerald&mdash;in narrowing the differentials or are we broadening the differentials between the vast mass of the Irish people, together with the rank and file in many professions and the highly-paid, the moneyed classes, the well-off classes, the well-paid politicians? Is the gap not being made wider, and should we not on the contrary be pleased if we find the gap is narrowing?</P>
    <P>The Minister might legitimately say that whether or not there is anything in this argument of mine it is not within his power to reduce the scale of fees earned by practising barristers. This is true, but I draw attention to the fact <Col N="862" /> that in our commercial society, in our society of free enterprise based on the profit motive, an essentially materialistic society, one of the results of this commercial, I might say money-pursuing society, is that the rate of fees that can be afforded by our large industrial and commercial companies in defence of their private interests in the law courts, the scale of fees that they can afford to pay, tends to condition our whole society and is one of the factors at least in this proposal in the Bill to overpay Senators, to overpay TDs, to overpay Ministers, to overpay the Attorney General, the Taoiseach, the Leaders of the Opposition and the others. In other words, this tendency to overpay results from something which I think is not good, I shall not use a stronger adjective, in the commercial and materialistic state which we have allowed to develop in this free Republic of ours. In other words, we are allowing ourselves far too much to be conditioned by the notion of private profit and major money gains.</P>
    <P>The Bill is asking for a 66? per cent increase in allowances for TDs although the TDs got a large increase four years ago. It is asking for a 50 per cent increase for Senators although we got a significant increase four years ago. It is asking for an increase of similar dimensions for the Taoiseach and the Ministers. The increase, unless my mathematics are letting me down, for the Taoiseach is something like 66?. The increase for the Ministers is a shade less, something like 62 per cent. It was brought out here last time and I might advert to it again that the Ministers are getting a double increase. I speak open to correction but I think I am right in saying that the Ministers are getting an extra £1,000 a year as TDs and an extra £1,300 a year as Ministers. This is a fairly big whack. In future the figure that will usually be quoted, if we pass this Bill unamended, as being the Minister's allowance or salary will be what is mentioned in the Bill, £3,500, and the public as a rule will not do the little piece of mental arithmetic of adding to this sum the increased amount the Minister will be getting as a TD. I speak open to correction but I think I am right in <Col N="863" /> saying that both of these will be drawn by all Ministers, that is to say, they will get £6,000 a year, and that under this Bill they are getting a double increase, an increase as a TD and an increase as a Minister.</P>
    <P>This is the Bill that is before us and that we are being asked to underwrite in front of the nation, in front of the people to whom we say: &ldquo;If you are an old age pensioner or a widow with £169 a year you are too well off to get an old age pension or a non-contributory widow's pension&rdquo;. The differential between them and us is very big, indeed, and I feel that the Seanad in its own conscience would feel a lot happier if it were to adopt my amendments which grant a ten per cent increase to all of us, but reject the Government's proposal, backed by all Parties in the Dáil, of percentage increases in the case of TDs and Senators ranging up to 66? per cent, and in other cases of 200%.</P>
    <P>It was said the other day, in a paragraph in one of our newspapers that by our action last week of delaying the Committee Stage for a week we in the Seanad had saved the Exchequer something in the order of £6,000. In view of the fact that the Minister has just told us that the total cost in a year would be something like £200,000 perhaps what we saved by this week's meditation has even been rather over £6,000. I think we saved £6,000 on the increases proposed for TDs and Senators alone. I might say I met a Member of the Lower House last week, a friend of mine, and he said: &ldquo;You cost me £20 the other night&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to mention the impact of (a) the allowance increase, (b) the slight delay in its being paid, and (c) my proposal, which after all is what is before us, that this amount should be diminished. I feel an illustrative anecdote of that kind has a certain relevance. However, having told the anecdote, I bow to your ruling.</P>
      <P>I am a little disconcerted, and here I come to the other amendments, to find how very big, on examination, the amount proposed in some cases is. Those, I have mentioned so far, have been of the order of a maximum of 66? per cent, and on a further amendment of mine I now want to mention a few which exceed that percentage. This 66? per cent seems to me to be an enormous increase. Yet, I find, with the greatest respect to you, Sir, that the first we come to of those above that percentage deals with the amount to be voted to the Deputy Chairman of Seanad Éireann. This is to be raised under section 8, to which I have a ten per cent amendment under the Bill, from £550 to £1,000. This is a rise of nearly 100 per cent. My suggestion is, of course, that it should be on the same basis as the rest and should be ten per cent.</P>
      <P>I should like, in saying this, to pay tribute not only to you, Sir, the Deputy Chairman of the Seanad, but also to your colleague, and to say, and I think in this House we all appreciate the fact very much the objectivity, the impartiality and the courtesy with which order is maintained by both of our presiding officers in this House, an example which I think could with profit be followed in some other places. This does not prevent me from saying that I think, in comparison with the order of magnitude of payment and remuneration in other spheres also proposed in this Bill, this 100 per cent increase is too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the top percentage, however, by any means. Section 9 proposes <Col N="865" /> that where formerly the Leader of a single Opposition Party would have got £5,040, instead he will now be entitled to £15,000, a rise from £5,040 to £15,000 a year. That is an increase of nearly 200 per cent. I am aware of the fact that Senator O'Quigley made the case, and I thought made it cogently, for the increase, and that he went so far as to say he would support £20,000, £30,000 or £40,000 for the Leader of the Opposition because of the fact that this money goes on research and goes to rendering more efficient the Opposition. From the point of view of Government, the granting of those allowances must be termed an enlightened measure, because its recognition of the necessity in a democratic State to have an efficient Opposition is obviously very valuable and praiseworthy.</P>
    <P>I feel here that for two reasons this method of encouraging efficiency in the Opposition, which is entirely well-meant on the part of the Government, is not necessarily the best way of doing it. I would prefer, for all-round efficiency both of TDs and Senators and also for the Opposition Parties, more ready access to a secretarial pool and of more group facilities of that kind rather than the payment of this large sum to the Leader of a single Party. That is why my proposal in amendment No. 12 is to reduce the proposed increase to one of 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is another element in that and it applies also to the other increases for Leaders of Opposition Parties, because, of course, in our Dáil at the moment there are two Leaders of Opposition Parties and, therefore, the amount involved is less, but I am not sure that the way in which this money is granted simply to the Leader of the Opposition, on the presumption that all of it will go towards efficient documentation, research and secretarial work, that that is the best way of ensuring that all the money will be best spent on rendering the Opposition Parties more efficient.</P>
    <P>Of course, I notice that in subsection (2) of section 9 the proposed increase is to be from the present £3,360 which goes to the Leader of the major Opposition Party, to £10,000, from <Col N="866" /> £3,360 to £10,000. Here again there is an increase of almost 200 per cent. I did not hear the Minister in his Second Stage opening remarks justifying this enormous percentage, which is here proposed and is so far above the 66? found elsewhere. The quantity, the order of magnitude, in those cases seems to me to be astonishingly high, and unwarranted. My feeling is that if the ordinary people of this country were to be asked: &ldquo;By what percentage do you think the salaries and allowances of our people who come under the provisions of this Bill should be raised?&rdquo;, if they gave a positive answer at all, which they might not, that the people of this country would say: &ldquo;We think 10 per cent is plenty&rdquo;. It is in that spirit I have put down those amendments which I now propose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I mention at the beginning two obvious difficulties that present themselves to anyone speaking on this subject? The first is that we suffer the penalty of having to increase or grant ourselves our income in respect of our Parliamentary duties. This, of course, as far as anyone has been able to discover, is an inescapable thing. It bothers a great many people in Parliament but no one has found any solution which is better, although all sorts of things have been suggested, but every one of them has had a grave disadvantage in it. If you involve any other body you do two things. You probably involve them in a certain amount of bother, which is always inevitable, and, secondly, you take away the supremacy of Parliament. The money must come out of the public purse and only Parliament has the right to provide it and to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I have a great respect for Senator Sheehy Skeffington. He is a useful Member of the Seanad. He has a very acute and determined mind but he has not had as much experience as I have had. There are all sorts of reasons for that. It is there I find fault with him. I do not think he is speaking from sufficient knowledge. I think he lives a life as a Senator that is very different from the average Senator. He lives in Dublin. His home <Col N="867" /> life is reasonably unaltered, I am sure, by the fact of his membership of this House. He is in a job which as far as I know whatever interference his Seanad duties may involve is not affected to as great an extent as many other people. He is not in a position to judge even the average.</P>
    <P>He has suggested that in his opinion a 10 per cent increase is sufficient. I would be inclined to agree with him if in my experience of 25 years there had been reasonably frequent increases. In my experience in 25 years with the exception of the first one they have all been subject to income tax. The Senator mentioned a means test. The Revenue Commissioners apply a reasonable one. Barristers and others will find that from the increases they get very little in plain fact. A Member of the other House admitted&mdash;he is not a legal man&mdash;that in plain fact what he would get is £200. I would say that from the point of view of differentiating between those who can effect Parliamentary duties independent of a Parliamentary allowance and those who do not get a sufficient allowance to carry out their Parliamentary duties and at the same time live as human beings, the Revenue Commissioners need no assistance from us. They are more than efficient.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I rose to speak in criticism of Senator Sheehy Skeffington is that I did not like his approach to the Second Reading. He referred to the indecent haste with which this legislation was introduced. It was made public long ago. There has been a greater delay since the time of the first mention of this Bill than ever before, so I do not see the indecent haste. There is the sort of feeling that here we are feathering our own nests. As I mentioned earlier, there is no one else to do it and we should face it. We owe it to the public that they should know what we are doing and everybody takes care that they do know. We can do all sorts of important things but the public are left relatively unaware of what we are up to and I think the public have got a completely distorted view of what membership of Dáil Éireann and <Col N="868" /> Seanad Éireann means to an individual.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that I should get an increase in my Parliamentary allowance. I have, I think, earned it. I have tried to do my best. It may not have been good but I have tried and I think I deserve it. Other people may disagree and they are entitled to their opinion. Membership of Parliament means a tremendous sacrifice to one's home life and one's business. I was a farmer and although one can say that this is exactly the type of business one can carry on while in politics and do quite well at it, I find this from experience is not true. The more time one spends on public life the less one farms. Those who have not farmed say that it is something one can do from a distance but you will find this is not true.</P>
    <P>I am not making a poor mouth about this. Relatively speaking, I enjoy public life more than I enjoy farming. I make no secret of that. If I had to go back 25 years I would do the same again. I have put a good deal of time and energy into my business as a Parliamentarian and I think the people owe me some measure of subsistence in relation to it and I see nothing wrong with a request for payment and I see nothing wrong with the present level suggested.</P>
    <P>There is another point which Senator Sheehy Skeffington made. He was rather illogical about it and it rather shocked me. He stated that if he were forced to take this increase he would devote it to some object of his own, that the last thing he would do was hand it back to the Minister. This expression &ldquo;hand it back to the Minister&rdquo; is nonsense. The Minister has nothing to do with it. The Minister is in charge of the public purse and if Senator Sheehy Skeffington thinks that he does not earn the money back to the public purse it goes. There is also this to be said about what Senator Sheehy Skeffington said. He said he would devote it to certain objects, but immediately he accepts it there is no difference between the objects to which he devotes it and my spending mine on, say, Guinness. Once you accept it, no <Col N="869" /> matter what your decision is it makes no difference. It is a decision on a private income and once it is accepted and a private decision made it does not matter what the decision is. Certainly it is open to anyone in my opinion to give the money back. It is the only possible thing anyone can do. If Senator Sheehy Skeffington thinks he is entitled to the opinion that he does not earn it as a representative of the public, he is then entitled to give the money back.</P>
    <P>This is largely my opinion and I have tried to indicate the reasons why I disagree with Senator Sheehy Skeffington. Were it anyone else but Senator Sheehy Skeffington I would have thought that it was for publicity. He has an unfortunate way of declaring that others do what he is doing himself. He has accused other people of sneering but he has done some himself. However, you do not go into politics unless you are prepared to be sneered at. I am sorry Senator Sheehy Skeffington adopted this attitude. It is a mistaken one and I disagree with his amendments.</P>

      <P>Yes, though that seems rather a harsh threat to hold over the heads of the rest of the House. I was waiting before rising to see if anybody else would speak. Nobody else has spoken so far and, therefore, I should like to take the opportunity at this juncture to intervene and reply to my friend and colleague Senator Sheldon. He said, first of all, that these increases would be viewed, perhaps, with more reluctance or hesitancy if in the past they had come reasonably frequently, but, in fact, the last one was in 1964.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The one <Col N="870" /> before that was 1960 so we have had 1960, 1964 and 1968. Senator Sheldon, I am afraid, will be expecting a similar increase in 1972. I do not think it is reasonable to say that these increases have not been reasonably frequent. It is true that early on they were not, but in the last eight years we have had three proposed&mdash;in 1960, 1964 and 1968. If that is not reasonably frequent, I suppose the tempo will have to be increased still further!</P>
      <P>I do not think that he quite got my point when I spoke about &ldquo;indecent haste&rdquo;. I meant that in fact the way in which it seemed to be regarded as a matter to get through the Dáil and through the Seanad very quickly. I made the point that a public man on a television programme on which I was had said that he was very impressed by the courtesy of the Dáil debate when discussing this matter. Everybody was very polite to one another. It seemed to him to stand out as an unusual debate, in that there was no name-calling at all, that they had agreed that it was a question of getting through fairly fast all Stages of a Bill to increase their own salaries.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheldon told a little anecdote about a TD whom he had met. He was a wealthy man and in fact owing to what Senator Sheldon calls the means test of income tax would only benefit out of the increase of £1,000 a year to him, to the extent of £200. If very wealthy TDs with big outside resources are benefited to this extent then I feel, perhaps, that the amount being allowed to all is too much, because it would seem to me equitable that men who are very wealthy outside should get no increase at this juncture. We all received, I think this morning, or in the past day or two, a statement of the views of the students on educational grants, with figures as to what it would cost to extend these grants. I feel that the £200,000 which is going to be used for the increases we are asked to vote to ourselves here might well be better employed. I will not pursue that because I might not be in order. The point is that the money, in fact, could go to people more in need than we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> I think that Senator Sheldon had an unhappy phrase&mdash;I do not think he really meant it&mdash;about the implementation of the Bill. The phrase was &ldquo;we have to feather our own nests because no one else will do it for us&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that the Minister is getting fractious, but I shall have to try his patience a little further. The Minister objects to my saying that Senator Sheldon had quoted me. He said that I said that if the £500 a year extra was thrust upon me, I would not return it to the Minister, and he misinterpreted me, saying that, possibly, because I was interrupted on that occasion by another Senator, he said that I should not refrain from doing this for personal reasons; but my reason was not a personal reason. When I said that I would not return it to the Minister, I meant to the Exchequer. I did not mean to the Minister as a person, but to the Minister for Finance or the Department of Finance. This has nothing to do with the personality of the present Minister, but clearly refers to the fact that I do not believe that the present administration, the Government and the Department of Finance, use the money they have at their disposal to the best national advantage. I am entitled to say that without being told that this is a kind of personal attack on the Minister. I can assure the House and the Minister that it is not. I think that Senator Sheldon will grant me that this was what I intended to say, even if it did not become quite apparent on Second Stage. I am afraid I was interrupted and I was interrupted again when I said what I was going to do with this extra amount if it was thrust upon me.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In line 17, to delete &ldquo;by the Minister&rdquo; and in line 18, before &ldquo;either&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;by the Minister or by a body designated for this purpose by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 are similar in form but there is some difference between them and so while we can discuss them in the one debate, I should like to distinguish between them. Amendment No. 1 is concerned with the definition of an approved institution. Amendment No. 3 is concerned with the question of whether or not a course is equivalent to a university degree. The effect of both these amendments, if agreed to, would be not to compel the Minister but to empower the Minister to devolve to some other body the decision as to whether a particular institution should be classed as an approved institution and whether a particular course should be taken as being equivalent to a university course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had in the Report of the Commission on Higher Education a proposal that there be set up a Commission for Higher Education in this country which would be concerned with a number of questions, including general questions of the financing of institutions and of courses in regard to higher education. I think if such a commission were already in being that the Minister might well have given <Col N="881" /> to such a commission rather than have reserved to himself these two tasks of deciding what is an approved institution and what is a course equivalent to a university degree course. Such a commission has not yet been set up but there is every indication that the Minister will, in the reform of higher education, which he proposes to introduce, set up such a commission. We all hope that this will be a body of full academic standing, and as such it would be an extremely suitable body to determine both of those problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated, I think in reply to the Second Stage of this very Bill, that he hoped in setting up the Commission on Higher Education that this Commission would represent the universities in certain matters in which they had previously possessed independent autonomy, that this Commission would now represent them by means of a sort of group autonomy. This, of course, would be a Commission set up by the Minister in order to do certain things in the work of higher education and there are, I think, extra things which it might well do.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated on the Second Stage in reply to the debate that he intends this to be permanent legislation. He rebutted vigorously the suggestion that this was stop-gap legislation. If so, I think we should on this Committee Stage build into this particular measure all the flexibility that will be required. The proposal made here is not that those powers be handed over to a Commission on Higher Education, as soon as one is established. It is still a matter reserved to the Minister to designate, as he thinks fit, a body such as the Commission on Higher Education to carry out those particular functions. I hope as such it would recommend itself to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the amendment although I must say I do not think it goes far enough, with respect to my colleague, Senator Dooge. It seems to me quite unsatisfactory that the question of what qualifications are equivalent to university degrees should be a matter for the Minister although I can see that at the present time there does not exist any <Col N="882" /> body other than the Minister and the Department which is in the position to take an overall view of university education and I can sympathise with the Minister, therefore, in drafting the Bill in this way at this point of time, but it seems to me an unsatisfactory arrangement and I would have preferred indeed if the amendment would have required the Minister, when a body is established with authority over higher education, to transfer this responsibility to them. However, I can see very great difficulties in drafting such an amendment and I can understand why my colleague Senator Dooge has drafted it in the way he has. I would urge on the Minister not alone to accept the amendment but to indicate his intention to hand over this power to any university authority that he may establish.</P>
      <P>The question of what is equivalent to a university degree is an academic matter. It is not one in which the Minister can properly adjudicate and certainly he would have to do so on the basis of advice furnished to him, and many people in academic life would be dubious about this being a matter to be settled by a Minister on the advice of civil servants. Many doubts on this score have been expressed and I share them particularly as, when the Minister was here a fortnight ago, discussing this matter, he gave me an assurance, if I remember rightly in the debate, that in relation to the teacher-training colleges there would be no question, when their status is changed in a year's time, of their giving degrees which are not university degrees, up to the full standard of university degrees. I accepted that assurance, but then I discovered subsequently that earlier on that day in the Dáil he had spoken in very different terms when he said that those colleges would &ldquo;give a type of university degree&rdquo;. There is no such thing as &ldquo;a type of university degree&rdquo;. University degrees are accepted as being equivalent to university degrees given in this country. There is no other qualification. Below that is what is called a diploma. We must be clear about this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very concerned about the apparent conflict in the Minister's mind <Col N="883" /> on this point. This is a very real issue. We are going to have, according to the Minister, all teacher-training colleges in the position of giving a type of a degree. I think anyone familiar with any of the teacher training colleges knows that in some of them it would be difficult, to the point of impossibility, within one year so to change the arrangements, the type of teaching, the type of courses and the staff that they would teach to the standard of university degrees given in the country at the present time.</P>
    <P>They are simply not geared to that and they have not the staff. I think it is correct to say that in the case of that teacher training college which is nearest to being in the position of attaining university standard, they, I think, would recognise that there must be a period of tutelage during which they will operate on the basis of a link with some of the university colleges which would ensure maintenance of standards and supervise them during the period of transition. This I think is what they would think desirable. If that is the position with regard to the teacher training college which is nearest to University College, it is clear that in their case it is unlikely that anything could be done to put them in the position of teaching to a university degree in one year. In those circumstances with this confusion of thought apparent in the Minister's mind in the two Houses on the same day of the week I am concerned that the question should be left to the Minister. It is something which cannot be settled by a political Minister. It is something on which the advice of his professional advisers is not necessarily adequate for this purpose and where the institutions concerned would not be happy to leave the matter for a decision of that kind. So that in those particular circumstances at this present time in the absence of any other period one may accept that for the interim period, for some months, this matter would be left to the Minister to decide.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Minister would reconsider this and hand over this function to the Higher Education Authority, or whatever the body is <Col N="884" /> to be called, which he proposes to establish, and the details of which we look forward to hearing soon. I hope the Minister can accept this amendment and give us that assurance particularly in the light of confusion that has arisen in regard to the teacher training colleges. I would urge on him that whatever plans he has with regard to teacher training he would ensure within the short time, within a year, that teachers would be given an opportunity of acquiring university degrees and at the same time that he does not make the mistake of rushing the transformation of these colleges to produce the situation where they become second class institutions, in the university world, by not providing degrees of university standard. Degrees are only awarded by a university. These will be colleges and how can degrees be awarded by colleges? Certainly universities have not awarded degrees of the second class standard. Perhaps the Minister can verify this position for us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am approaching this very widely because the whole section to my mind is wrong. The section as written will mean, in effect, that it will drive a coach and four through university autonomy and the rights and prerogatives of university institutions. In the first place, it applies to a number of institutions, not a university or university college. Why have these to be approved by the Minister for the purpose of the grant, in other words &ldquo;which is for the time being&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a suggestion here that the Minister can certainly simply approve certain courses in certain of the universities for award and rule out others and he can withdraw this approval at any particular time he wishes. That is not the intention of the Minister. Therefore, why not define an &ldquo;approved institution&rdquo; as a university or a university college? There is a need to qualify these. What use does the Minister intend to make of the qualifications he puts in? Why is he looking to designate courses? Again, the second power is &ldquo;any other institution in so far as it provides courses leading to qualifications which in the opinion of <Col N="885" /> the Minister are equivalent to university degrees.&rdquo; This to my mind shows that the Minister's advisers do not really understand the universities or do not understand the professional institutions in this country.</P>
    <P>The idea of a Minister deciding that some course was equivalent to a university degree is not right. No university of any standing would give this right to any Minister and neither would the professional institutions. You can take the Institution of Civil Engineers, for example. The Minister says a course given in such a higher technological college is equivalent to a degree and the Institution rules lay down that a member of the Institution must have a recognised university degree. Where does the Minister stand? Would they accept the Minister's pronouncement of an equivalent degree? I do not wish to take a narrow view of this and I do not wish that all the recipients of the grants should be channelled into the university. I want to see every institution playing its full part, whether they are the higher technological colleges, the teacher training colleges or those giving special courses in poultry management or other courses that are regarded as a logical follow-up to a secondary training, up to and including the Leaving Certificate.</P>
    <P>Therefore, what I suggest to the Minister is that he should not hide his hands. He should leave the section broad. Why does he have to say that a course is equivalent to a university degree course simply for the purpose of making a grant available to the students who take that course? If it is true that the taxpayer's money might profitably be spent on the course, then I say there is no need for any qualification. Simply let the Minister regard that course as desirable&mdash;full stop. We in the university will not quarrel with it. No professional institution will quarrel, but we will quarrel every time the Minister comes and says every course is the equivalent of a degree course. If the Act requires that the Minister has to make this declaration I appeal to him not to put this obstacle in the way of the development of this scheme. I put down an amendment to <Col N="886" /> this effect but it was ruled technically out of order due to the fact that it might involve additional charge. I ask the Minister to reconsider this and bring in a suitable amendment on Report Stage which he can do&mdash;No. 1 to define a university or university college, and No. 2 any other institution giving a post-secondary course which the Minister considers desirable and leave it as flexible as that.</P>

      <P>First of all, I should like to direct the attention of the Seanad to the Title of the Bill which is &ldquo;The Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Bill&rdquo;. We are concerned with grants towards higher education that need not necessarily be equated to university education. I want to get this very fundamental point home. As we say in section 1, we regard an &ldquo;approved institution&rdquo; a &ldquo;university&rdquo; or &ldquo;university college&rdquo; or &ldquo;any other institution in so far as it provides courses leading to qualifications which are, in the opinion of the Minister, equivalent to university degrees&rdquo;. I do not say that they are university degrees. If the community decides at any time that these grants should be paid in order to assist students along particular lines of intellectual and educational development that may not necessarily be university lines I think that the community should have a right to say that it will pay out grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is just the background, and the point is that I propose to retain my ultimate responsibility in this matter. I feel, though, that I can be advised on this matter, and I propose to write it into the proposed legislation on higher education <Col N="887" /> when we are setting up our proposed Higher Education Authority that I would be advised on all these matters appertaining to higher education by the Higher Education Authority on which there will be substantial academic representation. In addition, we propose to set up a Council of Universities which would be concerned with establishing academic standards in the universities and this would be composed entirely of university people. I think that when the full picture emerges arising out of what we propose to do in the new Higher Education Bill linked with this it will be seen that, far from being anxious to arrogate powers to myself, I am most anxious and will be seen to be most anxious to devolve powers and functions relating to matters of higher education to the proposed Higher Education Authority. So in that context I feel that when our higher education proposals emerge the Seanad and the people will see that what we are doing, in fact, amounts very much to what Senator Dooge suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald raised some other points concerning this question of teacher training colleges. I think that politicians are, perhaps, more straightforward than academics. Academics are inclined to read things that are not there. I intended no difference between the type of university degrees, and the Seanad will, perhaps, forgive me if I was not as clear as I intended to be. We are going to have a university degree which will be approved of by the universities in consultation with the teacher training colleges, and the two organisations, the training colleges and the universities will in this matter have their activities meshed in together so that we will have a single course suitable for teacher training organised by and approved by the universities in consultation with the training colleges whereby the professional competence in teaching, be it primary or post-primary, can be given at the same time as the academic university element in that teaching can also be imparted. This will be a university degree in which the existing professional teaching colleges will play a part, and impart the professional element to which <Col N="888" /> I hope the universities will make their contribution. Between them both we hope to organise courses which will be university courses and thereby basic courses for all teachers, and a necessary qualification for all teachers. Is that clear or is it not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, I shall now attempt to show that academics can be slightly more straightforward than full time politicians. We are not really in a sense divergent on this point except when it comes to the matter of putting it into legislative language. The Minister has said that he thinks it is right and proper that he as Minister should be able to decide that a particular course in higher education is equally deserving of a grant to a university degree, to which we all say: &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo;. If he decides that it is in the public interest for a certain course of higher education to be supported, then we will agree with him, but he is not, therefore, entitled to say that this course is equivalent to a university degree, because when he does he is saying that it is equivalent to it not merely in the single aspect of being equally desirable from the community point of view, equally deserving of support from public funds, but he is saying that it is equivalent. The Minister is going beyond this sense of a thing being equally desirable, equally worthy of support. He has brought in this pretty strong word &ldquo;equivalent&rdquo; and it is on this point that the debate arises. The Minister in paragraph B here has not even said &ldquo;is equivalent&rdquo; to a university degree for the purpose of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I must quarrel with the Minister here. It does not say that this is something which in the <Col N="889" /> opinion of the Minister is equivalent only for the purpose of this Act. If the Minister wants to hammer that home he must put in a phrase which would indicate that these institutions are institutions which in the opinion of the Minister give a qualification equivalent to university degrees for the purpose of this Act, that is, for the purpose of public support. I do not think that there would be any serious quarrel with what the Minister proposes if he narrowed himself to this sense. I would ask him to look to the consequences of what will happen if he leaves this as straight equivalent. He must admit from his own viewpoint on this matter that if somebody goes for a job before the Civil Service Commissioners or the local appointments commissioners which calls for a university degree he can come in and say: &ldquo;I have not got a university degree but I have a qualification which the Minister for Education has declared to be equivalent to a university degree.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is only one instance, I think, of the troubles that might arise if the Minister adopts the blanket definition here, and I would urge the Minister to consider this matter extremely carefully. I think he will find that when the new organisation on higher education, the Higher Education Authority, is working it will be the appropriate body for these decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said, when introducing these amendments, that I would like to distinguish between them from the point of view that I think amendment No. 1 is desirable but I think that amendment No. 3 is a vital amendment if this Bill is not to be seen to be an invasion of the autonomy of the universities. I spoke at length here some months ago on the nature of and the limits to the autonomy of the universities. One does not in the universities look for autonomy for the sake of power or for the sake of looking after narrow interests. To my mind it is only persons of full academic standing who can declare what course is worthy of a university degree or in all respects equivalent to one. As this paragraph is drafted the Minister is saying more than that designated courses are worthy of support, but is <Col N="890" /> speaking of them as being fully equivalent to university degrees, and I think that he has done more than he intended. By this amendment No. 3 we wish to remedy that, by putting in a few words at the end such as &ldquo;for the purpose of this Act&rdquo; to ensure that there is not read into this section more than the Minister intends.</P>

      <P>We are trying to help the Minister and it is very rare to find this. We are trying to give the Minister more power, we are trying to save the Minister from himself, from walking into trouble. We all agree with the primary objective of the Bill which is to ensure that the post-leaving certificate students, after a satisfactory performance in the leaving certificate, are supported both in the university and in any other courses desirable from the national viewpoint. This includes teacher-training colleges, the higher technology schools and others.</P>
      <P>I can see great opposition because in effect the universities are being asked to give degrees to students over whom they will have very little control or influence in their training.

      <P>I wish merely to add a little to what Senators Dooge and Quinlan have said. I can see how the Minister has got himself into this position. He was anxious to give himself power to give these grants to certain institutions of higher education which might not be technically university colleges, but he wished at the same time to avoid leaving the way open to every commercial college in the country; but in adopting this method of achieving this laudable objective, the Minister has walked into a hornets' nest. He must not have appreciated the extraordinary sensitivity of universities in matters such as this. The sensitivity to State influence in this area is very great, indeed, and in his desire to give himself flexibility in this matter of grants, the Minister has, unfortunately, created a position of sensitivity. The best thing we can do is to ask him to consider the position again between now and Report Stage to see whether he cannot manage to give himself the power he wants circumscribed in the degree he wants to circumscribe it.</P>
      <P>First of all, we suggest that the adoption of these sensitive, emotive words could mean that people going for jobs in the public service could say that, as laid down in the statute, they had qualifications equivalent to university degrees. The Minister has not thought out the full implications of the situation these wor could involve and it would be useful if he reconsidered the matter and arrived at some other formula in which to arrive at his very laudable objective.</P>

My purpose in framing the section as it is is more or less on the lines indicated by Senator FitzGerald in that I want to have higher education grants, paid for by the community, made available to all those students going to university courses and at the same time to have them made available to higher education courses which the Minister for Education of the day would decide were appropriate for grant assistance, in order to develop a particular type of training or a profession which might not have university status but which might be considered necessary in the <Col N="892" /> interests of the social and economic needs of the community at a particular time.</P>
      <P>That is precisely the purpose of the section. At the same time, I wanted to avjoid the danger indicated by Senators and indicated in the Dáil by Deputies, that I should broaden this in a still wider way. Some of the advocates at the moment of giving it to teacher training are unwittingly broadening the issue because the training courses are only one of a number of professional courses which universities would not recognise as being equivalent to university courses. I can mention legal, accountancy and engineering courses, postal courses of all sorts and classes. We had to narrow this thing down in a way that would bring it within the direct definition of higher education, either university education or such higher education, not university education, which the community from time to time might deem to be equivalent to university education in relation to the needs of the community at that time.</P>
      <P>Worry has been expressed here that we are writing into the Bill a judgment on the part of the Minister that any sort of course might become a university degree course and that this might be taken out of the context of the intention of the Bill. If we indicate in the section that the judgment made by the Minister at any time that a particular course is equivalent to a university degree course, we might meet the point. We might insert in the section that this was for the purposes of the Act. I might have a look at this and I am attracted by the idea of putting in an amendment for Report Stage inserting in the section the words &ldquo;for the purposes of this Act&rdquo;. I will look at the matter between now and Report Stage to see if that is adequate to meet what Senators have in mind. It is a suggestion which might meet the case made.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for acknowledging that at least on this occasion academics have been able to make the position clear. It is my intention to withdraw amendments Nos. 1 and 3 and we shall <Col N="893" /> join the Minister in separate thought between now and Report Stage. A point which was raised originally and which was, indeed, the heart of the amendments was the question of whether this was a matter appropriate for the Minister to decide or whether it was something for a body like the Higher Education Authority. Once the Minister expresses a willingness to narrow the question of equivalence, the position is that if the Minister does narrow the question of equivalence, which means equivalence deserving public support, then the arguments for handing over these powers to the Minister are clearly weakened.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, if there is a body such as the Committee on Higher Education, which we hope there soon will be, there is a strong case for the Minister to do this after consultation with such a body and if the Minister were now able to tell us that he would, in such cases, take the advice though not necessarily follow it of that Committee, then my point on this would be fully met.</P>

      <P>It is essential, as a minimum requirement, to do what the Minister suggests&mdash;to add the words &ldquo;For the purposes of this Act&rdquo;. This would eliminate the particular danger of people applying for jobs. At the same time, I hope the Minister will look at it a bit further. It seems to me it is not necessary to use these words &ldquo;equivalent to a university degree&rdquo; because they are sensitive ones. The Minister might narrow it down and say that the institute concerned must provide a full-time course of not less than two years duration if he wants seriously to cut out post-school courses which might be pressing for recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think he could also phrase it in such a way as to take account of the recommendations of the Authority, although I see a difficulty in doing that when the Authority does not exist, although it may be set up in legislation to be introduced. The Minister can make a reasonable case if he is deciding to keep the power of distributing grants but he might also decide to delegate that power to the Authority to be set up as recommended in the <Col N="894" /> Report of the Commission on Higher Education. However, he might equally decide that he should take control. It is only a question of his expressing an opinion and I am sure it can be redrafted in a way which will not give him any more leeway than he wants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take a little further what the Minister said about training colleges. If I understood him aright, he suggested that the training colleges would confine themselves to providing the professional training in teaching techniques, theory and practice of education, and that the university course as such, the academic subjects, would be provided in a university college. I am not sure if I understood him aright on this but I think it would be useful to clarify the point. Of course, this would be satisfactory from the university point of view but I think it might not be entirely satisfactory from the point of view of the training colleges because where a training college has reached a stage where it might become acceptable as a university college and could in a period of years become a university college an arrangement which would prevent it from fulfilling that role by confining it solely to educational theory and practice and teaching techniques will I think be unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that we have got a situation here in the process of evolution and I would hope that the Minister would not insist on one solution for all cases. There will be some cases of training colleges which are not yet ready to become university colleges and would not claim they are; there may be other cases where they are and I would hope that whatever solution the Minister finds to this problem will be one which leaves open either of these two solutions and does not force a single homogeneous solution on the whole teacher training area.</P>

      <P>We recognise the Minister's difficulty in regard to the position of training colleges but, nevertheless, many of us are worried about this particular body. It has been made clear in debates in this House that the entry standard to training colleges is very high, substantially higher than what the Minister proposes in his scheme for entry to the universities. The Minister indicates that he hopes an arrangement can be made very quickly and one gets the impression within 12 months, which would integrate training colleges into universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather worried about what will happen during the year. If we look at the position the majority of those who would qualify competitively for a place in the training college would also qualify, with four honours in the Leaving <Col N="896" /> Certificate, for a grant under the Bill. I think, faced with the position of going into the training college or the university to do a BA, a large number would opt for the university. Whereas they might ultimately return to the teaching profession we would have for a short period here what might be an undesirable diversion of good teacher material from the training colleges.</P>
    <P>We want to avoid at all costs the suggestion that we can afford to reduce the standard of those who enter training for teaching. We want to avoid at all costs the idea that those who go for teacher training with a view to becoming primary teachers do not get as high a standard as those who are going to the university, many of whom go ultimately for post-primary teaching. We must avoid at all costs anything which would lower the standard. The hiatus which will exist, and which might become more than that, which might become a divergence of certain valuable resources is something which worries me personally.</P>

        <i>(Longford):</i> I am afraid Senator Dooge covered most of what I intended to say but there is one aspect I should like to raise. Who is to decide in the ultimate when a training college or any other college is equipped to give a degree equal to that of the university? Is the function of decision to be with the university, with the Minister for Education or with the college which so desire or so feel it is entitled to confer a degree? My view is that that is a matter which should rest with the Minister as being the custodian of public authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I do not want to be rude, I feel that there is a sort of unconscious arrogance on the part of university people in that they are trying to express: &ldquo;We are the only people who have a right to decide when other people are so equipped or are so organised as to give an educational service&rdquo; or be in a position that they can confer an award which shall be regarded <i>pari passu</i> with an award of any constituent college of a university. There is that arrogance. While Senator Dooge covered some of the ground, I feel this is a fundamental point and <Col N="897" /> that in that particular regard it should be vested in the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I think in regard to this question of recognition of university degrees there are two levels of decision. We have had, as has been mentioned here before, to determine those two levels of decision. Firstly, the State has decided when it is appropriate to grant to an institution a charter which entitles it to grant degrees and decide what a degree is. It is for the State to decide whether an institution is not merely capable of deciding to give degrees, not only capable of training but also capable of deciding what is a degree. Having been given this power, it has been the practice over 1,000 years for those chartered bodies to decide.</P>
      <P>Let me say straight away that this power has been used arrogantly and narrowly at times and there are down through the years in the history of our university system occasions when it has been necessary for the State to shake the universities out of their complacency. This has been done in many countries at many times down the years but the State has only found it necessary to as it were shake the complacency of the university out of its complacency but never found it necessary to take the power from the universities to decide whether or not a particular course of study warrants a degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be dangerous if there was any suggestion that we should establish a precedent in regard to a degree which receives the stamp of an academic body and is accepted through the university community on the basis of the credit of that body. If this credit were to be transferred from the university to the State there would be serious trouble. This has happened occasionally not very widely and not in countries whose tradition we are aligned to but it has happened. The result has been a complete collapse of <Col N="898" /> the credit of the institution awarding degrees.</P>

      <P>If the Minister tries to force this and comes in next year and says that those in the teacher training colleges should qualify for grants and probably he designates their course as equivalent for university degree, whether for the purposes of this Act or any other, that will be resisted and rightly so, because the position of the university at present is that the courses as given fall a great deal short of the degree requirements. While all wish to see these lifted to degree standards very considerable improvements will have to be done to achieve that. It may take four to five years to work out these improvements and ensure that the courses are up to degree standard. We do not want fifth class degrees given. We want to ensure that the courses are adequate and that this should not be complicated by the Minister coming in next year and saying that as far as he is concerned the courses are equivalent for the purposes of this Act.</P>

I propose to bring in an amendment to meet their issues about this section in regard to the equivalent of a university degree. I hope between now and Report Stage to draft an amendment. Any opinion I give will be just for the purposes of this Act, to decide who should qualify for the student grants. This particular judgment is precisely the sort of judgment that should lie with the Minister for Education and with whatever type of education body there is, the overall responsibility to decide where the grants should go having regard to the needs of the community. I shall do precisely that. I shall bring in an <Col N="900" /> amendment and make it clear so that I am not making any judgment as to what is a degree outside the Act. I am making it for the purpose of issuing grants which is a community responsibility. This meets Senator Quinlan. Any subsequent Minister can make his or her decision at any particular time on what teacher training or any other professional training can be deemed for the purposes of securing these grants.</P>
      <P>This can be done at any future date and that is why the section is framed in this manner. It is now phrased implying a judgment on equivalence to university degrees outside universities. I hope to clarify that.</P>

Not only is there undesirability of his doing this at a sensitive moment but the fact is that it is not necessary to do so. By avoiding these words he could adopt other words. He is doing this only to protect himself against certain pressures. There is nobody in the country who is trying to tell the Minister that he must not give grants to an institution unless it is equivalent to university because he thought it up himself. The Dáil and the Seanad will give him power to determine who should get grants for higher education. The Minister is trying to tie himself down and the Dáil and Seanad are trying to tie him down.

      <P>In subsection (1), line 25, to delete &ldquo;are ordinarily&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;at the date of making an application for a grant are&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill declares that a corporation or a county borough council or a county council shall make grants to persons who are ordinarily resident in the functional area of the corporation or the council. It goes on to deal with the <Col N="902" /> general framework within which these grants will be made. As drafted, this section appears to me to be unduly narrow and legalistic. It seems that by putting in the words &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; one gets into the realm of legal definitions, things which are very much more appropriate to matters like an income tax code and similar legislation than to legislation which deals with grants. If this section is to stand as it is, with the words &ldquo;resident in&rdquo; being qualified by the word &ldquo;ordinarily&rdquo; then we have the position that the question of whether a person is ordinarily resident in a particular area becomes a matter for decision in some cases by the Minister and in others by the courts, and this is undesirable.</P>
    <P>What we are concerned with here is whether a person is resident within one county council area or another. There was some sense in drawing up legislation in this narrow way in the past, because in the past there were two elements; firstly, the schemes varied from county council area to county council area, and, secondly, for many years the cost fell completely on the county council or the corporation and in later years a great deal of the cost fell on them. Accordingly, it would be unfair to a county council to draw this so narrowly that the county council might be called on to support from the rates a person who was for strictly legal purposes resident in another functional area. Similarly, it would be unfair to a pupil&mdash;indeed there have been injustices to pupils&mdash;because of variations from area to area.</P>
    <P>We are now coming to a time when there is to be a uniform scheme throughout the whole country. We are also coming to a time when a great deal of the cost will be borne from central funds, and as the years go on more and more of the cost will be borne from central funds. Therefore, it seems to me that the necessity of differentiating sharply between one functional area and another is very much diminished under these conditions. It would be a pity if there were in the administration of this Bill an undue amount of difficulty over the question of the definitions of functional areas. We would be liable to have cases from time to time in which persons <Col N="903" /> applying for scholarships at one time would have them granted at another time, and they would be renewed several times during the course of their work in the university. It should be possible administratively not to have undue fussiness about the question of residence in functional areas. Such is the purport of amendments Nos. 5 and 6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of leaving &ldquo;ordinarily&rdquo; there is a very practical one, in that you have inevitably in the colleges and the novitiates, particularly in the novitiates throughout the country, people who are living in particular local authority areas that are not where they are ordinarily resident, and they are resident in these institutions for a considerable period, but not ordinarily resident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dooge makes the point that now we are bringing in a national scheme and it may not be as relevant as heretofore. That may be true to a certain extent, but from a practical point of view we are leaving under the Bill to the local authorities the responsibility for assessing the means of applicants. Obviously, if you have a person resident in the Dublin local authority functional area and he or she is from Kerry, from the point of view of efficient administration the more appropriate thing is that the assessment should be made by the county council of the county in which he is ordinarily resident, namely, Kerry County Council, which will have the machinery to be able to ascertain the means of his or her parents and make a decision as far as the question of a grant is concerned into what income category he or she comes. This is obviously a function impossible for the Dublin local authorities in those circumstances. They would have no particular knowledge of the circumstances parentally or the other means background, and from this point of view of streamlined administration as regards ascertaining means it is much better to have the requirement about &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; incorporated in the Bill so that it is quite clear that the local authority responsible for <Col N="904" /> advising on an applicant's means is the local authority where he is ordinarily resident.</P>
    <P>That is why we have retained this definition. I can understand Senator Dooge putting down an amendment, because, as he said, it would not appear to be necessary having regard to the fact that we are no longer making differences between councils as regards qualifications for grants. But we still leave to the local authorities this particular problem since they are the appropriate people to deal with it and to ascertain the means. For that reason &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; is necessary still to be inserted there.</P>

      <P>I am in some difficulty, and I see the force of what the Minister has said, but my difficulty arises from what I think is a mistaken view taken by the Minister in drafting legislation leaving the administration of this to the local authorities. It exemplifies what I said on Second Stage, that there was an opportunity here to remove this from the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Minister overestimates the extent to which local authorities have special knowledge in regard to the means test. It seems to me that what is involved is filling up a statutory form, making a statutory declaration in regard to means. The Minister seems to think that the local authorities will have at their disposal persons who will, from the knowledge which they already possess, be able to deal with such forms and statutory declarations more expeditiously and efficiently than the Minister's own Department could. I do not accept this at all. Those of whom they have special knowledge within the local authorities are persons whose inclusion in the scheme will not be in any doubt. The <Col N="905" /> cases of doubt that will arise will be the cases of persons whose means will not be a subject of investigation by the local authorities under the social welfare or other codes. It is this which has led the Minister to think that it is essential to this scheme for the administration to be in the hands of the local authorities. This is a particular feature of the present scheme which I think leads to difficulty here. I do not think there is much purpose in debating it at any great length, but I do feel that under this definition of &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; difficulties will arise which could possibly be avoided.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (1) (d) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() the persons have been accepted for entry to or continuance in a course of study at an approved institution,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment adds to the list of conditions set out in section 2 which form the overriding framework of the scheme&mdash;the condition that the persons to whom the grants will be made shall have been accepted for entry to or continuance in a course of study in an approved institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage, many Senators, the Minister joining with them, pointed out the insufficiency of a purely academic test for determining those who are most worthy of support for purposes of receiving higher education. There was general agreement that it did not appear in the present circumstances that there was little option open to the Minister but to adopt an academic standard&mdash;four honours in the leaving certificate or some such standard. <Col N="906" /> Nevertheless, there was general agreement that there were disadvantages in this approach.</P>
    <P>Those concerned with higher education have recognised the limitations of this purely academic, largely written examination, approach to the question of qualification for grants for higher education. In other countries these purely academic tests have been supplemented by others. In certain countries they have been supplemented by general intelligence and aptitude tests and in many countries they have been supplemented by selection by interview.</P>
    <P>It is true to say, of course, that both these aptitude tests and a scheme of selection by interview are themselves open to criticism as being fallible human devices for selection. However, it is possible that our universities will decide either generally or in respect of particular faculties to introduce selection methods other than pure performance in leaving certificate examinations in the future. Though there is no difficulty at the moment, and there will not be in the next few years, difficulties may arise later.</P>
    <P>At the moment, any person who qualifies for the Minister's grant by getting four honours in the leaving certificate, more than meets the standards of the universities. He more than meets the standard of three honours imposed by Trinity College and the standard of two honours imposed by the NUI. However, it may be that with the success of this scheme, with the availability of further resources for education, the Minister will decide it is not longer desirable to confine himself to the class of students he now proposes&mdash;those who get four honours in the leaving certificate&mdash;and that he might reduce the standard. He might decide he would give grants to all students who had got three honours.</P>
    <P>It is equally likely, and I hope it will not be long before we see it, that the NUI might join Trinity College in looking for three honours. We should then have an equality between the standard the Minister will, I hope, propose in the future and the standard of the university. The universities at that stage might impose other tests for university entry. It would be undesirable <Col N="907" /> that we should get ourselves into a position in which the Minister, or indeed, the Oireachtas, is directing local authorities to make grants in accordance with the scheme laid down by the Minister to persons who for some legitimate reason are not accepted for entry to the universities. We might have again an area of friction, an area of sensitivity. Under the system of higher education we shall have, in which these new tests for entry would be approved by, if not initiated, a Higher Education Authority, it may be that these tests would have the result of putting universities and the Higher Education Authority who wish to set certain tests for the universities, in conflict with the Minister in this respect.</P>
    <P>Maybe these difficulties would not arise very readily but, nevertheless, we should in this instance follow the practice of other countries and largely the practice in Britain. The practice there in regard to grants is that they are made available to any person who has two A levels plus acceptance by an approved institution. This acceptance in Britain is now largely on the basis of selection by interview. It is quite probable we shall move in the same direction and I suggest we could follow the British method. The Minister can follow the intellectual standards in other places, as he is likely to do, and put other tests into his scheme. It is appropriate he should follow the example in Britain where one of the basic conditions for the giving of grants is that the person has been accepted by an approved institution and given a place in an institution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that the point of view of Senator Dooge was covered by paragraphs (a) and (d) of subsection (1) of this section. It was our thinking when we drafted these paragraphs&mdash;to leave the position as it is, very flexible. Paragraph (a) reads:</P>
      <P>the persons reach such standard at the Leaving Certificate Examination of the Department of Education as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="908" /> That aspect of it is flexible. Paragraph (d) states:</P>
    <P>the persons comply with such other requirements as may from time to time be prescribed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>This leaves the scheme flexible enough to deal with any situation that may arise in the future. Some of the situations envisaged by Senator Dooge would be welcome in the future but I should prefer to leave it as open as it is. As I said on Second Stage, the entire Bill is designed to be flexible, to enable changes in regard to qualifications, in regard to the type of institution that would be recognised, to be made by the Minister from time to time in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I suggest we have left it sufficiently flexible and for that reason I think the amendment, while I agree with the sentiments behind it, is superfluous. particularly having regard to the very wide terms of the paragraphs I have quoted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is unkind of me to make the remark that I always have the suspicion, when a Minister says something is superfluous, that he has not got a very good argument against it. I ask him to reconsider this seriously because numerous difficulties could arise not only at entry but in continuance in universities. It is the practice of universities to impose discipline on their students. Some people may think they do not do the job very well at times, but for serious breaches of discipline it has been the practice to send down students for a matter of weeks, for a matter of a term, sometimes for a whole year. The university makes a decision that it is not willing to accept a student back during the next academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How does the Minister view this position in the light of the Bill? On Second Stage he indicated that he considers the passing of one's examination to be sufficient qualification for the renewal of a grant. I think this is a case which might well come about; again, we may run into difficulties here&mdash;we may get conflict between the Minister and his Department on the <Col N="909" /> one hand and the university authorities on the other.</P>
    <P>There are problems with certain courses, the numbers must be limited and certain persons who could not get into particular courses might not wish to go to the university at all because of that fact. I would ask the Minister what is his attitude to the university practice of sending down students for a complete year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We would have to follow the course adopted by the universities in regard to funds paid for study at those universities. That is covered in section 5 of the Bill where we set out the facts to be followed in the scheme for higher grants which is to be made by the local authorities. I quote from a draft scheme already prepared by the Department for the guidance of local authorities:</P>
      <P>A candidate must comply with the entrance requirements laid down by the university or other approved institution in respect of the course the candidate wishes to attend.</P>
      <P>That covers that line of country.</P>

      <P>I like to keep all these Bills tidy. This has always been the case heretofore with regard to scholarship schemes and these schemes have covered all this line of country. We propose to continue that and we are preparing specimen schemes to put before the local authorities. These schemes will be given force of law by section 5 of the Bill which puts the obligation on the local authorities to prepare schemes and to submit them to the Minister for approval. Any breach of the scheme will cause a loss of the grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about this matter. Traditionally the universities have been masters in their own house in regard to whom they shall accept as students and this right has been unchallenged down through the years. While travelling by train <Col N="910" /> to attend the House today I read in a newspaper that in the United States, for the first time, the position is now that the academic decisions of the universities are being challenged in law, particularly in regard to the acceptance of entry. The practice of certain State universities of charging substantially higher fees for non-residents in the State as compared with State residents is being challenged in law and this is a completely new departure. If we had the position that a person who had been refused entry to the university although he had satisfied the leaving certificate requirements for a grant took action against the university he would be in the position of calling the Minister to witness that he had satisfied all the statutory requirements.</P>
      <P>This matter of entry is one which the universities feel they must be free to decide because it is so essential to the maintenance of their standards that they feel there should be no doubt whatever about this particular problem. I would ask the Minister, who is perfectly willing to write into the scheme a requirement that people would comply with the entry requirements of an approved institution, to go further and put it into the Bill itself. I would ask him, even if he does consider it superfluous, to write it into the Bill.</P>

      <P>Even if one approached this matter as a legislator rather than a university person, the section is unsatisfactory. It requires a local authority to give a grant to a person whether or not he has been accepted for entry by the university. It is true that the Minister intends to require, under (d), that these people should, in fact, have been accepted by the university, but from the point of view of the legislator it is unsatisfactory, particularly from the point of view of accountability. The idea that legislation be passed requiring grants to be paid to people without regard to whether they are acceptable is unworkable from the universities' point of view.</P>

It is not unreasonable that we should require as a condition for the giving of this grant that the person concerned should have been accepted by the particular educational body. The fact that the Minister intends to introduce this in a particular scheme is not satisfactory enough. We should guard against grants being misapplied in this way. On those grounds also, apart altogether from the question of university economy, the Minister should consider inserting this in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Let me return to the case of the secondary schools. We are told they are in the same position and we find that the position has slipped very much in the past year or year and a half about whether schools can accept or not and we in the university can see in the failure to put in this the same thin end of the wedge which would say: &ldquo;These are grant holders and you must take them.&rdquo; There are other requirements laid down. The university has to get two character references and for continuation has its own standards. I feel that in fairness to the universities and to allay any fears that there may be of encroachment by the Minister and his Department in this domain, in other words to say whom we should have the right to turn away for unsatisfactory conduct or behaviour, those simple 21 words should be inserted, and I feel that you certainly cannot hold that they are any less important than what is inserted before in paragraph (c) or elsewhere. I appeal to the Minister to put this in and to accept Senator Dooge's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the Minister why this seems to be <Col N="913" /> important? There are traditional areas in which the universities are particularly sensitive. These are areas in which universities have been interfered with in certain countries and almost invariably to the detriment of the work of the universities and sometimes with wider results even than that. The areas in which the universities are particularly sensitive are the control of entry conditions, the control of appointments to the university and the standards of degrees. Those are the three things which the universities feel are vital in order that they will be able to maintain their standards. Accordingly, this is the reason why out of all the things which could I believe be dealt with in the scheme I have asked that this particular one should be taken out to make it clear that the universities control of their entry will be respected by the Minister and by the Higher Education Authority in the future. It is asking for a clear declaration from the Minister that he has no intention whatsoever of attempting to impose on the universities as students persons whom the universities are unwilling to accept. The Minister has said that he sees no objection in principle to this. He is quite prepared to put it into the scheme. I feel that the Minister will be going a good distance in alleviating any fears which university authorities or individual academies may have in regard to the future dispensation in regard to our Irish universities if he includes this. Even if he thinks we are foolish in asking for this to be put in the Bill rather than the scheme I think he would calm us and do good for himself by giving in to what he might regard as folly.</P>

There is a difference, of course, between the amendments. Senator Dooge is asking that the university be given a say. I <Col N="914" /> think Senator Quinlan's amendment goes a bit further because he is asking that the Minister's right to having a say in this matter shall have to be in agreement with the relevant education authorities.

If the Minister demands the right to lay down certain requirements, I feel it is only fair that the education authorities, the university in this case, should ask for similar rights. Therefore, I would find myself inclined to support the amendment though, perhaps, less so if paragraph (d) were to be dropped.</P>

Perhaps Senator Dooge may be able to enlighten me and say that there have been so many cases, percentage-wise or any other way, who have been debarred, who had the necessary qualification which up to recently was the leaving certificate without honours as <Col N="915" /> far as I know and have students been debarred from university because they did not succeed in getting references or because of a decision of the university authority who for some reason felt that a particular student was not a person they wanted in their college.

      <P>I should point out &mdash;and I have done so on previous occasions&mdash;that in other countries, notably in Britain, the practice has <Col N="916" /> been that large numbers who qualify in regard to educational qualifications for education in the universities are not accepted for places in the universities. This has been the practice in Britain where they have reached the stage in the development of educational grants, which we have not yet reached but which we hope to reach relatively soon, under the Butler Act of post-primary education and supporting the universities. They adopted a practice of a certain educational qualification for entrance to university but large numbers&mdash;this was the minimum qualification&mdash;of those were rejected by all universities, not only the first university they applied to but all universities. Those who have been accepted have either a higher academic standard than the minimum laid down or else have other qualifications. It is in regard to this future position rather than as regard the position in the past that I was addressing myself in regard to this particular point.</P>

      <P>To re-inforce what Senator Dooge has said there is another aspect here and I think the Minister and his advisers have not adverted to it. It is the case where selection is made not at entry but after the first year examination. This applies to pre-medical, pre-dental and preveterinary examinations. What is the position in the case of grant students who enter for the pre-medical and pass the examination but fail to get a place? The places are given strictly on performance in the examination and there may be some who rank high who fail to get grants on the leaving certificate performance, a leaving certificate performance which was below the standard. We want to ensure that universities have in the statutes the right to make their own decisions on the acceptance of that or not and solely in accordance with academic merit and, therefore, to have the right to refuse a student, whether he is a grant student or otherwise, who has passed the examination but for whom there is not a place available. The only way this can be done is to accept Senator Dooge's amendment thus making it quite clear that the university has the right to control both acceptance or continuance <Col N="917" /> in a course of study. That may be because of lack of space.</P>

I quoted from the particular requirement on the first page of the scheme, which is stronger in language than Senator Dooge's amendment, and states that every candidate must comply with the entrance requirements laid down by the university. There are a number of other requirements in it, all of which are designed to ensure that the candidate starts and continues in his course at the university in compliance with the requirements laid down by the university.</P>
      <P>It is far better it should be laid down in this manner. The universities may require in one year, two years or ten years time other requirements which they may wish to see inserted in the scheme. They may come to me as Minister for Education&mdash;and I hope I will still be there&mdash;or the Higher Education Authority to deal with this. They may say that A, B or C should be written into the scheme, which can be done, and the universities in that manner will be far better protected than they would be by picking out one particular aspect, as suggested by Senator Dooge, writing it into the Act, and giving it more importance than many other aspects. There is an annual obligation on the local authorities to adopt such a scheme and I would envisage that as being one in which the universities could make their requirements in the future known and have amended if they wished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say one thing here and this annoyed me even before I ever became Minister for Education. It is the ultra suspicion that in some way the Minister for Education and Parliamentarians are engaged in mischief, that in their own way they have something against the university authorities. This is not so and I have learned since I became Minister for Education of the <Col N="918" /> co-operation that exists among the people in administration. I should like to say to the three very responsible university people who are Senators here that this is so and that the sooner they get this into their colleagues' heads the better progress we can make in regard to all aspects of university education which we so desire to improve.</P>
    <P>This question of over-emphasising the rights and prerogatives in regard to universities and other institutions in the State has only done harm, not only to themselves but to the whole community. Duties and obligations should be emphasised far more than rights and prerogatives. We all have a community interest in doing what is best for the community. The sooner we rid ourselves of those motives the better progress we will make not only in this respect but in all other aspects of education which we so desire to improve if the country is going to go ahead but if we are going to be bedevilled by organisational politics at all levels of our educational system, then be it on the heads of the people responsible.</P>

      <P>One can appreciate the Minister's feeling in regard to this sensitivity in academic circles and in some of those issues that may appear so. If we in anything we have said have encouraged him to feel that way we should regret it. I should like to make the point that I recognise that among my colleagues there exists, an excessive sensitivity and I can assure the Minister that I have endeavoured to persuade them that things are not done only as they like and that neither politicians nor civil servants are ill-disposed towards universities as some of my collegues seem to believe.</P>

      <P>Having said that, I think it should be said that at times politicians have said things which have given reasonable grounds for concern to academics. I do not mind that on justified grounds but they have unnecessarily said things which have worried academics. I can remember two occasions recently. In this House the Taoiseach, then Minister for Finance, spoke on a Bill claiming the external right on behalf of Parliament to vet appointments to the universities. In fact, he clearly was under the impression that such a right existed and that he was advocating such a right. I pointed out to him that the right of Parliament is not to approve or disapprove of posts in universities and he did, in fact, give ground when that was pointed out to him.</P>

That particular case of incompetence we are not referring to. What I am talking about is a Bill called the Laying of Documents Bill, concerning the laying of documents before the House and Senator Dooge and my colleagues raised issues in regard to status and the Taoiseach, then Minister for Finance, in reply made this extraordinary statement. When it was pointed out that the Oireachtas did not have the right he claimed it had, he climbed down but still claimed that the Oireachtas had the right to vet appointments. The fact that that kind of claim can be made by a politician, a man who has no function in a university but unthinking can make such a claim does give rise to unwarranted anxiety among people concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this point. Even though we may be straining the patience of the Chairman, I think it is important that we should be quite clear on what the attitude of the academics in this regard is. If I strain the Chairman, I can return to another section. The Minister is quite right in saying that many academics are sensitive and thin-skinned about these things. They are particularly sensitive in three areas, the question of who should be accepted in the institutions, those who should be appointed to teaching posts and the standard of degrees that should be awarded. It is true that not only academics misunderstand politicians but also that politicians misunderstand academics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> I should like to make it quite clear that there is a basic reason why we should tolerate such sensitivity. We could say: &ldquo;To heck with it; why should we bother with those sentiments at all?&rdquo; The question of why there should be respect for university autonomy is not the fact that we are clinging on to rights. It is not that academics are better off but because there is a recognition of the peculiar&mdash; and it could be used in all senses in this regard&mdash;in universities; rather is it that the community is better off. I want to say, speaking for myself and speaking for all those who are academics in this House and speaking for the vast majority of our colleagues in the Irish universities, that our claim for respect in regard to these particular areas is based not on regard for rights which have been held down through the centuries but rather on recognition of the fact that there is ample testimoney that when academics are let free in regard to these matters which they consider essential they do a better job for the community.</P>
    <P>It so happened that in the course of another debate here within the past few days another Minister taunted an academic Member of this House with the remark: &ldquo;You fellows do not seem to be able to organise your jobs properly; all over the world there is academic revolt.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think, in fact, this is something worth examining. The position is that there has been academic revolt. There has been unease within universities but where has it occurred? The most notable example where an academic revolt has had political consequence has been in France and France is the typical example of the case where automony has been denied to the universities. It is in France that, with a centralised system of administration, we had determination of courses, determination of appointments, determination of increased entry standards, not by the academic community but by the central government. It is here that an explosion and revolt has occurred.</P>

It has been the Western European experience that the peculiar&mdash;again I use the expression &mdash;peculiar contributions to the community which can be made by the universities and other institutions of higher learning flourish in a certain atmosphere and die when not given certain conditions of freedom.</P>

      <P>I invite the Minister to give practical weight to his words about co-operation and about thinking the best of one another by accepting this very reasonable amendment, which puts it beyond all shadow of doubt that the universities control entry standards and subsequent standards. As regards the Minister's statement that he will have these schemes by the local authorities, as far as the universities are concerned these schemes are secret documents worked out between the Minister and the county council concerned without any reference to the university. We know that, in fact, commonsense generally prevails, but we would like to feel that certain minimum safeguards are contained in the statutes if the schemes <Col N="923" /> worked out are not to lead to trouble, unless the amendment tabled by Senator Dooge, the later amendment No. 9, is agreed on. I agree with the Minister in his concern that we should not be so suspicious of one another, but I would ask the Minister and his Department to examine their own consciences. Nothing has wrecked the mutual trust and confidence that should exist between the Department and the educational community as much as the present business about reorganising the leaving certificate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>As a non-academic, I shall endeavour to get a little closer to the point as regards this amendment. It strikes me, first of all, that it is completely irrelevant to the Bill and not needed, because, as I read this Bill, there is nothing in it about standards for entrance to universities or relating in any way to standards. It provides for payment of grants by local authorities. I am inspired to say a few words by this spate of oratory from our various academic Senators about the autonomy of the universities. I accept completely that the universities should be autonomous and should be able to run their own business without interference from outside. At the same time, they should accept, and I am sure they do accept, that they have duties as well as rights. They are very important to the community at large as to the way in which they conduct their business. This is of great importance to the community, particularly to the young people going to the universities or hoping to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this question of entrance it seems to me that in past years the universities, particularly the National University, have not been doing their business in a way which was to the benefit of the community at large. We had the situation where up to two years ago it was possible to enter the National University with no honours in the leaving certificate but merely a <Col N="924" /> pass. That seemed to me to be ludicrous. I have, in fact, thought that the various Governments which were in existence during this time were at fault in not exercising some pressure on the National University to remedy the situation, which inevitably led to many people entering university who were utterly unfitted for an academic education, which led to unnecessary overcrowding and which involved the State and the taxpayer in considerable sums spent on subsidising education for people who should not have been at university at all. I accept that the universities are fully entitled to complete autonomy, but they have duties too, and there may come times when some pressure or at least negotiation on the part of outside bodies, particularly the State, may well be necessary to see that the aims of the universities shall as far as possible be directed in a direction which is for the benefit of the community at large.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point is that in proposing the deletion of &ldquo;is committing or&rdquo; we are trying to establish, first of all, what is the purpose of the words. It is reasonable that somebody who in the opinion of a garda is committing an offence should be arrested, even without warrant, but if he has not completed the commission of the offence it seems unsatisfactory that he should be arrested. The offence here, of its nature, is not of a continuing character. It is the refusal or the failing to comply forthwith with the requirement of a garda. The purpose of the words &ldquo;is committing or&rdquo; is obscure. The failure is to comply with the requirement to have a breathaliser test, which happens at a point of time, but either the person has or has not failed to comply forthwith. Has he or has he not refused to have the test or failed to comply? If he has, then he has committed an offence. Because the offence is one which he cannot go on committing over a period, I cannot see the point of time during which a person can be arrested in the long process of committing the offence. To use the words &ldquo;before the commission of the offence&rdquo; would be reasonable but the use of the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; indicates the immediate, instantaneous character of the offence and, therefore, I do not see the purpose of the word. As there does not seem to be a valid purpose <Col N="927" /> for this provision, for these words, they might give rise to an injustice in interpretation by the Garda Síochána. It seems better, therefore, to have them deleted but I should like to hear why the words were found necessary in the first instance. If the Minister has a good case, then the question can be considered on its merits.</P>
      <P>The second point which arises, on amendment No. 10, is in relation to paragraph (b) of the same subsection. This is a broader issue because here we have proposed the giving of a right to the Garda Síochána to arrest without warrant a person who is or has been in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place with intent to drive or attempting to drive the vehicle, but not driving or attempting to drive it. It seems to us that to make it a statutory offence, subject to the penalty of immediate effect and subject to a breathaliser test, is going too far.</P>
      <P>The breathaliser test can reasonably be imposed when somebody is driving or attempting to drive a vehicle, not if he simply has the intent to attempt to drive it. For that reason we propose the deletion of the subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator FitzGerald in these amendments. Subsection (3) (b) goes much too far. I agree with the breathaliser test system but it is too much that it should be imposed or that the person should be subject to arrest without warrant if he emerges from a public house with some drink taken and has in his pocket the keys of a car which he owns. Even if he was completely intoxicated when he arrived at the car, his wife, who might be a pioneer, might intend to drive the car but the man may be picked up for drunken driving. As Senator FitzGerald has said, if a person commits an offence he should be subjected to the test but saying he should be subjected simply because he owns a car and that he is near it while under the influence of drink is going much too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister wants this legislation to be successful he should have some regard for the people whom the legislation <Col N="928" /> is supposed to be designed to protect. Therefore, to suggest that a person in a public place, having had some drink, is committing the offence before he gets into his car is wrong. The subsection says &ldquo;but not driving or attempting to drive&rdquo;. Therefore, I strongly urge the Minister to drop the paragraph. Surely it is sufficient for the purpose of the Bill that if a garda should find a man driving a car while under the influence of drink the test should be applied and if it is found positive the person should be penalised. I do not think a provision like this applies in England.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">

      <P>I cannot see how this is in any way a radical departure from the 1961 Act which provided in nearly exactly the same way for driving while drunk or being in charge of a vehicle while drunk. Under the 1961 Act, it is an offence to be in charge of a car while under the influence of drink, and consequently it seems only logical that it should be possible in this Act to ask a person who is in charge of a car, as well as driving it, while under the influence of drink, to submit to a test.</P>
      <P>The use of the words &ldquo;is committing&rdquo; arises out of the wording of subsection (2)&mdash;&ldquo;a person who has been driving or attempting to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle&rdquo; who refuses to comply forthwith. If a person refuses, he has committed an offence, but in respect of a person who fails, one cannot say he has come to the end of a stage of failing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This I cannot accept. The relevant part in subsection (2) refers to the person who refuses or fails to comply forthwith <Col N="929" /> with a requisition under this section and says that he shall be guilty of an offence. There is no question here of a continuing process. He is asked to comply and he either refuses or does not immediately accept the test and as he has not complied forthwith he is deemed to have committed an offence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the matter of amendments Nos. 9 and 11 I would say that it is quite possible for a man to refuse or fail by merely remaining mute, it may be mute of malice or it may be that he could be in a condition that he would not necessarily be mute deliberately and it is here we have the difficulty of determining in those circumstances if a person was mute when he had concluded the commission of the offence. This is one of the cases where the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; really highlights the fact that it was at that time and not the day after or two days afterwards that we are speaking about. One good reason for this is that the man can fail to comply by remaining mute. This has got to be taken into account and I do not think anybody can object to it particularly as the remaining mute need not necessarily be deliberate. He could be incapable of being other than mute and this would hardly be the case where one would expect a member to stand around until the person got to the stage where he would be other than mute.</P>
      <P>As far as amendment No. 10 is concerned it seems to me that if it was accepted it would make the Bill pretty unspecific in dealing with persons drunk in charge or driving while drunk. A guilty person may well refuse the breathaliser test and deliberately choose to accept a lesser offence in order to avoid prosecution for a far more serious offence. All this must be taken into the context of the Bill and the acceptance of amendment No. 10 would make the Bill completely unspecific in dealing with a person drunk in charge of a car. Is it not better to deal with persons drunk in charge in order to save themselves rather than to take the view that injustice might be done under this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also feel from the general remarks made by those in favour of the amendments <Col N="930" /> that they may in some way be of the opinion that we are dealing with the matter solely with regard to the offence of being in charge of the car. What we are really dealing with is the refusal of a person to take the breathaliser or some similar test in circumstances where it is obvious to the garda that the test should be carried out. It is the refusal to take the test that is in question rather than the question of whether the test should be applied. There is probably a little confusion in this regard and some people seem to think that we are dealing with the offences themselves. In this case the section deals with the refusal to have the test in circumstances where the person concerned obviously appears to be drunk in charge or driving while drunk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister can make that kind of distinction between this and another section. The purpose of the section is to assist in bringing to justice people who are committing an offence. It is the existing law that to be drunk in charge of a vehicle is an offence. This particular provision has been subject to criticism and objection because injustice can be done under it, as in the case of a person who is sleeping in the back of the car without any intention of driving. The introduction of the breathaliser test here to reinforce an already dubious law is most undesirable. This is all part of the scheme of things to bring people to justice who may be drunk while driving.</P>
      <P>On the question of &ldquo;is committing&rdquo;, I do not think the Minister has made any better case than that made by Senator Ryan. The wording is &ldquo;fails to comply forthwith&rdquo;. Whether a person is mute through not being able to answer or mute through malice, the mere fact that he does not comply immediately when asked to do so means that he has committed an offence under section 2. If the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; means immediately then, as soon as he is asked, he must comply instantaneously and if he says nothing and does nothing for a few seconds he has committed an offence under the section. I cannot see the need for the words &ldquo;is committing&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>If Senator FitzGerald's interpretation of the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; is correct it might mean that the amendment would be satisfactory but I have great doubt about his interpretation of it. I can foresee the case of a man being told by a garda to take the breathaliser test and who does not comply in five or ten seconds and is arrested and I can see the solicitor for the defence in such a case saying that he did not get a proper chance to comply. I can see such a case being brought for decision to the Supreme Court, the question being as to whether five or ten seconds was sufficiently long. I do not think that Senator FitzGerald's interpretation of the words would be followed by the courts and to save the community from having to indulge in this form of legal interpretation, I think the words &ldquo;is committing&rdquo; are proper. If a garda tells a man to take the breathaliser test and he says or does nothing, then he can arrest him on the grounds that he is committing an offence. The presence of these words in the section will save legal argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 28, I do not follow at all what the meaning of paragraph (b) of subsection (3) is. It seems to me that there is very bad drafting in this subsection. It says:</P>
      <P>A member of the Garda Síochána may arrest without warrant&mdash;a person who is or has been in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place... fair enough</P>
      <P>...with intent to drive...</P>
      <P>fair enough, too, but then</P>
      <P>...or attempt to drive...</P>
      <P>That does not seem to me to be intelligible English. I think I know what they are getting at, that if a person is in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle with the intention of driving it or is in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle with the intention of attempting to drive it, but if that is the idea it is certainly not couched in intelligible English. I have read it time and time again and I can make no sense of it. I should like to hear the Minister's view on that. It goes on:</P>
      <P>...but not driving or attempting to drive it...</P>
      <P>I do not know what it all means to tell the truth. I do not know if anybody else does.</P>

      <P>One thing that I think is pretty vital is that this wording is taken from section 50 of the 1961 Act. That has been going on for seven <Col N="933" /> years and it has never given any bother whatsoever. That is probably more than can be said for some of the other things we have done and may yet do. We have had experience of its operation and in that seven years it has not shown itself to have any of the failures or weaknesses pointed out by the Senator.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>That may well be, but the Minister must remember that under the existing legislation before a member of the Garda Síochána would approach any driver the driver would be obviously intoxicated, but with the proposed breathaliser test the person certainly need not be drunk because from what I gather it does not take very much drink to have a sufficient amount of alcohol in the breath to trigger off this mechanism. I should like to remind the Minister that a person can be to all appearances cold sober and yet the very fact that a garda might see him coming from a public house and getting into a car, if business is not too good, he can chance him with one of these tests. I feel that under the changed circumstances subsection (3) (b) is altogether unnecessary and too strong and most unfair to the majority of the public.</P>

      <P>When you read that first I agree with Senator O'Quigley it does not seem to make sense but I feel, on rereading it, what is meant there is a person in a public place with intent to do one of two things, the intent to drive or to attempt to drive. If you read it that way I think the meaning becomes clear. The intention may be to do one of two things, to either drive or attempt to drive.</P>

      <P>If that is so, it certainly is not anyway clearly expressed. It is probably what they are trying to get at. The fact that it is in section 50 of the 1961 Act does not matter. Of course, it should never have been allowed through in the 1961 Act but that was passed at the end of July.</P>

      <P>It was pushed through at the end of July in the same way as the Civil Liability Act which we were told could not be amended and the Courts of Justice (Supplementary Provisions) Act. All three Acts went through in the same way. I think the Minister might have another look at this because section 50 of the 1961 Act was not quite as important and would not be as much in use as this is going to be. Certainly there are people who are going to reject this new mechanism, this breathaliser, and I rather think that this section will be used a great deal more than section 50 was used since the 1961 Act was passed.</P>
      <P>There is another matter that arises on the section. I wonder if the Minister can give us any indication as to the type of mechanism or contrivance that will be used. Will it be kept in such a way that it will always be in a hygienic condition? Will it be of such a kind that nobody can reasonably object when it is presented to them by the Garda? One can see people having objections if it is handled in a particular way with paw marks and so on. One can imagine a person saying: &ldquo;I will not take the test on that particular one.&rdquo; He might do it on another kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another matter that I should like to take up. It was raised in the other House and not dealt with satisfactorily I think. It is the question of when this test can be imposed. Subsection (1) says:</P>
      <P>Whenever a member of the Garda Síochána is of opinion that a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place has consumed intoxicating liquor, he may require him to provide in the prescribed manner a specimen of his breath....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not required that this shall be done at the time when the person is driving or attempting to drive or is in charge of with intent to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle. Does <Col N="935" /> it means that this test could be imposed at any time afterwards? All that is required is that a member of the Garda Síochána should be of opinion that the person has consumed intoxicating liquor and that he has been in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle. It is not clear to me that the action of requiring the test must take place when the person is in charge of the vehicle. This may appear implicit in the words: &ldquo;in charge of&rdquo; but it does not seem to me to require that the test be imposed at that time. I would be glad of the Minister's assurance on this. If it is the Minister's interpretation that what this means is that the test can only be imposed when the person is in charge of the vehicle, then I would be reassured but it is not clear to me that that is the intention of subsection (1). I wonder if the Minister could comment on that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to mention the phraseology which is used at the beginning of this section. It says: &ldquo;Whenever a member of the Garda Síochána is of opinion that a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle...&rdquo; If one is to take this literally, the Garda may form the opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, he can form this opinion capriciously. I would ask the Minister to have another look at this phraseology. Even a judge who forms an opinion and gives a decision on that opinion may often be upset unless he can show there was evidence to support the opinion which he formed. I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that in the Criminal Justice Act, where there are somewhat similar provisions, the phrase &ldquo;is of the opinion&rdquo; is not used. The phrases used are &ldquo;where a garda has reasonable causes for believing&rdquo; or he &ldquo;reasonably believes something to have happened which would constitute an offence&rdquo; or reasonably warrants his believing such and such a thing to be done. I would suggest one of those phrases would be more appropriate than saying &ldquo;whenever a <Col N="936" /> member of the Garda Síochána is of opinion&rdquo;. I would ask the Minister to look at that between now and Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the point made by Senator O'Quigley. It is very important that the public should be assured by the Minister that these breathalisers will be in hygienic condition every time they are used. It is, of course, only an administrative matter but I hope the Minister will give us his full assurance on this point, otherwise there will be very grave reasons for refusing to accept some kind of unhygienic instrument if presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>On this matter of the hygiene of the apparatus to be used. I can assure the House&mdash;indeed, the Dáil has already been so assured&mdash;that the apparatus or the part of it which could in any way come in contact with the person, that is the mouthpiece, will be completely hygienic in each case and there will be no case of its reuse. They will be properly packed. This is apparently what was envisaged and that assurance has been given. I merely repeat it here.</P>
      <P>While we are on this another point mentioned by Senator FitzGerald was whether in the giving of a test or the seeking out of a person to allow himself to be tested this will be done in a public place. There is no question of following the person around to his home or some other place, seeking him out to apply this test. I think it was Senator FitzGerald who raised something on this and I want to say that it is in the public place this will be applied and not by following the person around to wherever he is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question of &ldquo;of opinion&rdquo; has been pretty well hammered around the Dáil. I think it was in a case in relation to the Offences Against the State Act, and perhaps the Senators have knowledge <Col N="937" /> of this, that this phrase was regarded as a better formula than possibly the alternative which might be suggested, for instance, &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;of opinion&rdquo;. In the case of substituting, for instance, the word &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo;, the Supreme Court in broad terms came down with the pronouncement that to use the word &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; in a somewhat similar context would imply a somewhat judicial decision and that, therefore, the words &ldquo;of opinion&rdquo; were in those circumstances better words. This was pretty well gone into in the Dáil and the Dáil were satisfied that &ldquo;of opinion&rdquo; was better than &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; in circumstances of this nature and the Supreme Court earlier in somewhat similar circumstances on an earlier piece of legislation had so pronounced. So, we more or less depend, rely and rest on this particular view, as stated in the Supreme Court, and have inserted those words &ldquo;of opinion&rdquo; rather than any other form of words that might be thought to be useful or might be thought to be a substitute for it.</P>

      <P>I am worried about one of the things the Minister said. I understood him to say that the breathaliser would have to be used in a public place, that the gardaí could not go into a man's house but that does not seem to be what the section says. It does not say that the breathaliser should be used in a public place and it would be highly undesirable that that should be so. If it had to be so used a drunken man could travel down the street, go into his house and he would then be safe from the gardaí and they could not require him to use the breathaliser. I cannot see any purpose in this and I do not think that is the meaning of this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am worried about this section and the Minister may be able to clear up the point. We are talking about an offence committed under the section and the only offence is a refusal to breathe into the apparatus. In subsection (3) (b) we are saying that:</P>
      <P>A person who is or has been in charge of a machanically propelled vehicle in a public place with intent to drive or attempt to drive the vehicle but not driving or attempting to drive it and who, in the opinion of the member, is committing or has committed an offence under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A man drives to a pub and takes a few drinks. When he comes out he decides that, in fact, he has taken too much drink, that it would not be wise <Col N="939" /> for him to drive the car. He can, nevertheless, be approached by a member of the Garda and is asked to breathe into the apparatus. If he refuses to do so, he is guilty of an offence even though he may have been very sensible in thinking, that having taken too much drink but still responsible, he is not fit to drive. Under the section, as drafted, he can still be regarded as guilty of an offence. If I understand it correctly, it is unreasonable. Surely when a person decides he has taken too much drink and that he will not drive, he should not be guilty of an offence. That is wrong. Perhaps the Minister would clear my mind on it.</P>

      <P>A number of points have been raised. I think they are all somewhat related, as they may well be, to the section but they are related in a more detailed sort of way. One is that raised by Senator Rooney. He spoke about the usual driver of a particular car in a local town where people know of the car. He goes to town with his wife. He goes off and gets well plastered and his wife goes elsewhere shopping. Having had enough&mdash;and he is unlikely in those circumstances to call it a day before his companion returns&mdash;he decides to cut his losses, get out and sit in the car. If these circumstances were as related by Senator Rooney, why would the wife or companion not have the key since that would be the person who would drive the car? But, allowing for the fact that he is still the owner and he takes the keys from whoever is driving and sits in the car and is clearly and obviously and ultimately unfit to drive if he underwent this test, it is unfair and not necessarily correct to suggest that he is obliged to undergo the test and that <Col N="940" /> if he fails to do so he has committed an offence. He need not necessarily undergo a test. He may be taken to court and he probably will be. If he is prepared then, as he would be in such circumstances, to swear that it was his intention not to drive, that he had no intention to drive, that the car belonged to him, that he had the keys, that he certainly was not going to drive the car and if his wife could come into the box as well and say that she had the intention of driving the car and would drive it back home, then the court would decide on the facts and I would have no doubt as to what the decision of the court would be.</P>
      <P>He has been genuinely brought to court with all its embarrassment and so on but, nevertheless, it is the worst that can happen to him, and in doing this it is not because we want to get that sort of person into court but it is to get the other type into court. We have to frame the law for this latter sort of case with the consequence that by refusing to take the test the other type of person would have to go to court.</P>
      <P>You are dealing with two types, one who is blameless and the other who is to all outward appearances blameworthy. I cannot see short of the cases going to court and letting the court decide how the non-genuine and the genuine cases are to be distinguished. If such a genuine case does arise and the defendant swears that this was so and he can, in addition, bring in his companion to add something to his evidence, I have no doubt as to what the court's final finding would be on his intention to commit an offence. That is what we must rely on in this particular type of case. There will be all sorts of versions of that case, some genuine and some far from it. In matters of that nature we can only depend on the courts to unravel the non-genuine from the genuine so that the law we are proceeding to pass in the House of the Oireachtas is, in fact, doing a job that badly needs to be done in this type of matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Yeats was disturbed in that he felt that in subsection (1) of section 28 there was nothing to say that those other than found in a public <Col N="941" /> place were untouchable. I think what should be read here is that the subsection must be read as a whole. There is another feature about it. If a person leaves a public place and if he has been observed leaving that place and going into private property, whether his own home or other private premises, there is no law to give any garda right to follow or make an entry to that private property. He will have to go through the normal formula to get a warrant, by which time the bird will presumably have flown or could have taken off.</P>

      <P>If I was ever to find myself in that position, I would not be in the house when he came back with the warrant. That is one extremity. What sometimes occurs is that, if a man has taken ten glasses and is drunk, then after detection he takes five more. These dodges, of course, are indulged in. Perhaps the fellow who has reached such a stage that he cannot run away will as a last resort put another bottle on top of two and say he did it after the garda left. There is this, that under the powers proposed to be given under this Bill private property is still private property. This is a far bigger question than is proposed in the Bill. We could if we decided to do it make it very much stronger but we are not proposing that they could invade private property. Something like this can be done in England, I think, at the moment under the most recent law.</P>

We should try it without that at first and if it does not work I have no doubt that we will have to come into the Oireachtas and ask for something more extreme.</P>

      <P>If my memory serves me properly this exercise is not unknown and it has happened that a person under the influence of drink has been followed to his doorstep off the public road. Convictions as a result, I think, have followed in this country even if the law does not give power to do so. The point I wanted to make when I was speaking in relation to the power of a garda to insist on a passenger in a car submitting to a test is this: I mentioned that the car owner was even in the passenger seat and not the driving seat of the car. That was the point I was trying to bring out, that apparently a passanger in the car can be compelled to submit to this breath test if the garda believes that he is or has been in charge of the car.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>On that again we have to remember that the garda would not do it without having some sort of belief that the passenger in question either was in charge or had been in charge of the car, nobody else was, in fact, in charge immediately before this person was met, and that this person had driven the car in a state other than a fit state from an intoxication point of view. In those circumstances undoubtedly the garda would be entitled to seek to have a test taken or given. On the other hand, if those were not the circumstances the passenger undoubtedly has the right to refuse. If he is charged and taken to court, again if this was a genuine case of the passenger not driving or not attempting to or not being in charge of the car, if he refused a test and was accused of being unfit, if he could satisfy the court that this was the case, then again I feel that we must rely on the court to so declare that it was a genuine case and that that person is found not guilty. We cannot go further than that in this case, but before it got to the court stage the garda must have had some reason obviously to come to the opinion that that person was unfit and was in <Col N="943" /> charge of the car or attempting to drive. These things are not all that easily come by. I doubt if there is any grave danger, taking everything into account, of abuses of this nature taking place. Even if there is, in the last analysis the court will determine in such cases whether the defendant in such cases was genuine or non-genuine, and find him guilty or innocent according to the evidence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the section itself, this is what this Bill is about. This is the section which provides that the blood alcohol level of 125 milligrammes per 100 millilitres of blood, whatever that may mean, will be accepted as a fair indication of sobriety or drunkenness as the case may <Col N="944" /> be, as the basic line. The Minister will be aware that there is a good deal of not unreasoned opposition to this whole new idea of fixing a level of alcohol in the blood for the purpose of offences under the Road Traffic Act. The truth is that the Oireachtas must try to fix some standard and say that if you have more than that you are going to be deemed to be drunk, and that is what is being done under this Bill. The level that is laid down is, in fact, extremely generous.</P>
    <P>According to what Professor Hickey says in the addendum to the medical report&mdash;and this must illuminate us on the extent to which we are permitting people to consume alcohol&mdash;in general it may be stated that a man weighing 11 stones would be unlikely to exceed a blood alcohol level of 125 milligrammes per 100 milliliters of blood unless he had drunk more than six small whiskeys or gins in a period of approximately two hours or more than four pints of stout or beer in the same period. We are, therefore, allowing over as short a period of two hours what I certainly would not drink, six whiskeys, over a period of two hours. He fixes this figure at exactly my weight, 11 stone, and you would not have unless you exceeded this figure 125 milligrammes per 100 milliliters of blood. That is a rather generous amount of alcohol to allow people to consume. In this Bill we are imposing very strict standards and it may be that on the basis of experience the legislation may have to be revised because it may turn out that the alcohol level in the blood is too high for safety.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the Minister for Local Government&mdash;who was always in charge of road safety&mdash;and the other road safety interests involved should embark on a form of education in relation to drinking, driving and eating, because one finds in the experiments carried out by Professor Hickey, and we know from our experience, that when food is associated with alcohol the consequences are not nearly so devastating. We find that a person of 45 years of age, weighing ten stone to 11 stone, of regular, moderate drinking habits, can consume six <Col N="945" /> whiskeys in a period of 50 minutes with a meal and show no signs of intoxication at the end of the affair and be fit to drive. Again, when the same type of person consumes two glasses of sherry&mdash;the upper class type &mdash;three glasses of burgundy and three whiskeys&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He could have a few Irish coffees afterwards&mdash;nothing wrong with that; this is the kind of thing being done&mdash;and find that that amount of drink consumed with a meal will leave him with no signs of intoxication, still fit to drive. On the other hand, a person who consumes six whiskeys during a period of 1½ hours, three hours after a meal, has been found to be unfit to drive.</P>

      <P>If you have a meal without meat it is not as effective a safeguard against intoxication as a meal with meat. It is important that those concerned with road safety should emphasise the fact that people become intoxicated more quickly on empty stomachs than on full stomachs. Whatever are the permutations and the combinations of that, these things should be made known to the public. The road safety authorities should also point out that there are certain mixtures that tend to make people quite intoxicated more quickly than others. I have heard it said that it is all nonsense that you become more intoxicated by mixing drinks&mdash;that really what makes you intoxicated is the amount of alcohol you consume. Experience, however, is that if you take certain mixtures the consequences are not so happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before these tests come in, therefore, the Minister should embark on an <Col N="946" /> intensive campaign of propaganda designed to point out to people the dangers of drinking on an empty stomach, or of fast drinking. He should try to get people to drink in such a way that will minimise the possibility of their getting drunk. That would be some contribution and it would help to offset what I think is the unreasoned criticism of the provisions of this Bill relating to drinking. It should be pointed out that the intake of 125 milligrammes per 100 milliliters of blood is a rather generous standard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in general agreement with Senator O'Quigley. I regret very much that the Minister has felt himself bound by the recommendations of the committee who suggested this breathaliser test, felt himself bound to follow the recommendation of 125 milligrammes as the limit. In Britain, the Medical Association in 1960 went into this matter and they suggested three single whiskeys or 3½ pints of beer as the maximum amount of drink compatible with unimpaired driving ability. However, in spite of the British Medical Association investigation, the British Government in their Bill arrived at a calculation of 80 milligrammes which, according to the BMA calculation, was considerably higher than the level they found to be compatible with completely unimpaired driving ability.</P>
      <P>In a Dublin shop a few months ago I saw a portable, do-it-yourself breath meter which had this lucid description: &ldquo;Fifty milligrammes, go easy; 80 milligrammes, go by bus; 100 milligrammes, go to bed.&rdquo; In Ireland, apparently, one can carry on beyond 100 milligrammes; one can absorb as much as 124 milligrammes, get into a car and drive it on a public highway. Our limit is undoubtedly too high. I suppose there has not been much choice in following this as an initial experiment&mdash; in view of the recommendations of the committee it would have been very difficult to fix a lower limit&mdash;but it should be kept very much in mind in years to come when it may become necessary to bring down the limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is an established fact, much as I regret it, that alcoholism and drinking generally in Ireland is a much <Col N="947" /> more serious problem than in almost any other country. Therefore, if anything, our standard for driving should be regulated by a limit much lower even than in England where it is 80 milligrammes. In Norway and Sweden it is 50, in Switzerland it is 100. It is higher in Austria and Germany, great beer drinking countries, where the level is 150 milligrammes. The figure we have fixed is really too high and I should like to see it lower in the reasonably near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this is a very generous limit and it will come as a shock to many people, even those in the habit of taking a generous measure of drink. It is possible in the initial stages of the administration of this Act that a number of people will be found to be outside that limit. However, I have no doubt that as time passes the fear of exceeding this limit will spread among people who normally take a few over the line. With the increasing amount of motor traffic, the Minister will surely find himself in the position of having to reduce this limit of 125 milligrammes per 100 milliliters of blood. Provided it does not do too much harm in the matter of loss of life or of people being maimed, I think it is fair enough to give it a trial at this limit first, but as time goes on it will become necessary to reduce it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say also that I would like to see a move towards a reduction. All the evidence is that the limit proposed in the Bill is too generous. I hope the Minister will, in a reasonable time after the coming into operation of the Act, examine the accident rate to see if it has produced comparable results with those produced under the British measure. There is one point which worries me. I was told some time ago by a doctor who is a specialist in relation to blood that the tendency of individuals to retain alcohol in the blood varies widely. His information was to the effect that one person might deal with the alcohol content in his blood quickly while another might keep it in his blood, not for hours, but for days and weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> If a man goes out on a better one night and is carefully driven home and the next day, when the hang-over has disappeared, he gets up and goes out and drives, on the evidence we have, if he is picked up there is a medical probability that he will be found to have alcohol in his blood beyond the statutory limit. I wonder if the Minister can tell me whether this is true and, if so, how can such a person establish his tolerance in this respect. If such a person fails to do so and unwittingly finds himself in the position several days after of having too much alcohol in his blood, will he be guilty of an offence or is there some way in which this can be allowed for? I should like to know the expert opinion on this point. The man from whom I got the information was an expert in the matter. It perturbs me and I would like to hear the Minister on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the figure being used here is possibly a little high but this is a good thing because it means that a person who has only a few drinks is going to be careful that he does not offend against the Act. I do not think anybody is going to deliberately look at the chart and decide that they have exactly the right number of drinks and feel quite safe. All the evidence is that you can never be quite sure in certain circumstances, such as not having a meal; even if you have what drinks appear to be safe, you may still be just above the 125 milligrammes. I do not think that anybody will deliberately take advantage of the fact that the figure is a little on the high side and deliberately drink what seems to be the maximum and get away with it. With regard to Senator FitzGerald's point, I always understood that the only alcohol that would remain in the blood is poteen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we all recognise that the effect of alcohol varies substantially from person to person and that the amount of alcohol which would make one person dangerous as a driver does not have the same effect on another. This is linked with the removal of certain controls in the character and this is one reason why it is difficult to legislate fairly as between <Col N="949" /> those who can take a fair number of drinks and still drive reasonably carefully and those upon whom a few drinks have a disastrous effect in rendering them reckless, over-confident and, perhaps, aggressive. The Minister will recognise that it is impossible to devise a law which will discriminate between those who can take a certain amount of alcohol and remain careful as drivers and those who take remarkably less and become dangerous.</P>
      <P>For this reason a better case can be made for a lower maximum which means that anybody who wants to have a few drinks will have to make other arrangements about driving. It is not a question of saying that if you take 80 or 90 milligrammes you necessarily become a dangerous driver. It means that we were making a law which will put you in jeopardy if you try to drive having taken this amount of drink. What has happened in Britain is that people taking a not very large amount of drink have been scared out of driving. They make arrangements to be driven home. This has had a very good result and the British safety statistics arising out of the new law have been very significant indeed.</P>
      <P>I support those who say that we could with justice base the figure lower while recognising that in many cases a person with such an intake might not be incapacitated from driving. That would involve all persons taking this amount in the necessity of making other arrangements. This might necessitate inconvenience but it would not be great inconvenience. I should like to see the Minister reconsidering whether he should not adopt the standards which have been found so effective in the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>If the Bill had proceeded with the expedition which the Department would have wished, and I do not say this as a reflection on anybody, it would have been in operation before the other Bill came to their Houses of Parliament. This Bill was on its way before I left the Department of Local Government which was over two years ago. The fact that we have not got it in operation is not the fault of anyone concerned, but because of <Col N="950" /> extraneous matters which cropped up in the meantime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It could have been a year earlier but for several interruptions of various kinds. As to the 125 milligrammes, I always agreed that this was a high level to set but the basis on which these proposals are being brought are those contained in the committee's report. It was that commission which recommended a level of 125 milligrammes and this is why that figure is before the House. Certainly if I had the personal decision on this and were to rely only on my personal decision I would say less than 125 milligrammes, but again it was not only my decision nor the decision of the present Minister for Local Governments but the decision of the Government of which we are both Members who agreed with the Commission's recommendation that the level of 125 milligrammes be recommended is the one we should put into operation. This is not to say that that level may not be found to be too high and that we may, in fact, have to amend it downwards. I think it is unlikely we will have to come back and amend it upwards unless the capacity of all concerned has gone up immeasurably in the meantime, which I doubt. I think we have got to keep very much in mind that it is an offence to have this measure of 125 milligrammes in the system but this is not to say that a person with this level is intoxicated or drunk. Neither does it mean that those who have got only 100 milligrammes in the blood are not drunk. We are not dealing with drunkenness really.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the purpose and this is what must be sold or clearly shown to all concerned. If a person exceeds 125 milligrammes and is so found to have exceeded it it does not mean that he is drunk in the commonly accepted social sense. Neither does it mean that if he does not reach the 125 milligrammes he is free to drive how he likes and where he likes and so forth because while he is committing a special offence without question under this section if the content exceeds 125 milligrammes, <Col N="951" /> on the other hand, at 100 or at 80 or even under it, it may well be that a person can and will be convicted for drunken driving. This is not altered to the slightest degree nor the common approach to it. When the guards observe a man behaving in a certain erratic manner, driving in a dangerous way, in a way that obviously is not normal, accost this person and find that his speech gives certain indications, he is taken in and examined by certain tests and if he is found to be below 125 he can still, and I hope will be, convicted of drunken driving and given the penalties appropriate to it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, let us not, while saying we feel 125 is too high, have any illusions that if one does not hit the 125 mark he is not drunk nor is it to be taken that if you have exceeded the 125 you are, in fact, drunk. This gets back to what Senator Sheehy Skeffington has said about the effects of alcohol as between individual and individual and even on the same individual under different circumstances. They can vary to a very great degree.</P>
    <P>This, I think, we must get across to the public. Education should precede and indeed simultaneously go with and continue after the introduction of this particular measure, the education of the public through every medium that is open to us. It is the intention of the Department and the Minister for Local Government that this sort of education will be commenced, that it will be carried through and that it will be tried in every possible way to get across to the public what, in fact, we are trying to do, why we are trying to do it, that these levels are set, the effects they can have on some people as against others and that this is a special offence and that if the level is below 125 it does not mean one can drive any way he likes and if it is above 125 one is drunk. These and many other things will have to be brought very forcibly and clearly and consistently to the attention of the motoring public in order that there will be an understanding and thereby a greater acceptance of what is involved in this matter. All of this is aimed not at stopping people from drinking or <Col N="952" /> stopping people from driving but in order to try to save lives and save people from injury on the roads which is on the increase and growing all the time unfortunately.</P>
    <P>The rate of elimination of alcohol from the system has been mentioned here. The only thing one can say about this is while allowing for variations, undoubtedly nobody can either explain or control that the rate of elimination apparently is fairly consistent and apparently will approximate about one fluid ounce per hour after one has ceased consuming and it is possible for somebody on a right batter the night before to wake up and still have a very high blood alcohol level the next morning. Of course, a good deal would depend on what the night before entailed, whether it finished at 11 p.m. or 5 a.m. and whether the man got up at 6 a.m. or got up at 11 a.m. Likewise, it would have maybe a good deal to do with the mixtures that were talked about here, some of which some Senators assert do not go too well together. The man, in fact, in such circumstances could have a high content that would condemn him under this particular section as being unfit to drive because of his alcohol content. He could be devoid of that content having eliminated it over the hours in between but he could be still far from fit to drive or fit for anything else. Of course, if the chap wakes up in the morning with a fair carry-over retained, whether it is the normal retention or abnormal because of some peculiarity in the particular person's make-up, and if he adds to that fuel in the morning more coal, obviously you will have to add the two together and if this test shows he has gone above it, then the end result is the one you get when you add the two even though he might have had very little to drink that morning.</P>
    <P>Of course, we are talking of average circumstances and the average person, but in fact there is no such thing, I think, as the average person and we must keep this in mind. While we have to give general guidelines to deal with this mythical average person and his behaviour and capacity and so forth, we really must remember the weakness <Col N="953" /> of such in that there is no such being as the average person in a given set of circumstances. This law probably does not fit anybody exactly but it is intended to fit as nearly as we can all the people to the best of our ability and it is in this regard that we must approach it and try to get it across because I feel that the acceptance of the whole idea underlying this measure dealing with this matter of alcohol, its consumption and its relation to driving or not driving in certain circumstances, education is vital as is the law that we are proposing to enact here. I feel that the Members of this House and of the Dáil and everybody in public life have not only an opportunity but a very particular responsibility to get this across to try to give that little additional help to reduce dangers on our roads which seem to be growing year by year if not week by week.</P>
    <P>The other thing people should get into their heads clearly and concisely is that the fellow who has had a couple of drinks, is not drunk, could not be regarded as being drunk, would not exceed the level as stated here but probably has had a boost to his confidence as a result of a few drinks and, indeed, would even try to demonstrate that he is a better driver, that he is a safer driver in that condition, that he is a better driver than most others on the road at that particular time. I would say to that person that he would be a better driver still if he had no drink. That is something people should get fully into their minds, that without drink their driving is better than it can be no matter how little drink they may have taken.</P>
    <P>I feel that if our younger drivers particularly who feel their cars are going better because they are stoked up as well as their cars could only get it into their heads that their driving is not improved by drink but that their reactions are dulled to some degree anyway, some of them might cease to take it because they would like their driving to be good. In fact, taking a few jars mars that good driving even though they may still be better drivers than nine or ten others on the roads but they could be still better if they did not drink at all. I think that is <Col N="954" /> what Senator O'Quigley has been advocating that publicity will be given through the Department and all the other media when this matter is under way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There were two points I wanted to make on the section. The Minister dealt very fully with the first but it might to be no harm to repeat it. It is that the level we are seeking here means that a person with higher than this level of 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millitres of blood is automatically guilty of an offence, is regarded as guilty of an offence, but it does not mean that a person with a lower level is not also guilty of an offence. It is a bit dangerous to be talking about the amount of alcohol the average person can take and still be below the 125 milligrammes. As the Minister says, there is no average person. We all know from our own experience that not alone does it very between individuals but it varies between one day and the next with the same individual. Sometimes one drink can have a greater effect than two or three drinks on a different occasion. That is one point.</P>
      <P>The second is really what we are dealing with, the effect on a person's judgment of the consumption of alcohol. His judgment is dulled; he is upset, and we are in this section creating an additional offence and saying any person over this level is automatically guilty of an offence. This is another offence under the road traffic code and there are many already there.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about another offence which equally dulls or upsets a person's judgment and this is rampant on our roads at the present time. I personally feel that more accidents are caused by bad manners and rudeness on the part of some drivers and the effect that rudeness has on other drivers, who are upset because of it and their judgment dulled. We have all had this experience and it is really an offence that is increasing on our roads at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the law we will enact here will be enforced but equally I hope the law already there will be enforced to a grater extent than at present. We <Col N="955" /> had, what I think, were called the courtesy cops. They went around with a lot of publicity some years ago but they are very few and far apart now. There is grave need for them. There is grave need for gardaí, who are not apparent gardaí, going around and spotting the careless drivers. The people I am talking about are more careless than anything else, but the upset caused to the ordinary individual going about his business is enormous. I have seen this again and again. We are upset by the rudeness of somebody who cuts across us and we find that a mile further on, our judgment is still upset and we are very liable to have an accident. I want to say on this section that having decided on this law, it should be enforced, but it should also be enforced in regard to other matters of road safety far more rigorously than it is at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to observe from the reading of this section that the situation is that if a man has 125 milligrammes of alcohol in his blood, if he is not drunk, he is liable to the same penalty as a person who is drunk with 125 milligrammes or less. In other words, you are going to convict one man for drunken driving with less than 125 milligrammes and put the same penalty on a man who is drunk but has over 125 milligrammes of alcohol in his blood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the problems of course of putting the level as high as it is in this Bill is, as the Minister has said, that there will be people who are drunk, although the level in their case may be well below this figure. Indeed, I think young people who are not used to taking alcohol will in very many cases reach the stage of being incapable of driving a car at levels well below the 125 milligrammes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am considerably less optimistic than the Minister on this question of drunken driving at this level, as we all know, it has been extremely difficult over the past few years to get convictions in the District Court for drunken driving. We all read in the papers of a garda stopping a man driving a car. The man gets out of the car and staggers along. One thinks this <Col N="956" /> is an open and shut case but then the evidence is given, and it is said that he had only two small whiskies and in the end the district justice gives him the benefit of the doubt.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that when we have this breathaliser test and further evidence in the District Court that the breathaliser was used and that the man's level was below the 125 milligrammes, except where it is an open and shut case, and there is no possibility of saying that he actually was drunk, the District Justice will acquit in such a case. I hope I am wrong but I strongly suspect that the normal practice will be in future that where the breathaliser was used and the person did not exceed the 125 milligrammes, the garda will not in fact prosecute for drunken driving simply because they will feel the chance of getting a prosecution is very small. I may be wrong but I do not think I am.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be that problem that there will be a new test, so to speak, for drunken driving and one is inclined to think that if people pass that test, although they might be quite drunk physically, so to speak, they will be acquitted of drunken driving. However, I think Senator Yeats' fears can be allayed by what has been going on up to now. Regularly district justices have reports from Garda doctors about sobriety in a man from the medical point of view. The doctor may very often be there a short time after the person arrives. Nevertheless, I have seen cases where a doctor pronounced a man fit to drive and not drunk, and possibly that he was not drunk a half hour or threequarters of an hour earlier, but the district justice, and the Circuit Court judge on appeal, have taken the evidence of the garda that the man getting out of the car staggered, was unable to walk, probably had bleary eyes and he was convicted on that. They will continue to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>In some cases this may well be, but usually the evidence of the garda is accepted by the district <Col N="957" /> justice and a conviction is got. The ordinary law will still apply because under section 29 we are merely adding in this new test of 125 milligrammes and the old law will still apply. I should hope that what Senator Yeats says will not happen. I do not think it will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (3) and substitute the following new subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() Where an arrested person (other than a person who has provided a specimen of his urine in accordance with the prescribed procedure) following a requisition under this section, refuses or fails to permit a designated registered medical practitioner to take from the arrested person a specimen of his blood evidence of these facts may be given in any proceedings relating to the occasion in question under section 49 (4) of the Principal Act or section 28 (3) (a) of this Act against the arrested person.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In section 30 we are providing the procedure that will be adopted when an unhappy motorist finds himself in a Garda station following a breathaliser test and will thereupon be called on to provide a specimen of his blood or, alternatively, a specimen of his urine. This is a very drastic section we are introducing and the Minister indicated earlier that indeed it may well be that there are certain provisions of this Bill that will have to be amended as experience warrants and shows to be necessary. I find myself in sympathy with what is contained in the section but I also feel that it is probably going a bit too far at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have very little doubt that there will be many people who will not want to undergo a blood test purely because they are afraid of the consequences of <Col N="958" /> the test and know that it will show 125 milligrammes and upwards. There will also be other people to whom the idea of having this puncture for a blood test&mdash;and I do not know where this will be done, whether on the fingers or on some of the veins here or on this side of the elbow; I do not know the anatomical terms&mdash;is repugnant. There are a number of people who faint at the sight of blood, but who submit to the test, in the first place. If the Garda doctor has plunged in what was not a very fine syringe needle that person may say: &ldquo;I will not put up with this; you have had one go and I will not put up with it&rdquo;. If such a person refuses, and he could have good reason, he will be found guilty and be liable to exactly the same punishment as if he were in fact drunk.</P>
    <P>I grant you that it is very difficult to know what to do in the situation. What we want to get at, and what must be done, is to prevent people driving while drunk. I do not know that I am all that happy with my amendment either. It takes a good deal of the teeth out of the section. I am not happy with the section either. There will be quite a number of people who, for good physical reasons, may not be able to submit themselves to the blood test or submit themselves to the physical ordeal of undergoing this.</P>

      <P>It is the same offence for being in charge. However, it is not entirely relevant. I am not entirely happy with the amendment. There is a problem and it is difficult to see how one can get over it. There will be people, and there may be quite a large number of people, who physically will not undergo, and I know people of that kind who physically would not undergo the ordeal of a blood test, and if they do not, they will be in the unfortunate position of being guilty or liable to the same punishment as if they were found guilty of drunken driving.</P>
      <P>What I would like to see in this Bill is a changing of the law as a gradual evolution, and if in 18 months or two years, a great number of people were found unable to undergo the blood or urine test, we could say: &ldquo;Very well; this provision is not operating satisfactorily and we will make it compulsory in the way it is done in subsection (3) of the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is a problem. I do not know that even the amendment I have drafted would solve it. It is something on which I would like to hear other Members of the House as well as the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the drafting Senators O'Quigley and O'Kennedy have referred to, this amendment is not one that we really should accept. It is quite obvious that if something like this were written into the Bill, anyone brought into the Garda barracks after a breathaliser test, who knew he had consumed a considerable amount of drink, would be foolish to take the test. His legal adviser would advise him not to take the test. He will be no worse off if he does not take it. He would be worse of it he were to take it. It would be an encouragement to everyone to refuse to take the test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can quite see the Senator's point about taking a blood test. I doubt if <Col N="960" /> I would myself. The only way we can look at it is this. We know that the breathaliser test is not to be regarded as accurate and is only to ensure the weeding out of people who are not willing to take the scientific test but at least the breathaliser test will show that the person has consumed some alcohol and one can conceivably make the point that anyone who goes to drive a car in a public place and who takes any alcohol has only himself to blame if he ends up by having to take the blood test, even though he may not be drunk in any way. The mere fact of having taken any drink before driving could be considered sufficient warning to him that he might be put into a position like this. I would not have too much sympathy with people in this position. If they have taken a breathaliser test, guilty or not guilty at least it has shown that they have consumed some alcohol, and to that extent have only themselves to blame for being in this position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator O'Quigley's amendment. The point that worries me is who is going to take all these tests. Are the gardaí to undergo a new scheme of training or will it be entrusted to anyone at all? At a time when crime would appear to be on the increase and we have the appearance in this country for the first time in years of armed robbery, we are to have the time of the guards taken up by taking no fewer than three tests on individuals. If this is going to be followed to its logical conclusion, the police will need to be full-time on this job. This is completely unnecessary and I feel that it is unfair to subject people to this kind of treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am against this amendment because I feel that it would be an invitation to everybody who has been subject to a test to avoid tests by merely allowing this to be used in evidence in proceedings taken under the former section. In any event, it seems quite clear that the particular amendment does not make sense because proceedings cannot be taken under section 29 subsection (3). Proceedings can only be taken under subsections <Col N="961" /> (1) and (2), so that whatever effect Senator O'Quigley intended the amendment to have it does not have that effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two situations which will arise in the case of a person who refuses to take these tests. Under subsection (3) if he refuses to provide a specimen of blood or urine as the case may be he shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for up to 12 months and to a fine. That is one situation, but he is just as effectively dealt with in that kind of case as if, in fact, he had undergone a blood test and had been found guilty of exceeding the specified limit of 125. There will also be cases where the court will act on its own and on the evidence of the gardaí and the observed facts by the Garda medical officer and from all the evidence the court will come to the conclusion, I should say in a large number of cases, that the person who refused was in fact, drunk and unfit to drive under the old section 49. What, I am wondering, then is, will the person be liable to two penalties? Can he be convicted for drunken driving, assuming that the facts warrant that conviction, and will he also be convicted under subsection (3)? Will there be two offences and can he be found guilty of both, although they seem to arise out of the same single act of drunken driving?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I suppose that on the strict reading of the measure, both this and the other provision the Senator has been talking about, it is possible in theory to have both penalties sought and applied, but in practice this will not be so. In this sort of case I imagine that the State would be unlikely, except in some unusual circumstances, to press for the application of the double penalty as it were. The other thing on the section itself that I think needs to be understood is why we are seeking to have this refusal to submit to these tests an offence the penalty for which <Col N="962" /> is equal to the penalties for having submitted and been found over the odds, that is over 125 milligrammes in the blood. I think that this follows absolutely and completely. Without question, it must follow that once we have accepted that a blood alcohol level exceeding 125 milligrammes in itself establishes an offence, it follows as night the day that we cannot enable people to evade the tests, or to be encouraged to refuse to undergo them because it would be a lesser penalty if they did so.</P>
      <P>The whole emphasis and encouragement that would be given by the amendment particularly to all those who felt themselves guilty of an offence, would be that they would opt for the refusal of a lesser penalty, and the only people who would submit would be those who were quite sure that they were in the clear and that the test would show that they were so. Once we accept first that it is an offence to have this content above 125 milligrammes we must follow it up by this further offence of refusing to submit to any tests and that for these two offences the penalties should be equal. Otherwise evasion would be practised and naturally encouraged. It is those who knew themselves to be guilty of having a higher alcohol content who would presumably opt for refusal to undergo the test and only those who were in the clear who would submit to it. This is the way we have to look at it. We have accepted a level, and the fact of having over that level is an offence, and we have no option, therefore but to follow it on by making a refusal an offence carrying the same sort of penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Also on the section, under the new Schedule, the offence under subsection (3) of this section will now mean that the person will be automatically disqualified from driving for 12 months in the same way as he is automatically disqualified from driving for 12 months if found guilty of drunken driving. On this question of disqualification for a period of a year, it is a thing that very often leads to tremendous hardship. I entirely agree that the drunken driver must be put off the road, but there can be cases <Col N="963" /> where the imposition of the automatic disqualification for one year creates terrible hardship and is unjust in the eyes of everybody. Let us take the case of a man&mdash;and one has seen this kind of case in the courts&mdash;who has had a number of drinks, and he gets into his car, starts off and then, in fact, decides that he will not drive because he is drunk. I have seen that type of case. The gardaí noticed the man, waited for him to get in, saw him stop the car and then went over and arrested him.</P>
      <P>He was then brought in, showed the usual symptoms, and the Garda doctor said he was unfit to drive. I am speaking of a case I know about. The judge who heard his appeal from conviction in the district court said he was terribly sorry. Here was a decent man, a commercial traveller in a small way. If the judge could have done anything to prevent the re-affirmation of the district court conviction he would have done it because the man was not of reckless habits, a matter which was well established in evidence. There was nothing the judge could do except affirm the disqualification for 12 months. That man lost his job as a commercial traveller.</P>
      <P>It is the kind of thing that can happen and some consideration should be given to it. I do not know if we can do it here. We are refusing to give a blood test or a urine test and we are putting this offence into the same category as drunken driving. We are doing it for a very good reason but I think, and I do not know the view of other Senators, that if we want to get at drunken driving and the drunken driver, if a man in other respects has been a competent careful driver with a clean record, instead of disqualifying him for a whole year&mdash;which as a commercial traveller would put him out of his job&mdash;we should disqualify him from driving at weekends during a period of, say, five years. In that way the man would continue to be able to earn his livelihood though suffering a continuing punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no great merit in disqualifying such a person for a year. We must appreciate that there are as bad road <Col N="964" /> offences as drunken driving, because of their effects. There is the type of driver Senator Murphy referred to, the person coming back from the races who will cut out, when the road is chock-a-block with traffic, and then try to cut in on a busyroad. The worst mannered drivers on our roads are those one sees driving home from the races. They inconvenience everybody because everybody tries to prevent this fellow colliding with an oncoming vehicle. That can be as serious in its consequences as if somebody got drunk and took charge of a car. A great many serious motoring accidents occur when motorists are overtaking.</P>
    <P>I discussed this with a solicitor&mdash; the question of how it is we failed to meet them in court. The reason is, of course, that there is no defence in these cases and the insurance companies settle them. However, this is as bad an offence, just as detrimental to the community and the motoring public, as drunken driving, yet we do not provide any automatic disqualification for the type of dangerous driving I have been referring to.</P>
    <P>For that reason, though drunken driving is something which must be stamped out, so also is dangerous driving but I think there are cases where to disqualify automatically might put a person out of his livelihood, discretion should be allowed to the courts because I suggest that automatic disqualification is a punishment which does not fit the crime and which might not be appropriate to the person committing it. The number of cases involved would be small and if persons were disqualified from driving on Saturdays or Sundays or on their halfday, if they have one, it would bring home to them and to the public generally the enormity of drunken driving equally as effectively as the present system.</P>
    <P>Even with automatic disqualification for one year, those convicted under the 1961 Act can go back to the courts after six months and apply for re-instatement and the court, having heard evidence of previous convictions and having regard to how the person has behaved in the meantime and to his <Col N="965" /> family circumstances, may decide to give him back his licence. I am not satisfied that the present system, which we are now extending by making it an offence under subsection (3) of this section, liable to automatic disqualification, is something we should be happy about. I should like to see more latitude given to the district court than at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never been in favour of lengthy disqualifications except in cases of very serious offences. We have seen cases where licences were withdrawn for life or for very long periods and usually when we have examined the cases concerned we have agreed the penalty was fully justified. On the other hand, as Senator O'Quigley has said, the period of 12 months of automatic disqualification is too long because of the automatic nature of the penalty. If it were only a matter of a judge, having carefully considered all the circumstances, that a man should have his licence withdrawn for 12 months I should not find fault with it, but I am against automatic disqualification of a person from driving for 12 months without having his case threshed out and considered in court and a decision made by the justice.</P>
      <P>There are many cases in which disqualification for three months or six months would have the desired effect, would be a serious penalty for the person at the loss of his licence for such period. Therefore, the Minister should consider the possibility of discretion on the part of the courts or of shorter disqualification. He should consider whether the period of 12 months is not too long.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Quigley in so far as I think he is right that though it is proper that stern measures should be taken to prevent drunken driving, there is the danger that in concentrating on this aspect other driving offences may be forgotten. Indeed, a great many of them seem to be forgotten as it is. I have seen some appalling driving in Dublin at 10 o'clock in the morning. The drivers are not drunk. What is wrong with <Col N="966" /> them is sheer bad manners. It has reached the point when one is almost ashamed to drive at the specified speed limits because one feels slightly odd. If one is driving at 30 miles an hour other motorists will blow one to get out of their way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have been saying, by concentrating on this we are in effect saying: &ldquo;It is all right as long as you are not drunk. Never mind the other things&rdquo;. I do not suppose for a moment that this is the official attitude, but taken in conjunction with the fact that at the moment the most disgraceful driving goes on in this city and outside it, one cannot help but feel that through this concentration on drunken driving, the image will be created that as long as a motorist is not drunk he can do what he likes. I know it is not easy for the Minister to stop all this but surely the resources of the State could be extended to make some effort to make the existing law work. A concentrated effort could be made for a week in one or two places to administer the law at present in operation. The authorities need not announce where they are going. Radio cars could arrange to switch from one place to another, to switch ideas without any pre-arrangement. Otherwise, if something along these lines is not done, quite good humoured people will get infuriated, will lose their tempers and without exceeding the speed limits may be provoked to do something serious. Anyone who drives knows the reaction one gets. One sees a number of clots getting away with it and you find your blood pressure goes up. While you are concentrating on this foolishness, some innocent person walks out on the road in front of you and they have had it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree to a great degree with what Senator Sheldon has said and I must say that some of the behaviour on our roads is scandalous. That behaviour does not always indicate that drivers are over the 125 level. May I also say that I do not <Col N="967" /> agree that it is not possible for a person to be over that level at 10 o'clock in the morning as has been stated? Some Senators told us of some friends of theirs or others who would have consumed so much alcohol the night before that it would be retained in their blood. However, I do agree that the behaviour on our roads is not improving. In fact, the indications are that there is a disimprovement as far as safety on our roads is concerned and a great deal more requires to be done with regard to that.</P>
      <P>I do not subscribe to the idea of enacting further legislation. It may well be said that a more complete legislative framework is a prerequisite to the proper application of the law as a whole. It is my belief and my hope that this will prove to be so when we enact this further traffic legislation and that there would be a greater observance of the law and a greater enforcement of it. I still subscribe to the belief that we are a gambling people in the sense that we do not back losers if we can avoid it. Perhaps &ldquo;gambling&rdquo; is the wrong word to use in this context but I feel that if all our people got the idea that by doing the wrong thing on the road they were likely to be caught and caught quickly, far fewer of them would commit any of these offences at all. If we feel that we are going to get away with it, which seems to be the general idea, if we see other people do the wrong thing and get away with it, we are inclined to follow their example. People see others get away with offences and this encourages them to take a chance and do the same thing themselves. Unfortunately, some person comes along who is not taking a chance, gets in the way and they are gone. It is small help to the family of a person who may be killed or crippled that somebody gave bad example by doing the wrong thing five minutes earlier and that somebody else followed that example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, when we put the microscope on a Bill at Committee Stage we are inclined to forget the total content of the Bill and some of us are inclined to be over-sympathetic to the law breakers. I feel that we are being over-sympathetic <Col N="968" /> here when we talk about the obligatory disqualification for a year being too harsh and when we say that disqualification for a year is too long for somebody who has broken the law and is shown to have broken it by his refusal to undergo tests. If such a person is over the level of 125 milligrammes, which is a very generous level by any standards, or if such a person refuses to be tested there is no reason why he should not be subject to the same penalties of fine and imprisonment and there is no reason either why he should not be treated for the offence by disqualification for 12 months.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the hardship cases, to the persons who probably lose their employment by virtue of the fact that driving is an essential part of it. It is felt that such persons are more harshly treated than others who commit the same offence, but I would hope that the person on whom the loss of a driving licence would have no great impact would get a little while in jail which would discommode him, or that he would get the full fine and disqualification. This is the way we should be looking at it instead of isolating the case of disqualification and saying that a person has been harshly treated. This is isolating the disqualification as the only penalty. It is an obligatory penalty but the fine of £100 and/or six months imprisonment may also be applied. I would expect that the imprisonment and a fine would be imposed on those on whom the disqualification would be no real hardship.</P>
    <P>None of these people should be treated in a manner that would encourage them to offend again because the penalties were not severe enough. We cannot tolerate the present conduct on our roads, we cannot tolerate people who behave in this way and these penalties must be used as deterrents of a severe and drastic nature if we are to make any impact on the vigilance of the people themselves. If these people are going to be caught and if the penalties are going to be so severe as to discourage future offences, then this is a realistic approach to a very serious matter; it will deal properly with <Col N="969" /> those who cannot conduct themselves and it will protect law abiding people who are using the roads properly but who can end up in hospital or can end up dead although they never put a foot wrong on the roads in their lives.</P>
    <P>I feel that we are far too much inclined to talk about the lame dog sort of fellow who gets himself into trouble and who not only gets himself into trouble but probably kills somebody in the course of getting himself into trouble. Then we get all this talk about consideration for him. I do not think he deserves a great deal of consideration. It is all very well to talk in that way and probably in certain circumstances I might do the same but the realistic approach is that we cannot have this sort of behaviour and we must prevent it in any way we can&mdash;by more severe penalties; by extending and expanding our laws; by greater enforcement of our laws&mdash; whatever device possible. I think the obligation is on us in this and many other respects to try to protect the people who are law-abiding and using the roads properly from those who are breaking the law and misusing the roads. We just cannot have it. It is as simple as that. I think this law if it were proposed in 1961 in this form would have had a fairly stiff run against the public opinion then obtaining but I think our public have become very much more educated since then and appreciate in a general way the need for preventing the misuse and abuse of our roads.</P>
    <P>You will still have a few who will go against these laws but I think the majority of people are behind us and the only thing for which they will point a finger at us is that we are not doing enough about making them stick, not bringing them through quickly enough, to stop the carry-on that is going on and the slaughter and the death on the roads and the maiming and the injury and the loss incurred by all sorts of people, not just this isolated group here. They are not the only offenders but they are major offenders in a serious way and they must be treated in that way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> I think we can become a little bit too over-sympathetic when we look in Committee Stage in isolation on particular aspects of what we propose to do and not at the overall general context. The overall general context must be given its fair place and the overall impact of what we are trying to do should be kept in its proper perspective and remember that we are expected to do this. After all, we are here to reflect and give effect to the views of the public whom we serve and I think that that is what we are doing now, I feel that what we are doing is justified and must be put into operation and the sooner the better.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>Before section 32 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution of the following section for section 50:</P>
      <P>(1) In this section &lsquo;unfit to drive&rsquo; means under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a drug to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of a mechanically propelled vehicle.</P>
      <P>(2) A person who, when in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle which is in a public place with intent to drive or attempt to drive the vehicle, but not driving or attempting to drive the vehicle, is unfit to drive the vehicle or in whose body there is present a quantity of alcohol such that, within three hours after having been so in charge of the vehicle, the concentration of alcohol in his blood will exceed a concentration of 125 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) A person who is guilty of an offence under this section shall be <Col N="971" /> liable on summary conviction, in the case of a first offence, to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any terms not exceeding one month or to both such fine and such imprisonment and, in the case of a second or any subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>(4) In a prosecution for an offence under this section, it shall be presumed that the defendant intended to drive or attempt to drive the vehicle until he shows the contrary.</P>
    <P>(5) A person liable to be charged with an offence under this section shall not, by reference to the same occurrence, be liable to be charged under section 12 of the Licensing Act, 1872, with the offence of being drunk while in charge, on a highway or other public place, of a carriage.</P>
    <P>(6) Where a member of the Garda Síochána is of opinion that a person is committing or has committed an offence under this section, he may arrest the person without warrant.</P>
    <P>(7) Where a person convicted of an offence under this section has been previously convicted of an offence under section 49 of this Act or under section 30 of the repealed Act or under section 30 (3) or 33 (3) of the Road Traffic Act, 1968 he shall be treated for the purposes of this section as having been previously convicted of an offence under this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14, I hope, sets out what I intended to do and that is to take the amendments which are proposed under section 32 of the Bill and to incorporate them into section 50 of the 1961 Act so that the 1961 Act and the amendment will go together as a compact section. This is another of those sections that is likely to be in every day use from now on. One must be realistic. What I want <Col N="972" /> to avoid is having unnecessary complications in relation to what should be quite a simple matter. What we want to deal with is the case of persons being in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a drug or while having the 125 milligrammes of alcohol in their blood. It seems to me right and proper that if the offence is committed that then we should say that it is an offence under section 32 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968, rather than that somebody has committed an offence under section 50 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 and section 32 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968. There was a plea made on Second Stage by a number of Senators on both sides of the House to have this kind of thing done. I think the Minister should have little difficulty in recommending it to the House.</P>

I very much doubt if I would be entitled to. In any event, I want to avoid trouble. The odd thing is that on this question of drink we have all become very friendly, the way people become very friendly over a drink.

      <P>One of the features about this matter is that the Commission itself, probably deliberately, refrained from making any comment or suggestion on what should be so considered and in that regard did have the belief that this should be left more to the courts discretion, as presented at the particular time, which the courts would regard as, I think the words mentioned were, &ldquo;special&rdquo; and &ldquo;substantial&rdquo;. Those two words cannot be ignored in regard to the <Col N="974" /> possible type of circumstances where this could be pleaded successfully.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that the Commission rightly avoided this and deliberately did so on the basis that it was of a nature that should be considered by the courts but with special regard to special and substantial reasons.

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (4), page 24, to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;() The Bureau and every member of it shall be independent in the exercise of their functions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The operation of the provisions of this Bill relating to drunken driving will give rise to a considerable amount of discussion and, perhaps, criticism in its early days of operation. When the Bureau which will carry out those functions is established and begins to function it is highly important and desirable that it should get off to a good start and that the public, especially the motoring public, should have confidence in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite certain that the highly specialised and technical people who will be appointed to it will carry out the functions which will be assigned to them in a thoroughly professional and competent way, but so that there can be no question that the bureau is got at or that the bureau forms part of the paraphernalia of the Garda or part of the paraphernalia of the Department of Justice or the Minister for Local Government, I should like to see it put beyond any doubt that it is a body which is quite independent in every way. It is for that reason I <Col N="975" /> am suggesting that section 37 should be amended so that the Bureau will be independent in the exercise of its functions and when certificates are handed in in evidence in the district courts, they will always be seen to be independent.</P>
    <P>Again, in regard to amendment No. 17, I think the members of the Bureau should only be removed from office on the grounds of physical unfitness, mental disability or misconduct. It very often happens in cases of this kind that a statement of the reasons for the removal of the person should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Again, this would be in line with the thinking that the Bureau should be entirely independent. If a person is removed on the grounds of physical unfitness, mental disability or misconduct that would have to be stated. Having put down this amendment and having gone through the Report of the Commission on Drunken Driving, I found, in fact, that they had made a somewhat similar recommendation. In their Report at page 54, it is stated:</P>
    <P>The analysis of all blood and urine samples should be carried out in the same institution under the control of a medical director. We consider that the institution should be an independent authority not under State control.</P>
    <P>As this will be a body whose evidence will be accepted in court, it should be quite clear from the very beginning that it is a body which is entirely independent of the Garda, the Department of Local Government and members of the public. Therefore, I think it would enhance the prestige of the Bureau if it was agreed from the outset that they would be independent and that they would be removable only on an order of the Government.</P>

      <P>The thing about this is that it will be set up as a corporate body. It will become as it were another semi-State body and it will be performing a function under the law as it were in respect of the overall performance of this law. The Minister answerable to the Oireachtas is the Minister for Local Government, whose function it is to set up this body to do these certain specified matters which are outlined in greater detail in the following section, section 38.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is being done in a manner which is pretty well established. Take for instance the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards. This type of body is doing a job which could possibly be said to be one which if abused could lead to a great deal of dissatisfaction on the part of persons in the commercial field. There is nobody suggesting this is so and I do not think there is any reason why they should. I am merely mentioning that Institute because it is in a sense parallel to what will be done in this particular section, which proposes the setting up of this Bureau. It will not only be of a similar nature to that but in a way related. It will be doing a functional, probably a technical and a scientific job, in carrying out tasks relating to the law administered by the Minister for Local Government in like manner to the Industrial Research and Standards body which carries out functions for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or any other Minister or Department as well. It will in its day-to-day operations and in the matters that will be assigned to it&mdash;and there will <Col N="977" /> be, as you will see from later sections, specific functions assigned to it&mdash; have complete freedom. In the last analysis, the Minister for Local Government will be responsible to the Houses of the Oireachtas for the functioning, not the malfunctioning, particularly of an institute such as this. Therefore, it seems to me that an eminently suitable way to have this particular job done, or special jobs done is by setting up this special body, this semi-State board, this corporate body, this Bureau that is named here today, to adopt and carry out the functions assigned in section 28. There is no doubt that its freedom of operation in this particular way will be such as to make it as free as any body can be free and that it will in its day-to-day operations be completely free as are similar other bodies performing other and varied functions and under various other Ministers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very much in these matters a question of emphasis and a lot depends on what view one takes of the particular problem. This Bureau is not like the Bureau for Industrial Research and standards or other semi-State bodies that are established. This is a bureau that will be established and very few members of the motoring public will know very much about it, but the public will find that a certifi cate issued by this particular body as to the alcohol content of specimens of blood or urine in particular cases will be conclusive evidence in the courts. When it is a case of a State prosecution and where the livelihood and liberty of the subject is involved, in the ordinary course the person is convicted only upon evidence which is sworn and that evidence is tested under cross-examination by the judge, and if it is a case by jury, assessed by jury but it is always, remember, sworn testimony and a medical doctor at the present time goes into a witness box and gives the result of his examination of a person charged with drunken driving. The medical doctor is sworn and gives his evidence upon oath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read section 44 of the Bill dealing with the evidential effects of certificate <Col N="978" /> under section 43. It is provided there that:</P>
    <P>Where the certificate states it has been determined that a specimen of blood contained a specified concentration of alcohol....</P>
    <P>Under section 49 or 50 of the Principal Act, but subject to section 45 (4) of this Act, the conclusive evidence....</P>
    <P>and the facts are stated. That is a very good reason for putting beyond any doubt the absolute independence of the Bureau whose certificate will be accepted as conclusive evidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the very thing Senator O'Quigley fears in relation to the nature of the setting up of this Bureau that might indeed get around as a result of what is being said here. I would like to point out the following in section 38. It is proper and necessary to say it is in subsection (2) (a) (b) (c) and (d) that the functions of the Bureau have been set out. That is, section 38, in subsections (1) and (2) and particularly (2) (a), (2) (b), (2) (c) and (2) (d) put upon that Bureau obligations under the law which we propose to enact. The main obligations placed upon them are outlined in that particular subsection (2) and these obligations fall on that Bureau. The Bureau therefore will carry the responsibility for the performance of those roles as specified and the Bureau will undoubtedly be under or have as its head or chief officer a director. This has already been said by the Minister for Local Government, that there will be a well-known eminent and scientifically qualified man whose reputation, character and repute will be beyond reproach in the scientific world and he and those others, whoever they may be that serve for him on this Bureau, on matter by whom placed there will not be able to get out of the responsibility placed on them by this Bill if it becomes law under section 38 subsection (2) (a), (b) (c) and (d). Even if they were able to get out or if somebody tried to manipulate them to depart from the practices that are proper practices, they still carry responsibility in law to see that this does not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="979" /> There is in the following section the responsibility placed on the director and others to carry out certain functions of the Bureau. They must carry out their definite and personal responsibility each by virtue of his standing and the nature of the people they will be. Being in the public eye in a matter such as this, even if they had any wish to diverge from the straight and narrow, they would be damned fools to do so. In the first place there would be ruinous consequences to their own standing and professional operations in this country if there were any breath of malpractice being carried on either by themselves, by their own wish, and Senator O'Quigley does not suggest that this might be thought about, or by direction of anybody else, by a Minister of Government or anybody else. The House will see that this is just not on and I want to press home that it is being said publicly here so that the public may understand that it is not on. If the Seanad has done nothing except that we can say this is to be the position, it is well this amendment has been discussed.</P>
    <P>The director or chief officer of this Bureau will be beyond reproach. He will be the best that can be got in this particular field. In addition, the Minister for Local Government has already stated that in regard to the certification that Senator O'Quigley mentioned, this will be the responsibility of that Director or chief officer of the Bureau and this function may only be delegated by him possibly to his assistant, so there will not be any question of faceless men, or allegations that faceless men are writing these certificates. The duty will devolve on the top man and a certificate may be signed in his absence only by his assistant by delegated authority from the chief himself. That being so and this being the type of body proposed to be formed, not only should the House be satisfied that giving it status as a semi-State body in the circumstances I have outlined is the proper way to do the job but also that it is beyond any shadow of reproach, that it may not function improperly or may its functions be misapplied <Col N="980" /> or abused in any way. Not only should the House be satisfied but the public, for whom Senator O'Quigley seems to be so concerned, will see the circumstances so that they will be satisfied. There must be no question of reproach about the veracity of the performance of their functions by the members of the Bureau in regard to these matters of such serious import for the individuals concerned.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said about the integrity and the standing of the members of the Bureau but all he has said would really form a very good argument for the amendment because the Minister has been describing what these people will be. What I want to do merely is to have it stated in the legislation that they are all the Minister says and that the law says it too. However, for some reason, the Minister does not want to put this in that way and I shall not pursue the matter at great length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course the Minister, first of all, thinks from the point of view of a Minister watching the operations of his Department every day, while we, who are not in the same position, see things from the outside. We have had varying experiences which the Minister does not have. We have seen laws which, when they were being enacted here had a particular intention, but which when they came to be applied administratively&mdash;this applies equally in the courts as it does within the Civil Service&mdash;took on very strange shapes. Of course the Bureau will have to perform the functions assigned to it by this Act. That is so, but equally so we have seen appeals officers appointed under the Social Welfare Act of 1952, with the functions given to them directly by the Oireachtas, and if anybody had put down an amendment in those days to say that they shall be independent in the exercise of their functions and if the Minister for Agriculture, who is here this evening, had been dealing with it, he would have said in relation to the appeals officers what he has said now in relation to the Bureau, its director and members. However, we know what has happened in relation to the appeals <Col N="981" /> officers. They have not been independent.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that is the Minister's experience, but as I have said, we have experience on the outside. I know of one case that went the whole way through the courts, arriving in the Supreme Court, where it was established that the appeals officer, instead of exercising the appeals functions given to him by the Act, took his directions from the Department. One subsequently had the experience of appeals officers acting as if the Supreme Court had not indicated what the powers of appeals officers were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am talking about the fact that both the Bureau and the appeals officers get their powers directly from the statutes, but when it comes to the exercise of these powers, it can be a different matter. I have said that I <Col N="982" /> expect the Bureau, composed of highly scientific men, will take its own line, but what I want to do is to protect them from the interference to which they may be subjected by some overanxious part of the Department of Local Government. It is important that the director of the Bureau can then point out: &ldquo;We are to be independent in the exercise of our functions and apart from certain things the Minister may direct, we will have no guff from you&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is important from the point of view of a bureau whose certificate will be conclusive evidence of whether a man is guilty of drunken driving. There is no reason in the world why the Minister will not accept the amendment which merely puts into the Act the label which the Minister has spelled out so eloquently in so many words. I merely suggest that the Bureau and every member of it shall be independent in the exercise of their function so that thereafter members of the public will have no doubt in their minds and will be able to say, in so far as it is possible to remove it by legislation, that the Bureau, who issue the certificate and which, when handed into court, will determine whether a person is guilty or not: &ldquo;It is the same as with our judges under the Constitution&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Likewise, this Bureau, which will be the arbiter of whether a person is guilty of drunken driving, will have the same label of independence as will, through this amendment, be written into the legislation from the beginning. This amendment could not do anything but good; I should like to hear Senator O'Kennedy or somebody telling us what harm it could do. On the contrary, it could make a positive contribution to the status of the Bureau and it is highly important that a Bill like this, which is making inroads into certain customs and liberties of ours, should take care that this liberty of functions is maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having been invited to contribute, I wish to say that surely subsection (2) clearly spells out what the nature of the functions of the Bureau should be. It says that the <Col N="983" /> Bureau shall do certain things without reference to the Minister. Could anything be clearer? Senator O'Quigley appears to be arguing in a circle. Though he wants to have this independent Bureau, he appears to suggest at the same time that it will be in some way subject to such orders as will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Either it is to be entirely independent of these Houses or it is not. I do not think it would be appropriate that it should be entirely independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers being conferred on it will be conferred by the elected representatives <Col N="984" /> and accordingly the Oireachtas must retain some authority, not in relation to the functions of the Bureau but to the constitution of it. One can always find grounds for suspicion in the setting up of any body, semi-State or otherwise, from Aer Lingus down. I think the Bill sets out clearly the matters posed by Senator O'Quigley.</P>
