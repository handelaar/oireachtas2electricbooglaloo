      <P>Yes&mdash;the Minister for Justice, repeating his assertion five or six times, gave the House to understand that I had contacted Mr. Ralph Schoenman at Dublin Airport on his arrival, and/or at Mountjoy Gaol subsequently. Since I was not enabled, either during the Minister's speech or at the end of the debate, to state fully the true position in this connection, I now beg leave of the House to make the following personal statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) I want to begin by saying most emphatically that if in fact I had seen or contacted Mr. Schoenman on the occasion of his short visit to Ireland, I should have felt myself under no obligation to apologise to anyone for having done so.</P>
      <P>(2) I did not in fact see him, however, or contact him, either at Dublin Airport, or at Mountjoy Gaol, or at any other place during his stay in Ireland.</P>
      <P>(3) He did not communicate with me in any way on that occasion, or in connection with that occasion, nor I with him, either directly or indirectly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4) Consequently, the information about our alleged meeting at Dublin Airport and/or at Mountjoy Gaol, upon which the Minister based his charge of hypocrisy against me&mdash;when I asked for the reasons why Mr. Schoenmen was refused entry&mdash;was information which was not only grossly inaccurate <Col N="112" /> but completely devoid of any foundaation in fact.</P>
    <P>(5) Lastly, the source of this information about me, some of which concerned events alleged to have taken place within the precincts of a State prison under the jurisdiction of the Minister, has been shown, in the light of the easily verifiable facts which I have here publicly and categorically stated, to be totally undeserving of the Minister's trust.</P>

    <Title>Army Pensions Bill, 1968    (Certified Money Bill):    Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard) Michael Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide concessions in regard to married pensions and allowances, and to enable Budgetary increases in benefits under the Army Pensions Acts to be prescribed by regulations. It also effects a number of amendments to the Acts which are regarded as necessary.</P>
      <P>Except for persons with pre-Truce Service, in whose case a marriage contracted before the 5th August, 1953, qualifies for benefit, a pensioner who marries after the date of his wound or the date of discharge, is not entitled to a married pension under the Acts. Section 2 now provides that a pensioner who marries at any time will be entitled to a married pension.</P>
      <P>The Army Pensions Acts at present require that the death of a pensioner must be due solely to his pensionable disablement before allowances can be granted to his widow and children. Although the words &ldquo;due solely&rdquo; are given as wide an interpretation as possible, there have been cases where widows and children were not eligible for allowances because the Army Pensions Board&mdash;which has the statutory duty to determine such matters&mdash;was unable to associate the certified cause of death with the pensionable disability. In my opinion a high degree of pensionable disability must affect the life span of the pensioner and play a not inconsiderable part in his death, even though it cannot be certified that death was due solely to that particular disability. Consequently, I feel that where a pensioner with a high degree of disablement, i.e. 50 per cent or more, dies, his widow and children should have an automatic entitlement to allowances. The necessary provision is made in section 3, which also covers the cases of pensioners who died before the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> Section 11 also relates to allowances for widows and children. It provides for the widow and children of a person who did not receive a pension and who died either while serving or within eight years after discharge from a disease aggravated by United Nations service.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the qualifying date for marriage for purposes of a married pension necessitates a number of consequential amendments to the Acts in relation to children and adopted children. New married pension rates which provided in the Acts of 1946 and 1949 and the No. 2 Act of 1960 for former officers and soldiers of the Defence Forces are made up of an element in respect of the pensioner's wife and an element in respect of each child born not later than nine months after the pensioner's discharge. An adopted child is treated as a child of the marriage for purposes of benefit only where he was adopted before the date of the wound, the date of discharge or the date on which the special allowance commenced. Sections 8 and 15, in conjunction with the Schedule, provide that in future the child's element of the married pension will be payable in respect of all the children of the pensioner and that a child adopted at any time will reckon for benefit on the same basis as a child of the marriage.</P>
    <P>The object of section 5 is to enable a member of the First Line Reserve to apply for a wound pension or gratuity. At present he cannot do so until he has been discharged from the Reserve. A wound pension will not be payable concurrently with service pay.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Act of 1953 provides for the grant of an allowance to the permanently invalided brother of a deceased person who had pre-Truce military service and who died in circumstances attributable to service in the 1916-1923 period. Where an application is refused on grounds of failure to fulfil the requirement of dependency it can be reviewed from time to time at the request of the applicant. If, however, it is refused because of failure to satisfy the condition of permanent invalidism there is no power to reconsider it. In section 6 it is being provided <Col N="116" /> that such an application may also be reviewed from time to time.</P>
    <P>Increases in the benefits under the Acts are, in the main, what have come to be known as Budgetary increases, i.e. increases announced by the Minister for Finance in the Budget Statement as part of a general increase in public service pension. The present procedure for giving effect to such increases is by way of amendments to the Acts. It is now standard practice, in so far as public service pensions are concerned, that increases of this type, which conform to a well-established pattern, should be implemented by regulations rather than by amending legislation. The necessary provision is being made in section 7 to enable Budgetary increases in benefits under the Acts to be promulgated by regulations.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the Bill is of a technical nature. Section 9 clears up an anomaly in the No. 2 Act of 1960. A former member of the Defence Forces has up to eight years after discharge in which to apply for a pension in respect of disease attributable to United Nations service. If, however, he dies, after discharge, from such a disease without having been granted a pension, his widow and children cannot qualify for allowances unless his death took place within four years after discharge. The period of four years after discharge in the case of allowances is being amended to eight.</P>
    <P>Section 10 applies to the dependent relatives of a deceased soldier who dies from disease attributable to United Nations service the same conditions as at present apply to the relatives of a soldier who is killed or dies from wounds i.e., a relative will be treated as a dependant only if a voluntary allotment was payable to him or her by the deceased soldier.</P>
    <P>When the Act of 1962 introduced married pensions and allowances in the case of pensioners whose pensions were in respect of disability aggravated by service, the relevant provision did not cover the case of a person who qualified for an aggravation pension after the passing of the Act. Section 12 remedies this omission.</P>
    <P>Section 13, for the removal of doubt. <Col N="117" /> applies certain general provisions of the Acts to the benefits under section 7 of the Act of 1962. It also applies them to allowances under section 11 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, subsection (5) of section 3 and the first and fifth items in the Schedule repeal provisions of the Acts of 1932 and 1959 which impose restrictions on the grant of married pensions and widows' and children's allowances and which will now no longer apply.</P>
    <P>Where my Department has a record of persons who would appear to be eligible for benefit under the Bill, it is the intention to communicate with them as soon as the Bill becomes law and to give them an opportunity of making application. To cover the possibility that there may be cases of which the Department is not aware, the provisions with regard to benefits will be advertised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentMcHugh" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much one can say on this Bill except to welcome it. For many years military service in this country was treated as something which was below average. Military personnel were treated for many years as second-class people and second-class citizens who did not apparently deserve proper pay, proper allowances or, indeed, proper pensions. When one sees, even at this late stage, little anomalies like this being cleared up it is welcome. It is difficult to understand why it took us until this stage to bring this question of married pensions into line with pensions for people in civilian life. However, it is a welcome move even at this late stage. The provisions to provide disability pensions particularly for those who are suffering from wounds received in the 1916-1922 period are particularly welcome.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the Bill. There is nothing that one can say about it except to welcome it and to congratulate the Minister again on bringing it in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedOSullivan" hpid="Mr. Ted O'Sullivan Mr. Ted O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ted O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise my voice to welcome this Bill. This, I suppose, is really an amending Bill but I feel it is the greatest, the best amending Bill that we have had <Col N="118" /> to the Pensions Acts over all the years. Personally, I feel very happy about it and very grateful to the people in the Department for having gone into all the matters that have been raised here year after year on the different Army Pensions Bills. We can honestly say that this Bill has done almost all the things for which we have been agitating for the Old IRA and the Army over the years. It is certainly a wonderful Bill. It is a great pity, of course, as Senator McHugh has said, that it is so late. It is definitely late for the many. I regret that the Minister did not give us some idea of the number of persons who will be likely to benefit under this Bill. I have a feeling that the number is very small. I wonder if it is much more than 1,000 or so? It would have been better if the Minister had given us figures for military service pensions, disability pensions and special allowances so that we would have a better idea of the great benefits that this Bill will confer on a certain number. However, be that as it may, my only regret is that it is so many years late. I have always held that it was unfair to single out pensioners of under 50 per cent disablement and not give them an opportunity of qualifying for a married pension. Now that is all set aside and we are assured that the dependants of most disability pensioners will be provided for in a fair way. Surely a disability pensioner who was 50 per cent disabled 30 years ago must have had his life shortened and must have suffered from various infirmities in the intervening years because of that disablement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyhow, each and every section of the Bill as far as I can see confers a benefit on all recipients of disability pensions. We are grateful for it, indeed, and trust that a few of the matters which were referred to here on several previous occasions may now be given attention by the Minister and the Department seeing that they have got all those big items out of the way. In volume 55, No. 19 of the Official Report, the Minister was asked to consider the question of hospital treatment for a small number of disability pensioners. At the moment and for many <Col N="119" /> years persons who have not received final pensions have been allowed to have treatment for their wounds and diseases in St. Bricin's Hospital but the person who has got a final pension was ruled out in relation to any further assistance.</P>
    <P>That was wrong and if we were bound in any way to give assistance or treatment in regard to pensions which are not final the same thing should have applied to those pensions which were final. The same concessions should have been given in those cases. The circumstances under which those things occurred were the same. I do not think it is too late that this should apply to the very few who are left. I am sure that after all that has been done in this great Bill by the Minister and his Department they will find some way to make provision for assistance or treatment for those few hundred people to help them over the few remaining years left to them.</P>
    <P>At the passing of the 1962 Act the then Minister gave as his opinion that it would be impossible to cater for all those people in St. Bricin's Hospital. I was of opinion then, and I am more so of opinion now, that there was no necessity whatever to attempt to cater for them in St. Bricin's Hospital but that it would be quite easy, as has been done in many other cases, to make arrangements for urgent treatment, if any, in local hospitals, at the nearest county hospital, for instance, and the Department should take responsibility for the expenses of that treatment as if they had been called to give it in St. Brican's Hospital. I would urge consideration of this as one of the few remaining benefits which the Minister can confer on this dwindling number.</P>
    <P>There was one other matter I referred to on that occasion and I have to refer to it again. It applies only to very few in the whole country. I refer to persons who are in receipt let us say of 100 per cent disablement benefit and who are certainly unfit to make a living in any other way and have to depend on their pension. In the same way, you have persons who have got special allowances. I might remind the House that those special allowances <Col N="120" /> are investigated closely and nobody gets a special allowance unless he is incapable of self-support and being incapable of self-support and having no other means, he must depend entirely on the special allowance to support him with the result that many people find themselves in the position, when they are nearing their last days, that they cannot make provision for their burial arrangements. This is a great shock to the country. Mind you, I think the Department of Defence should take some responsibility for those people. They are people who have given their all to the country, who have been pronounced incapable of self-support. How, in the name of God, can they be pronounced able to provide for their burial expenses.</P>
    <P>As I say, there is only a very small number but even if there were only ten or even only one, I see no reason why the Department of Defence would not come to their rescue and ensure that those people are buried decently rather than their having to depend entirely on the poor allowance. I trust that those few matters will get the attention of the Minister and his Department from now on seeing that all the major matters, as I said, have been cleared up.</P>
    <P>I am glad to notice in the Minister's statement today that it is the intention of the Department to communicate with persons whom they think would qualify under this Bill. That is a wonderful idea. We appreciate very much that, as well as advertising, those people will be communicated with and told of their rights. I am glad to note that we have no more serious criticism of this Bill. I wish to place on record my appreciation and the appreciation of the organisation which I represent to the Minister and his Department for what they are doing under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should just like very briefly to associate myself with the Senators who have congratulated the Minister on this Bill which is a thoughtful and a humane Bill, one which gives justice to those dependants, the widows and the orphans of army <Col N="121" /> pensioners whether their service was in this country or under the aegis of the United Nations. I should just like to make the point that the Minister for Defence is here setting a very good example for the Minister for Finance. The Minister for Finance has told us that he intends to introduce a scheme of pensions for the widows of State servants other than members of the Army, army pensioners. This Bill and the Acts which it amends are setting a good example for the Government and the Minister for Finance who is immediately concerned with the problem as to the way in which we would hope the widows of all pensioners, State pensioners, would be treated. The Minister in introducing this measure has set a good example and one which I hope will be swiftly followed by his colleague.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This indeed, as some other Senators have said, is a Bill which confers benefits and I am quite certain that the recipients would agree that it is not coming a day too early. In fact, a Bill of this kind, as Senator T. O'Sullivan has indicated, has long been overdue. If Senator Sheehy Skeffington were aware of the kind of allowances that were paid to dependents of army pensioners and to the pensioners themselves he would not refer to this Bill as doing justice to those people. The allowances, if my recollection is correct, are, indeed, meagre and, indeed, the increases granted in recent years were ludicrously small. In some cases they were only as much as 6d and 7d. However, the Bill in so far as it is an amelioration is to be welcomed and should be given a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One criticism I have of the Bill is in relation to section 7 which proposes to make automatic increases in pensions where other increases in pensions have been given to public servants and to other State employees. That is a wrong approach. The increases should be related to increases in wages to other public employees, not to increases in pensions merely. In other words, what should happen in relation to pensions for army personnel, or former army personnel, is that as the level of remuneration of serving personnel <Col N="122" /> is increased the pensions should be increased automatically by at least the same amount because most of these increases are related to the increased cost of living and the plight of the pensioner is always more harrowing than that of the serving person. Therefore, the pension should automatically go up every time the existing pay of serving personnel is increased.</P>
    <P>In fact, whenever the Minister for Finance is assessing the amount of money he will have to pay to civil servants, teachers, army personnel, or whoever else is involved, he always has an eye on pensioners and says: &ldquo;It will cost so much for personnel and we must pay £X, or whatever it is for pensions&rdquo;. They have a factor for finding out and approximating what the pensions will amount to. I think section 7 would be much more justifiable if increases were related to increases in the pay of serving personnel. There is an odd thing about the way we do our business in this country which means that we cannot trust any Minister of State to do anything without recourse to the Minister for Finance. That is the fiction. We all know it is not the Minister for Finance who brings his mind to bear on the particular sum of money or the particular rate of pay. It is a principal or other officer who does this and we are told that in enacting the law the Minister is doing this, that or the other.</P>
    <P>This is a Certified Money Bill. This House of the Oireachtas cannot make any amendment in any pensions legislation because the Constitution says that we cannot do so. The Seanad has no power to amend Money Bills and the Minister for Finance says the Seanad have not power to amend. Indeed, individual members of the Dáil cannot increase pensions by a halfpenny as they have not this power under the Constitution. In this Bill we are proposing that the Minister for Defence will be able to do what no Member or all the Members of the Dáil cannot do and what this House cannot do. We propose under section 7 that the Minister for Defence, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, otherwise a principal officer of the Department of Finance, will be able to increase <Col N="123" /> pensions. This is the kind of cod we get on with. I make this remark in passing so that people will know what we are enacting under section 7.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Constitution and every power enabling the Minister to do so he is responsible, but I should like the House to look behind this fiction and see where this House and the other House of the Oireachtas stand and point to the growing power of the bureaucracy which is hedged about and screened off when the Minister makes a regulation with the approval of the Minister for Finance. I think it is always right to point out this gradual erosion of the power of Parliament and the growing establishment of the civil servants who make these regulations which are approved by the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>As far as I am aware, there is no provision under our code of army pensions and certainly not in this Bill for the kind of situation with which I am about to deal. As I understand it, if while serving, an army officer dies, from natural causes a gratuity or pension is payable to his widow but I understand that does not apply to privates or non-commissioned officers. Whether that be so or not, I am aware of a distressing case of a young private who about two winters ago took ill in a barracks in Galway. His complaint was first diagnosed as flu. He was sent to bed for a few days. Then it was diagnosed as appendicitis and he was transferred from Galway to Athlone. When he got to Athlone they decided it was a case calling for an operation and then he was transferred to a military hospital in Dublin. What was originally diagnosed as flu and then diagnosed as appendicitis resulted in the death of the young man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already referred this case to the Minister and while one cannot penetrate <Col N="124" /> into the secrecy of the army and the Civil Service as to what, in fact, went wrong, there should be some kind of provision in a Bill of this kind for an <i>ad misericordiam</i> lump sum in such cases. As it happened, the unfortunate mother of this young man who might benefit from his earnings should be entitled to some kind of pension. It may well be that all that could be done in this particular case was done. It may well be that something went wrong somewhere but in the ordinary course one would have expected that a young soldier might not have died from what was originally diagnosed as flu and then was diagnosed as a case of appendicitis. There should be some provision in a Bill whereby the Minister, without imputing blame or negligence to anybody, but where the circumstances are such that if it were within the power of the Minister, he could make <i>ex gratia</i> payments.</P>
    <P>If something is not available in existing legislation to enable a lump sum to be paid or, as I say, if in years to come a pension should be payable to the widow or mother of the type of young man I have been referring to, like a lot of other hard cases which are now being dealt with in this Bill, the Minister should be enabled to do something about such cases. It will not arise often but when it does it is particularly tragic for the affected family. Therefore, I urge the Minister to give some consideration to it because no Member of the Dáil or of this House can effectively do anything to give that power to the Minister. It is a power which every Member of the Oireachtas agrees he should have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other Members in commending the Minister for the Bill, such as it is. I do not suppose it is possible to find a Bill that would give complete satisfaction to everyone. I appeal to the Minister on behalf of a particular category who served in the Army and who apparently do not come under any provision of any Bill. They are the men who served the country during the Emergency and apparently they are not provided for by way of compensation for consequent disability <Col N="125" /> other than by way of social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>When the Emergency was declared, the Army was very low in strength and something in the region of 66 per cent of its increase came entirely from the people in all branches of society who offered themselves for service. At that time the Army were not prepared for an expansion of that kind and consequently the arrangements to house, feed and generally look after these men were inadequate. I know of companies and battalions which were moved out into the country to places where there was no suitable accommodation except old country houses which were falling down and which were taken over. In them there were no facilities for drying clothes, no heating.</P>
      <P>In the winters of 1940 and 1941 some of these units were put on night patrols on the Border. They had to leave their billets at seven at night and did not return until seven in the morning, in the meantime exposed to all types of inclement weather. The winter of 1940 was the worst we ever had in this country and it is most unlikely that these men could have gone unscathed through six years of service in such conditions. On their discharge, medical boards were set up and each man was examined. A number were found to be suffering from one disability or another. Some of them were looked after at that time but during the course of the years, as these people advanced in age, various disabilities began to show themselves. During the past few years cases were drawn to my attention in respect of which, as an ex-member of the Army, I felt ashamed of the fact that these men should have been left to their own devices with nobody showing any interest on their behalf. We owe something to the people who served the country during the Emergency and we owe a lot to those who are now incapacitated as a result of that service &mdash;to men who are incapable of earning their own living and looking after their wives and families. I appeal, therefore, to the Minister to consider, before we conclude this measure, taking some power to deal with cases of real hardship in the category about which I have been speaking.</P>

      <P>I also wish to thank the Minister for the fine Bill he has introduced. As Senator Ted O'Sullivan said, it goes a long way to clear up a number of irritants and to remove a number of road blocks which have stood in the way for years of giving a modicum of justice to those who served their country. Some years ago I made a plea in the Seanad for one type of benefit which, unfortunately, has not been included in this Bill and I hope we shall find the Minister coming before us at an early date asking for legislative approval to provide it. I refer, of course, to the crying need for what might be described as a soldiers' home. We have hospital treatment for disabled soldiers here, we have pensions to provide against illness, unemployment and old age. However, may I say that in our hospital treatment provision, I am not at all satisfied that there is not one special hospital such as Saint Bricin's reserved for Old IRA men or men who served during the Emergency or in the permanent Defence Forces who were discharged because of disability sustained as a result of service.</P>
      <P>I cannot see why, with the resources at our disposal, it is impossible to provide one such military hospital to cater for these classes without any of the red tape associated with entry into St. Bricin's. In this respect, many of the Old IRA men still living find themselves, as a result of the passage of time, with very few, if any, relatives living. Their people have died and many of them are left on their own. They are old and there is nobody to care for them and perhaps nobody to take very much interest in them. There is nowhere they can go except to some costly private nursing home or hospital or to depend on the charity of their friends.</P>
      <P>This country owes something to those men. There are, as Senator O'Sullivan said, only a few of them left. We have been derelict in our duty to them and before they pass away we should derive inspiration from what they did for this country and find the amount of money necessary to provide a proper soldiers' home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" /> In Great Britain, the US and the Continent worthy citizens, better endowed with the world's goods than most of us, are glad to present to the nation houses, suitable buildings for purposes such as I have outlined and I have no doubt that if an effort were made here we would find that some of our better-off citizens would be prepared to donate a suitable building for a purpose such as this. When one considers the advantages it would have not alone for members of the IRA but also for old soldiers of the permanent Defence Forces who have been discharged and find themselves in this boat, there is no doubt it would be well worth the effort and the expenditure incurred.</P>
    <P>I live quite near a magnificent hospital provided by the British Government for Irishmen who served in the British forces and who are disabled and in receipt of pensions. There is a full medical and nursing staff provided there, X-ray services and a television room and everything else. Every care and attention is provided for these men and it makes me envious when I see it and think of the treatment given by all our Governments from 1926 or 1927 to the people we are now discussing. With regard to my suggestion about a soldiers' home, on the 11th November of every year, the British Remembrance Day, when I see the magnificent pageant staged in the Albert Hall in London and see the Chelsea pensioners honoured and given every admiration by the younger people who know they have served their country well, and when I see the provisions made for them in a soldiers' home where old soldiers can swop yearns and talk about old days, I am often envious.</P>
    <P>I am often envious when I remember that the men who freed this country and who defended it in times of peril have no provision made for them when their people die and they have no one left. As the Minister has got over all the other bottlenecks as he has done in his magnificent Bill, I hope that he will come again before this House with a proposition for a soldiers' home <Col N="128" /> for the soldiers of this country and for a hospital properly equipped and staffed to care for them.</P>

      <P>Sections 9 and 10 of this Bill deal with pensions payable to soldiers and with allowances to the relatives of soldiers who have served with the United Nations. They also deal with the pensions of other soldiers who have served abroad and I should like to know if this country is recompensed in any way towards the payment of these pensions, even though the pensions themselves may not commence to be paid for seven or eight years. I have particularly in mind the case of the ordinary soldier who has served for different periods in different places abroad. Are any portions of these pensions paid from United Nation funds or do we pay them all ourselves from State funds?</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Seanad for the manner in which it has received the Bill and for its acceptance that, as Minister, I have done the right thing in bringing in its provisions. I want to say how grateful I am that has been acknowledged by all the Senators who have spoken. In reply to Senator Ted O'Sullivan I should like to say that there are 1,000 disablement pensioners and about 10,000 military service pensioners. There are 9,000 special allowance holders of whom 1,100 are also in receipt of military service pensions. All the special allowance holders are in necessitous circumstances. There are over 2,000 NCOs and privates in receipt of pensions under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act. Some 47,000 service medals without bar have been issued and about 8,000 holders of these are in receipt of special allowances. Of the remaining 39,000 no information is available but it is reasonable to believe that about 20,000 are still alive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Senators press me to make financial provision for benefits such as hospitals and soldiers' homes, I should like to make known to them that the <Col N="129" /> task they suggest is a formidable one. It is not simple or easy; the cost would be very heavy. I am not opposed in principle to providing hospitals or homes or, indeed, to providing for our ex-soldiers and veterans as far as the State can afford it. I wish I was in a position to meet the cases that have been put forward to me and to provide the amenities which are available for the ex-servicemen of richer countries than this. But I think that Senator O'Sullivan and the other Senators who have spoken here and who have experience of military service either in pre-Truce days or during the Emergency must realise that it is not easy to deal with a large number of people who seek monetary recognition of service.</P>
    <P>With regard to pensions payable to widows of deceased pensioners, a man must have at least 50 per cent disability attributable to disease before he can have a disability pension. We have 580 such pensioners at present, of whom 180 are already in receipt of married pensions. Where the degree of disability is less than 50 per cent&mdash; these are sound cases&mdash;we have 364 cases, of which 127 are in receipt of married pensions. Thus we have about 1,000 disability pensions of one kind or another. We know who they are and they will be notified of the benefits that will accrue from the passage of this Bill. There are also widows who were ineligible up to now but we can only guess at the number. It is perhaps about 100.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley raised a question which he has raised before. He referred to the Budgetary increases and wanted them fixed in a different manner than at present. All I can say to that is that Budgetary increases are the province of the Minister for Finance. They are announced by him and are then implemented by the various Ministers. They are applicable to the whole public service.</P>
    <P>As regards section 7, this section was introduced at the request of both the Dáil and the Seanad so as to obviate legislation. They asked that fixed increases be dealt with by regulation and it is provided in this Bill <Col N="130" /> that the pensions and allowances for which the Army Pensions Acts provide shall be dealt with in this manner. Other pensions for which my Department is responsible are being dealt with in the same way as a result of the passage of the Bill which I had in the Seanad a short time ago.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan raised the question of men who served during the Emergency. Men who served in the Army during the Emergency were eligible to apply for disability pensions. Many of them are in receipt of such pensions. It is true, of course, that they had to apply within four years from the date of their discharge. That is the usual rule. I feel that four years is reasonable enough. A disease contracted or aggravated during service should manifest itself within four years.</P>
    <P>In relation to gratuities payable to officers, it is true that a married officer gets a gratuity in addition to his retired pay but a single officer does not. A soldier gets his pension plus a married pension if he is married. Soldiers are insured under the Social Welfare Acts for social welfare benefits, widows' and orphans' pensions and disability benefits. They are insured in the same way as workers in any other employment and they are entitled to claim the benefits that are provided under the Social Welfare and the Health Acts.</P>
    <P>I do not think there are any other matters that call for comment from me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedOSullivan" hpid="Mr. Ted O'Sullivan Mr. Ted O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ted O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one point. I mentioned that at the moment persons who are not in receipt of final pensions may obtain hospital treatment at St. Bricin's Hospital and I suggested that some arrangements should be made for hospital treatment where necessary for other pensioners. After all, there are only 1,000 all told and I think it should be possible for the small number that would require hospitalisation to make some arrangement for them, if not in St. Brican's, then somewhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>St. Bricin's Hospital and the other military hospitals are not geared to treat every category of patients. Pensioners in receipt of a final pension are not entitled to treatment <Col N="131" /> in a military hospital. Persons in receipt of temporary pensions are in the same position. They are not entitled to treatment but may be required by the Army Pensions Board on occasion to undergo treatment with a view to the reduction of their pensionable degree of disability. The idea is to contain or reduce their disability so that a final pension may be fixed.</P>
      <P>Along with the 1,000 disablement pensioners we have 9,000 special allowance holders. To obtain a special allowance before reaching the age of 70 an applicant must submit himself to medical examination and be found to be unable to earn his living by reason of permanent infirmity of body or mind. Therefore, you would have to extend admittance to the military hospitals to a great number of these people also. The State is expending a considerable amount of money on improved health services. There has been a considerable degree of improvement in the hospital and health services generally and all those people are entitled to such services. That is the present position. I cannot say if there will be any change of approach to that matter but I have felt it well to set out as clearly as I can the situation as it is at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one or two <Col N="134" /> queries on the various definitions in this section. Perhaps the Minister could enlighten me on this. First of all, in regard to performance, I should like to have some idea as to what limitations there are on the various performances which come under this heading in the Bill. In this section the definition of performance reads:</P>
      <P>Performance means a performance of any actors, singers, musicians, dancers or other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in or otherwise perform literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works.</P>
      <P>With regard to the people who take part in those activities, I think the field there is quite unlimited. You have actors, singers, musicians, and so on and other persons who act, sing or otherwise perform. That covers every conceivable thing that you can conceive. The limitation here would be very wide but with regard to the type of performance that is covered it could be much more limited. I wonder what the limitations are and why it has been necessary to limit them in that way. For example, a comedian it seems to me would probably not be covered. He might not be intended to be covered but I am not quite sure why. In a circus you would have lion tamers and other performers but I do not think they would be covered. I am not even quite sure about pop singers because they are clearly not literary, dramatic or artistic, and one wonders whether they are even musical. This would be a matter of opinion but at any rate it is clear there are limitations here. As I say, I should be interested to know what they are and why?</P>

      <P>The definition here generally keeps to the terms of the international Convention to which we wish to subscribe on the passage of this Bill. The interpretation of the points raised by Senator Yeats will, of course, ultimately be a matter for the courts. For what it is worth my own opinion would be that a comedian would be included but that is merely my personal opinion on the basis that if his work were not dramatic it should at least be artistic. The definition here is conforming to the terms of the Convention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect that if this question arose in court the terms of the Convention would cause problems. There is one other query which is of a highly technical nature which I should like to ask. The Bill arrives at a definition as between performance and performers. At the end it says:</P>
      <P>and includes any such performance rendered or intended to be rendered audible or visible by mechanical or electrical means.</P>
      <P>I have no idea of what making a recording by mechanical and making it by electrical means means. Presumably there is something in it or it would not be put in here. Then we have:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;performers&rdquo;, in the case of a mechanical performance, means the persons whose performance is mechanically reproduced;</P>
      <P>This would seem to exclude performers whose performance is recorded electrically. I do not know whether it is put in for the sake of euphony, or something like that, but I would be interested to know what is the distinction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give Senator Yeats a satisfactory answer on this except to say we are adhering as closely as possible to the Convention. The Convention reflects a general international consensus of opinion as to what rights and privileges should be given to performers and users of their work. It formulises the work and a considerable commercial negotiation of give and take over a very long number of years culminating in the Government negotiation in the Rome Convention of 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is designed to conform as closely as possible to the Convention and in so far as I have room to manoeuvre on the wording of the Bill within the terms of the Convention these portions of the Bill have been the result of very detailed negotiations in this country with the various Irish interests concerned, including Radio Telefís Éireann. The mechanics of the technicalities of contracts between performers, unions, broadcasters, record companies and other users as we know are very complicated. I would suggest that the function of the Legislature <Col N="136" /> is to provide a general framework within which these rights and duties can be worked out but that the technicalities of their contracts are really a matter for the parties concerned than for the Legislature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to raise a point on this question of performance too. The point I want to raise and, perhaps, I should deal with it first is whether or not, for the sake of clarifying my own mind, performance means performance by amateur as well as professional persons. You could have people who are generally first-class amateur performers, who make records and so on, and who would not be professional performers. It seems to me they are entitled to just as much protection as professional people. I can imagine people singing sean-nós and that sort of thing and who never would want to be professional performers. Nonetheless, their records might well have a very high merit and it seems to me that they would be equally entitled to the protection that the professional performers would be entitled to. I should like the Minister to indicate whether the amateurs as well as the professionals are in. One would think they are out because of these negotiations that have taken place. They are what I would think are the regular professionals in the world of entertainment, or the unions representing the professionals in the world of entertainment.</P>
      <P>Coming to Senator Yeats's point as to whether a comedian is included in a &ldquo;performance&rdquo;, it is not good enough for the Minister to say that this is a matter for the courts. That is a most unsatisfactory attitude for the Legislature to adopt. The courts, in turn, will throw the ball back and ask: What does the Legislature intend? It is the function of the courts to say what we intend to enact in this Bill and we ought to make it as clear as words and punctuation and good grammer can make it what we intend to cover in it by &ldquo;performance&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is either for the Minister to say that the Convention lays this or that down. The Convention forms no part of our law except if we take it holus <Col N="137" /> bolus under the Constitution. When we talk of international Conventions, as we did in the Load Lines Bill the other day, which in turn will be subject to the jurisdiction of our courts, we must say in the legislation what we want to do and spell that out quite clearly. I would think from reading &ldquo;performers&rdquo; as defined here that the comedian is not in, that he is not protected. If one looks at the way this definition is worded it says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;performance&rdquo; means a performance of any actors, singers, musicians, dancers or other persons who</P>
    <P>and then it goes on:</P>
    <P>act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in or otherwise perform...</P>
    <P>Then you are left with what they perform. There are three things: &ldquo;dramatic, musical or artistic works&rdquo;. It all depends on whether the guff the comedian made was done in an artistic way as an artistic work. Was his performance in his rendering of it an artistic work? If he is coming to sing in a public house and relaying that we may say it is done artistically no doubt but the guff an artist is giving is not artistic. Therefore, a comedian's&mdash; Jimmy O'Dea's famous conversations, whether it is backing a horse or trying to get a drink after hours or whatever it is&mdash;particular work not being artistic work would clearly in my view not be protected.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a lawyer and he may take an entirely different view but it will take days to sort it out as correct. What we ought to do in this Bill is to say quite clearly what we want. Either we want to have a comedian in or we do not. If we do we should put in some kind of an amendment or phrase to include people who are not delivering or declaring or acting. We should put in a phrase or amendment to include people who are delivering, declaring or acting which are not artistic works but who are doing it artistically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where we could run into real difficulty because it is a matter of taste and how the courts in their wisdom could decide on that point I should hesitate to say. I cannot see the distinction one can make <Col N="138" /> whether a performance might be artistic but that it is not an artistic work. I think the matter is reasonably clear and I do not think any great doubt could arise. Senator O'Quigley mentioned the case of a person singing in a pub and the performance being amplified. He asked the question of whether it is artistic but that does not arise because anything which occurs in two tones is musical and whether the tones are musical or not is neither here nor there.</P>
      <P>Senator Yeats raised the point in regard to the definition of a performer and in his reply the Minister was correct in one thing. He said he did not think he could give a satisfactory reply and he certainly fulfilled that promise because he did not refer to it at all. In this matter we have got to keep within an international convention. This is of importance because the people with whom the Bill is concerned go from one country to another and, therefore, there should be some standard. This, however, does not meet the difficulty of putting in &ldquo;electrical&rdquo; in one provision and leaving it out in the other. If nothing had been put in about performers at all, then I think any court would hold that a performance which had been rendered visibly or audibly by electrical or mechanical means is something done by a performer. However, once you put in a limited definition of &ldquo;performer&rdquo; it appears that you exclude anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, in regard to the point raised by Senator O'Quigley, amateurs are covered by this Bill. There is nothing in the definition to exclude them. However, to the extent that this Bill regulates payments to them, if they receive payment they cease to be amateurs, but there is nothing in the definition to confine it to professionals. With regard to whether a comedian is covered, one can think of a list of other types of performers about whom one might ask: &ldquo;Is this person or that person covered?&rdquo; You cannot simply cover every person in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the definition here is sufficiently wide to cover the kinds of persons whom we want to cover and certainly the kinds of persons <Col N="139" /> who are normally covered. This, as I have said, is the result of many years of detailed negotiation both at commercial and Government level and we may take it that as a result the kinds of persons normally covered in these transactions are covered in the Bill. My opinion is that a comedian, be he good or bad, is included. First of all, he comes within the first definition which says &ldquo;a performance of any actors, singers, musicians, dancers or other persons ...&rdquo; Then we have &ldquo;who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play&rdquo;. Following that we provide &ldquo;or otherwise perform literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works and includes any such performance rendered or intended to be rendered audible or visible by mechanical or electrical means&rdquo;. It seems to me that the performance of a comedian, and particularly of Jimmy O'Dea, who has been mentioned, certainly comes within the category of artistic works and also of dramatic works. That is my personal opinion. Whatever we may say in the Bill, in practice it will be interpreted by the courts.</P>
    <P>I should draw the attention of the House again to the fact that we cannot hope to define all possible categories. On the question of the definition of &ldquo;performer&rdquo; relating only to persons whose performances are mechanically reproduced and not to those whose performances are electrically reproduced, I can only say that the point raised by Senator Yeats and by Senator Sheldon appears to me to require some further explanation on the fact that it is following the Convention. I will undertake to explain it or amend it at the next Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamAlexanderShel" hpid="Mr. Sheldon Mr. Sheldon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the explanation. In the case of the performance in one context, it is the method of recording that is being referred to, whether mechanical or electrical. Anything which is not done immediately by the person but which has been recorded and is now broadcast or played in some other way is a mechanical performance as against a personal performance. That is the point intended to be covered and the fact that the mechanical means may be some electrical <Col N="140" /> apparatus does not necessarily mean that an electrical method is used.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 3, before &ldquo;directly&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;for sale or hire&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The thing behind these amendments is that section 2 (1) makes it an offence to do any of the things referred to in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) and then subsection (2) gives a means of defence to a person who does things which are, in fact, lawful. Subsection (1), line 3 reads: &ldquo;Makes a record, directly or indirectly from or by means of a performance&rdquo;. That is the offence we are trying to get at&mdash;the portion of the subsection which says &ldquo;without the consent in writing&rdquo;. It is to protect people against the unlawful sale or hire of records of performances. Subsection (1) makes everything unlawful and then provides for an offence. One should specify the things that cannot be done. In subsection (1) we say that if a person does things which are, in fact, lawful he is guilty of an offence but we provide that it will be a good defence if he did it for his private or domestic use.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of turning it round the other way and saying that a person shall not hire or sell records of performances and that if he does he will be committing an offence. It is all a question of emphasis. I know Parliamentary draftsmen like to bring in everything and then exclude some things. The emphasis should be the other way&mdash;to state what is unlawful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what attitude the Minister may take but I urge him not to accept the amendments because it seems to me that the amendment we are now discussing takes no cognisance of the real situation which is that there is no principle at all which one can set forth which entitles people <Col N="141" /> to make copies of other people's performances. The basic proposition one must insist on is that people who have made performances are entitled to other rights.</P>
      <P>People are not entitled by any sort of principle to make copies of such records even for their private use. The Bill, in a begrudging kind of way, says that all such recordings are illegal but that we will refrain from prosecuting people who make them for their own private or domestic use. The only justification for that line, if there is a justification for it, is that you cannot prevent them but I think that is as far as it should go. I do not accept any such principle as the one laid down in the amendment that people are entitled to make copies for their own private use. People are not entitled to make such recordings but no great harm is done by them and you cannot prevent them from doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>These two amendments seem to me to be unacceptable both on the theoretical and practical basis. The theoretical basis has been dealt with by Senator Yeats. The whole purpose of the Bill is to protect the performer and to ensure that he gets paid for the pleasure people get out of his performance. If a person records that performance for his private and domestic use he gets great pleasure from the performance many times over. The Bill, as drafted, makes an exception of such a record and does not insist on the performer being paid each time the record is used. The exception is a privilege and is open to abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the theoretical objection I have to the change of emphasis but, on the practical level, a person who <i>bona fide</i> makes a recording for domestic or private use has nothing to fear from the provisions of the Bill. It is only the person who tries to abuse the privilege who has anything to fear and I do not think the House would insist or protect such a person in that way. Therefore, I think it is better to leave the onus on the person who wishes to make a recording for private and domestic use to prove that he is doing it for private and domestic use. It could only arise in <Col N="142" /> the case of somebody who was not deliberately attempting to abuse the privilege.</P>

      <P>This is the same kind of thing. When I was reading the subsection I found it difficult to make out what was meant by the awkward construction and this amendment makes it somewhat clearer when you are reading it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters which arise on this section and which it has already been stated by the Minister and other people that the courts will interpret them. I do not think we should act in that way. Everybody reading these sections should know what is meant by them. People who are trained to interpret statutes should always be given a fairly clear idea of what their provisions are and the courts should always be the last resort in relation to a Bill of this kind where you are dealing with commercial interests who always want quick and firm decisions. It is not always possible to obtain such decisions and for that reason I would like the Minister to clarify a few matters in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (2) it is stated that <Col N="143" /> where a person is charged with an offence under subsection (1) (a) of this section, it shall be a defence to prove that the record to which the charge relates was made for his private and domestic use only. In this connection I am thinking of the diligent teacher who might make a recording of a Shakespearian play broadcast by Telefís Éireann and bring it into his school for the purpose of allowing some of his pupils to hear it time and time again so as to hear the diction in the play. I wonder if that would be regarded as making a record for his private use. I know it could hardly be regarded as making a record for his domestic use. I am certain that it has been done from time to time and, although it is not done for private use, there should be no objection to it. Would that matter be an offence under the Bill?</P>
    <P>There is also a reference to recordings made by Telefís Éireann by reason of its own facilities. Telefís Éireann have a reciprocal arrangement with the BBC by which each body make recordings for the other. I wonder if the BBC does a recording on behalf of Telefís Éireann whether that is within the exemption provided by subsection (3).</P>
    <P>Another point arises where no offence is committed if consent is given by the performer in advance. If consent is given to the recording of a play in which all the performers are agreeable with the exception of one, can that one person hold up and prevent the recording? That would also arise in the case of a performance given by a choir. It might be easy to deal with that but not with the case of the one performer in a play.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with Senator O'Quigley's last point first, the one person can hold up the whole arrangement. Nothing can be done except cancel <Col N="144" /> the performance or cancel the person concerned and substitute for them. On the question of whether or not a teacher making a recording of, say, a Shakespearian play and using it for the benefit of his pupils. I am afraid that this is question of interpretation of the meaning of the words &ldquo;private and domestic use&rdquo;. A different view might be taken of this by other people but my view, for what it is worth, would be that &ldquo;private and domestic use&rdquo; does not cover the circumstances envisaged by Senator O'Quigley. All my advisers do not agree with me in that. It is my own personal opinion and it is coloured by reason of the fact that there are records issued for schoolteachers or at least with the intention that the bulk of the sales will be to schoolteachers using them for the benefit of their pupils and that this is a form of performance for which performers would expect they should be paid. The Senator will appreciate, of course, that it depends on the in-domestic use&rdquo;. One could raise many points under this Bill and question whether or not they would be covered but I think what we have got to do is simply take what appears to us to be the meaning of the words and assume the courts will interpret them in that way. Of course, in relation to any Bill one may act in this way but it does not follow that the courts will interpret it in the way we assume it is intended.</P>
      <P>The third point raised by Senator O'Quigley I am afraid I have not got. He raised some point about the use by the BBC&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that the Bill says &ldquo;the record was made by Radio Telefís Éireann by means of its own facilities&rdquo;. Now on occasions the BBC's facilities may be used for the making of a recording for Telefís Éireann. It seems to me that when we use the words &ldquo;its own facilities&rdquo; we are preventing this. Supposing, for example, a recording was made of the Edinburgh Festival by the BBC and passed over here to Telefís Éireann, that is not something that was made by means of Radio Telefís Éireann's own facilities and, therefore, <Col N="145" /> not having the consent of the performers, they would not be entitled to show it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheldon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is a very narrow interpretation of &ldquo;its own facilities&rdquo;? Surely in the case mentioned by Senator O'Quigley the BBC are no more than the agents of RTE. They are presumably being paid for it, RTE ask them to make the recording so I would imagine this would come within &ldquo;its own facilities&rdquo;, otherwise what does &ldquo;its own facilities&rdquo; mean?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the words &ldquo;its own facilities&rdquo; mean that it has a proprietary interest in the facilities that are being used, that it owns them, that it is the owner of them. For instance, if there is certain equipment that is regularly hired out to certain companies and this is hired out to Telefís Éireann, then this would be part of Telefís Éireann's own facilities. That is a different thing to a recording being made by the BBC's television facilities for use by RTE. Again, it is a question of clarification. I do not know if it is desirable that we should preclude Telefís Éireann from using the BBC or not. It is merely a matter of what the Minister's own view of it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What is generally intended to be got at is what is known as ephemeral records. It is often more convenient both for RTE and for the performers involved to make a record of a performance to the broadcasting of which the performers have agreed rather than to broadcast the live performance. This is often for reasons of convenience or for technical reasons. This is intended to be covered in this section. Similarly, it may happen that <Col N="146" /> RTE would wish to make a record from a record which it was entitled to broadcast in order to incorporate the performance in, say, a wider radio programme. This would be covered under the ephemeral records. I am explaining this as the kind of thing that is intended to be dealt with under this section but on the strict interpretation of the wording it would seem to me that Senator O'Quigley's contention is probably correct and that unless the facilities were actually those of RTE as distinct from those which they might use on an agency basis of the BBC, I do not think they would be covered by this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know enough about the Convention, I have not got a copy of it, but does the Convention prohibit the authorised agents of RTE from making a recording for RTE purposes alone because if it does not it might be desirable to put into the subsection a phrase to the effect &ldquo;or its duly authorised agents&rdquo;. That would still seem to me to be within the general intent of this Bill and of the Convention. One does not want to find RTE some day ready to go places to make a recording&mdash;they have had unfortunate experiences in that regard already and they were not either artistic, musical or literary; they were certainly I suppose dramatic&mdash;one does not want to find them in a position where they are advised by their lawyer that they cannot do that. I think if it can be done within the spirit of the Convention and if there is no objection to it we ought to give RTE the benefit of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another thing that arises in this connection. Supposing there is, as sometimes happens, a technical breakdown. If there is a programme like the Eurovision Song Contest or the Fashion Contest where I believe recently the transmission broke down between England and this country, if there is an agreement that it shall be transmitted simultaneously on BBC, UTV and RTE and supposing something goes wrong between here and the BBC and that Telefís Éireann, wishing to give service to the public, get a recording of it, can they then show that <Col N="147" /> recording of the event? If there is an agreement to show it simultaneously and there is a breakdown can they then show it later on? I wonder whether we are excluding Telefís Éireann from availing itself of that kind of concession in this section. I do not know and I do not know enough about the Convention to know whether it is possible within the limitation of the Convention to enable RTE to avail itself of this kind of facility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the breakdown of the kind envisaged by Senator O'Quigley is one which I feel is better dealt with in the actual contract for the right to rebroadcast. We cannot, I think, provide for every possible contingency, which might be provided for in the contract, in the statute. I would assume that in the contract dealing with those there would be some clause providing for some form of arbitration in the event of disputes in the implementation of the contract, and the arbitrator dealing with it would do so with regard to the general principles laid down here where there is permission from the performer to broadcast the performance, that this extension to broadcasting the performance can exclude the actual live performance. In other words, if there is a consent to broadcast and to rebroadcast that is the end of the matter. The interval involved, provided it is not too long, does not change the validity of that. As I say, this seems to be more appropriate for the specific contracts which would be entered into in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that the freedom conferred in relation to reproduction of records is available not only to RTE but to any persons and that they are strictly in accordance with Articles 7 and 15 of the Convention. The wording, I think, follows very closely the wording of the Convention in this regard. I think it may be taken that we are not restricting RTE unduly here. This Bill is the result of a very great deal of negotiation, as I said earlier, with the various parties, including RTE and anything RTE have looked for has been given to them subject to the rights of the other parties concerned. <Col N="148" /> Senator O'Quigley may rest assured that we are not restricting RTE under this subsection in any way which is not accepted by them or is not justifiable by the facts.</P>

      <P>The making by Radio Telefís Éireann by means of its own facilities of a cinematograph film from or by means of a performance without the consent in writing of the performers shall not be a contravention of subsection (1) of this section if&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the performers had consented in writing to the broadcasting of the performance by Radio Telefís Éireann and the film or a reproduction of it was not used by Radio Telefís Éireann for any purpose other than the broadcast, or</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> If I understand this correctly, it means that RTE can take, say, a commercial cinematographic film, make copies of that film, as many copies as they like, and use them in any way they see fit because there is no limitation at all in this particular section. I am just wondering what is the purpose of this. I am sure there is some purpose but I am rather curious about it.</P>

      <P>I think this arrangement is general international practice in this regard. The Convention deals with films and records. The application to rebroadcast films and the limitations which are applied to rebroadcasting of records are dealt with in section 2, subsection (3) (b). Article 19 of the Convention provides and I quote:</P>
      <P>Once a performer has consented to the incorporation of his performance in a visual or audio-visual fixation Article 7 shall have no further application.</P>
      <P>Article 7 deals <i>inter alia</i> with reproduction of a fixation without consent so the way in which films on the one hand and records are dealt with is different. This arrangement with international practice in this regard is specifically provided for in the Convention.</P>

      <P>What we are doing here is making it an offence under this measure to make a record of any performance without the consent of a performer living in another country if the law of that country requires that that consent should be forthcoming. That is the kind of reciprocal arrangements it is necessary to have in the copyright, trade mark cases and so on where we are a party to an international Convention. The only point I am concerned about here is when it comes to determining whether or not the consent of any performer was required by the law of another country how it is proposed to establish what the law of that other country is, especially if it is going to be a criminal offence for the purpose of paragraph <Col N="150" /> (b) of subsections (2) and (3) of section 2 of this Act. It is all very well for you to say yes, if you are doing something in relation to a performance in another country in which it is necessary under the law of that country to obtain the consent of the performer, that that will be an offence under our law. It is all very well to say that. At the same time I would like to know how we are going to establish what the law of another country is for the purposes of this prosecution under section 2.</P>

      <P>I think in a case like this the performer would have to enquire what the law is in the other country and to produce evidence of this in our court. This is a procedure which is not uncommon in our courts and I am sure Senator O'Quigley has had some experience of the establishments in our courts. One is the law in relation to specific formulae in another court under another jurisdiction. The Senator will recall I am sure that this arises with revelant frequency in regard to the law of intestacy in the USA and the different States in America. On occasion this has to be established in our courts and I would assume that the same procedure would be followed here.</P>

      <P>The Minister is quite right. I am aware of all that. That is all right on the non-criminal side. One can have an affidavit made by an American lawyer or an affidavit under German or French law stating what the law of their States is and that is accepted as a fact on the non-criminal side; but it is a different situation when we come to prosecuting and establishing a criminal offence. I do not know offhand, and perhaps the Minister will enlighten me and others, whether we have any similar situation obtaining in our law where an offence is constituted by reason of a person resident here within the jurisdiction of the court doing something which is contrary to foreign law.</P>

      <P>This is largely a matter of reciprocation. Our performers will be protected in other countries adhering to the Convention in the same way as their nationals are protected here. The question of establishing what was the law in that other country would, as I said earlier, follow the normal procedure. I cannot say offhand that there are other statutes on the same lines. I would be very surprised if there were not such because of various international Conventions to which we have adhered in the past. I take it Senator O'Quigley's concern is the method of proving the law of another country. What is wrong with the procedure which is normally followed in these cases?</P>

      <P>It is one thing to adopt a certain procedure on the civil side. If I were drafting an indictment in relation to a charge under this measure based on the law obtaining in France in relation to performers' protection I would run into great difficulties. It is easy enough in regard to the civil side. The Minister and the House will be well aware that in order to establish that an offence has been committed it will have to be established beyond reasonable doubt, and what we would be doing in subsection 4 is saying that an offence shall have been committed if:</P>
      <P>under subsections (b) and (c) of section 2 (1) of this Act and paragraphs (b) and (c) of section 3 (1) of this Act, a record or film to which an order under Section 12 of this Act applies and which is made directly or indirectly from or by means of a performance...if the consent of any performer to the making of the record or film was required by the law of the country in which it was made,...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a civil case, if a person claims royalties or if a person were selling records of a performance made under the requirements of the law of France or West Germany, I can well see somebody on the civil side going in to <Col N="152" /> court with an affidavit and saying: &ldquo;That is the law in France&rdquo; or of West Germany and establishing his claims. When it comes to the criminal side, it might be necessary to put in some further provision to make this section work. It may well be that some other countries have adapted to make similar reciprocal arrangements which would work for us. If so, it might be put into this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has adverted to this. It is not easy to ask the Minister to elaborate on this. It is a difficulty which arises. I cannot think of any case offhand, of any case in criminal law, where a breach has been committed in a foreign country, and the proof of that law is an ingredient in the proof of the criminal offence. We may be breaking new ground in this section and if we are we ought to have another look at it after the Minister has been advised by the Attorney General.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>This section reads:</P>
      <P>A consent to the broadcasting of a performance shall, unless the consent provides otherwise, be deemed to include the consent to the rebroadcasting of the performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rebroadcasting is defined in section 1 as the simultaneous rebroadcast by one broadcasting organisation of a broadcast of another. It covers Eurovision in particular. It also covers simultaneous broadcasting. Probably Eurovision is mainly what is in question here. I mentioned on Second Reading <Col N="153" /> that I was worried about this section. It says, in effect, that if an Irish artiste agrees to do a broadcast for Radio Éireann as far as this Bill is concerned unless there is something in his contract that covers Eurovision there is no legal obligation under this Bill on Radio Éireann to pay him any additional sum because of its rebroadcast on Eurovision or in any other way if it is done simultaneously. I accept that in fact Radio Telefís Éireann pay additional fees in such cases. They have a hard and fast agreement with the trade unions, Equity for the actors and the Irish Federation of Musicians for a section of the musicians, by which fixed percentages are paid and an increase on the original fee in the case of such rebroadcasts, and in the case of freelance artistes who do not belong to any trade union similar increased fees are always paid in cases of rebroadcasts for the broadcasting organisations.</P>
    <P>My objection to this section is that in principle it seems to be wrong that we should enact in a statutory way a blanket consent which would empower Radio Telefís Éireann in law not to pay any additional fees and would give them power to authorise such simultaneous rebroadcasts without any reference to the actual performers.</P>
    <P>I understand that the reason this has been inserted in the Bill is that, otherwise, Radio Éireann might be faced with unreasonable demands by foreign performers in cases where we took rebroadcasts from other countries under Eurovision. In such a case the foreign broadcasting organisation has to pay fees in accordance with whatever arrangements they may have in their own country. There is no obligation, moral or otherwise, on RTE to pay further additional sums for such performance.</P>
    <P>However, the trouble is that in providing against this possibility we seem to be throwing out the baby with the bathwater. We are enacting a provision that the person is not entitled to a further fee unless it is inserted in the contract. The small print in contracts between RTE and performing artistes does not provide for such increased <Col N="154" /> payments for rebroadcasts on Eurovision. This section is wrong in principle. At the moment, until this Bill becomes law, an Irish artiste has some contractual right to enforce the payment of additional fees in the unlikely event that RTE refuse to pay them, but once the Bill becomes law the situation changes and further payments by RTE in the case of rebroadcasts will be merely on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis. It may be said that it is up to the performer to argue his case with RTE but I do not consider that to be a reasonable proposition.</P>
    <P>The average freelance artiste is not a lawyer. The average artiste who does not belong to a union would not be aware that a problem of this kind existed or that there could be any question of his legal rights. In any event, even if he did realise it, no artiste wants to be put in the position of being looked on by RTE as a legalistic trouble maker. Unless he is in the category of the Beatles or the Rolling Stones or somebody eminent like that, the artiste is not in a position to argue this with a broadcasting organisation and, therefore, the onus should be on the organisation rather than the artiste to see that his rights are asserted in a case like this.</P>
    <P>I have looked at the section to see how it could be amended and I realise that great difficulties undoubtedly arise. I gather that the international convention forbids any discrimination between artistes of one country and another, and to provide that the consent of Irish artistes should be required but not the consent of foreign artistes would, therefore, be a breach of the Convention. One could eliminate the section altogether but that, perhaps, would face RTE with the danger of being flooded with demands from foreign artistes who were not morally entitled to the benefits claimed.</P>
    <P>The section seems to be unsatisfactory as it stands but I am not sure what, if anything, can be done about it. The situation might be remedied&mdash;to some extent though not entirely&mdash;if some sort of undertaking could be wrung out of RTE to insert in all <Col N="155" /> their contracts in the future some provision in the small print that in the case of rebroadcasts the usual additional payments would be made. I think that would partly cover the position. It would also cover RTE in a respect which this section does not cover them because the section deals only with simultaneous rebroadcasts. It does not cover the far more common situation in which a television network or radio station broadcast is in later weeks or months sold to another broadcasting concern.</P>
    <P>The usual practice in Radio Éireann in the past has been that in the case of such rebroadcasts they did not bother to ask the original performer for his permission. He did not even know of the rebroadcast until a cheque came to his doorstep, of which he was very glad. That normal procedure of the past will be contrary to the Bill and render RTE liable to prosecution because they will have made a second broadcast without the consent of the performer. They can cover themselves against that by putting into the contract some sort of vague provision that the performer's consent to the contract is also a consent to further rebroadcast in respect of which he would be paid additional fees. It would cover the performer and RTE in the matter of later rebroadcasts rather than the simultaneuos rebroadcasts covered by this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Yeats raised this point on the last Stage and since then I have given it a good deal of thought in depth. The Senator has more or less set out what the position is. First, the section was put in largely to protect RTE against unfair claims by performers in foreign countries. To amend it so as to ensure the protection of Irish performers in the way Senator Yeats wishes would, as he indicated, get us into difficulty in regard to the non-discrimination clause in the Convention. Senator Yeats' concern is with Irish performers and in particular those who may not be members of one of the unions involved in these matters. In an effort to tie the situation down a little I asked RTE <Col N="156" /> to give me in writing a statement of what the position is and it might be no harm if I were to read this and have it incorporated in the records of the House. I have here a letter dated 4th June, 1968, addressed by the legal officer of RTE to the Controller of Patents. It states:</P>
      <P>The practice in Radio Telefís Éireann is to have a written contract with all performers, both in sound and television, before a broadcasts takes place. Contracts with members of Equity and the Irish Federation of Musicians (and the bulk of performers' contracts are with these) provide that supplementary fees in respect of rebroadcasts will be paid in accordance with the terms of the Agreement between RTE and Equity on the one hand, and between RTE and the Federation on the other hand. In the case of non-members the individual contracts specify the conditions governing rebroadcasts, when these are applicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that section 6 deals with rebroadcasts only as defined in section 1 of the Bill, that is to say the simultaneous broadcast by one broadcasting organisation of a broadcast of another broadcasting organisation. Supplementary fees are normally paid in respect of such broadcasts in the case of television, but in sound broadcasting it has always been the practice that simultaneous international broadcasts do not give rise to supplementary payments to performing artistes. This, with the full agreement of the International Federation of Performers, is the general arrangement among the members of the European Broadcasting Union, of which Ireland has been a member since its foundation, and if RTE were to depart from such an arrangement it would create a dangerous and unacceptable precedent on the international level. In actual practice, however, the number of international simultaneous sound relays involving performers originating in this country is insignificant, and moreover at no time has any such rebroadcast given rise <Col N="157" /> to complaints from performers in regard to supplementary fees.</P>
    <P>Therefore it seems to me that on the basis of this letter setting out the practice in Radio Telefís Éireann which they confirm to be the one they follow and intend to follow, that this is as far as we can go to deal with the situation envisaged by Senator Yeats which is more a theoretical than a practical danger. I admit that there is a theoretical danger but I do not think that in practice there is any danger.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In line 45, to delete &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;intended&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 is another section which is not too happily phrased. It seems to me that what we want to get at here is to enable the court which convicts a person of making a record to confiscate, or decide what is to be done with, that record. When we are dealing with a contrivance for the making of records we have to read it as a contrivance adapted for the making of records in contravention of the Act. Every contrivance capable of making a record is a contrivance adapted for the making of a record in contravention of the Act, there is no doubt about that, but what we are trying to get at is one which is intended for the making of records or has been used for the making of records in contravention of the Act. Instead of using the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; we ought <Col N="158" /> to have power to make a differentiation between a contrivance which can be used for the making of a record and a contrivance which is used for the making of a record in contravention of the Act. It is all a matter of phraseology.</P>
    <P>Might I now go on to the section itself? It is extremely badly worded. It says that on conviction of the offender the court may order that all records, cinematograph films, plates or similar contrivances in the possession of the offender which appear to the court to have been made in contravention of the Act, or to be adapted for the making of records in contravention of the Act, may be destroyed or otherwise dealt with. Does that mean any contrivance or does it mean a contrivance adapted for the making of the record?</P>
    <P>I think it would be better if the Minister broke up the section and first dealt with the things made, and then the mechanical contrivances which are the means by which these things have been made or which can be used for the making of them. It is a very higgledy-piggledy kind of section and I do not think it would do credit to a leaving certificate student under our new arrangements to have written a sentence of that kind. The Minister might have a look at it again in order to break it up and to deal separately with the things that are made in contravention of the Act and the machinery that is used in the making of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; in the Bill is already wide enough in my opinion and the use of the word &ldquo;intended&rdquo; in place of &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; would go too far as it has a much wider connotation. The word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; is capable of objective measurement and the word &ldquo;intended&rdquo; is much too difficult to interpret. It seems to me, therefore, that to accept the amendment would be going too far and I think the House should remember that we are dealing with a situation in which a person had already been convicted and it is in that context that the court is given power in its discretion to order the destruction of the various <Col N="159" /> records, films, plates or similar contrivances which have been made in contravention of the Act or adapted for the making of records in contravention of the Act. To put in the word &ldquo;intended&rdquo; could mean that something which the convicted person had innocently in his possession could come under the section. While we want to deal with such persons we do not want to take the matter too far.</P>
      <P>On the general wording of this section, I do not think it is quite as bad as Senator O'Quigley suggests but I feel that there could be a certain amount of confusion and I will have another look at the matter before the next Stage.</P>

      <P>Some of the matters that I intended to raise on this section have already been dealt with. I noticed in this section that the word &ldquo;plate&rdquo; had one connotation and one only. In section 7 it is reasonably clear but in section 8 it refers to plates or similar contrivances which might as well be flying saucers. It struck me that in this section almost too much is being said in too few words. I feel that if it were expanded a bit it would be clearer and get the records and the contrivances for making records somewhat separated because you do have in the middle of line 3 &ldquo;plates or similar contrivances in the possession of the offender which appear to the court to have been made in contravention of this Act.&rdquo; That looks to me as if the plates or similar contrivances are an offence which is probably not what the Minister intended to get at. I doubt if the manufacturer of a tape recorder is going to find himself in trouble. I can see that the person must already be an offender which keeps the manufacturer out I presume but at the same time I do not like this type of wording where you have a &ldquo;plate&rdquo; just referred <Col N="160" /> to without any indication of what type of plate; the fact that it is referred to in an earlier section as a plate for the making of records is not quite sufficient I feel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not wishing to delay the Minister or the House too long, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to something that Senator Sheldon has just touched on. My amendment, which is actually Senator FitzGerald's amendment, is much nearer to the mind and heart of the Minister than the word &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; because in section 7 of the Bill what the Minister is trying to get at and what the House has been asked to ordain is that if a person has in his possession a plate or similar contrivance for the purpose of making records in contravention of this Act, he shall be guilty of an offence, and what I want to get at is the &ldquo;plate or similar contrivance for the purpose of making records in contravention of this Act&rdquo; would be an exact reproduction of what is in section 7 but is a longer way of saying what I was saying by using the words &ldquo;intended for the making of records in contravention of this Act&rdquo;. It seems to me if I might go back to section 7 for the purpose of enabling the Minister in accordance with the Standing Orders of the House to do so, that he should bring into section 7 the power to confiscate these plates and contrivances which are in the possession of a person for the purpose of making records. At any trial there can be two charges, one of having these things for the purpose of making records and the other of, in fact, using them and having used them for that purpose. It would be much clearer if the two sections were boxed together and mixed up and divided up along the lines that we have suggested.</P>

      <P>I should like to query my copy of the Bill as passed by Dáil Éireann. It still has &ldquo;principle&rdquo; misspelled. However, of more practical moment, under subsection (b) I should like to inquire the meaning of this. I imagine that the answer I will get will be that this subsection sets out the terms of the Convention and in that case I presume we are bound to abide by it but it does not seem to me entirely desirable in certain respects. If I understand it correctly it means that if anyone is charged with an offence under this Act they can prove that the inclusion of the performance in question in a film or a recording was only by way of background or incidental. It seems to me that that will entitle anyone to make a film and include in that film as part of the background music or score someone singing a song without any reference to the performer. I may be wrong in thinking that is the meaning but I suspect it is. Perhaps the Minister could enlighten me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of interpretation of the words &ldquo;by way of background&rdquo;. I cannot give Senator Yeats a definitive interpretation of this but my own impression would be that a snatch of some song or other as a background to some film would be protected under this section but that, say, a full performance even as background would not. Again, I am speaking purely personally on this and it is a question of the interpretation of these <Col N="162" /> words as they have been interpreted in other countries and are likely to be interpreted in the courts here.</P>

I do not suppose we are empowered to do so but I would be a bit afraid of what might be brought in under the heading of &ldquo;by way of background&rdquo; because I think that in any film with some sort of music, it could be called a background and I think one could be exempt from prosecution under this section. I think it goes further than is desirable but I presume we are bound by the international Convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spent some time studying this clause and the one which follows. I think you cannot read section 10 without referring to section 11. Except for the explanations that we have heard this afternoon from the Minister my first conviction would be that the Bill would be far better and would be strengthened without either one or the other of those two clauses. However, I gather from several things the Minister has said that that may not be possible. I understand that this Bill is necessary in order to bring our practice here into line with the international Convention. That is quite understandable but, perhaps, the Minister could tell us why the clause should not simply provide for the production, for example, under clause 10 of the written consent of the performer at the same time as the clause requires production <Col N="163" /> of the written consent of the person purporting to represent the performer.</P>
      <P>That is the first point. I cannot see how that should present any difficulty having regard to the fact that the written consent of the performer for the first consent is the one which must be obtained in any event. You cannot really discuss this properly without referring to section 11, otherwise it does not make any sense at all. The other point which struck me was that section 11, having laid down conditions under which a person can be convicted, then stipulates that the fine must be a fine not exceeding £100. I am sure the Minister and other Members of the House can visualise circumstances in which a fine of such a nominal amount of anything from a penny to £99 19s 11d&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is all I have to say about that. I believe the fine here is too small to provide a sufficient deterrent. We can visualise circumstances in which a person for one reason or another, but particularly for the business of making profit, may well when the risk is not too great, commit this offence. I do not believe a fine of not more than £100 in order to do certain things is a sufficient deterrent. Those are the two points which struck me and I would like to hear the Minister on them. Perhaps he might also consider them between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I am not quite sure if <Col N="164" /> I grasped Senator Crowley's point. Section 10 provides protection for a person who acts <i>bona fide</i> in dealing with somebody who claims to be authorised to act on behalf of a group of performers and where the person with whom that unauthorised person is dealing has reason to believe they are not authorised. In other words, he is acting <i>bona fide</i> and is thereby protected. Might I refer to Section 11? As Senator Crowley rightly said, you cannot really deal with one without taking the two together, It deals with the person who purports to have this consent when, in fact, he has not. I think the point about having the consent of the performer is simply to conform with the general practice where you have a group of people with, say, a manager negotiating their business contracts or, as was mentioned earlier, perhaps a choir. I do not think it is the normal practice to have everybody sign who is going to perform. The more usual practice is to have some individual, some authorised person, say, the manager sign on behalf of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. That is why the provision is made in the way it is here. Does that meet Senator Crowley's point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not quite. I thought my point was even simpler than that. The section actualy stipulates:</P>
      <P>Where a record, cinematograph film, broadcast or transmission is made with the consent in writing of a person who, at the time of giving the consent, represented that he was authorised by the performers to give it on their behalf...</P>
      <P>That is straight enough. Would it not have been better still to provide more protection and to provide that the written consent of the actual performers or somebody acting on behalf of the performers should be produced? Would it not be more straightforward if it came from the actual performers or person authorised to speak on behalf of the performers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I think this is <Col N="165" /> designed really to cover instances where there is more than one performer but not always. It may be an individual performer acting through a manager but where it is not it is obviously better to have somebody acting on behalf of the whole group. What we are doing here and what we have written in is that where somebody says that he is an authorised person we are saying that he should not commit an offence simply because we are dealing with him. Then the next section deals with a person who purports to act in this way but is not authorised to do so.</P>

      <P>Much thought was given to the amount of penalties in this Bill. A good deal of correspondence took place between the various interests and, of course, one may have any number of views in regard to penalties in relation to particular offences as to whether they are too big or too small. In general, having regard to the negotiations and arguments which took place about penalties in this Bill, this seems to be reasonable in the light of the possible offences and the circumstances of those likely to be convicted. You must remember, in the normal way if you are dealing with reputable performers, where, perhaps, the fees would be large, this kind of offence is less likely to occur than in the case of people who are not, perhaps, going to be paid so much. So, the amount of the fine in most cases which would arise under this would be fairly substantial.</P>

It seems to me to be desirable from the point of view of the Government that this order should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas but there is not any provision in the Bill for doing that. I think the Minister will readily agree that an order of this kind applying provisions of this Act to the records and so on of other countries is the kind of order which the Minister should lay before each House of the Oireachtas; otherwise there is no obligation on anybody to bring the matter to our attention. The Convention itself is in the statute but there is no obligation to lay it before each House of the Oireachtas. There should be an obligation in such a far-reaching provision of this kind. I think the Minister should consider amending this before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The development company was set up to promote the increased use of Shannon Airport for passenger and freight traffic and for tourist, commercial and industrial purposes. It has been recognised that the greatest scope for the company's energies lies in developing the industrial estate and in using the existing advantages at the airport to promote industry. In addition the company has promoted the establishment at Shannon of warehousing and commercial and service activities. It has also engaged very successfully in the promotion of passenger traffic at the airport, mainly through the encouragement of tourism in the surrounding area. All these activities contribute markedly to the maintenance and development of Shannon Airport which is a very important national investment and asset and a focal point for economic growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Share capital subscribed to the company is used for the provision of factory buildings. These are normally rented to the occupiers but factory bays may also be purchased outright <Col N="169" /> or may be built on sites leased from the company. Repayable advances are used for the provision of dwellings and community services for the purposes of the industrial estate. The houses are provided by the company to rent or to purchase and developed sites are also made available for persons wishing to build their own houses and for speculative building. The grant-in-aid moneys are applied towards meeting the company's running expenses and providing financial assistance to industries, including grants towards factory buildings, new machinery and the training of workers.</P>
    <P>The Finances provided to the company under existing legislation (SFADCO Ltd. Acts 1959 to 1965) up to 31st March, 1968 were as follows:</P>
    <P>Share capital&mdash;£5,051,000.</P>
    <P>Repayable advances&mdash;£3,050,000.</P>
    <P>Grant-in-aid&mdash;£2,856,000.</P>
    <P>The balances remaining under existing statutory provisions are therefore:</P>
    <P>Share capital&mdash;£949,000.</P>
    <P>Repayable advances &mdash; £50,000 (deficit).</P>
    <P>Grant-in-aid&mdash;£144,500.</P>
    <P>The balance available in the case of grant-in-aid is not sufficient to meet requirements for the current financial year while the balance of share capital is barely sufficient for the year. The existing limit of £3,000,000 on repayable advances has already been reached and it is necessary to finance repayable advances temporarily from share capital pending enactment of the present legislation. Interest on the amounts temporarily issued as share capital will be payable from the date of issue. The introduction of new legislation at this stage is in accordance with the intention when the 1965 Act was under consideration. It was decided then that the limits settled should cover the company's operations up to about the present time.</P>
    <P>The company has been making steady progress in attracting new industries to Shannon. At 31st March, 1968 there were 27 manufacturing concerns in operation at the airport compared with 14 at 31st March, 1965. Of the 27 <Col N="170" /> concerns, one had built their own factory, two had purchased their factories and the rest occupied factories on a rental basis. Proposals for the establishment of four further manufacturing concerns are under consideration.</P>
    <P>The manufacturing activities cover a wide range of products including electronic equipment, yarn, fabric, finished garments, pianos, industrial diamonds, precision tools, floor maintenance equipment and many other items. Practically all the output is exported.</P>
    <P>The company promotes the establishment of warehousing activities with a view to stimulating air freight traffic through the airport. At 31st March, 1968 seven warehousing concerns were in operation and proposals from another concern were being considered. In addition, 13 commercial and service concerns were operating at 31st March, 1968 with a proposal for a further concern under consideration. The commercial activities included data processing and consultancy and trading business.</P>
    <P>A total of 60 factories and ten warehouses were occupied at 31st March, 1968 compared with 40 factories and three warehouses occupied at 31st March, 1965. Twelve more factories and two warehouses were under construction and a further 31 sites had been reserved by existing firms with a view to expansion of their activities.</P>
    <P>In the calendar year 1967 exports from the industrial estate amounted to £32.6m. and imports were valued at £22.5m. leaving a net balance of £10.1m. This balance gives an idea of the volume of work being carried out at the industrial estate and its contribution to the country's balance of payments. The percentage of total national exports of manufactured goods represented by exports from Shannon increased from 21 per cent in 1964 to 29 per cent in 1967. In relation to total national trade in 1967, Shannon exported 10 per cent of total exports and imported 4 per cent of total imports. Air freight generated by the industrial estate in 1967 was 3,301 tonnes compared with 876 tonnes in 1964.</P>
    <P>The company promotes tourism <Col N="171" /> through Shannon in conjunction with other promoting bodies including Bord Fáilte, the air companies and CIE. This promotion is reflected in the growth of terminal passenger traffic at Shannon. Terminal traffic in the year ended March, 1968 exceeded 320,000, the highest figure in the airport's history. The tours, banquets and other tourist activities promoted by the company catered for over 100,000 people in 1967.</P>
    <P>At 31st March, 1968, 3,942 people, 2,238 males and 1,704 females, were employed in the industrial estate as compared with 2,927, 1,538 males and 1,389 females, at 31st March, 1965. The total employment in the whole Shannon complex at 31st March, 1968 was over 6,000 people and their total annual income has been conservatively estimated as being in the region of £4m. The number of people resident in the Shannon community was over 2,100. 443 houses and 137 flats had been constructed by the company for rent or sale and almost all of these were occupied or allocated. A further 130 houses were under construction. In addition to the company-built houses, 25 houses had been constructed by private builders on developed sites provided by the company and 18 such houses were in course of construction. Consideration was being given to arrangements with a speculative builder who proposes to build further houses for sale. Clare County Council also plans to construct houses in the new town. However, the bulk of the housing requirements at Shannon will have to be provided by the company for a number of years to come. In addition to housing development, certain community services have been provided by the community, the company or by other authorities. These now include two churches, a comprehensive school, a community hall, two primary schools, shops and recreational and library facilities.</P>
    <P>The majority of the workers at Shannon live outside the community and commute to the factories at Shannon. The development of the new community is becoming the biggest single element of the company's work, <Col N="172" /> in terms of the finances involved, of its complexity and of its vital importance to the attraction of industry and to stabilising future industrial growth in the region. It is clear to the company that industrial development and community development are interdependent whether in planning or in building, in working or in social living. Having regard to these factors and to the relevant observations in the report of Dr. Lichfield, the planning consultant for the region, the company are fully satisfied that the minimum viable community which must be aimed at in Shannon's particular geographic environment is one of not less than 6,000 people. Based on the rate of progress necessary to attain this end, it is proposed that provision should be made in the new legislation for the necessary funds for the three years to 31st March, 1971, by raising the limits in existing legislation to the figures which I have quoted.</P>
    <P>In regard to grants-in-aid these grants provide for the running expenses of the company and also enable the company to pay grants to industrialists for buildings, machinery and the training of workers. Grants paid to the company to 31st March, 1968 amounted to £2,855,500. In addition the company received £1,246,462 by way of rents and other income. £2,499,479 was used by the company for promotion and administrative expenses and grants totalling £1,598,075 were made to industrialists.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that the confidence which I expressed in the continued progress of the company when recommending the 1965 legislation for the approval of the House has been fully justified and I consider that it is necessary that the company should be provided with the financial resources up to the limits now proposed to enable them to consolidate the progress already made and to provide for further orderly progress in the future. The outline which I have given of the progress made by the company to date affords ample proof of the continuing value to the national economy of the Shannon enterprise and I am convinced that the additional finances now sought will prove to be a prudent <Col N="173" /> investment in the national interest. For my own part, I wish to congratulate the board, management and staff of the company and all those who are contributing to the success of the Shannon project.</P>
    <P>As has already been announced it is the Government's view that it would be clearly beneficial to make use of the successful experience of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited within the Limerick/Clare/ North Tipperary region. Accordingly it has been decided that the company will function as an organ of industrial development within this region and will be responsible to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for industrial estate development and possibly the building of advance factories within the region.</P>
    <P>The company will report to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on all industrial and related matters, including those at the Shannon industrial estate, but will continue to report to me on its tourism and aviation activities. This Bill is without prejudice in any way to what may be done under the new arrangements and is related to requirements under the existing arrangements. Any additional financial arrangements for developments in the company's extended area of operations will be announced separately as will the details of any legislative action necessary.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentMcHugh" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has recommended this Bill for the approval of the House and Fine Gael agree with him. I do not think there is any need to delay the progress of this Bill. It is necessary and desirable that it should pass. It has already secured the full approval of the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister congratulated the board, the management and the staff of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and he pointed out the advantages of the industrial estate&mdash;the number of jobs, the economic advances made in the area because of the work in the Shannon Free Airport Development Company. All this is true and no praise could be high <Col N="174" /> enough for the people immediately concerned with all this work. No praise either could be high enough for the men who were, in fact, responsible for the whole concept. The Minister omitted to mention these. I am sure he did this inadvertently. He omitted to mention the men who blazed the trail, who did the spade work, whose brainchild Shannon actually is.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps necessary to remind the House that the first inter-Party Government set up in 1949 the Industrial Development Authority and it is under that Authority that all these factories now operate. The Shannon complex and, indeed, all foreign industrial development in this country is made possible by this Industrial Development Act of 1949. When the Minister praised everybody connected with Shannon, I am sure it was inadvertent that he left out the people who put this Act through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It may be necessary to remind the House also that this Act was very bitterly opposed by the Minister's Party who were then in Opposition, by the former Taoiseach in particular and, indeed, by the present Taoiseach. It might be interesting to remind the House of some of the things said at that time. In the Dáil debates of 9th March, 1950, Volume 119, No. 11, column 1596 Deputy Lemass said:</P>
    <P>Needless to remark we are opposed to this proposal.</P>
    <P>That proposal was the establishment of the Industrial Development Authority. At column 1599 Deputy Lemass said:</P>
    <P>The drive for industrial development has not lost its impetus. It will go on in spite of the Minister and the Industrial Development Authority, but it will go on at a steadily diminishing pace, unless the impediments to it are removed.</P>
    <P>This impediment to our national economy was the Industrial Development Act of 1949. At column 1607 Deputy Lemass said:</P>
    <P>I sincerely believe that this commission will be an impediment to industrial development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="175" /> At column 1618 he said:</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the Bill in principle and, whatever views I may have about the individuals I do not propose to express them. But, in fairness to them and to anyone else who may be now or who may in the future become associated with this Industrial Development Authority I want them to understand that my opposition and the opposition of Deputies on this side of the House to the whole idea in this Bill is fundamental and that at the earliest possible occasion we will terminate it.... Our hostility is to this Bill and to the principle of it... if ever that situation ceases and the Party on this side of the House becomes the Government, the functions of the Minister for Industry and Commerce will be resumed by whoever is nominated to that post and these subsidiary bodies will cease.</P>
    <P>This body is still in existence. The Industrial Development Authority was set up in 1949. As I said, the present Taoiseach said in the same volume, column 1633, and this is the real gem:</P>
    <P>It is a dangerous precedent to allow men appointed by the Minister to this authority to have control over the expenditure of moneys in the establishment of industries that are being contemplated by private individuals.</P>
    <P>Those are the grounds on which the present Taoiseach opposed the Bill. I am sure the Minister will remember this occasion.</P>

      <P>The authority is still there. Fianna Fáil and Deputy Lemass in particular took credit for what is happening at Shannon. Their claim seems to be spurious, having regard to what was said at that time. They are naturally due credit for whatever work they have done and there is no use denying them that. It is enough to give them credit for what they have done but they cannot claim credit for everything. The words of Deputy Lemass, and the words of the present Taoiseach, indicate what they felt then. If they were sincere at that time and knew what they were talking about they can hardly claim credit for what has been achieved. Another Act which affects the Industrial Estate at Shannon and indeed all industrial estates in this country is the Industrial Grants Act, 1956. This was an inter-Party effort. This Act empowered the Industrial Development Authority to make grants towards the cost of factory buildings and any other work required in the establishment of an industrial undertaking. Again, it might be interesting to remind the House what the Minister's Party had to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>You were against <Col N="177" /> the Industrial Grants Act, 1956. In Volume 160 of the Dáil Debates of the 5th December, 1956, Deputy Lemass had this to say:</P>
      <P>The first question that arises on this Bill is why it was considered necessary at all.</P>
      <P>At column 1947 of the same volume he says:</P>
      <P>We have this proposal to give grants to private industry. No statement has been made to the House to lead us to believe that anything will come of it. No argument has been advanced to show that it is necessary and no attempt has been made to analyse the possible consequences of the provision.</P>
      <P>At column 1950 he says:</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that in my view it has no importance whatever in relation to our industrial development and represents a completely wrong approach to Irish industry.</P>
      <P>That is the approach which is still operating and that is the approach for which the Fianna Fáil Party takes so much credit and in which they have so much pride. Those are things which were said by Fianna Fáil. Now they become very anxious when they are reminded about those statements. The major success of the Shannon experiment is due, of course, to the industrial grants and the tax concessions given by the 1956 Act. That is quite clear and it is not necessary to remind the House of it.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us provides that the Minister may subscribe some £8 million instead of £6 million in- share capital, £6 million instead of £3 million in grants-in-aid and some £7 million instead of £3 million in community services. The Fine Gael Party welcome this and we hope there will be a corresponding increase in such provisions in the coming year. It is no harm at this stage to remind the House of what the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited had to say last year. I quote from the concluding paragraph of the introduction to their annual report of 1966-67:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="178" /> Restricted financial allocations led to a severe curtailment of promotional activity, which reduced results below possibilities and which will seriously affect next year's targets.</P>
    <P>The company had to refer to their expenses which will now affect next year's target. They go on to say:</P>
    <P>To achieve even a minimum level of promotional activity the company had to defer other expenditures which must now be met next year, notably on the painting and general maintenance of property. Promotion is the essence of development and the company earnestly hopes that a marked improvement will be possible in the future. Granted this, the company confidently expects that its employment and other targets for the Second Programme will be achieved.</P>
    <P>We all hope so. The Minister has stated that the company is able to receive more responsibilities and that its responsibilities will now include industrial development in Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary. If the company are to carry out their new responsibilities it is absolutely essential that they are not expected to operate in the same fashion as they had to operate in 1966-67 with restricted financial allocation. We can only hope the Minister will be able to persuade his colleagues in Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, to provide the necessary money to enable them to carry out their functions. An early start is essential on this work. I am sure the Minister and his Party are as well aware of that as we are and will undoubtedly provide the money. Quite recently the Chairman of the Development Company, as reported in the Press, claimed that the position in regard to finance was not abundantly clear and the extra responsibility will add to that. All this industrial activity and all the increases in population in the Shannon area mean that there must be facilities for higher education provided in this area.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the position of the problem of a university in Limerick. We can only hope here that the Minister for Education, who has <Col N="179" /> already explained that the claim to a university is well-founded, will enable people in that area to make provision as soon as possible for the education of their children. Many of them are three, four, five and six years living there and they are now at the stage of considering their children's education and if they were assured that there will be a university in the vicinity they would have an assurance that their living in Shannon was worthwhile.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to mention and that is the trade dispute with EI. This is a thorny and difficult position and I do not want to say anything here which would make the position worse. Certainly every sensible man and person in this country must condemn the burning of buses and all criminal acts associated with this campaign. There can be no excuse or reason for such acts. While we say that the EI company are giving a lot, every body or responsible person in the Shannon area believes that the union should be recognised and that EI are grievously to blame. It is inevitable, in view of our history of industrial relations, that the union will eventually be recognised. The Minister should attempt, if at all possible, and I know how difficult this may be, to persuade his Government to take some action to persuade EI to accept the inevitable and recognise the union before irreparable damage is done at Shannon.</P>
    <P>Finally, my Party welcome this Bill and in welcoming it we should like to agree with the words of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the inter-Party Government when introducing the Industrial Grants Act, 1956. He said:</P>
    <P>I would be very glad if the estimate proved too low as I can think of no better way of spending money than on industries which will provide permanent employment for our people, reduce our expenditure abroad and increase our export potential.</P>

      <P>For sheer downright hypocrisy and brazen effrontery it would be hard to beat the attitude of the Fine Gael Party at present. I have <Col N="180" /> listened to the last speaker enunciating the achievements of the inter-Party Government and now belatedly trying to take to themselves credit for this enterprise founded by Fianna Fáil and supported and encouraged, despite the efforts both of the then Leader of the Opposition and many of his colleagues to try to cast reflection on the good intentions of the Fianna Fáil Government towards the establishment of industry in this country and towards an effort to provide jobs for our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>We also know what happened at Inchicore and various other places. It is an undeniable fact that when that outfit of Coalition Government were in office few industrialists of any kind, either at home or abroad, had any confidence whatever in them. There was practically no stability whatever in the country and, to prove it still further, when those people applied to the ordinary Irish people for a national loan of a mere £5 million it was not even one-half subscribed. These are some of the bald, salient, undeniable facts that it is no harm to recall now and then, especially when we hear people of the Fine Gael mentality away in the back of this chamber being sent in here with prepared documents to try as best they can to retrieve lost prestige for the Fine Gael Party. Last year they did their very best to sell out to a Coalition and they also were not accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have explicit faith in the Shannon Free Airport and we have had from the very beginning. It was the Fianna Fáil Government who established and nursed it through its infancy, despite all the other adverse <Col N="181" /> criticism that pursued that policy of building up for our people an industrial arm to absorb extra members of our population who were then leaving the land. That has been our policy down the years. It is nothing new to us. It has been proved and it has borne success all down the years and this Bill, in conjunction with others, displays the investment this Government is making so as to ensure that there will be further success in the Shannon Free Airport. It is a matter of extending it even further to embrace areas around Limerick city and, indeed, eventually probably other parts of the country as well. We are very proud of the part our Government have played in the establishment of Shannon Airport and all the other ancillary benefits that flow from it, in particular tourism.</P>
    <P>It is not so long ago since so-called members of the Fine Gael Party, or whatever Party they belonged to then, were on platforms hounding down tourism and making a laugh about An Tóstal and the various methods by which the Fianna Fáil Government were trying to educate people that this was the potential place for tourists to come, a place where they would be well treated, that we were a kindly, friendly people. This Government were providing grants to build guest-houses and hotels and we all know of the catchcries from the Opposition platforms about money being squandered to build luxury hotels, <i>et cetera.</i> Now when tourism is a paying proposition and the majority of the people came to our way of thinking they are bending over backwards trying to take credit even for tourism as well.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are wholeheartedly, 100 per cent, on the side of this Bill which the Minister has put in front of us and we intend to continue and pursue still further our efforts to ensure that as the years go on we will still go from height to height to ensure that we will provide industries so as to provide more jobs for our people. I certainly welcome the Bill and I did not go out of my way to provide any statistics coming in here which I could read out as the other speaker did, but were I <Col N="182" /> put to it I could do it. It is a well known fact that what I have said is true&mdash;those references I have made with regard to Shannon Airport were made by those people in the past and they can swallow them or not. We have produced the goods; we are proud to stand over our success and we take all credit for it. Go raibh míle maith agaibh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all welcome this Bill and the success of Shannon Airport no matter who, or what Party, was responsible for developing it. Both Parties have contributed to the development that has taken place. Consequently, we can welcome the Bill, as we welcome every indication of increased employment for our people. In the past our difficulty has always been to find worthwhile industry and the capital has been of consequential consideration. We have shown in Shannon Airport development that industry has been got going. The capital has been rather high but still if we can succeed in providing employment it is, I think, the people as a whole who will face whatever tasks as are necessary to raise the capital involved. I wish to thank the Minister for the great welter of statistics and the informative speech he has made. His approach is always statistical and factual.</P>
      <P>Looking through the figures given by him it struck me that at a cost of £10 million, of which £3 million is repayable sometime in the future, we have placed about 4,000 people in employment, the cost working out at £2,500 per worker. About half of the money is share capital, a quarter is by way of grant to the companies involved and the other quarter is in the form of repayable advances. The money per worker involved is, by modern standards, perhaps, not excessive and the return is estimated at about £750 per worker which is the minimum type of return we can expect from such industry. It provides a yardstick to the task involved in creating new employment. It shows that jobs cannot be produced out of thin air, that the money must be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any rate, what is being done in <Col N="183" /> this case is our yardstick. I should like in this context to suggest to the Minister that he should apply the same yardstick to the problem of creating new jobs anywhere else in our economy. If the Minister looks at the agricultural picture he will find that we have a reduction of 14,000 per annum in the labour force on the land. If we could cut that by half, if we could save 7,000 of those 14,000 jobs, we should find that those jobs are just as good and as valuable nationally as is the project of increasing jobs, of creating new jobs, in an industrial estate or in any other industrial situation in the country.</P>
    <P>The cost of doing that, as estimated on the Shannon scale, would involve about £14 million annually of which £3 million would be repayable, still taking the Shannon figures. I urge the Minister and the Government seriously to consider earmarking some of our national product, our resources, for the very urgent task of saving some jobs in agriculture, creating thereby the help to boost our efforts to achieve what we all hope for, the target of full employment for our people sometime in the future. I hope that at a later date we shall have an opportunity, by way of a motion on the Order Paper, of belatedly discussing the Report on Full Employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should know&mdash;and bring it to public attention &mdash;the real sacrifices that must be made by each section of the community if we are to achieve the very laudable aim set out in that paper on full employment. I am glad to see the Minister and the Government enlarging the functions of the Shannon industrial authority to provide for industrial development in the adjoining areas of the three neighbouring counties. In the past I have been critical of trying to have <Col N="184" /> development in an area like Shannon involving the building of a complete infrastructure as well as factories when in the neighbourhood there are towns like Ennis, Limerick, Rathkeale and Newcastlewest where you have got already an infrastructure of schools, churches and the other facilities and where all that is needed is industrial development. Now at last I hope the Government will extend the Shannon approach and give the same type of generous injections to those outside areas to help to establish factories and create employment, thereby removing the transport costs and the other costs involved in building elsewhere the infrastructure which must take a considerable portion of the amount already spent at Shannon. What has been done there is valuable. It has shown what can be done. But let us do the same thing in areas already developed and let us hope that sometime in the future we may be pressed again to go out into virgin territories and there build new towns.</P>
      <P>That is a long time in the future. Our task at the moment is to develop the industrial and other amenities of existing centres. In doing that, I suggest to the Minister that in approaching this new development he must first look at our industrial relations about which we are not happy at present. Our industrial relations are not what they should be in a small community where we are all close together. We have all come from the same background and, therefore, the spirit of acrimony that gets into our industrial relations should not be there. There should be a more Irish type of industrial relations, a type that is more suited to our national temperament, more inspired by our traditions and better geared to have workers and management uniting in preparation for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the figures and the grants mentioned in his statement&mdash; £10 million put into Shannon, £2,500 per worker invested there&mdash;I suggest to the Minister that it should be possible to take those figures and abstract at the start the amount repayable&mdash; £750 per worker, leaving £1,750 per worker&mdash;and to devise a scheme by <Col N="185" /> which the workers would gradually attain part ownership of the industries in which they work: that the State, having put in £1,750 per worker as at present, would arrange that the share capital which the State should take up, based on those figures, would be gradually transferred to the workers on the understanding that the workers would contribute part of their output to acquiring those shares. I have in mind especially that this extra output by the workers would be put in by way of extra hours for the purpose of acquiring the share capital. By working an extra four hours on a Saturday they would each contribute in a year at least £100 and, therefore, during seven or eight years they would provide, if converted into share capital, sufficient to enable the workers to take up half of the shares of the company.</P>
    <P>If we had a situation where the workers in their factories held at least half the share capital and were more deeply interested in that aspect of their companies' activities you would have a much closer and better worker-manager relationship and a greater feeling by the workers that the factory was theirs. If the factory began to run into difficult times, because of competition or otherwise, there would be the answer to that problem of longer hours and harder work to ride out the difficulties. That is what the farmers of this country have had to do all through the years and other self-employed classes have also had to do it. The pattern of industrial relations which I would like to see radiating from Shannon would be the pattern I have just mentioned. On that pattern you could provide a system of worker-manager relationships, the kind of relationships which should operate in every happy family.</P>
    <P>The people who will staff the factories in the extended areas will be drawn from the areas themselves. They are from the area at present and they will be from the extended area, they will give a local base to the factories and it is only natural that they should wish to acquire share capital in them. Any incentive that the Government can give to enable them to do this is all for the better. We will have a better <Col N="186" /> chance of discussing this side of the matter when the Bill for the extension of the Shannon development works comes before the House but I put the idea before the Minister who is always willing and receptive to new ideas.</P>
    <P>The time has come to step out on a new road and to build a new structure. The old structure of having management on the one side and labour on the other has failed and we will have to replace it by something which will enable these people to work together as one happy family for the benefit of themselves, their industry and for the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all the previous speakers, I am happy to welcome this further stage in the development of the Shannon Free Airport Development area. I would like to say that I have had an opportunity, because of my association with that area in my schooldays, of seeing the result of this development, not just in the economic well-being of Clare, Limerick and Kerry but in the uplift of morale which this industrial adventure has given to the people of that area.</P>
      <P>I think Senator McHugh could have given the House more useful information had he concentrated on the benefits that have accrued to the people in that area and to all those involved in the project at Shannon. It was unfair to suggest, as Senator McHugh did, that the Minister had not given credit to certain people when, in fact, he had not even claimed the credit which is entirely due to the Party which initiated this whole concept of regional development and put it into practice in the Shannon Airport area. It is unfair to suggest that names have been left out when the men who initiated the concept do not claim credit for it themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best thing that has arisen from the formation of this scheme in connection with this regional development is that we have seen go forth from it not merely a flow of manufactured goods and exports but a number of experts in management and planning. The Minister was right when he paid a compliment to the staff and to the board who have implemented the plan <Col N="187" /> which the Government put before them and for which the Government gave them the facilities to carry out. One of the lessons which Shannon can give to any other development is the delegation of responsibility and how that can be achieved with the maximum success. One does not need to mention the names of the people concerned; their names are well-known and their success speaks for itself, but anyone concerned with the development programme in that area will be aware that this success depended entirely on the way in which responsibility has been delegated by the directors to the various heads of Departments.</P>
    <P>Weekly meetings are held and these report back to the chairman in each case and the chairman uses the fountain and source of information and suggestions that come in from these meetings to their fullest extent. This is a very effective lesson which can be followed by all other industries, even the smaller ones. The success of this project is attributable to a number of factors but this is one which has had a more than sizeable bearing on the end result.</P>
    <P>Another factor is the enthusiasm with which every worker in the complex became affected. Even those who have been trained in that area have brought from it a new concept of work and enthusiasm, the effect of which is being felt throughout the whole extent of the nation because it applies particularly in the field of hotel development. The hotel school in Shannon sends its graduates to the various parts of the country to implement their training and the graduates of that school are very much involved in the immensely successful hotel development which we have had in this country in recent years.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave some very salient and significant figures in relation to industrial output in Shannon and to the significant increase in output which I believe will continue. He expressed the percentage of national exports from Shannon having increased from 21 per cent of the national exports in 1964 to 29 per <Col N="188" /> cent in 1967. It is, of course, very significant that in one single area one can have almost one-third of the national exports of the country. It possibly may be a matter of credit to Shannon and it may be, to a certain extent, a reflection on other areas. It may also, I think, serve to encourage the Government, as Senator Quinlan suggested, to implement or to give the facility for the same type of development in other areas because if one small restricted area can contribute such a fantastic proportion of our national exports it leads us to believe that, in fact, we are not at all realising our potential in various other parts.</P>
    <P>I should like to note that again in the field of tourism, while the Minister has not actually given the percentage figures for the tourism activity in Shannon, it is my recollection from the Bord Fáilte report that it is a very significant part of the total tourist earnings. Here, again, one can point to enlightened planning, to progressive thinking and, indeed, to the kind of thinking that is as far away from Senator McHugh's historical research into contributions to debates of 20, 30 or 40 years ago as is real progress from retrogression and inhibited development.</P>
    <P>The tourism programme in Shannon has captured the imagination not just of our own country but very obviously of the customers who are the people with whom we must be particularly concerned and notably the customers in the United States. This, again, is a programme which is expanding and developing at every level and at all times from the initial medieval banquets which one saw in Bunratty to the various cultural and historical events which are now being offered in Knappogue and Drumguaire, the historical pageants that have been developed there. Not only is the programme justifying itself in terms of money but, in fact, it is giving a clear historical impression to so many of our visitors of the type of people that we really are. It is disillusioning to many of them who thought that we were somehow a rather savage nation with no fine feelings and whereas 20 years ago one would feel that an American <Col N="189" /> who stopped at Shannon hardly got a representative picture of Irish life one is very happy to think nowadays in view of this development, in view of this continued expansion, that the American who stops at Shannon is certainly getting a very optimistic impression of Irish life. I am no more modest and no more proud than the rest of us but I think the Government can clearly claim credit for having promoted this opportunity. I would not at all have referred to this credit that is due to the Government were it not for what I call the defensive attack of Senator McHugh in opening this debate.</P>
    <P>On a recent visit to the US I was particularly concerned with, and had an opportunity of discussing, the proposed travel tax both with members of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company board and also with various members of Congress. Obviously, if implemented it would have been a very significant blow to the continued growth of Shannon. I must say that I think due to possibly the general public opinion of the American people themselves and, secondly, due to the effective lobbying done both by the Government and the members of the Company, the tax as proposed will not be implemented. I should like to suggest here at the same time that while we are now aware of that I became aware of the fact that even with the announcement of the proposal by the President of the United States many of the medieval tours which had been booked for this year were, in fact, cancelled so that the picture, instead of being one of continuing expansion, looked for a while as if there might be a setback due to this announcement.</P>
    <P>There were immediate cancellations but I understand now that many of these cancellations have, in fact, themselves been cancelled. I think that it is important that this change of policy on the part of the Congress in America should be communicated as much as we possibly can through Bord Fáilte and the various other travel organisations throughout America because, strangely enough, though it was almost evident on the occasion of my visit to the States about two months ago that this tax would not be implemented as <Col N="190" /> announced, nonetheless it was amazing that the ordinary American whom one met was not fully aware of this change of policy and one can assume that until such time as they do become fully aware of it they might not make travel plans which otherwise they would make. Therefore, I would suggest that every effort should be made to communicate to them that this tax as announced is no longer being implemented and one can hope that the bookings will continue for the tourist development in that area to expand and expand enormously as it has, indeed, in recent years.</P>
    <P>A matter which is hardly relevant, certainly not at the length at which Senator Quinlan referred to it, though I agreed with a lot of his sentiments, is the field of industrial relations. I would say that obviously in a developing area of the magnitude of Shannon, industrial personnel relations must be of immense importance. Up to recently I think it is fair to say that relations in that area, because of the community attitude and spirit, have been very satisfactory and highly commendable. It does appear now that there is a certain cleavage in a particular case and while it is, of course, very desirable that both sides, management and labour, would realise their mutual responsibility and their mutual rights, I think I should say that all too seldom does one hear from either side the acceptance of the notion&mdash;because it only appears to be a notion to them&mdash; that all on the other side are not, as we say in the country, lightened devils and that goes for both trade unions leaders and the leaders of the employers section. I was greatly relieved and impressed recently to see what the chairman of the Nenagh Branch of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union said so effectively. What that young man had to say about the principles of community responsibility, of co-operation in industrial relations, would certainly be in the mutual interest not only of Shannon but everywhere if implemented. One could comment on the issues in this dispute but I think in the interests of allowing everybody to solve their own problem I would prefer not to, beyond saying that whatever is involved in recognition <Col N="191" /> or otherwise of union's rights both sides should be got to understand that Shannon was founded on the basis of mutual assistance and responsibility, that Shannon has developed on that same basis and that only on acceptance of those principles can Shannon continue to expand. If either side loses sight of that, the whole programme such as it is and such as it will be can be thrown into jeopardy in their own interests.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the extension of the authority of the Shannon Free Airport Development again. I know this aspect of it is not the Minister's responsibility because in his opening speech he said that the company will be responsible to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in connection with subsequent expansion of their responsibility. I should like to say that we in Tipperary welcome this announcement because we see, first of all, the effects which Shannon has had in the Clare area and, to a lesser extent, in my own area, in that many of the personnel travel from Tipperary and Limerick to the Airport Development Company.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we realise that this community enthusiasm, their experts and their planning, have a very significant effect in any development. We, like others, are anxious to play our part in this to the fullest possible extent. I am speaking particularly of Tipperary, but the same applies to Limerick, when I say that we lost a number of developments by virtue of the fact that grants and facilities were available to neighbouring counties on a scale much higher than were available in our county. Factories which might have been established in Tipperary and Limerick went across the Shannon, in fact, to the Shannon Airport Development area. It is to be hoped with this extension of the Shannon Airport Development Authority we can see that this imbalance will be rectified. I can assure the Minister and the House when that extension comes they will find the same ready enthusiasm, the same ready responsibility and the same <Col N="192" /> determination to work in the extended areas of North Tipperary and Limerick as they found in Shannon and which has proved the very bedrock of the Shannon success.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;some predictable clichés on the subject of the responsibilities of different Governments for different things. Senator O'Kennedy returned to this subject somewhat. Although I do not agree with everything he said, the manner in which he said it was somewhat more constructive.</P>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to ask the Minister some questions about promotion work. It was very disturbing indeed to see in the accounts of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company in their Annual Report for the year ended 31st March, 1967, appalling cuts in the promotion work, the sums available and spent on promotion both in tourism and in industry. I found the expenditure for tourism is cut from £67,000 to £16,000, by more than three-fourths. The estimated export creditor for industrial promotion is cut from £38,000 to £5,500, a cut of 6/7ths approximately. It seems to me that in times of financial stringency and difficulty which a country occasionally experiences, and which we experienced in the years 1965-66, we ought to have a better sense of priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been astonished, and at times appalled, by the way in which savings of paltry sums in the context of a Budget of £250 million are effected at the cost of a vital national concern, the development in this case of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, its factories there, its housing and the expansion of employment there when many millions of pounds are spent in other areas where a small cut, though possibly unpopular, would not have any like effect. The <Col N="193" /> gearing of promotional expenditure in a case like Shannon to the return we get from it is so much greater than the kind of return we can get on many other forms of expenditure that it should be the very last thing to be cut, no matter how great our economic difficulties, instead of being the first thing to be cut as it was on this occasion and cut most drastically to such an extent that the board were provoked in their introduction to their report, which Senator McHugh quoted, to refer to the grave difficulties which this created for them and to state further on in the report on page 12, that unless this were remedied the expansion of the estate could not continue. They put it slightly more positively. The expansion of the estate could continue if adequate sums were available for promotion.</P>
    <P>Mind you, it was not only the promotional side which was cut down during this period. If we look at some of the other figures we find a similar pattern. We find, for example, in housing there were actually fewer dwellings built on the 31st March, 1967 than in the year earlier although there is a reference to fewer dwellings sold, so apparently there may be some slight adjustment here. Certainly, however, there was no increase in the number of dwellings. It is a bit startling to find on the 31st March, 1966 that 455 dwellings were completed and 125 under construction and a year later 453 dwellings were completed and 125 under construction. It is a very long period for under construction, so long, indeed, that one wonders what &ldquo;under construction&rdquo; means. To me &ldquo;under construction&rdquo; means a building has started to materialise out of the ground. If that were the case with 125 dwellings in March, 1966 there must have been a bit of moss grown on them by March, 1967 if they were still not completed.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see from the figures the Minister has given here that this dead stop of the accommodation for workers at Shannon, the new town there, has come to an end, and in the past year, in the year ended March, 1968, there was once again a further expansion of dwellings <Col N="194" /> to the tune of about 127. In other words, what has happened in this year, if I read the figures correctly, is that the 125 dwellings which were under construction in March, 1966 and under construction in March, 1967 were completed in the year ended March, 1968 but that is all. Nothing else was completed.</P>
    <P>It is nice to know they were completed and at least we have got to the point where the number of dwellings has risen from 453 to 580. I note, however, that there are now a further 130 under construction from which I gather the stop in activities at Shannon for several years, which held up development of the new town, has come to an end. One must hope that those 130 dwellings will not be as long getting their roofs on them as were the previous 125.</P>
    <P>The slow-down in the growth at Shannon caused by the severe cuts imposed in its budget, wrongly by the Government, the effects of this also can be seen in the pattern of employment where there was an increase of only 181 jobs in the year ending March, 1967 as against 366 in the previous year. I am glad to see this also has come to an end, that employment has started again and that the unfortunate effects of the Government measures are no longer applicable because in the year ended March, 1968, according to the Minister, employment rose by, I think, 698.</P>
    <P>This is a very cheerful picture. In fact, it is in excess of the 500 jobs a year target but it needed to be to catch up on the lag in the two previous years when in the two years together there were not 500 jobs created, never mind 500 each year. This slow-down in the growth of the activities there was to be seen also in the figures for the value added by industry at Shannon, the difference between exports and imports, which rose hardly at all from only £6¾ million to £7.14 million in the year ended March, 1967. This, again, has leaped forward to about £10 million. We can see here progress has again resumed after the effects of the cuts imposed in 1965-66. I should like to ask the Minister, <Col N="195" /> however, because he has given us no information, what has happened on the question of promotion and development. Can we be assured that the cuts of 75 to 80 per cent imposed on promotional expenditure in the year ending March, 1967, have been removed and that the company is now promoting its services, as regards industry and tourism, on the scale it was previously? It is not much use building more houses or building more factories if, in fact, efforts are not being made to attract people to establish industries there. The promotional effort is vital to making useful investment to put into these factories on this site.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to tell us what, in fact, was the square footage in factory space in March, 1968. It is a figure usually given to indicate the growth of the factory area there. We had it for previous years in the annual reports, showing once again a complete stop in the growth in the year ending March, 1967, and I would like to know what the figure is for March, 1968, if the growth in factories has been resumed.</P>
    <P>On the question of the extension of the regional responsibilities of the company, I, like others, would like to welcome this, more particularly because this is a matter I have pressed before without success until now. I was most disturbed, and I so expressed myself in the House, when works started on development centres in Galway and Waterford that the centralised authority responsible for these new development centres failed to make any use of the experience, knowledge, skill and enthusiasm of the people who had built up the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and the industrial estate there. There was consultation. Somebody was asked to see them but their skills were not unleashed on these problems because work on development of these industrial estates at Waterford and Galway has been held close to the chest of An Foras Tionscal with no consideration for local interests and no attempt made to unleash the skills and abilities of those who made a success of Shannon. <Col N="196" /> It is nice to know that although they have not been allowed to help, as they would willingly have done in those industrial estates, that at least they will be allowed to make a contribution to a wider area than this estate. Knowing the abilities of the people concerned, I am satisfied they will make a great contribution and that their abilities are such that the growth of Shannon will not be slowed down or their efforts to develop the industrial estate will not be diluted by the responsibilities of these people being extended to a wider area.</P>
    <P>I am, however, a little concerned about the dividing of the responsibilities of the company between two different Ministers to two aspects of its work. Here is something which may require further thought. There is a difficult problem because the company is undertaking two different kinds of activity, tourist promotion and promotion of transport services on the one hand, and on the other hand, promotion of industrial development, and housing associated with industrial development. Yet, it is logical that it should do this. The idea of having a local promotional body concerned with the whole range of local activities operating at local level with local people involved is something that one must welcome and endorse, but the problem of co-ordinating this local development with the very split-up responsibilities of Government Departments is a difficult one. Here difficulties and problems may arise and the answer that has been found so far may not prove satisfactory. I gather from what the Minister said that the widening of the responsibilities of the company will be accompanied by the provision of extra funds and one presumes that there will be no question of slowing down the growth of resources available to Shannon itself when these responsibilities are spent.</P>
    <P>There is something Senator Quinlan said implying that there could be a saving in infrastructures by developing in locations rather than building a new town. There is some truth in this, but it can be exaggerated. The fact is, and we have to face this and we are not facing it squarely, that the infrastructure <Col N="197" />&mdash; housing, water supply, sewerage, roads, transport services&mdash;in most Irish towns is not at all adequate for the extended needs of industrialisation. There is a delusion in Ireland that our towns and villages are in a position to absorb, with their present facilities&mdash;and I should have mentioned educational facilities&mdash;new industries, making a fuller use of existing services without the need of expansion of services. This is the kind of idea people have in offices in Dublin but people who live in those towns tend to see the effect of a new industry starting, with some hundreds of new jobs being created, young people coming in and having children, and affecting schools. People at local level have not this delusion. It is something we have to watch because there is this idea of delusion that it will do. A good blurb is to plonk down an industry in an Irish town and leave it at that. A lot of our difficulties arise from this approach. The fact is that most Irish towns are not adapted to the establishment of new industries of any size and require considerable infrastructural investment to make them so established. There is no Irish town, even, perhaps, Dublin, that could absorb a really substantial new industry, though Northern Ireland picks up usually at the rate of about one per year&mdash;a new industry employing say, 2,000 people. People have said to me that if they have to face the problem of such an industry, where to put it, how to provide housing for the workers, water, sewerage, transport and educational facilities and do this in the time that the industry could get established it would be a nightmare and quite impossible. There is nowhere in Ireland that could accept a large industry, nowhere in the Republic. No attempt is being made to develop our infrastructure, to absorb that and we are codding ourselves in thinking that we are competing for large-scale industrialisation. Such industries go up automatically in Northern Ireland which is geared for them, and we get the small ones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant <Col N="198" /> to this question of the extension of the activities of this body. I do not believe that when this body applies itself to industrialisation and establishing industrial estates in other places that it will achieve the kind of savings Senator Quinlan thought. It will find itself involved in the same problems of housing and other infrastructure without a chance&mdash;not as acute, not as immediate, nevertheless, the same problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister in making provision for the extension of the activities of the Department in this way should not fail to make financial provision to enable it to undertake this kind of work. We should not feel that because it will be working in old-established, and not new, areas that there is no need to provide for housing, no need to give it authority to build houses and that this problem will look after itself. It will not. Experience throughout Ireland has shown that this problem does not look after itself.</P>
      <P>The company should do the kind of job that is done, the integrated job of looking after the industry&mdash;I was going to say from the cradle to the grave, but let us hope there will not be a grave&mdash;of finding workers, training them, housing them, providing telephones, cutting all the red tape, if this job is to be done elsewhere as successfully and effectively as at Shannon. That is why it has been a success; the company is there to do things, where there are new industries to nurse them along. It will need the same kind of authority and resources and must not be put into a different position in other areas because of some confusion of thought leaving people to believe that in other areas this difficulty about infrastructure will not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the problems of the EI factory. We have not faced this issue properly to date. We are all to blame in varying degrees for the situation that has arisen. Any of us officially or unofficially who have had occasion to assist in any way in getting new industries to this country, or helping them to come here, or persuading industrialists that this is a good country to come to, must feel a little <Col N="199" /> guilty of over-simplifying this problem. I feel guilty myself. I know I have been tempted to say to visiting industrialists who wanted to know whether workers have to be in a union that there are foreign factories established here and the workers are not in unions. While normally it must be the case that workers are members of trade unions, and I personally recommend they should be, it has not been absolutely essential, apparently, and I think that at official level the thinking has been the same and things have been enthusiastically said in efforts to get new industries here. We should have, I suggest, a stronger line to the effect that we would recommend against any firm coming here which is not prepared to act as any Irish firm would do in the matter of labour unionisation, in the light of events at Shannon.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to congratulate the company for the imaginative efforts they have been making in tourist promotion. They have done things which have not been done by anyone else in the country where we have not shown the imagination needed in matters such as folk villages and medieval banquets. It is a pity that other bodies interested in tourism cannot show the same imagination and undertake the same remarkable work the Shannon Company have done.</P>

      <P>I shall start by complimenting the Minister and thanking him for the very detailed review he gave of the development and success of this company which, I think, is striking from the figures he quoted which are quite startling in respect of the size of the exports it has been possible to achieve and the continued growth process which the figures reveal. We all agree that the Minister is one who in a matter like this takes a good deal of trouble to gather together the facts and place them before the Seanad for a debate of this kind. This opening speech of his is something we will keep for the purpose of future reference for observing, I hope, continued growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main object in getting up is to say something on the question of the <Col N="200" /> EI strike and the whole set up there. It has been mentioned by two or three Senators already. The first question is can we reasonably expect the Government to interfere? I think it is probably legitimate to ask and to expect the Government to do a bit of quiet talking to the company, a bit of persuasion, but I do not feel this is a matter in which the Government can, at this juncture at any rate, intervene directly. Senator FitzGerald has implied that we might warn in a friendly way incoming industrialists that our way of life as far as industry is concerned usually includes organised labour. I do not think it would be right, however, for the Government to try by legislation to say: &ldquo;No foreign company shall come in unless they are prepared to employ trade union labour&rdquo;, for the reason, of course, that we do not do that to Irish companies. Personally, I do not think it would be a good thing to do it.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the free organisation of labour. I am all in favour of all industries and businesses being organised on a union basis but I favour very strongly the voluntary principle and it weakens trade unionism in the end if you have either coercion from Government level or coercion by firms. It is true that in this company&mdash;so I gather &mdash;the wages and conditions in all probability are as good as trade union conditions outside or possibly better, but we must recognise, and I wish the company would recognise, that their employees would recognise, that working class standards are indivisible and that it ought to be the case that Irish workers, whether employed by a non-Irish company or not should be all for one and one for all and workers who may be paid trade union rates or more without having to pay trade union dues, without being organised in trade unions, ought not to be encouraged to say to the rest of the workers outside: &ldquo;I am all right Jackeen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to put the question in relation to this particular strike as to whether there may not be a tendency&mdash; I am not thinking of any particular union&mdash;on the part of some Irish trade unions to be just a little bit lazy and to expect their work of organisation to <Col N="201" /> be done for them by companies, compulsorily rather than by persuasion of the workers involved. If the company were to compel all their workers to join any given trade union, eventually that union would not be as strong basically as if the union had been given a full right to go in to persuade the workers to join on the voluntary principle. I feel that a trade union which asks that the company shall do its job for it and exert coercion, is in a sense abdicating its own role which is to persuade&mdash; and I understand they have powerful methods of persuasion&mdash;rather than to coerce. It should be possible for an active and inspired trade union to win the workers in any industry by an appeal to solidarity rather than by an appeal to the company to force all their workers into a particular union.</P>
    <P>We cannot ask the Government in relation to companies of this kind to insist that they employ only trade union labour for the reason, among others, that we do not do this with Irish companies. However, we could ask the Government in such a case and in future cases to indicate to such prospective employers from outside that they will find a great deal of smoothness in the relationship between workers and managers if they are prepared to observe the ordinary practices of commercial and industrial and working class life in this country which as a rule includes organised labour, labour which is prepared to speak for itself, to state its requests and demands about conditions and wages, in an orderly and organised manner which cannot but redound to the credit and benefit of the companies concerned in the final analysis.</P>
    <P>Moreover, it is always possible for a large foreign company such as EI to treat Ireland as something of a lost leader in relation to employment of labour, and such companies may be prepared to lose money on certain factories in Europe, if they happen to be American companies, in order to show what can be done by refusing the right to workers to organise themselves in trade unions. It should be patiently but persistently pointed out to such employers that we are not prepared to allow our workers to be used <Col N="202" /> in this manner.</P>
    <P>I repeat that the role of the Government in this matter in relation to the whole industrial estate at Shannon is one of moral suasion and persuasion rather than coercion and I state with confidence that the present Minister is well aware of that fact and is extremely well equipped for that kind of action. My hope is that he is engaging in such persuasive tactics behind the scenes as will bring this miserable strike soon to an end for the greater benefit of the whole Shannon area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the House for the general reception of the Bill but I want to make it quite clear, without referring to anything which has been said about Fine Gael and industry, that the Shannon Free Airport Development Act was passed in 1959 and that there is nothing about the Industrial Grants Act whatever in it. I have been very proud to have been associated with the whole scheme since its whole concept was thought of, designed and developed by the former Taoiseach, Mr. Seán Lemass. I must say that I have met the executives of the Board very frequently, practically every fortnight and I know that the Fine Gael Party has not been exclusively connected with the development of this company. Ministers should not boast about their own achievements but it is only right that I should make this position clear to the House.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinlan referred to the total cost per worker of setting up an industry. I will not go into details but we did go into an examination of the total cost per worker and, based on what the companies themselves told us as to the number they would eventually employ, it works out at a very moderate figure indeed, something between £400 and £600 per worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald referred to the restrictions placed on the Government's activities during the credit restriction period. I make no apologies for these. We went through a difficult period and we handled it in an exemplary fashion as is depicted by the recovery in 1967 and by the recovery in output in exports. That is reflected <Col N="203" /> in the continual growth of the Shannon Industrial Estate. Reference has been made to the EI dispute but I do not propose to go into detail on that matter because the Minister for Labour has made it quite clear that it is his purpose to bring about an amicable settlement of the dispute. I note the constructive observations made on the matter by Senator Sheehy Skeffington and I must say that I agree with a great deal of what he has said. However, the Minister for Labour is doing his very best to bring about a settlement and I hope his efforts will meet with success.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations at Shannon taken as a whole are very good. That is partly due to the magnificent aftercare services offered there. The preindustrial care services and the aftercare industrial services there are the two special factors of the company which are of much more importance than the factors that it is a customs free airport and that grants are given to it in a particular way. Senator Quinlan also referred to the various schemes that could be devised in connection with the operation of the industrial estate and to its extent in relation to the participation of workers. While this particular matter does not relate to the Bill before the House I have noted these developments and watched their progress in the world of Europe. The progress is slow but progress is being made. Some companies give bonuses and some have made arrangements for their workers to purchase ordinary shares. There has also been progress towards a wider community of effort and some industries in this country do have workers' councils and consultative industrial councils such as they have in CIE where workers and employers discuss the activities of the company. It would take me too long to go into detail on this matter but the more workers feel that they have a part in the actual operations of their industry and the more they know about it the better. I must agree that communication between employers and workers are very defective in this country and I can assure the House that the Shannon <Col N="204" /> Free Airport Development Company always stresses the concept of good communication between employer and worker in one form or another.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy spoke about the tourist potential. The total tourist income expended in Clare is about £1½ million, of which a considerable proportion comes through the Castle Schemes. Bord Fáilte has been taking into account the new restrictions on travel from the United States which take the form of a five per cent duty on air tickets and a limitation on the amount of goods that can be brought into the country by travellers. Senator FitzGerald dealt in detail with the amount of our contributions to the company. In 1966-67 the grant was £365,000. In 1967-68 it was £500,000 and in 1968-69 the amount is £700,000. These are the amounts we have budgeted for and it will be seen that we have doubled the grant-in-aid in two years. These provide for running expenses, promotion and grants to industry.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald also referred to the necessity of providing servicing facilities for industry but I would not agree that practically not a town in Ireland is in a condition to service industry. The whole concept underlying the extension of SFADCO to Limerick, Clare and the North Riding of Tipperary is that there is a regional plan. There is already a regional organisation of interested parties and a regional tourist company and the idea behind this regional scheme is to establish growth centres. Certain towns are better situated for the establishment of larger industries and in these areas large industries will be provided but it has been found possible also to secure industries more suitable to the small towns. The purpose is to follow a specific plan of development from which we hope most of the towns will derive benefit.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald asked for the square footage of factory space. On 31st March, 1967, it was 1,000,000 square feet. A year later it was 1,100,000 square feet and this is the accommodation for five extra factories. Square footage is perhaps not the best <Col N="205" /> criterion because employment increases in older factories take place at a faster rate than in the new ones.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with all the matters of importance that were raised in the course of the debate but perhaps I should mention in passing that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Industrial Development Authority and the officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce have all been in very close touch with the Board of SFADCO and the Board of SFADCO have given their advice on the subject of regional planning based on their successes in Shannon and there has been no lack of consultation at any time.</P>
    <P>In relation to my own sphere of influence in future, that of tourism, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company does collaborate with the local regional tourism authority, with Bord Fáilte and with CIE in order to ensure that the whole tourist effort is co-ordinated in the proper way.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) A regulation shall not be made under subsection (2) of this section until a draft thereof has been approved by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this evening on the Performers' Protection Bill I adverted to the section of the Bill where the Government was to make an Order applying the Act to foreign countries. I felt that was the kind of Order which should certainly be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. In this case what the Minister is in substance <Col N="206" /> seeking power to do is to enable himself by regulation to amend the definition of &ldquo;motor vehicle&rdquo; which in subsection (1) of section 1 is defined <i>in extenso</i>, I quite agree that there are cases where it is necessary to implement sections of a Bill by regulation, to make Orders, and that a sufficient safeguard is provided if those regulations and orders are laid before each House of the Oireachtas. However, when it comes to amending the substance of a Bill, where it is extending or restricting or adding to, I think that such amendments ought not to be carried out merely by a regulation to be made by the Minister and laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The practice has grown up and is clearly embodied in the legislation of this county. One finds it frequently in the Social Welfare Acts, certainly it is in several places in the Social Welfare Act of 1952 that where it is necessary to modify the provisions of a section of the Bill, not merely to implement it, that power is taken to do it by order or by regulation subject to the provision that a draft of the regulation is laid before each House of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving of the draft must be passed and then the Minister can amend. That seems to me to be the kind of case we have here in subsection (2) where the Minister is going to extend or restrict the definition of &ldquo;motor vehicle&rdquo; which is actually part of the legislation. One has only to look at the space that is taken up by it. It runs from line 16 to line 32, sixteen lines, and the Minister proposes to amend this subsection merely by a regulation. I do not think this is right or proper and I think that a draft of the regulations should first be approved by each House of the Oireachtas merely for the sake of maintaining the authority of Parliament over legislation. I do not want to repeat myself. I have no objection to implementing legislation by regulation but I do object, and I think the Minister and many others would agree with me, that we ought not to amend legislation simply by regulation.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept this amendment and that the House will accept it. I should say that in practice <Col N="207" /> and experience an amendment of legislation by the draft order procedure has never given rise to any delay whatever. I have never known of any protracted debate. There has been some debate and this has been useful on occasions in enabling the Minister to make a statement from a position where he would not be able to command the public attention with the same effectiveness that a regulation would command. I think there is no loss at all to ministerial power or ministerial influence by adopting the procedure suggested in my amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not think what is involved in this matter is a question of ministerial power. What might be alleged to be involved is the power of the Houses of the Oireachtas and in this regard I do not think there is any breaching of that in the provisions of the Bill because section 8 provides that as usual any Orders of this nature must be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution of either House. In practice, it could happen that the legislation operating it may reveal the need to exclude certain vehicles from its scope or some other amendment might be needed and serious inconvenience and disruption of business could arise if it were to be held up. It could be held up in some circumstances for a period of months, for instance, if the Houses of the Oireachtas were not in session. For that reason I think it could be seriously disrupting to have to adopt the procedure set out in the amendment and, on the other hand, the question of the Houses of the Oireachtas having the ultimate control in this regard is, of course, safeguarded by virtue of the provisions of section 8. For those reasons I find myself unable to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not dealt with the point I am making, that it is one thing to implement a particular section by regulations which are then laid before each House of the Oireachtas and which may be annulled within a period of 21 days and another thing to amend a section <Col N="208" /> of an Act by a regulation. The Minister puts in a plea that business may be delayed. Of course, business may be delayed if people are not alert. How often have we seen urgent measures brought in here in the last days before the Christmas or the summer recess and there have been months before in which to bring in the legislation? In fact, I think before Easter we had a Bill in here that was red hot, great urgency associated with it, and we were expected to pass all Stages in one day. I think, in order to meet the difficulties of the situation, we did so. Then, when it came, if my recollection is correct, to look at the date when the particular Bill was introduced we discovered that it was introduced 18 months previously. Everybody sat down, sent files down from the Minister's office and his advisers, had consultations with the interests affected, then somebody went on holidays; there was promotion and somebody did not pick up on that. This was the reason Parliament was presented with it in this fashion. I think it was a Bill from the Minister's own Department which had been introduced about 18 months previously.</P>
      <P>That is what happens when people are lethargic and are not alive and with it. I take the stand that this Order the Minister power to do this by Order, tion to amend a section of an Act should not be permitted. It is good enough of the Oireachtas to give the Minister power to do this by Order, which will be approved it seems before it is made, but I do not at all agree to this erosion of the power there. It is no use saying those regulations can be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. That does not satisfy me because I do not believe any regulation ought to amend any Act of Parliament. I quite agree, as I say, that a regulation can be made to implement an Act of Parliament. To amend an Act of Parliament by regulation&mdash;sin scéal eile.</P>

      <P>Just briefy I want to say that if Senator O'Quigley was referring <Col N="209" /> to the anti-dumping legislation his recollection is accurate in regard to the length of time between its introduction and being brought in here. As the Bill to which I have referred was the only one which might fit into the category he referred to, his recollection is somewhat vague in regard to the reasons for the delays which were experienced. It was not the case that files were passed back and forth. The delay related to a change in the GATT code, which resulted in our being able to add that in. I do not agree with the Senator in regard to the principles he is enuciating in the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment is put down to find out what this register will disclose. I refer to the register which is to be kept by the Revenue Commissioners.

      <P>The only information which the register of motor vehicle importers will contain will be the names and addresses of registered firms and the makes and types of motor vehicles for which they are registered. At the present time if a person wishes to ascertain who is an Irish distributor, his name and the type of vehicle he has, he can readily get this information by inquiry through the trade. Of course, the position would be the same after the coming into operation of this Bill. There is no objection from my point of view to making this information available but it seems to me that <Col N="210" /> the Senator's amendment is unnecessary because the information will be available both through official sources and the trading merchants. I have no rooted objection to the amendment except that I do not think it is necessary.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (2) to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section the Minister may impose conditions relating to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the quality of manufactured motor vehicles,</P>
      <P>(b) prohibiting the issue of, or the publication of, or requiring the signature of any purchaser to, a document which is misleading or likely to mislead as to the conditions upon which the motor vehicle is being sold,</P>
      <P>(c) the rectification of faults in manufacture or assembly of a motor vehicle including the payment of compensation to the owner of the vehicle or to a person buying same on hire purchase.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to the substance of this amendment on the Second Stage of the Bill. As I understand the position now as a result of the introduction of the Bill the motor industry and the motor assembly industry in this country may look forward, on the Minister's assessment of the situation, to a period of perhaps, 20 years or 25 years and, perhaps, longer of progress and expansion. That being the case, and being the case for the future, most Irish <Col N="211" /> motorists will be buying their motor cars, lorries, vans and so on from Irish assemblers. It seems to me to be the proper time to decide what should be done in the interests of the purchasers of motor vehicles of all classes. There is no doubt at all in my mind that if a person invests £600, £700 or £800 in a new car or £1,200 or more in a motor truck or van and much larger sums than that in a heavier vehicle and it turns out to be a dud he should be able to do something about it.</P>
    <P>As things stand, there is always a dud lot in every ten, 20, 30, 50, 100, or whatever is the average, of motors assembled. It has nothing whatever to do with being Irish or American assembled because it happens that way. The weight falls against the individual purchaser who has no effective remedy for the bad motor vehicle he purchases. It is the small man against the giant corporation. The stage has been reached where the conditions under which motor vehicles are sold to the public should be examined by the Minister's Department or the Department of Justice, who probably would be more concerned with it from the point of view of the Sale of Goods Act.</P>
    <P>One has seen from time to time the unfortunate person who makes a tremendous investment of £500, £600 and up to £900 or £1,000 on a new car or a trade in and he gets a dud. That person goes along to the garage who will refer him to the guarantee he has signed. That guarantee is one which excludes the manufacturer and the supplier from the strict provisions of the Sale of Goods Act. Under that Act, as Members of the House know, where a person buys an article, which is in the course of the vendor's business to sell, and he relies on the vendor's skill and <Col N="212" /> judgment, then he is entitled to expect that that article will be of merchantable quality but the guarantee that the innocent purchaser of a motor vehicle is presented with is framed in such a way that if anything goes wrong with his vehicle he cannot go back to the garage man and say: &ldquo;Look here, this car is a heap of scrap. It is leaking oil all over the place. That is the third time I have had something done to the clutch in six months.&rdquo; The first thing he will be asked is how long ago he purchased the car.</P>
    <P>If he says he has it such and such a time and if it is over six months he will be told that the six-month or the 12-month period has elapsed. In signing the guarantee the purchaser has, in fact, excluded himself from the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act in relation to that particular vehicle. That is the greatest injustice to the small man and I do not hesitate to say so. It is a fraudulent document prepared by wily, crafty and scheming advisers, motor manufacturers and motor assemblers whoever they are. It is a treacherous document to be allowed to be presented to unfortunate members of the public who think, when they are signing under guarantee, that they are getting something special, something extra. That is the position of a person who makes an out and out purchase of a motor vehicle from a garage, but the position of a person under the Hire Purchase Acts is even worse because he cannot go to the garage who supplied him.</P>
