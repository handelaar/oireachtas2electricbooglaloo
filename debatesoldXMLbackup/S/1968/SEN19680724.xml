      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the fact that in this House as well as in the other House the Opposition think the way in which debates should be conducted is that they should put their case and that there should be no reply but unfortunately I cannot undertake to comply with that manner of discussion.  I can assure the Opposition that as often as they make ridiculous and dishonest charges against the intentions of the Government in proposing this electoral reform those charges will be refuted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was dealing with this ridiculous proposition of the Opposition that there should be provision in the Constitution for two separate Commissions and last night I contrasted their present attitude with the attitude adopted in 1959 when the proposition was being put forward in the form of one Bill and the Constituency Commission was included in it, the only fundamental difference being that on that occasion it was to take a two-thirds majority to overrule the decision <Col N="2226" /> of the Commission, whereas on this occasion it is to take a simple majority only. In inserting that, it can be shown that we are also complying with the expressed opinion of the Opposition on the last occasion but in 1959 when the complaint could not be made that the Commission would only deal with half of what was being proposed the Opposition attitude was to propose that there should not be a Commission at all. Deputy T. F. O'Higgins and Deputy Costello moved an amendment to that effect. Speaking on the amendment Deputy O'Higgins said at column 946 of Volume 172, of 21st January, 1959:</P>
    <P>We think that this Constituency Commission should not be inserted into the Constitution.</P>
    <P>He went on to say in the same column:</P>
    <P>... we say in this amendment: &ldquo;Forget about your Constituency Commission. Let any law reviving constituencies be passed here through the Dáil. Let it be supported and defended in the Dáil. Let the Minister who seeks to introduce it take full responsibility for it in this House where he can be challenged in the broad light of day, with the Press looking on and with the public entitled to admission.&rdquo; We say that is the responsible course for any Minister or any Government genuinely intending to do the right thing to adopt.</P>
    <P>The present Leader of the Labour Party spoke on the same day at column 980 in support of this proposal to have no Commission to delineate constituencies.  Deputy Corish said:</P>
    <P>The reason I favour the amendment is not so much because it retains what is embodied in the Constitution at present, but because I believe it will work and there is a certain amount of elasticity about it. At least, it gives the power to the Oireachtas to determine what the constituencies will be, what form they will take and what populations will be represented in each. I do not think the system it is proposed now to enshrine in the Constitution will work. It is crude. As Deputy Declan Costello described it, it is putting <Col N="2227" /> the veneer of respectability on these other two proposals. For that reason, I think the House should reject this part of the Schedule and adopt the amendment proposed by the two Fine Gael Deputies, or something reasonably near it.</P>
    <P>Now that the Commission is being provided, and provided in the more appropriate of the two Bills into which the proposal has been divided in order to facilitate the Opposition, they want not one Commission but two. I think it must be obvious that when the division into two separate propositions was made, either the Commission would have to be dropped altogether or put into one Bill. The fact is the call for the separation of the proposal into two separate proposals was not a genuine one at all. It was merely meant as part of the Opposition's campaign against the proposal. They were hoping to be able to pretend that if the proposition had been separated, they would have supported the proposals which are now in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.</P>
    <P>But to their surprise, what was requested was conceded, and these two things were separated. Once this was done, a decision had to be made as to which Bill should have the provision as to the Constituency Commission. Our choice to put it into the Fourth Amendment is because it is there the fundamental change is to be made. As far as we are concerned, we want both Bills passed. Therefore, we want a Commission. As far as the Opposition are concerned, they want no Bill passed and they want no Commission.</P>

      <P>All the Opposition want is to oppose what Fianna Fáil are proposing. Senator FitzGerald said that we on this side of the House are prepared to have a Commission in the Fourth Amendment Bill but not prepared to have it in the Third. The contrary is the fact. We want both. We did not want to separate them. We wanted if possible to dispel the confusion in their minds. It has been argued by Senator FitzGerald that if the Third <Col N="2228" /> Amendment Bill is passed, there will be a high degree of elasticity in drawing up constituencies. He knows that is not so. He knows that the degree of elasticity will be much less if the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill is passed than it will be if it is not passed. This applies whether or not the Fourth Amendment is also passed. In the more likely event of the two Amendments being enacted by the people, that is, the Fourth Amendment being passed also, the requirement will be there to keep within county boundaries as far as possible and that obviously will be more restrictive on the Government, or on the Commission, than if there is no such requirement with regard to county boundaries. In the most likely event of both being passed, there will be less elasticity. In the event of the Fourth Amendment being passed, we will of course have the Commission.</P>
      <P>In the more unlikely event of the Third Amendment only being passed, and this is the assumption on which the Opposition base their case, and indeed it is characteristic that they like to base their case on the most farfetched assumptions they can, nothing more will happen than a return to the position that was assumed to obtain here from 1932 to 1959 and the requirement will be there to adhere to county boundaries in so far as it is possible and this will reduce the scope that is available for the revision of constituencies.  In fact, that has been conceded when Senator FitzGerald admitted that it was only in the case of Dublin and Cork that there will be really any effective choice available.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; that there will be much scope for this. However, I dealt with that last night. Senator <Col N="2229" /> FitzGerald went on to make the most ridiculous suggestion of all, and I must say I do not know how he relates it to this Bill but he insists on relating it to every section of each Bill and apparently also to every amendment. In view of the fact that this is one of the things I refrained from dealing with in my reply on the Second Stage, I think I will deal with it now when Senator FitzGerald seems to demand that it should be dealt with. Senators know in response to their urgent appeal last Friday night I kept my reply as short as possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not encourage Senator FitzGerald to refer to it once again. He made the ridiculous suggestion that under the present system Fianna Fáil are likely to be in a minority after the next election. At least in his attempts to forecast what might happen in the event of the Fourth Amendment Bill being passed&mdash; at least there he was dealing with completely new circumstances&mdash;there is some excuse for the ridiculous forecast he made. But to suggest that there is any indication that in present circumstances the Fianna Fáil Party will not secure a majority at the next general election is to display his complete and absolute ignorance of practical politics.</P>
      <P>We have of course had the clearest possible indication of the virtual certainty of there being a Fianna Fáil Government after the next election. We have had, for one thing, six out of seven by-elections in the lifetime of this Dáil and of course nothing approaching that ever happened before. If Senator FitzGerald would like to contrast that performance with the performance of the Government in either of the two Coalition Governments we had, he will see that out of the three by-elections during the first Coalition Fianna Fáil won one, Fine Gael won one, and Labour won one. In seven by-elections&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the first Coalition period, there were three by-elections and the two main sections of the Coalition at the time won one each. That would be two out of three <Col N="2231" /> as against one out of three for the Opposition. In the second Coalition period, there were seven by-elections and Fianna Fáil won no less than four of them. So, for the Government to win six out of seven by-elections is obviously a clear indication of continuing support for the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we have it that according to the Opposition the West is our strong area and Munster is our strong area, but the facts are that in the West we happen only to have a majority of one whereas in the Dublin area we have a majority of two.</P>

      <P>So if the West is a strong area for us then the Dublin area is a strong area also, because we have double the majority we have in the West for approximately the same number of seats. Now Munster is our strong area also so apparently it is in part of the province of Ulster that the Opposition did not cede to Great Britain at the time of the Treaty, in those three counties apparently, that the Opposition are strong and possibly strong also in the rest of the province of Leinster.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In whatever degree of detail the Opposition wish. All I want to point out at this stage is&mdash;we can go into them in as much detail as required&mdash;that despite the maximum possible Coalition effort, despite the fact that there is always a tendency in by-elections, particularly when the Government are not in danger, of every element with any kind of grievance to come out and vote against the Government, we have won six out of seven by-elections and there is a clear indication, if anything, of increasing support for the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2232" /> Not alone have we had the maximum Coalition effort but we have also had bodies that pretend and represent themselves to be non-political bodies taking an active part against the Government in those six by-elections. In the last three by-elections, in addition to that, we have had this British society, which is described by the Fine Gael Party as being a heavily subsidised one, also campaigning against the Government. Despite that, as I said, we have won six out of seven by-elections, retaining the three seats in the areas where the vacancy was caused by Fianna Fáil Deputies and winning three seats from the Opposition.  As I said, we can go into those individually, if necessary, but I think I will wait and see just exactly in what detail the Opposition would like to go into them before doing that. As far as we are concerned, there is nothing we are more happy to consider than those six out of seven wins we have had in the by-elections. If the Opposition also can take some pleasure out of contemplating those six defeats, which they like to look on as moral victories, it is nice to see everybody happy.</P>
    <P>As far as we are concerned, we can see the clearest possible proof that Fianna Fáil will definitely be the Government if the present system were by any chance to continue. As to what may happen in the new and clearer circumstances we propose, that is something which is not known yet. However, as I pointed out, it is only legally possible to provide for one Constituency Commission at a time. We have decided to do that in the Bill which will make the more comprehensive change in the matter of constituencies and I am quite satisfied that that was the more appropriate Bill into which to insert the Commission. We are asking the people to pass both those amendments and if the people do that the Constituency Commission will in fact be provided for in the Constitution.  This is obviously not a genuine amendment at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several points I want to deal with, arising out of what has been said by the Minister and Senator Ryan. First of all, there seems to be some confusion <Col N="2233" /> in regard to the question of gerrymandering.  The position is that where the boundaries of constituencies can be modified by a political decision, a decision by the Minister, there is an opportunity for gerrymandering. Senator Ryan said if I were honest I would admit that this is not possible because nobody knows how people are going to vote. Senator Ryan is being at best rather naïve in this matter. Of course nobody knows how any individual is going to vote; of course there are swings between elections; and of course those swings may at times vary somewhat between one area and another because of local issues or other causes, although the degree of variation from the national swing is relatively small by the standard of other countries, a reflection of the relative homogeneity of our political structure, which extends also, as I pointed out in an earlier speech, to the political geography of the country. The fact is, as anybody who has watched votes being counted knows, there are very wide variations within any constituency, within small areas within it, according to the social composition of the area or its local political tradition or the local popularity of the candidate.</P>
      <P>There are very strong variations locally within small areas between different Parties. The percentage of votes a Party may get within a matter of a few hundred yards of an area in a city can vary from below ten per cent to over 70 per cent, depending, particularly in the city and urban areas, on the social character of the areas. In rural areas, the differences are less sudden geographically but can also be very marked and the opportunities for gerrymandering are therefore considerable.  It is true of course that at elections there are swings from areas which voted 70 per cent Fine Gael at one election and which might only vote 60 per cent in the next election, or alternatively, might vote 80 per cent for Fine Gael in the next election. Nevertheless, there is a remarkable degree of consistency in the relative Party strengths in the different sub-areas of constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who has watched votes being counted knows this. I stood beside the Minister at the Limerick <Col N="2234" /> count. I commented to him humorously at the time that whatever about the pre-election organisation, at least we were better organised at counting the votes because we had printed slips on which to record the results from each box as they were checked. The Minister was jotting them down on the back of an envelope in what I thought to be a slightly curious fashion for a Minister with such a reputation for electoral organisation. However, the fact is that both of us were jotting down the results from each box.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not responsible for the organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>From each box from each polling station we were noting them. The Minister and myself have records therefore, as anybody has who has watched election counts, of substantial accuracy. One can miss the occasional vote and if you have not enough people doing this, watching the votes being checked, you may miss a few boxes, but assuming you have enough people there, you can get with almost complete accuracy the result of the votes cast in each box at each polling station, units which in rural areas consist very often of a couple of hundred votes and in urban areas of four or five hundred, possibly something of that order of magnitude. So, for those very small areas each Party has almost an exact record of the voting of those areas. The voting composition can vary very widely. As I have said, looking at the Limerick votes being cast, there were areas there where one Party might have less than ten per cent of the votes and other areas where the same Party could have 70 per cent of the votes and the two boxes might have been counted after each other and the two areas might have been within a few hundred yards of each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, the Parties know how the votes are cast; secondly the variation in votes as between contiguous areas can be very marked; thirdly, there is remarkable stability in the patterns in that despite the fact that there are general swings backward and forward, the same consistency of voting is there for one Party or another. Those are the facts. The Minister knows them as well <Col N="2235" /> as I do. Senator Ryan, who has also been present at counts, knows them as well as I do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact the counts Senator Ryan has been present at have very often been in Dublin. In Dublin the same situation applies in regard to checking the votes, so much so, that I recall at the Presidential election, visiting the various rooms where the votes were being counted while the votes were being checked. On the basis of what the speakers of all Parties told me&mdash;because one listens to the views of the different Parties on this in case there might be a bias of optimism in one's own Party&mdash;I was able to ring the Leader of my Party at 12 o'clock, two and a half hours before the count ended, and tell him the approximate results in Dublin&mdash;a 30 per cent majority in Dublin for O'Higgins and 40 per cent in the city and county&mdash; 28,000 and 42,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry. I am trying to establish the veracity of my statement that the information is available upon which to gerrymander. Let there be no doubt about that. I can produce stencilled records for Dublin, Waterford, Dublin South-East, table by table. Given that that is the situation, the question arises, in how many constituencies under the Minister's scheme will it be possible for the Minister to very boundaries in the event of the Third Amendment being passed and the Fourth Amendment not being passed, which is the situation we contemplate on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of constituencies in which the Minister can determine boundaries represents almost two-thirds of the total. There are, in fact, 90 seats in these constituencies&mdash; Dublin, Cork and the six constituencies that are divided in two and where the boundaries within Limerick, Tipperary, Mayo and so on can be varied in order to take in or exclude particular pockets of voters who may be known through the process of watching the checking of votes to favour one side or the other. There are 90 constituencies, therefore, under the Minister's scheme, in which gerrymandering will be feasible. In adition, some room for manoeuvre remains in other cases. The Minister, no doubt, will examine carefully the pattern of voting in Carlow, Kilkenny and Kildare in order to decide whether Carlow is best attached to Kilkenny or Kildare in order to produce the optimum result for his Party. While maintaining the integrity of county boundaries but by linking them together in one or other way, the Minister will be able to take a political decision under this scheme in respect of these counties and there may be others. Even if there are no others, constituencies involving 98 seats will have room for political manoeuvre by a political <Col N="2237" /> Minister in determining the pattern of constituencies under the scheme. All this talk about gerrymandering not being possible is nonsense.  It is possible in at least 98 out of 144 cases. I hope I have now dealt adequately with that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The next point I want to deal with is the by-election results which the Minister has again challenged. By-elections occurred in seven constituencies in which at the last election Fianna Fáil secured about 52½ per cent of the Party votes. In the last election they secured in the country as a whole 49 per cent of the Party votes. These constituencies are, therefore, constituencies biased in Fianna Fáil's favour above the national average of 7 per cent, 52½ per cent being 7 per cent more than 49 per cent. I give all these figures in case the Minister would wish to intervene with a correction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it I can deal with them now in all this detail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what you want to do. In these constituencies, inevitably, the results of the by-elections will tend to favour the Party which in the last general election secured more votes there than it did in the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In speaking on the Second Stage, I detailed the results and will just confirm them now in case there may be any doubt as to the position. A swing against Fianna Fáil occurred in all these constituencies. The first batch is Waterford and South Kerry. In the Waterford by-election, the percentage of votes secured by Fianna Fáil was 42.6 as against 48.1 in 1965. In South Kerry, the percentage of votes secured was 44.6 and this must be compared with the second count in South Kerry in 1965, the count after the elimination of the Independent candidate&mdash;just to make a fair comparison; it would not be fair to Fianna Fáil to reduce its share as would happen if you included the Independent votes. This gives a drop from 45.9 to 44.6. Taking the two constituencies in these by-elections, <Col N="2238" /> Fianna Fáil's share of the Party vote fell from 47.0 to 44.2. If the Minister wishes to challenge this, I have the actual figures. That is a swing of 6 per cent because 44.2 is 6 per cent less than 47.0. The next result was in West Limerick and Cork where Fianna Fáil in the general election in both constituences got 54½ per cent. So much above the national average were they of the Party votes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Of which Parties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the three main Parties. Let me take constituency by constituency. I do not wish in any way to mislead the House as to the basis of the figures. There were, in fact, no other candidates in either election, if I can read my notes correctly. Therefore, the comparison is between the Parties. In West-Limerick, of the total and Party vote, Fianna Fáil secured 54.5 per cent in 1965; 53.9 in the by-election.  In Cork there is a problem in making any comparison because in the general election there were a multiplicity of Independents but unfortunately they were not eliminated until some Party candidates were eliminated and it is not possible, therefore, in the case of Cork to make a valid comparison for any count after the elimination of the last Independent candidate because at that stage some of the Party candidates had disappeared down the drain. The only fair comparison is one between the total Party votes in both elections, excluding Independents. That comparison shows a drop from 54.3 per cent of the Party vote to 47.7 per cent&mdash;a drop of 12 per cent and a drop of 7½ per cent taking the two constituencies together. The fall, therefore, in that instance, was a drop of 7½ per cent in Fianna Fáil's share of the Party vote.</P>

    <P>Next I come to Clare and Wicklow. In Clare, Fianna Fáil secured in the general election 58.7 per cent and in the by-election 51.0 per cent&mdash;a drop of 13 per cent in the Party vote. In Wicklow, in the general election they secured 48.0 per cent of the Party vote. In the by-election, at the stage when Independents and other smaller Parties were eliminated and the three big Parties remained, which is the valid <Col N="2239" /> comparison with 1965, they secured 40.0 per cent, a drop of 16½ per cent and a drop of 15 per cent in Clare and Wicklow together. In Clare and Wicklow the decline in Fianna Fáil's share is 15 per cent&mdash;note the pattern &mdash;six per cent in the first batch; 7½ per cent in the second and 15 per cent in the third.</P>
    <P>In East-Limerick in the general election, Fianna Fáil secured 53.5 per cent of the total and Party vote&mdash;sorry, of the Party vote. In the by-election, after the elimination of the Independent, they secured 44.4 per cent of the Party vote, a drop of 17 per cent in their share of the Party vote in that instance.</P>
    <P>These are the most valid comparisons one can make, in each case selecting the comparison fair to Fianna Fáil. I could easily take first preference votes and show a different picture because in the by-elections where there were more Independents and where Fianna Fáil's share of first preferences was artificially depressed by the presence of Independents. Not until they were eliminated can one see the strength of Fianna Fáil relative to the other Parties. Not wishing to make any unfair comparisons, I take in each of these the comparison of the Party votes, having eliminated the Independents in the most appropriate manner. The position is clear. There has been a cumulative decline in the Fianna Fáil share of the vote&mdash;six per cent in the first batch, seven and a half per cent in the second, 15 per cent in the third and 17 per cent in the fourth. As a result of that disastrous trend for Fianna Fáil, combined with the swing in the local elections, which reduced their share of the Party vote from 49 per cent to 45½ per cent in comparison with the general election of 1965, Fianna Fáil decided to introduce these two Bills. These are the only figures available in the absence of public opinion polls.</P>
    <P>There is one further point I want to make. The Chair will be glad to hear that it relates directly to the Commission.  As we know, a Committee sat and considered these issues. I would like to read what it said.</P>

      <P>This is what the Committee has to say on the subject of the Commission. I address my remarks particularly to Senator Ryan and to Senator O'Kennedy, whose comments on this I would be glad to hear. I note that on occasions the Committee recorded the views of one side or another, and this has sometimes been abused by misrepresenting such views as the views of the Committee. On certain occasions views were expressed one-sidedly, but there were other times when the Committee reached unanimity and expressed a unanimous view. A unanimous view means that all the Committee support, adopt and press that view. I am concerned about a certain difference between the unanimous views of the Committee, of which both Senator Ryan and Senator O'Kennedy were members, and the views they appear to be pressing on us in this House at the moment and which Senator Ryan has, in fact, raised in the House already. First of all, there was a view expressed which was not the view of the entire Committee but the view of only part of the Committee.</P>

      <P>Yet this House has before it two amendments to the Constitution, either of which can be passed or rejected. We all recall 1959 when two proposals were put to the electorate, one of which they accepted&mdash;the election to the Presidency of Mr. de Valera&mdash;and one of which, this proposal, they rejected. Again, two amendments to the Constitution are being put, either of which can be passed or rejected. If one of them&mdash;the Third Amendment&mdash;is accepted and the other&mdash;the Fourth Amendment&mdash; is rejected, which is certainly a possibility and which most people would feel is the more likely of the two things to happen, if that happens, we shall have a constitutional change which does not incorporate a Commission, despite the fact that Senator Ryan and Senator O'Kennedy are on record as saying that no such thing should be allowed to happen. I would invite them to join us in the Division Lobbies on this vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald claims that he and his Party know how people vote in all areas in the country. I suppose it is probably because they think they have this information&mdash;and not only the information as to how they have voted but how they will vote&mdash; that they continue to do so badly. As far as we are concerned, we can only make a rough and very tentative assessment as to how the people are likely to vote after a thorough canvass, not before it. We believe that before attempting any forecast as to how people will vote, it is necessary to assess, in so far as it is possible to <Col N="2242" /> assess it, how the people are feeling. We would not attempt to insult the people's intelligence by assessing how they are going to vote without first asking them. It is because we have so much more respect for the intelligence of the people that they continue to give us their support.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald insisted on giving us his fanciful opinion as to the by-elections in general and individually. I suppose it would be a charitable thing to allow Senator FitzGerald to continue to live in his fool's paradise. But I must say I do not think anybody, even somebody as naïve as Senator FitzGerald, could really believe what he pretends to believe. Of course, there is not any one of the seven constituencies in which there have been by-elections in which it has not been clearly indicated that at worst, as far as we are concerned, there is no change but, generally speaking, that there is an increase in the support for the Government. Since Senator FitzGerald purported to go through them in detail, I will do the same. Let us, first of all, take Waterford and South Kerry, where Senator FitzGerald claims there was an indication of a swing against Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>One thing I notice about Senator FitzGerald is that he is able to change from considerations based on the operation of the present ridiculous and discriminatory vote to assumptions based on the straight vote system. The fact is that all these by-elections were contested on the discriminatory system of the transferable vote and that in all of them we had a coalition line-up. Despite that, there is no indication in any single one of these constituencies of any change for the worse in the support for Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take the first two by-elections we had in Waterford and South Kerry, where Fine Gael had the first of their long series of glorious moral victories, in the South Kerry constituency in the general election of 1965 Fianna Fáil barely succeeded in getting two seats out of three. The by-election clearly indicated no change. It clearly indicated that two seats out of the three will be secured by Fianna Fáil again in the next election. The by-election was contested <Col N="2243" /> on the system of the transferable vote. Under that system it is quite clear that to gain two seats out of three demonstrates equivalent support as the gaining of a seat in a by-election. Exactly the same amount of support in the constituency is required for each of these things on the basis of the transferable vote. It is quite clear we have every reason to be thoroughly satisfied with the result in South Kerry.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Waterford by-election, which was conducted on the same day, Fianna Fáil improved their position substantially because in the general election of 1965 they had succeeded in gaining only one seat out of three. Any Party able to gain only one seat out of three in a general election cannot have any significant hopes of winning the seat in a by-election, particularly when the vacancy is caused by the death of one of the Opposition Deputies.  In Waterford, however, Fianna Fáil significantly improved their position because in the circumstances of a Coalition line-up and the transferable vote, we won the seat against all indications because we had only got one seat out of three at the general election and winning a by-election indicates that at the next general election, if the people continue to vote as they did in the by-election, Fianna Fáil will win a seat.</P>

      <P>Apart from that, these two by-elections could not have taken place at a more suitable time for the Opposition, a time when the country was still affected by adverse economic circumstances existing in many countries and naturally affecting us. They took place at a time when it was necessary to cut down on the State's capital programme, when we had credit restrictions and so on and a time when it was possible for the Opposition to endeavour to cash in on the situation that arose because of rivalry between the two major farm organisations in the country. In fact, in those two by-elections the Opposition had actively campaigning for them, picketing polling stations and so on, a major farm organisation, the NFA, <Col N="2244" /> putting their own posters there in addition to the Opposition posters outside polling booths advising people to vote against the Government and also putting personnel outside the polling stations. Also, as Senator FitzGerald knows, in addition to the assistance of other sections of the Coalition, the Labour Party and the NFA, they also had the active participation on their side of the anti-language organisation.</P>

      <P>Despite the adverse economic circumstances, despite the fact of the two allegedly non-political organisations, the NFA and the anti-language movement, campaigning on their side, the result of those two by-elections was increased support for Fianna Fáil in Waterford, a clear indication that if this had been a general election, we would have increased our representation there by gaining two seats out of the three&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and there was an indication in South Kerry that at the next general election we would again retain our two seats out of three. These were the most satisfactory results conceivable for a Fianna Fáil Government. At that time we could have got no more favourable indication and no greater boost to our morale. We had Fine Gael consoling themselves with what they described as moral victories. If they can derive any consolation from this type of situation, they are welcome to it. These two by-elections were followed by by-elections in Cork and West Limerick, where again we had two outstanding victories for the Government. In both constituencies, the Coalition tactics were the same, a man from each section of the Coalition, an effort to ensure that the maximum possible vote would be pulled out in this way and transferred from one to another. I suppose the farming organisation had not so much effect in Cork city but the anti-language organisation which, of course, is a wing of the Fine Gael Party&mdash;although I see the Labour <Col N="2245" /> Party are now making a bid for their support&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but again without any success. What Fianna Fáil achieved in the Cork by-election was to get four seats out of five. It was a Coalition vacancy. Fianna Fáil already had three seats out of the five, the Taoiseach, the then Lord Mayor of Cork and Deputy Healy. The task of the Fianna Fáil workers in Cork was to convince the electorate that in a situation where Fianna Fáil already had three Deputies out of the five, there was some reason why the people should go out and support a fourth Fianna Fáil Deputy. We succeeded outstandingly in getting the people to do that. The result, I suppose, was looked upon as a foregone conclusion but the people came out and decided to give Fianna Fáil four out of the five seats in Cork, despite an all-out effort by the Coalition.</P>
      <P>The most amazing thing is that the Fine Gael Party actually have the effrontery to pretend that they can gain some consolation from a result such as the West Limerick by-election. If they can do that, there is no hope for them.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Commission I can understand why Senator FitzGerald should be trying to find some inconsistency on the part of some Fianna Fáil Senators having regard to the glaring inconsistencies we have heard from the members of Fine Gael, who were dead against a Commission when this was last discussed and who now want a Commission. I am not inconsistent in this regard. I was in favour of a Commission when this was discussed at the Committee on the Constitution, and I am in favour of a Commission now. A Commission has been provided under the terms of the Fourth Amendment and that Commission would have been included in both amendments if both amendments had been taken in the same Bill. However, one of the tactics that was introduced into this campaign by the Opposition Parties in an attempt to prevent these proposals going before the people was to say that both of these proposals should not be taken in the same Bill. As the Commission could not be put in both Bills&mdash;the Minister has legal advice that it cannot be put in both Bills&mdash;there was no alternative but to put it in one or other, and I fully support the view that it was more consistent and more logical to put the Commission in the second Bill than in this one.</P>
      <P>Consequently, I do not regard myself as being in any way inconsistent in relation to the Commission. I am for a Commission, and when both of these amendments have been passed by the people, there will be a Commission to deal with the setting up of the new constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to try to bring this debate back upon some kind of orderly lines and to bring it to a quick conclusion. It is quite clear that the Minister has not the slightest intention of having a debate here on this <Col N="2248" /> measure which would be in any way relevant. He has got an obsessional preoccupation with Fianna Fáil. That is his whole life, and all that he has said here this morning and all that he said last night was about how well Fianna Fáil had done, were doing and would do.</P>
      <P>In any kind of legislation one must have regard for contingencies and possibilities, and if the Minister has, as he pretends to have, all the respect he says he has for the wisdom of the people, then he will not presuppose that the people are going to do one thing rather than another. If he respects the wishes of the people, then the proper thing for him to do is so to frame each Bill that, if only one Bill is accepted, it will stand on its own feet and have in it all that is necessary to meet his wishes, as alleged, the views of the committee of both Houses that sat on the Constitution, and also the needs of the situation. That is not what the Minister wants to do, and Senator Ryan says it cannot be done. That is exactly the attitude that one always gets either from civil servants or from Ministers of State when they do not want to do something. They say it cannot be done; it would not be legal. Anything that the people of Ireland decide to do in a constitution amendment becomes the law and becomes legal. That is a simple fact that the Party across there cannot get into their heads. This is a sovereign people and if they decide in their Constitution to put ten Commissions in ten articles, that is the law because the people of Ireland wish it so.</P>

      <P>I find it very difficult not to put a label on something that I see requires a label. I want to call attention to the fact that Article 6 of the Constitution of 1937 says in relation to the people of Ireland:</P>
      <P>1. All powers of government, legislative, executive and judicial, derive, under God, from the people, whose right it is to designate the rulers of the State and, in final appeal, to decide all questions of national policy, according to the requirements of the common good.</P>
      <P>We are told in Article 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish nation hereby affirms its inalienable, indefeasible, and sovereign right to choose its own form of Government, to determine its relations with other nations, and to develop its life, political, economic <Col N="2250" /> and cultural, in accordance with its own genius and traditions.</P>

      <P>What I want to point out is that we are a sovereign people and that if we want to put two Commissions into Articles, we can do so if we think it is necessary and that it suits the situation. In the 1937 Constitution we adopted the device of putting in 13 Articles, Article 51 to 63, as transitory provisions. Then we provide in Article 52:</P>
      <P>This Article and the subsequent Articles shall be omitted from the Constitution after the date on which the first President shall have entered upon his Office.</P>
      <P>In 1968 we find the Constitution is down to Article 50. The Minister says that is the reason for not putting a Commission in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill. Of course it is a spurious and false assertion that it cannot be done. It can be done, and it has been done already. Therefore the amendment which we suggest is entirely feasible. We put the amendment down in this way to get the view of the Government upon it and to avoid controversy so far as possible. We used the words contained in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill. We concede that there are certain defects in it. We have not incorporated the transition provision and further matters that have been attended to. In these circumstances it is well worthwhile considering putting the provision in both Bills rather than in one Bill. The Government have conceded that it was right to have two Bills rather than one, and they might now concede that it is right to have a Commission in both Bills. Accordingly, with the leave of the House, I will withdraw the amendment, redraft it and put it down again on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Quigley alleges that I do not want to be relevant in this debate. I admit that I have had to deal with matters which were not relevant to the debate but I am quite satisfied that the record will show that all the irrelevant matters to which I have had to refer were introduced in the first place by members of the Opposition. I agree that there were quite a number of these and, in fact, I would say there were considerably more than there were in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley says provision for a Commission should be put in each Bill. The fact of the matter is, as Senator O'Quigley knows as well as I do, that this cannot be done. It would be ridiculous to have a provision for two separate Commissions in the Constitution. As Senator Yeats pointed out, the people could reject a Commission in one Bill and accept it in another. The difficulty would be to interpret whether they had decided for or against a Commission. The only way in which what Senator O'Quigley pretends to want could in fact be done, would be to have two completely separate referenda; in other words, to adopt the procedure of coming to the House, first of all, with the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, bringing it through the Dáil and through the Seanad and holding a referendum on it, and that having been done, to bring the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill through the Dáil and the Seanad with or without provision for a Commission, depending on the result of the first referendum on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, to conduct the separate operation of bringing the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill through the two Houses and the separate operation of having a referendum on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator O'Quigley says, we complied with the Opposition's demand for two separate questions. It is only now becoming apparent that what the Opposition wanted was that we should have two separate referenda at two different times. I appreciate the fact that their main desire and hope is to try to delay this matter for so long that it will be too near the next general <Col N="2252" /> election to actually implement it before then. I agree that if the procedure I have outlined were adopted, this would be quite likely to be one of the results. Apart from that, if the Opposition are really advocating this procedure, the question of the added cost which has been represented as being vital would be another thing that would arise.</P>

      <P>As Senator O'Quigley and every member of the Opposition knows, this proposal for the Commission had to be put into one Bill or the other when the proposal was subdivided into two separate proposals.  This was done at the request of the Opposition. Senator O'Quigley describes this as conceding that it was right to have two Bills rather than one. There is no such concession at all. We merely did it because, on this occasion, unlike 1959, the Opposition were so confused they could not understand it. They said they would be confused and that their voters would be confused. In order to try to do the impossible, in order to try to dispel the confusion in the mind of the Opposition, we agreed to separate a simple proposal for electoral reform into two separate proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The present proposal does not differ significantly from the proposal that was put to the people as one question in 1959. The only difference was that, in 1959, there was no actual limit specified to the amount of consideration that could be given to such practical considerations as the desirability of respecting county boundaries and taking account of the area, extent and accessibility of constituencies.  That was the only difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1959, the Opposition were able to understand these two proposals. They assumed that the people would be able to understand them all together. However, the calibre of the Opposition had apparently so deteriorated between 1959 and 1968 that, on this occasion, they were utterly confused. In order to try to dispel the confusion, if possible, <Col N="2253" /> in the Opposition's mind, we acceded to their request and introduced two separate Bills and put the people to the unnecessary complication of having to deal with two separate ballot papers. That was purely and simply to try to make the Opposition happy.</P>

      <P>The 1959 referendum proposal contained a specific provision authorising the commission to take account of such relevant factors as county boundaries and the extent and accessibility of constituencies even though, at that time, the actual need for this had not arisen because the High Court action had not yet been taken by Fine Gael. At the same time, the 1959 proposal clarified the position by making it clear that the commission was entitled to take these things into consideration. Subsequent to that, the Fine Gael action in the High Court established that, under the present Constitution, these things could not be taken into consideration. Obviously, then, what I say is right.</P>

      <P>Acceding to the Opposition's request or demand, or whatever you like to call it, to try to clarify this terribly complicated proposal for them inevitably involved a decision to put the commission into one Bill or the other. We decided to put it into the one which will involve the more fundamental change in the scheme of constituencies: that must be conceded. The Opposition did not ask for three separate proposals. If they had done so, we might have conceded that, too. We should like to give them every opportunity to be happy.</P>

However, the public are now strongly critical of his subsequent performance. Unless the Taoiseach can show that he is able to restrain some of his vociferous Ministers then Cork, Kerry and Waterford may take a different view in the next election. That was the main factor.

      <P>The National Farmers' Association behaved very properly as a vocational group. They advised their members that they had their own allegiances. The organisation did not tell them what to do or how to vote, despite the controversy going on at the time. It is wrong and a grave falsehood for the Minister to suggest that the NFA took part in these campaigns. The one time they were forced into political action was in the recent elections of the Beet Growers' Association&mdash;and that was not of their own choosing. The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries intervened in the most blatant manner in those elections. The NFA then stood firm and stood behind those proposals. The results were reflected in the fact that they won 58 out of 60 seats. The Minister might be thankful they continued to behave as a vocational group rather than to show the same determination behind a political Party: I do not think it would be right for them to do that. They should at all times <Col N="2256" /> judge political Parties by the way they behave towards vocational groups and farming organisations in particular. If they maintain that standard, unless there is that change of attitude in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, then obviously, in the next election, acting as a vocational group, they will not be helpful to the Government Party.</P>

      <P>On this question of a package proposal which the rugged Independent from Cork has now resurrected, I have pointed out that, in substance, the proposal was the same as the proposal in 1959, the only difference being that, on this occasion, we proposed a definite limit to the divergence that could be operated in order to take account of the same considerations that were included in the 1959 Bill. It is becoming clearer that the only purpose in all this operation is to delay. Now, on the Committee Stage in the Seanad, the suggestion is made that we should have three Bills instead of two. That suggestion has not been made before now. As I pointed out, we might have considered that when we did decide to give two Bills instead of one, which was all that was necessary.

      <P>I quite freely admit that this was not the actual objective&mdash;that the reason for the proposal was to accede to the demand from all sections of the House that there should be reasonable scope to avoid the anomaly and injustice of breaching county boundaries which had to occur on the last occasion in 1961 and would have to occur on such a much wider scale now, if this change is not made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2260" /> The Minister also said that Senators opposite wanted to insist that the county boundaries would be breached and that this was in accordance with a definite policy of theirs. The Minister, however, turned down our proposal in regard to the county boundaries, which, if he had accepted it, would have avoided cutting up Cork and Donegal and would have avoided touching Clare and Kerry, to give some examples. He also rejected our amendment that the system be based on the numbers of the electorate, with some additional tolerance for minimising the cutting of county boundaries. At one part the Minister claims that his objective is solely to avoid the anomalies and injustices of breaching county boundaries and said that the Bill is not designed to equate the rural with the urban vote, and in another passage he spoke in relation to Mayo and said that the present Government, and any Government approaching this matter, would approach it from the point of view of making the maximum utilisation reasonably possible of the population and the rural areas as a whole. If that were to be the approach, the Government would be unlikely to decide to waste, as it were, almost 9,500 of the population in Mayo and therefore looking at it from the practical point of view, it was likely, he said, that Mayo's boundaries would also be breached.</P>
    <P>So vital is it to give it its fair share of votes he would breach the boundaries unnecessarily for this purpose, although the purpose of the Bill was to avoid breaching county boundaries and not related to this question of parity. There is a flagrant contradiction in this, in the two themes the Minister has put before us. Despite all he said in regard to Mayo, he had the nerve to ask us, as I quoted before, to endorse the principle of one man, one vote of equal value. He told us how he intended to use the Bill, breaching the county boundaries to give Mayo more than its share, even on an electorate basis.</P>
    <P>Contradicting himself again, he told us that the only purpose was to equate the rural vote with the urban vote. He told us also that certainly there was no likelihood of an overall rural vote <Col N="2261" /> being more effective than an overall urban vote and that in general, it would do no more than make the average rural vote equally as effective as the average urban vote to elect a Deputy. The whole thing was designed to keep the county boundaries and not to equate the vote, and then he said that it was to equate the vote but to do no more than that, than to give the rural vote greater value at the expense of cutting up the county boundaries. As I said, there is a flagrant contradiction in the Minister's three themes running through the debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister accused me of having given sketchy information. I was not here at the time but he spoke at some length very personally about me, about my scribbling away on scraps of paper, running my hands through my hair and dashing in and out of the House, and he expressed himself as disappointed that, after all this physical activity, there was no corresponding mental product emerging in what I said, &ldquo;because&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;all he produced after all this was a bald and unsupported statement, which I will show is completely wrong, that these counties will be affected in this way.&rdquo; Later on he claimed:</P>
    <P>Unlike Senator FitzGerald...</P>
    <P>I have given the figures and figures are all that is relevant, according to Senator FitzGerald... I have shown that on this liberal interpretation of the Constitution, that practically every county in Ireland must have its boundaries breached. I think every single one, except... Wicklow, must be disrupted in some way.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the Second Stage, I confined myself as far as possible to reasonable generalities. I thought that discussion on the detail of constituencies would come best on the Schedule and, therefore, I confined myself to making a general statement which I propose now to support in the necessary detail. What I propose is an exercise similar to the one in relation to my election proposal, but in somewhat greater detail, because I will, on this occasion, put to the Minister the precise areas, the transfer of which would achieve the result I claim can be achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2262" /> The Minister has claimed that, if this change is not made, there will be a much worse breaching of county boundaries now than there was in 1961. He said:</P>
    <P>What happened in 1961 will be as nothing to what must happen now.</P>
    <P>Again, he said:</P>
    <P>...the anomaly and injustice of breaching county boundaries which had to occur on the last occasion in 1961 would have to occur on a much wider scale now, if this change is not made.</P>
    <P>I apologise for the English; it is not mine. He claimed that, if this Bill were not passed, the counties would be chopped up in a much more extensive way than in 1961.</P>
    <P>On the Second Stage, I examined the situation and I pointed out that there are seven counties, pieces of which would have to be detached and added to other counties, and, on my reckoning, a total of 15 counties would be affected directly by this process&mdash;in the case of seven, by having pieces detached, and in the eight others, by having pieces of counties added to them, or to another county with which they are associated in another constituency.  The Minister said there were 16: I could not find 16, but I accept his word. We are in the position now that seven counties have pieces detached and 16 are directly or indirectly affected; there is a total of 56,000 people in the areas that are detached, representing something like 1¾ per cent of the population.</P>
    <P>I am now going to put to the House a proposed redistribution which will be well within the limits of maximum and minimum population which the Minister has laid down, which will detach pieces from six, not seven, counties, which will affect no more counties than are affected in the present situation, that is, 16, and which will reduce to seven per cent the number of people in the total population who would have to be disturbed, so that only 1.15 per cent will find themselves detached and added to another county and only 25 square miles, or 1.6 per cent of the total area of the country, will be affected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2263" /> That represents then, not as the Minister said, a situation about which it could be said that what happened in 1961 will be as nothing to what must happen now, but a situation about which one could not say that it would have to occur on a much wider scale now than in 1961. It will represent, in fact, a situation better than the present situation. It will involve less disturbance, with one less county having a piece detached and 37 per cent fewer people having to be pushed around to vote in counties other than the counties in which they reside. That can be achieved within the present system of tolerance laid down and the Minister's statement and the Taoiseach's statement&mdash;the Taoiseach made the statement in the Dáil&mdash;that a much greater fractionalising of the country would be necessary are false and misleading. I am not surprised the Minister chanced his arm, because he must know these statements are untrue; I refuse to believe his civil servants are incapable of devising the simple solution that I worked out in a couple of hours&mdash;&mdash;</P>

While one expects from his Ministers statements that fall below a certain standard, one does not expect the Taoiseach to make similar statements, though there were two occasions on which he departed from that code, one on the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and this statement in the Dáil that the country would be fractionalised to a far greater extent in future if this Bill were not passed.</P>

      <P>I shall now go over the figures and I challenge the Minister to tell me if I am wrong. We are not here dealing with estimates. I <Col N="2264" /> do not have to make guesses, guesses which he, shamefacedly, had to admit were accurate for the purposes of the calculation. I am dealing here now with hard population figures&mdash;superintendent registrars districts and rural districts&mdash;and I shall show specifically which districts, if transferred, would achieve the result within the present system without any amendment, a situation in which only one per cent of the people inhabiting little more than 1½ per cent of this territory would find themselves voting in areas other than the counties in which they live.</P>
      <P>We have, first of all, Dublin with a population of 95,047. Its entitlement is to 39.7 seats. I propose, as in my other proposal on the electorate, to reduce this, within the tolerance permitted, to 38 seats, depriving Dublin of approximately two seats because, in the tolerance available, in so far as you have to make any choice, any bias forced by arithmetical calculation should be at the expense of Dublin and in favour of the rest of the country, particularly the West, a thesis we in Fine Gael have put forward constantly. Dublin will then have 4.2 per cent less seats than the five per cent tolerance limit would permit. Wicklow, with a population of 60,428, would have an entitlement of four seats: proposed, three seats, no tolerance required. Wexford, with a population of 83,437, would have an entitlement of 4.17 seats: proposed four seats, tolerance 4 per cent.</P>
      <P>Here, I must refer to a mysterious passage in the Minister's speech about which he would, perhaps, enlighten us when he is replying. He said:</P>
      <P>County Wexford does not absorb all this population&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Again, the phraseology is a bit obscure.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and still comply with the requirements of the Constitution either for four seats or three seats. Therefore County Wexford must continue to be butchered in this way.</P>
      <P>This I cannot follow:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Population 83,437, 4.17 seats, and tolerance four per cent. It is entitled <Col N="2265" /> to four seats and there is no need for any butchering in this case.</P>
    <P>The Minister must have nodded at that point because the figures simply do not correspond.</P>

The Minister has said that to eliminate that he would require a tolerance of 30 per cent. There is no objection in principle to this. What is there about Monaghan and Cavan that makes it undesirable there? Could it be the fact that in that area there are about 12,750 nonCatholics who have difficulty in electing a Deputy in two three-seat constituencies but could more readily elect one in a five-seat constituency? If that is not the reason would the Minister tell us what it is and why he is against a five-seat constituency in that area particularly?</P>

    <P>Laois-Offaly has a population of 96,312, an entitlement of 4.82, five seats, tolerance 3.8 per cent. Kerry as the Minister has told us at great length in <Col N="2269" /> his speech has a population of 112,785 and under the present tolerance arrangements it requires some addition in order to strengthen it to the point where it would be entitled to six seats and to remain two three-seat constituencies.  The Minister also made much of the fact that Kerry is surrounded by ranges of mountains. This reminds me of that remarkable speech in the Dáil which caused such hilarity back in 1959 when Mr. Lemass informed the disbelieving Deputies on all sides of the House that Donegal was divided by ranges of mountains with only two passes through these mountains, like the Alps. One wondered why tunnels were not constructed through these massive ranges.</P>
    <P>On that occasion I took out my atlas because I had a certain interest in political geography and I discovered that there were five or six routes from one side of Donegal to the other. Now we have Kerry surrounded by mountains. Now I travel in and out of Kerry by train and sometimes by car from Mallow and I would like to tell the Minister that there is a valley through which one can enter Kerry without having to clamber over rugged mountain-tops.  It is actually possible to get into Kerry by railway going in through a valley.</P>

The Minister may have better proposals. He seems to think in terms of adding something from the other side of the Healy Pass for some reason. I would suggest adding the districts of Knocknagree, Cullen, Doonasheen, Derragh, Caherbarnagh and Coomlogan.</P>

      <P>That would be an extra 4,116 which would give Kerry 116,901, entitlement 5.845, two three-seat constituencies, tolerance 2.6 per cent. This would mean subtracting 4,116 from Cork which would give you 335,587, entitlement 16.78, seats seven, tolerance 1.3 per cent to be divided and gerrymandered at the Minister's will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Limerick has a population of 137,357, entitlement 6.87 seats, two per cent tolerance required to give it seven seats, three and four as at present. Clare the Minister has told us is short. May I point out that both Clare and Kerry are counties which if our proposal had been accepted, would not have required the addition of other counties? In fact under our proposal which the Minister has rejected, these counties would have sufficient electorate to justify having this number of seats without having any bits added and the Minister has rejected our proposal on the electorate, and so these additions become necessary. Here I suggest&mdash;it is only a suggestion; there are various other things one could do &mdash;if one added the old Gort registrar's district, before it was reorganised in more recent times as in the 1935 map, that you added 3,100 population to Clare, a population giving 76,697, entitlement to 3.83 seats and 4.2 per cent tolerance required to bring it up to four seats. Roscommon-Leitrim involves the usual adjustments in this area, which Leitrim has suffered so often. It is necessary, first of all, to add from Galway. There are many solutions to this area, as the Minister has indicated. This is a solution. I must put some solution on record to show my good faith in suggesting the Minister has been misleading us in this matter. If one adds from Galway the areas of Ballinasloe, for example, adding the Ballinasloe-Laurencetown registrar's district and the Killure, Ahascragh and Taghboy district electoral division, this would bring the population of Roscommon-Leitrim up to the point where it would satisfy five seats, and where the loss of the strip of land about which the Minister made such a song and dance the other day linking Sligo and Donegal, involving a population <Col N="2271" /> of as many as 975 people, can be accepted without affecting the tolerance.  Therefore Roscommon-Leitrim losing the little strip of land at the top of the balance of 975 people and gaining 10,189 in the Galway-Ballinasloe region, the province&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister underrates my knowledge of geography. I would have thought that I showed a certain knowledge of Irish geography in this debate. This is precisely why one has to take a strip off the top of Leitrim with 975 people and to link the two. I am telling the Minister if he would listen. That gives Roscommon-Leitrim 96,014 population, entitlement to 4.8 and 4.1 per cent tolerance required to make it a five-seat constituency. In the case of Galway which had a population of 148,340, insufficient to justify it in having eight seats, the deductions from it have been so devised as not to reduce its entitlement below the seven seat figure. It is not entitled to eight anyway.  These are deductions in the direction of Clare and Roscommon, and perhaps even when they have been carried out, Galway is still entitled to the seven seats, which is all its population as a whole is entitled to in any event. These deductions reduced it to 135,051, entitlement to 6.75 seats and a 3.7 per cent tolerance, brings that up to seven giving a three- and four-seat constituency. Mayo has 115,547, an entitlement to 5.78 and 3.8 per cent tolerance, gives six seats in a two-three seat constituency. I have already quoted the Minister's remarkable statement about Mayo, that although Mayo is entitled in its present population to a two-three seat constituency, he proposes to breach the county boundary in order to get some extra seats into the area in some way, so little does he care for county boundaries which in the other part of his speech he told us was the only purpose of this Bill being brought before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sligo now has a population of 51,263, but add to that 75 from the Tullaghan and Gubbacreeny district <Col N="2272" /> electoral divisions of Leitrim and the Ballyshannon and Bundoran area, that is to say, the Ballyshannon registrar's district in Donegal with a population of 6,319 and it gives Sligo with passages forming Donegal, 58,557, entitlement to 2.53 seats and a 2.4 per cent tolerance gives three seats.</P>
    <P>Finally, Donegal is entitled, unfortunately, with its 108,549 population at the counting only to five seats anyway and this deduction does not alter that. It brings it to 102,240, entitlement to 5.11 and 2.2 per cent tolerance giving five seats.</P>
    <P>I know it is a waste of time trying to avoid misrepresentation from the other side of the House. I will repeat once again what I have done. I have produced a notional exercise to invalidate the Minister's and the Taoiseach's statements, that in this and future divisions, it would be necessary to divide up the country much more drastically than in 1961. This division may not be the best but it is a possible division which may achieve the results I have mentioned. I am not advocating it in particular. There may be better ways of doing it. The Minister's ingenuity no doubt will devise ways better for Fianna Fáil and, indeed, his Department's ingenuity will probably devise ways which will involve less inconvenience for the people concerned and involve perhaps less disturbance for the population than even I propose, but my proposal would involve disturbing only 1.15 per cent of the people of Ireland, detaching them from the counties in which they live and adding them to other counties, that is, 1.15 per cent of the people living in 1.16 per cent of the area of this country, that is, 425 square miles.</P>
    <P>That is the terrible crime that is brought upon us, the terrible injustice, the uprooting of people forced on us as if this were the question of Poland taking up East Germany after the war. This is the terrible injustice of uprooting forced on us by this evil constitutional decision which was invented a Fine Gael plot&mdash;one per cent of the people of the country voting in a county different from the county in which they live, a disturbance far less <Col N="2273" /> than credited. It involves 56,000 people who are disturbed at the moment by the present arrangement, whereas in my amendment only 33,000 would be disturbed. In fact, this is a very minor problem. It is a problem which with an intelligent approach, not bedevilled by the desire to gerrymander, would cause less disturbance than at present.</P>
    <P>I suspect that the degree of disturbance in 1961 involved almost two per cent of the people of the country being disturbed&mdash;it involved only 1.7 or 1.8 &mdash;and this was due to the fact that the Minister was not prepared to take the solutions involving least disturbance but in fact adopted other solutions at the margins in order to get a better political result. I have shown that regardless of the political results&mdash; whether it is Deputy Tully or Deputy anybody else from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour; I have not examined that aspect of the thing, but have simply looked for the solution which involves least disturbance for the least number of people in the least area of the country&mdash;this can be achieved in fact with less disturbance than in 1961.</P>
    <P>If there is any more disturbance than this involved, it is because the Minister would be trying to gerrymander the country and to disturb more people than is necessary to get a political result.  I shall examine with great interest the results of the redistribution that will follow the defeat in this referendum.  If in fact the number of people disturbed exceeds 1.15 per cent, I should have no hesitation in pinning this on the Minister, this unnecessary disturbance, as a result of his desire to achieve a political result. I think I have made the point adequately and conclusively.  If there is anything wrong with my figures, the Minister can say so, but I do not think there is, I have put all my cards on the table. I have accepted that this may be used in misrepresentation against me. I accept that the Minister will be trotting down to Carrick-on-Suir and Knocknagree and Cullen and Roundstone and Ahascragh and all these places, telling the people that I and Fine Gael wanted them particularly shifted to another constituency. I said nothing of the kind.</P>
    <P>I have said that under the present <Col N="2274" /> system this is a solution, one that involves a minimum disturbance. It may not be the best solution. I do not particularly advocate it but I put it before the House to show that this House and the other House have been deliberately misled by the Minister, and more so by the Taoiseach, in attempting to pretend that if the present system persists, it would be necessary to chop up this country in a manner much more extensive than anything done in 1961 or in the past. On that I can rest and I look forward very much indeed to hearing the Minister's reply.</P>

      <P>The case Senator Garret FitzGerald has made shows that it would be quite easy for the Minister to reorganise the constituencies without much disturbance. He has mentioned that the plan, or scheme, he has submitted for the Minister's consideration will disturb only 1.1 per cent. Some Senators seem to think they would gain great political advantage out of these proposals, particularly the suggestion that Carrick-on-Suir should be moved into another area in order to bring up the representation to a fair figure but it only involves 1.1 per cent of the people, and of course there is nothing in that for Fianna Fáil because even if all the people who would be disturbed by Senator Garret FitzGerald's proposal voted for Fianna Fáil it would only represent an increase of 1.1 of the percentage of the electorate.  That would not help Fianna Fáil much. Considering they have lost 9 per cent of the electorate since 1965, 1.1 per cent will not give any help to them at all. It is obvious the Minister would not accept this arrangement because 1.1 per cent would be no help to the Fianna Fáil Party at this stage. He must look rather to doing some constituency butchering, which he has mentioned, in order to get some benefit for the Fianna Fáil Party. I think it was Senator Ryan who mentioned, in fact, that gerrymandering is possible only in Cork and Dublin and that it is not really possible in the rural constituencies where people are less objective when considering policies and candidates for which they might vote. Apparently there is nothing in it for Fianna Fáil as far as the rural areas are concerned.</P>

Ballyfermot now is lost to the Minister as far as support for Fianna Fáil is concerned.  He would be very glad on this occasion to get rid of Ballyfermot as far as any constituency he may be representing is concerned.

Obviously that is a ridiculous tolerance and it is designed only to give a good, comprehensive margin for Fianna Fáil gerrymandering and the organisation of areas for the benefit of the Fianna Fáil Party. Senator Garret FitzGerald has given his example of the manner in which this country and this State at the moment could be divided up into constituencies giving an equal representation to the people as required by the Constitution which requires representation on a population basis rather than based on the electorate.</P>

I hope this does not mean I am going to have to deal with this again and actually demonstrate how it is so. Even Senator FitzGerald should agree that the divergence it is proposed to insert into the Constitution through this Bill is a maximum divergence which can only be operated in particular circumstances.  It must be quite clear then there will only be a minority of rural constituencies in which the divergence from the national average, in order to take account of such things as county boundaries, will approach this maximum of one-sixth.</P>
      <P>It must also be obvious that in view of the requirement to pay the maximum possible regard to county boundaries there will also be some constituencies in which the number of population per Deputy will approach the national average and others in which, possibly, it will be over the national average. It must be clear, then, that the overall divergence from the national average in rural areas will be considerably less than the maximum of one-sixth, which is 16? per cent.</P>

      <P>With the deliberate purpose of saying something he knew to be false, Senator FitzGerald said that I had indicated I intended to use this <Col N="2283" /> Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill in order to do what the Bill provides cannot be done. Of course, Senator FitzGerald knows that even if I did do that it could be challenged in the courts and shown to be unconstitutional.  What I pointed out was that under the present system certain areas in the rural part of the country would have to unjustifiably lose representation and that if the present system was not changed, this representation which is not justified would be allocated to urban areas as against rural areas. I said that in those circumstances if the change we propose is not made&mdash;not if the change we propose is made&mdash; this Government would certainly try to minimise the number of representatives who would be taken from the rural areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pointing out that when I was speaking about what would happen in regard to County Mayo on the Second Stage, I was referring to what must happen if present circumstances continued in which such things as county boundaries&mdash;which the Opposition are so determined to retain &mdash;are irrelevant, circumstances in which representation is to be based closely on the actual population as disclosed in the latest edition of the census and in which county boundaries would not be a relevant consideration and, of course, neither will voters. I said that in these circumstances this Government would obviously be inclined to minimise the loss of overall representation which this requirement would involve for rural Ireland in general and that this operation would inevitably involve the breaching of county boundaries and that the boundary of County Mayo would be so involved but that this would be done under the circumstances in order that the maximum possible utilisation of the population in the rural areas would be ensured so as to avoid the unjust reduction of representation in those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out that under the present constitutional requirements the Dublin <Col N="2284" /> area must get an increase of at least four seats, from the present 34 to 38, although an increase of only two is required by the actual number of voters and that the western area comprising Donegal, the province of Connacht and Clare must get a reduction on the present representation of 33 Deputies to 30, although a reduction of only one from 33 to 32 would be required by the actual number of voters in the area. Senator FitzGerald's approach as he disclosed here today would be further to downgrade the value of rural votes by allotting only 29 seats to the western area of Donegal, province of Connacht and Clare instead of the minimum of 30 to which it would be entitled even under present circumstances. You will get a different solution to the problem if your approach is on the basis on which Senator FitzGerald approached it. What I indicated was that our approach would be to minimise this unjust reduction in rural representation.  I am not in the least surprised that the Fine Gael approach should be the opposite as demonstrated by Senator FitzGerald, that is, to maximise the reduction in representation.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear&mdash;and on the Second Reading I made it clear&mdash;that it was under the present circumstances that boundaries have to be breached and that what I was doing when I went through the constituencies was showing what must happen if this Bill, the Third Amendment Bill, is not passed. I must say that I am grateful to Senator FitzGerald for his suggestions and his indications of the manner in which he would propose to deal with the situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The manner in which the Minister might approach it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If he has his way and the Third Amendment Bill is not accepted by the people, these will prove most useful. But we are proposing that in future the Constitution should require that so far as possible county boundaries shall not be breached. The Opposition are determined to retain the present position in which the ruling of the courts is that county boundaries <Col N="2285" /> are not relevant. It is natural that I should say that having a greater approximation to equality of votes as between the rural part of the country in general and the urban part in general is inherent in this Bill. This is the position and I showed it to be so.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald says that I have accepted that combinations of two counties are an acceptable manner of forming constituencies. Of course I have not accepted any such thing; what I have said is that combinations of two counties have been inevitable since the State was set up and since this ridiculous system of multi-member constituencies was first foisted on the country on the principle, as Fine Gael speakers have pointed out on a number of occasions, of trying it out on the dog. It has been inevitable but I have never said that it was desirable or acceptable to have these combinations of counties.</P>
      <P>For instance, I do not, any more than Deputy Oliver Flanagan, consider the present combination of the two large counties of Laois and Offaly to be desirable. I can quite see the difficulty of a Deputy representing these two very large areas and I can see how defective representation is from the point of view of the people, and I can even understand how undesirable Deputy Flanagan considers the situation in which he has to collect votes all over those two large counties in order to bring in Deputy O'Higgins on his back. However, that is a consideration applying more to Deputy Flanagan and probably has something to do with the reason why he supports our proposals.</P>
      <P>All I want to say is that although I agree that the joining of Laois and Offaly was inevitably required by the present electoral system for as long as I can remember, and possibly since the foundation of the State, I do not agree that it is an acceptable or a desirable solution and I am perfectly certain that the people of the two counties involved do not consider it desirable either and that they would consider this joining together of these two counties to be ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies in regard to Carlow-Kilkenny <Col N="2286" /> or Longford-Westmeath and certainly to portion of a county like Wexford being stuck on to the constituency that already comprises the two counties of Carlow and Kilkenny. But, of course, Senator FitzGerald does not see anything undesirable or objectionable in this. In his approach, he would detach Carlow from Kilkenny and add it on to Kildare where, of course, the junction between these two counties will provide only a narrow corridor as distinct from the comparatively extensive border that there is between Carlow and Kilkenny. It was in that context that I referred to the proposed joining of the counties of Monaghan and Cavan as not being a desirable solution of the problem there, even though the Fine Gael spokesman on this matter, Deputy Fitzpatrick, would welcome this because, as he said in the Dáil, it would suit him personally down to the ground.</P>
    <P>It was typical of Senator FitzGerald's approach that he should allege that it was because of the fact that there was a certain non-Catholic community in both Cavan and Monaghan that I considered it undesirable that these two counties should be united. He knows that it was not in that context I was speaking at all. I was speaking in the context of the unworkability of very large constituencies and the practical impossibility of the Deputies giving the people the service they required under these circumstances.</P>
    <P>I repeat now that it would not be a desirable thing and certainly not an improvement of the present situation to join the two counties of Cavan and Monaghan together in the one constituency.  The result of it would be that the people would get bad service from their Deputies, even worse than at present when constituencies are larger than is appropriate. In present circumstances that is one of the things that happen, that the people get a raw deal in so far as representation by their Deputies is concerned.</P>
    <P>Since Senator FitzGerald is concerned only with figures, he proposes with equanimity that, instead of the present position in which there are two comparatively large constituencies, constituencies difficult to travel round, <Col N="2287" /> in Donegal, the whole of Donegal should become one five-seat constituency, that Cavan and Monaghan should be joined together, and to form a new constituency consisting of the counties of Sligo and parts of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>He did, but when I gave him a slight lesson in elementary geography he mended his hand here today and suggested that instead we should have a constituency composed of County Sligo, part of the county of Leitrim and part of the county of Donegal. Of course, these things are quite acceptable and reasonable to a person like Senator FitzGerald who deals with figures and figures only but forgets that the figures represent human beings and that those human beings have to be represented by other human beings in the form of Deputies, and that the work at election time has to be done by other human beings who are members of these political party organisations.</P>
      <P>These things are irrelevant, according to Senator FitzGerald. All you need is the figures. When I was speaking about this in the Dáil I said all you needed in present circumstances was the figures and a map, but Senator FitzGerald does not even need a map and he is quite prepared to build up constituencies without even taking the care to see that the areas which he proposes to utilise to make up the required population in some constituencies are contiguous to the county to which he proposes to attach them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my reply on the Second Stage here, I dealt with each individual constituency. I put on the record of the House the actual figures for these areas. Dealing with each separately, I showed beyond any shadow of doubt that practically every county in the country must be breached in one way or the other unless the amendment being proposed is accepted by the people, must be breached either by the detachment from it of some of its population and <Col N="2288" /> its transference to some other county or be breached by the attachment to it of population from some other county. These figures are already on the record of the Seanad, and although I appreciate that Senator FitzGerald's main concern is to try to delay the passage of the Bill, I do not propose to repeat them. I do not think it is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not, of course, got the actual figures Senator FitzGerald gave here today, but I did count the number of counties that would be affected, and they number 20. His approach was to try to apply the principle of the non-breaching of county boundaries which is in the Bill to the present constitutional situation, although he is bitterly opposing the amendment of the Constitution which we are proposing so as to permit these things to be taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald was quick to see that a revision under the present interpretation of the Constitution, but also endeavouring to do what the High Court says is not relevant, to avoid county boundaries, would result in a further injustice to his pet aversion, that is, the western area of this country, Donegal, the province of Connacht and the county of Clare. He was quick to see that this would result in a reduction of the representation of that area from 33 to 29 as against 33 to 30 which is all that is inevitable in present circumstances, and as against the reduction from 33 to 32 which is all that would be required on the basis of voters and the present assumed permitted divergence from the national average of 5 per cent. It is of course indicative of the whole approach of his Party. When I describe it as &ldquo;his Party&rdquo;, I am merely using his own phraseology. Apparently he has assumed some proprietorial rights over the Fine Gael Party. I detected the same attitude in the lower House when on a number of occasions Deputy Fitzpatrick, ex-Senator Fitzpatrick, indicated that he would leave some matters to be dealt with by the experts in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2289" /> This is an indication of the Fine Gael Party's whole approach. It is obviously part of the effort that has been decided upon under, I believe, the influence of Senator FitzGerald, to practically eliminate the rural community by rearrangement of the land of Ireland on the basis of farms supporting a minimum of 400 cows each. Apparently the first step is to be a further downgrading of the value of the rural vote. Senator FitzGerald, on the basis of figures, and without any consideration for the needs or the desires of the people, put forward something which anyone could see was completely impracticable in regard to the revision or delineation of the constituencies.</P>

      <P>I would welcome him in County Dublin any time he likes to come.  Apparently Senator Rooney is still brooding over the fact that in this thrilling struggle for the last seat in County Dublin, Deputy Clinton emerged the victor. The revision of the constituencies which took place in 1961 was, of course, called for because of the decision of the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Senator Rooney would cast his mind back&mdash;if he is able to think back further than 1961&mdash;he would remember that the 1959 revision of the constituencies which his Party succeeded in having declared to be unconstitutional did in fact take the Ballyfermot area out of the constituency of County Dublin and in the rearrangement that was required by the High Court decision <Col N="2291" /> it was apparently found necessary to put Ballyfermot back into County Dublin. Apparently Senator Rooney alleges that not only was my predecessor, Deputy Blaney, so unscrupulous as to gerrymander that area in the interests of the Fianna Fáil Party, but that he also conspired with Deputy Clinton to gerrymander Senator Rooney out of the seat. He went on to imply that the area of Ballyfermot had been lost to Fianna Fáil. He based that on the local elections but Senator Rooney might like to be informed, since he does not appear to know, that neither myself, nor my gracious senior colleague, nor Deputy Foley, contested the local elections. The story will be completely different when we do.</P>
    <P>Senator Rooney went on to ask if I could put forward a better scheme of constituencies than Senator FitzGerald. Of course if I could not do that I would resign, but I can do it, and I will, or the Commission will put forward a much better scheme of constituencies.</P>

      <P>From 1959 or 1961 down to 1968, at no time has the Minister or any of his colleagues in the Government or any of the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party, or county councils, urban councils or any cumainn of Fianna Fáil or cumainn of Fine Gael, or anything else, complained about the 1961 constituencies.

      <P>There has been no indication from any Minister of the Government Party at any time that it was proposed, in the long years from 1961 to 1967, when they established this Constituency Commission, to review the whole of the Constitution. There was not an indication in the world that the people of these areas were suffering from what the Minister talks about, a gross and serious injustice.  One would imagine that the presence of a Deputy in a particular area meant that the people, from then on, were happy. Because people had been transferred from one administrative county or joined up from a particular administrative county with another administrative county to form a constituency, one would not imagine they all went around with a sense of gievance wondering when the day of deliverance would come when they would be delivered from the serious and permanent injustice under which they were labouring. Our people are not as mad as that. They do not suffer from that sort of neurotic view of life and politics, as does the Minister. They do not value all that highly their Teachtaí Dála, from whatever Party they come, that they feel they are suffering from a serious injustice. It is just plain nonsense to describe it as an injustice.</P>
      <P>The Minister says Senator Rooney, or some of us, cannot go back beyond 1961. Were there great and widespread complaints about the serious injustice that was done in 1935 when county after county was butchered, not because of a decision of the Supreme Court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not know that it mattered a fiddle-de-dee to the people of these constituencies from 1935 to 1947. Two years after that, this operation&mdash;and it was a surgical operation&mdash;took place. We had a new Constitution. Fianna Fáil soldiered with these constituencies, cut up in the way in which they were, for a further ten years until 1947. They did not bother even with the provisions of the 1937 Constitution, and their then understanding of what those provisions meant, until the High Court declared what they were, what their understanding of what those provisions meant. They left those constituencies from 1937 to 1947 and then they made another change.</P>
      <P>What all that adds up to is that, when the Minister and his Party say that an injustice is being done to people because they are taken from their particular county and joined on to another county, they do not mean a word of it, not a single word of it. In any event, there is no truth whatever in it. The people of these counties and constituencies are not as neurotic as the Minister fancies them to be.</P>

    <P>The Minister then insists upon the <Col N="2295" /> half-truth. He insists upon parading that and on continuing to parade it well knowing&mdash;being the expert propagandist that he is&mdash;that the half-truth and the half-lie always stick and that it is very difficult to drag down the half-truth. He refers to the case taken by Dr. John O'Donovan on the Constitution in 1961 as being a case that was taken by the Fine Gael Party. That case was not taken by the Fine Gael Party or with any funds supplied by the Fine Gael Party. The costs of that action were borne entirely by Dr. John O'Donovan. Anybody who wants to ascertain whether or not that is so can find out from him. I know it to be so. Being a junior counsel in that case, I was paid my fees by Dr. John O'Donovan. Not one halfpenny was paid by the Fine Gael Party for the prosecution of that case. The Minister will still continue to say, in spite of my clear declaration as to what happened, that that case was brought by the Fine Gael Party&mdash;I do not say that, if they had wanted to bring it, they were not justified in doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>At least I have clarified one matter in relation to the origins of the challenging of the 1959 Act. It is wrong to say, as the Minister said here today, repeatedly, and no doubt will continue to repeat, that the courts have decided that no regard should be taken of administrative counties or anything of that kind. The High Court did not say that; the Supreme Court did not say it. What the Supreme Court did say, when the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1961, was referred to it, was that all of these matters were matters to be taken into consideration by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Let me quote now from page 183 of the <i>Irish Law Reports,</i> 1961:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sub-clause recognises that exact parity in the ratio between members and the population of each constituency is unlikely to be obtained and is not required. The decision as to what is practicable is within the jurisdiction of the <Col N="2297" /> Oireachtas. It may reasonably take into consideration a variety of factors, such as the desirability so far as possible to adhere to well-known boundaries such as those of counties, townlands and electoral divisions.</P>
    <P>What the Minister says is in flagrant contradiction of what is contained in the <i>Irish Reports</i> in regard to the decision of the Supreme Court, that the country boundaries cannot be breached. Of course they have said these things can be taken into consideration and also indicated that a certain deviation from strict parity is possible. The deviation under the 1961 Act was of the order of five per cent of the national average and they said this was permissible, and perhaps if it had been eight per cent or nine or ten per cent, they could well have said that that was permissible too.</P>
    <P>As I say, this Bill is produced on the basis that the people living in different constituencies have nothing better to do than to spend their time running to Deputies every day and that there is something wrong or unjust being done to a person who lives in a county other than that in which the Deputy resides, or if a person is attached to a county which forms the bulk of a particular constituency. I have never known that this gave rise to any difficulty. Of course there will be people who will complain, but in the long run what the people are concerned with is not whether their constituency falls between county boundaries or whether it is a one-seat or four-seat constituency, but with economic and social conditions, with educational and health services. They are not concerned with how accessible a Deputy is to them.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to say that the people look upon their Deputies as aids to getting the kind of things to which by law they are entitled. The people want their Deputies, and in particular their Ministers, to devote their attention to the wellbeing of the community. They hope that in the general development of economic conditions every county and every part of every county will get its fair share of the prosperity. If a Deputy happens to belong to another county they have not got any neurotic ideas that they are going to suffer some <Col N="2298" /> injustice until the next revision of constituencies takes place.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary fact that with all the talk that is going on, that even as matters stand there are upwards of a dozen towns that straddle two counties and I am satisfied that the people in these towns have no difficulty remaining in contact with their Deputies. I am sure the Minister will not be able to give any instance of people who have written from any of these towns saying that their town is divided into two parts, one lying in one county and the other lying in another.</P>
    <P>We will start off with Athlone, part of which is in Roscommon, the other part being in Westmeath. It is what the latest census regards as a town. Then we come to the next town, Charlestown&mdash;what was it they said? &ldquo;No one shouted stop&rdquo;&mdash;part of which lies in Mayo and then across the railway bridge, part of it is in Sligo. It is represented by two sets of Deputies, Deputies from Mayo and Deputies from Sligo-Leitrim. I have not had the advantage of reading &ldquo;No One Shouted Stop,&rdquo; or whatever the series of articles was called, to know whether that was one of the reasons decay set in in Charlestown. The next town is Dowra on the borders of Leitrim and Cavan. It is divided between two counties and these people continue to labour, according to the Minister, under this great injustice.</P>

      <P>Portarlington is divided between Counties Laois and Offaly and is also within the one constituency. <Col N="2299" />  Bunclody is divided between Wexford and Carlow and O'Brien's Bridge at Montpelier, between Limerick county and Clare. Clonmel is divided between Tipperary and Waterford and Bray, according to the last census, is divided between Dublin and County Wicklow. Finea straddles Cavan and Westmeath and Roosky straddles Leitrim and Roscommon. Birr straddles Offaly and Tipperary and Graiguenamanagh straddles Carlow and Kilkenny. Lanesboro, an expanding town, straddles Longford and Roscommon.</P>
      <P>That is the way history and geography and the administration of the counties have ordained how these towns will be located in regard to their electoral location. Some of the towns are big; some of them are small. They are divided between two counties and I have yet to hear that that is a disadvantage, or to hear that these people suffer from any sense of grievance or injustice. One would imagine from the Minister's description of what has happened to date that these people were labouring under a sense of injustice. Let him apply the test in the case of these towns. No doubt the Minister will go through all of these points and we will have to listen to him from now until 5 o'clock&mdash;that is what is in store for us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The point I want to make is that we had this Solicitors Bill and we took every precaution to make sure that it complied with the written Constitution. Subsequently some solicitor misconducted himself. He was not actually struck off the register, but he appealed to the Supreme Court. Two judges took one view and two took another, and one of them found it hard to make up his mind, and we were then told that it <Col N="2303" /> was not constitutional to deal with a solicitor who had misbehaved himself. But the medical profession can do that and it is, apparently, quite constitutional.  That is utter rubbish. I am sorry the Government have not done the right thing and done away altogether with a written Constitution. Let us have one or two principles and no more. So long as we have this written Constitution, we will have the lawyers fattening on it. That is all I have to say. I hope everybody understood. If the written Constitution is done away with, we will get somewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Some points raised by Senator O'Quigley were, I suspect, merely raised for the purpose of delay. At the same time, I think I should deal with the points. He said that at no time since 1961 was there any complaint about what had happened in the 1961 revision of constituencies. He admits, apparently, that there were complaints in 1961. Senator O'Quigley must not make many visits to branches of his own Party's organisation in other parts of the country because, if he did, he would know that the uprooting of parts of the population from one county and their transference into another is still, in fact, resented in these areas. I admit that the complaints about what happened in 1961 are not so virulent now as they were in 1961, when this injustice was perpetrated on the people, and that is because the situation has now, of course, been established. Two general elections have been held on the basis of those grotesque constituencies and the position is now more or less accepted. But complaints were made from all sides of the House in 1961 and there were demands from both the Opposition Parties for an amendment of the Constitution, an amendment which could have been only on the lines we are proposing here. Once the situation was established and Deputies elected under the 1961 revision&mdash;presumably the Party organisations were adjusted to the new <Col N="2304" /> situation&mdash;we did not concede these demands. We did not comply with them and we did not move as we were requested for an amendment of the Constitution but the position is that now a further revision of constituencies is required by the position disclosed by the census figures of 1966 and that a demand has been made by members of the Opposition Parties for this revision to be carried out now. The Constitution says that this proportion of population per Deputy shall be the same as far as it is practicable at any time and if it is not the same now, we interpret that as indicating that a revision of constituencies is required now. It is quite clear that this would involve a further breaching of county boundaries, a further butchering or dismembering of constituencies, a further disfranchisement of large sections of the population in different parts of the country and obviously a further outcry against this ridiculous requirement.  What is annoying the Opposition is that we did not go ahead and do this and give them the opportunity of moaning and groaning about it as they did in 1961. What annoys them is that we are complying with the demands made in 1961.</P>
      <P>With regard to the suggestion that the 1935 revision of constituencies did not cause any complaints, of course that again is absolutely wrong. It did cause considerable resentment in the places where this type of thing happened in 1935. Of course, it did and not alone that, but the resentment still exists to the present day.</P>

It has not happened there since but it has had to happen in other places and obviously would have to happen all over the country if a revision is made now. With regard to the statement by Senator O'Quigley, who was one of those involved in the action which required this to be done in 1961, that the action was not taken by the Fine Gael Party well if he says <Col N="2305" /> that I suppose we must accept it as true, that it is a pure coincidence that the person taking the action was a Senator of the Fine Gael Party, the solicitor was a Deputy of the Fine Gael Party, the junior counsel was a Senator of the Fine Gael Party and his senior counsel was a Deputy of the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <P>We know members of the Fine Gael Party who specialise in getting money out of the State on this kind of thing.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley went on to say that the High Court did not say that county boundaries could not be taken into account. I admit I would find it rather difficult to interpret what the High Court said in that judgment. I cannot say why they did not say it in so many words, lay down and specify what the position was. Instead of that, Budd J. took quite a number of pages of the <i>Irish Reports</i> in which to convey his decision. I can only take the advice tendered to me as to what the decision is. We have tried to interpret it because we have a practical job to do, to revise constituencies. We have interpreted it as indicating that these things are not relevant considerations but that a maximum divergence of about five per cent can be allowed. In fact eminent lawyers in the Fine Gael Party have not been able to agree as to exactly what is said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley says here today that the High Court did not rule that county boundaries were irrelevant. Surely that means, in other words, that these things can be taken into account in delineating constituencies but the solicitor who instructed Senator O'Quigley in that famous case, Deputy Ryan&mdash;I believe &ldquo;instructed&rdquo; is the word&mdash;has a completely different view <Col N="2306" /> to Senator O'Quigley? On 28th May, 1968, volume 235, No. 1 of the Official Report, columns 42-43, Deputy Ryan said after I had interjected &ldquo;That was because the court permitted the five per cent divergence&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>The court allowed no such thing, and typical of the utterly false propaganda being advanced in support of this despicable proposal is the one that the courts have allowed a 5 per cent divergence. The courts have allowed no divergence from equality in so far as equality is practicable. The courts have said, because our Constitution says and because the people of Ireland said, equality should operate in the ratio between population and Deputy as far as it was practicable. In relation to the 1961 revision equality as far as it was practicable was operated. The courts have not said that a 5 per cent divergence is permissible. That is not what the courts said. That is not what the Constitution says. That is not what the law at the moment says and that is why I queried last week the ruling out of order of an amendment when the reason for ruling it out of order was supposed to be that the law at the moment allowed a 5 per cent divergence. The law allows no divergence whatsoever.  It says it shall be equal as far as practicable.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, the position is quite clear from the <i>Irish Reports</i> and that is that such things as county boundaries may not be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I quote from page 146 of the <i>Irish Law Reports,</i> 1961:</P>
    <P>Here let me observe straight away that although a system in the main based on counties has in fact been adopted, there is nothing in the Constitution about constituencies being based on counties. The Constitution does not say that in forming the constituencies according to the required ratio, that shall be done so far as is practicable having regard to county boundaries. Even if it did, the Oireachtas or the appropriate Minister could alter county boundaries.  No doubt it is convenient in many ways to use the existing <Col N="2307" /> administrative machinery: and there is nothing objectionable in a certain degree of adherence to the county basis of division provided that the dictates of the Constitution are observed.</P>
    <P>Further down on the same page:</P>
    <P>No doubt the Oireachtas would have to proceed on the basis of having regard to the areas for which census figures are available, but that is about the only limiting factor.</P>
    <P>The only limiting factor is the amount of detail in which population figures are available in the census. I shall leave Senator O'Quigley and the other lawyer members of the Fine Gael Party to try to hammer this out between themselves because they have different views about it.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Quigley says now that county boundaries may be taken into consideration. Other Deputies and Senators have said that they may not. I agree that there are certain cases of towns and villages straddling two counties as Senator O'Quigley has discovered. There are of course some cases in which a small part of one county could be added to another less objectionably than in other circumstances but unfortunately it is not always in these places that the constitutional need arises for these adjustments to be made and it is not always the case either that that would be a sufficient adjustment to make to comply with the requirements of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite obvious from Senator O'Quigley's remarks that he, just as his colleague, would like the debate to be conducted on the basis of one side only. He said that no matter what I say he will not be convinced. I can assure him that I would not attempt for one moment to try to convince him or anybody else on the opposite side of the House. I appreciate that they have a closed mind on this matter, that their minds are made up and that this being a proposition put forward by <Col N="2308" /> Fianna Fáil, therefore, their duty is to oppose it. I agree with that but I am quite certain that the people will be convinced with the assistance of the fact that the Leader of the Fine Gael Party and the minority of his Party who have some confidence in the future of that Party are in favour of these proposals.</P>

      <P>Very briefly on the Schedule, I rise to compliment Senator FitzGerald on the very excellent case he has made, and the excellent way in which he documented it. The figures are there and the inevitable conclusions to be drawn from them are drawn. This is only what you would expect from Senator FitzGerald and, indeed, it is only two weeks since the most senior member in the Government, next to the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, paid a very special compliment to Senator FitzGerald on the very careful analysis he had made of the Second Programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied from the figures given that at most the breaching of six counties was all that was required and, indeed, that would restore much of what has been done up to this. In point of fact, the Minister deludes himself if he thinks the people down the country look upon these politicians as tin gods and that the whole welfare of the country is bound up with whether they have a TD or not. The Minister is not reading the signs right and from the way the Minister and his Party are rushing this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the public realise what is going on. The recent salary proposals have also contributed heavily to this. The case made by the Minister that he realises after 36 years that county boundaries can now be regarded as sacred is a very belated conversion and one that will not carry weight down the country because what is needed is a more efficient Government, more efficiency from the top so <Col N="2309" /> that the public can see that the Government are actually doing the job.</P>
      <P>No person in his sane senses would trust the present Minister or any Minister with the discretionary powers that are asked for in this, being capable of bearing a tolerance from &mdash;?th to +?th so that 16,600 votes in one area can be equal to 23,300 in another or that three votes in one area can reckon as two in another. We would be prepared to give whatever tolerance was necessary provided we saw that would be carried out by an impartial body and provided there was provision in the present Bill for a Commission. That is given only in a package deal in connection with the Fourth Amendment where it is pretty well certain to be defeated.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made no provision for any such Commission in conjunction with a system that would prevail after the referendum, where we will have the constituencies we have today and where the Minister seems to foreshadow some more Blackrocks being shifted from the parent region like Cork city, a totally unnecessary transfer especially when you see horns pushed out into the Cork constituency on the other end as far as Blarney and away up to the north end. That does not inspire confidence in giving discretionary powers and I would not be a party to giving these discretionary powers.</P>
      <P>If the Minister has a case there is a duty on Telefís Éireann to enable this question to be resolved before the viewers. Let Senator FitzGerald's figures be shown. They cannot be contradicted because Senator FitzGerald would defy any panel to go on Telefís Éireann and take his figures one by one and examine them and their validity. Therefore, the new bogey raised about this breaching of county boundaries is shown to be totally absurd and unreal. The people will see it for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister wishes to submit it to an impartial inquiry, why not submit Senator FitzGerald's figures and his own figures to people whose profession it is to analyse such&mdash;in other words, to professors of political science. They are capable of analysing the figures of Senator FitzGerald and the Minister <Col N="2310" /> and giving the public the benefit of their impartial and considered judgment of these figures. I challenge the Minister to take that course because the public will have far greater reliance on figures produced by those distinguished and respected professors than they will have for figures handed out by the Minister. Let him take up that challenge and as a representative of the graduates of the university amongst whom we reckon the Minister, I challenge him to be a university graduate. Let the truth prevail and let him face a panel on TV against Senator FitzGerald and let the viewers see where the truth is and let Professors Chubb and Thorney play a part in the analysis. Until that is done, indeed it will be the height of folly to give the totally unnecessary tolerance that is asked for in the Bill.</P>

He has suggested that if a tolerance is to be allowed in this Bill, discretion is to be given to the Minister to divide constituencies any way he likes. That is not true. There would have to be legislation and the legislation would be passed by both Houses of Parliament.</P>

      <P>Surely no Minister and no political Party in introducing a Bill can be flagrantly in favour of one side or another? The whole basis of this discussion, unfortunately, has been what I said in my speech on Second Reading, that apparently the impression endeavoured to be given by the Opposition in this Parliament is that everybody, every Minister and every Deputy, is dishonest if he does not belong to one of the Opposition Parties. It is most degrading, most humiliating, and the people who make statements of that nature do not reflect <Col N="2311" /> great credit on themselves. The general intention in any electoral system is that in a broad way you should have a Deputy representing approximately the same number of people, but as well as representing the same number of the population in the country, he should also represent in a broad way the same number of the electorate. At the moment, we have a very grave discrepancy between parts of the rural areas and the cities because in so far as the electorate is concerned, it takes very many more votes in a rural area to elect a Deputy than it does in an urban or city area.</P>
      <P>In every democratic country in the world there is a tolerance. The thing at issue is what is a reasonable tolerance. It must be reasonable at the time of each census because the Constitution says &ldquo;at the time being&rdquo;. The population in various constituencies may increase.  They may decrease as well. Are we going to have this chopping and changing around every five years or every eight years? Surely there should be some reasonable tolerance which will stay there for a rather indefinite length of time which would be fair and reasonable to everybody? I do not think anybody with any good sense can suggest that there should not be a reasonable tolerance. The only thing at issue is what is a reasonable tolerance. The tolerance suggested is one-sixth. Are we to consider that is unreasonable? Perhaps we could apply ourselves to other democracies. We do not hear Deputies in other democracies suggesting that because there is a greater tolerance, their Ministers and their Government are crooks and are dishonest people. The whole basis of this is to strike at the very root of democracy, to detract from the respect people should owe to any Government. I do not care what Party it is that is in power, I would not subscribe to that.</P>

      <P>I could not let that go unheeded. In this country politics has come to be a dirty word because of the tactics of certain people, who when they think they are looking through a window are looking in a mirror, and see themselves and not their neighbours.  If I am going to suggest that somebody else's motives are dishonest without any evidence of it, I am judging his motives by what I might do in his place. Therefore, if I suggest dishonest motives to somebody else, it is because there is probably dishonesty in my own nature. I feel that it is striking at the very roots of democracy in this country that this scandalous attitude should be adopted towards political opponents.</P>
      <P>Let the Opposition show, if they suggest a more reasonable tolerance than the one-sixth suggested, one example of where there is a smaller tolerance than one-sixth in any country in Europe. I consider it is a reasonable tolerance and that it is smaller than in most countries, and enables constituencies to be kept within county boundaries, which are already there for administrative and other purposes. I feel the people have a certain pride in their own county and that they would like to have the same relation between their counties and their constituencies as they already have between their county councillors and their Deputies.</P>

      <P>The Minister and the Fianna Fáil Senators have gone to great pains to blame the fixing of the constituencies the last time on the court <Col N="2313" /> action which has been mentioned here during the course of the day. This is just a red herring in order to divert the attention of the people from what is happening and so that the Minister will have an opportunity of fixing constituencies in the way he wishes. Take, for instance, the case outlined by Senator Quinlan in Cork where they moved portion of Cork city, Blackrock, into the middle of Cork for no other apparent reason than that it was the residential area of one of the most popular Fine Gael Deputies in that city. Again, if my memory serves me correct, we in the Fine Gael Party had a very promising Dáil candidate in Councillor Jim Bowe from Wexford. Before any time, he found himself and his area landed in Carlow.</P>

      <P>What happened to Councillor Bowe has happened all over the country. This was not confined to the constituency of that Fine Gael councillor alone. I think many Labour candidates found their constituencies moved as well. If the present Government get an opportunity, they certainly will rape the constituencies to a very fine degree. The Minister has not told us in any of his long speeches in this House whether any portion of the county boundaries will be regrouped. Will the portions of Meath and Westmeath which are with Kildare be restored to their administrative counties at the first opportunity? The Minister has said that those people have expressed disquiet on account of being with other counties but he has not given an assurance to the House that if he gets the chance, he will restore those people to where they were pre-1961.  This entire problem is a major one and one which will affect practically every constituency and I would ask the Minister to show even at this late stage some change of heart in order to reassure the people that they will not find themselves facing a problem, as far as gerrymandering is concerned, such as they have in the North of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two issues and a bit involved in debating this Schedule. We have tried to establish why it is needed. I have tried in speaking earlier to give the reason. I am merely summing up very briefly at this stage. There is the issue of fair representation. I suggest this is not in issue because we propose that an electoral basis, which the Minister thinks is fair, should be employed, but he voted that down yesterday. The Minister has rejected this proposal. He has rejected the proposal which would have given to the west of Ireland, including Kerry, which he seems to omit, 37 seats as against 34.1 as they are entitled to on the basis of population.</P>
      <P>The second issue is county boundaries.  He claimed in words which I quoted before that this would get much worse and what happened in 1961 would be as nothing to what must happen now, and that this would have to occur on such a much wider scale now if this Bill is not passed. These are the words he used. I have presented a possible way in which the constituencies could be divided which shows that not alone need this not be worse on this occasion, but better. Instead of taking pieces from seven constituencies, to take pieces from six would suffice. Instead of taking 56,000-odd people, 33,000-odd would suffice. In disturbing in their voting pattern 1.5 per cent of the people, the problem could be solved. Far from getting worse, this problem, if not aggravated by the desire to gerrymander at the expense of unnecessarily moving people around, might be resolved with very little disturbance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not, therefore, a question of county boundaries. The Minister made this clear in his reference to Mayo where he said that under the present system&mdash;that is what I said, although I think he has misquoted me&mdash;he was prepared, and any government would be, to break up Mayo unnecessarily even though there was no need to do so and break up the county boundaries in order to produce unfair representation&mdash;something which certainly a Fine Gael Government would not do. We believe that county boundaries should be adhered to where possible <Col N="2315" /> and that representation should be fair, based on electorate or population, whatever is appropriate.</P>
    <P>The grounds that the Minister put forward for the Bill were self-contradictory and were disproved out of his own mouth. I have challenged him with the figures I have put forward for the various constituencies and, speaking at great length and in his usual wandering manner, he has failed to come to grips with my figures and has not challenged them and, by default, has accepted that what I said was true. His claims that if the Bill does not go through, the country would have to be divided up far more extensively are disproved and, with respect to Senator Quinlan, I do not think it is necessary to establish any committee of inquiry to see whether these figures are correct or not. The fact that I have put them forward and that the Minister has failed to refute them is quite clear evidence that my figures stand and that his claims are false. On these grounds, we reject the Schedule.</P>

      <P>I also thought that the main tenor of the debate was the allegation that we were too well able to read the signs, that we had too accurate an information service in regard to voting patterns and so on in the country. However, Senator Quinlan being, as he says himself, a rugged Independent, has, apparently, a different view from that of some of his colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator FitzGerald's scheme of constituencies, which Senator Quinlan naturally found so acceptable and so much deserving of compliments, I can only say that I dealt with each <Col N="2316" /> county on an individual basis, that I gave the figures from the census of population and I think Senator Quinlan would probably be capable of reading these. They are incontrovertible. I showed the number of counties whose boundaries would have to be breached. This cannot be contradicted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>These figures are on the record of the Seanad. I showed that a much wider breaching of county boundaries would be necessary now in order to do justice or to go as near as possible to doing justice to the people of rural areas under the present circumstances which the Opposition are trying to hang on to, that is requiring representation to be based on the population in the census irrespective of the number of voters in the constituency.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald's suggested scheme of the constituencies is, apparently, acceptable to Senator Quinlan but we know from past experience that it would not be acceptable to the people concerned or to their representatives but because these representatives have not been sufficiently interested to investigate the matter for themselves they have not come face to face with what is going to happen in their constituencies, of course, no objections have been raised yet but when this type of thing had to happen in 1961 the objections from the Opposition benches were very vehement indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently, Senator Quinlan's main purpose in rising was to repeat something which he knows to be a deliberate falsehood. With regard to this proposal to permit of a maximum divergence from the national average of population per Deputy of one-sixth in order to take account of certain very practical considerations, Senator Quinlan alleged, which he knew to be false, that this meant that it would take 16,000 odd votes in some constituencies, as against 23,000 odd votes in other constituencies, to elect a Deputy. Senator Quinlan knows that that is untrue and I suspect that his sole purpose in <Col N="2317" /> speaking was to repeat that deliberate falsehood.</P>

      <P>He knows that, so far from that being true, the position is that these figures relate to total population and that the total population have not got votes, that, in fact, the position is that if the change that we propose is not made the situation that will continue will be that, for instance, in the area of Dublin North-West it will take 10,206 voters to elect a Deputy, not 23,000 odd as he alleged, and that in the area of Donegal South-West, it will take 13,567 voters to elect a Deputy, not 16,000 odd as Senator Quinlan alleged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinlan also said that this proposal would give very wide discretionary powers to the Minister but he knows himself that, in fact, it will give much less discretionary powers to the Minister than now because the requirement will be to utilise this maximum permissible divergence from the national average of population per Deputy in order to avoid the breaching of county boundaries.  So that, it will be much more restrictive on the Minister than the present position which Senator Quinlan wants to retain, the position in which the Minister will be required, whether he wants to or not, to make adjustments as between one county and another, and, of course, he will have the facility available to him of selecting the areas to be attached to one county and the areas to be detached from another in the many different ways this can be done. It is the situation now, and which Senator Quinlan wants to retain, which will give much greater discretionary powers to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinlan's argument against this is a dishonest one because he first of all decided what his attitude was to <Col N="2318" /> be, that his attitude was to be to oppose this, and it was only then that he searched around for arguments to use, instead of first of all examining the situation and then deciding, on the basis of the relevant considerations, what viewpoint he should take. He leads a very simple life and decides everything on the basis of one consideration and one consideration only and that is, if something is proposed by Fianna Fáil, he in his capacity, as he said himself, of rugged Independent, must oppose it.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan, as well as everybody else here, knows that it is possible to put the provision for the Constituency Commission into one of these Bills only, since the two are being put before the people at the same time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Senator knows that that is so. Senators also know that it was our intention originally to have only one proposal put before the people and that this provision for the Constituency Commission would be in the Bill. It was at their request, not as a result of any decision of ours, that these were segregated into two separate proposals and, that being done, it was necessary to decide into which of these Bills the provision for the Constituency Commission should be inserted. Surely, since all that is proposed in effect in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill is a return to the circumstances that existed when the provision in the Constitution was interpreted by the people who drafted it, since that is all that is proposed and since there is a requirement to adhere as far as possible to county boundaries, only a minor revision of existing constituencies can take place. The whole scheme of constituencies is not to be disrupted.  But if the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill is passed, there must be a completely new revision of constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the information on which to gerrymander the country is available and if the Minister is as unscrupulous as Senators opposite say, then it is on the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill being passed that more <Col N="2319" /> scope is there for this unscrupulous activity to be carried out by the Minister.  Obviously, if the provision of a Constituency Commission is in any sense a safeguard against gerrymandering, the more appropriate Bill to put it into, since it can only be put into one, is the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.</P>
    <P>But the discussion on this point is academic because we are proposing to the people that they should accept the two amendments of the Constitution and the Opposition are suggesting they should not accept either. Therefore, the likelihood is that we will either have both amendments accepted or neither. If neither is accepted the position will be as it is and we will be required to go ahead and butcher more constituencies. But there will be nothing to prevent a Constituency Commission being established to do that. It will not be a requirement of the Constitution, however. If, on the other hand, our advice and the advice of the Leader of the main Opposition Party, Deputy Cosgrave, is taken, then the two amendments of the Constitution will be passed by the people and the Constituency Commission will operate. The whole thing is quite simple and this is purely a bogus argument that is being made.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald wants to know whether or not the areas of Counties Meath and Westmeath and of other counties added on to other counties in 1961 will be restored. The Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill provides that it will be permissible to operate a maximum divergence of one-sixth from the national average for the purpose of avoiding the breaching of county boundaries. If this Bill is passed, it will be possible to restore in all cases these bits of counties added on to other counties. On this occasion also it will be possible to avoid doing it in any other case. On the other hand if the position Senator McDonald and the rest of his colleagues over there want to retain is retained, then it will not be possible to avoid doing these things</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This cannot be avoided unless the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill is accepted. Admittedly, if you are to approach it from the point of view of further decreasing the representation of the rural areas and further increasing the injustice that must be done if the change is not made, you can avoid a certain amount of this breaching. But, even on that basis, you cannot avoid it in every case on anything approaching it. A substantial amount will have to be done.</P>
      <P>With regard to the loss of this prominent Fine Gael aspirant for the Dáil in County Wexford, I must say I do not know anything about that. But I do know Fine Gael have lost a prominent aspirant for the Dáil in the constituency of North-East Dublin lately, and this did not arise from any revision of the constituencies, gerrymandered or otherwise, carried out in 1961. It merely arose from the fact that we have this unnatural and disruptive electoral system of multi-member constituencies here. When this prominent aspirant of Fine Gael appeared and posed a threat to the two sitting Members for Fine Gael in the constituency, they took the action Senator Rooney regrets not taking in County Dublin. They kicked him out when they had the opportunity.  Senator Rooney waited until it was too late and in the struggle for the last seat in County Dublin, he came a cropper. His colleagues in North-East Dublin knew what was going to happen and they got rid of this prominent aspirant. This is what is involved in the system of multi-member constituencies.</P>

      <P>Senator FitzGerald still desires to prolong this discussion. Apparently, he was not able to do it himself and tried to provoke me into doing it. Once again he asked me why <Col N="2321" /> we are making this proposal. I explained it to him when introducing the Bill. I explained it again in reply to the Second Reading debate. Senator FitzGerald still wants to prolong this debate by asking me to do it again. I do not think I will oblige him. I think even he knows the reason by now.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald again takes me to task for having said that what happened in 1961 will be nothing compared to what will happen now. I have proved that by dealing with each constituency individually. The figures Senator FitzGerald quoted with regard to the disturbance involved in his proposed revision of constituencies are, of course, completely wrong. He ignores that in some cases he is actually disrupting the population of whole counties, detaching them from where they have been and attaching them to other counties. His proposal involves much more shifting of population than he himself has admitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2322" /> All this is an operation with figures. The fact that you move people about every five years is of no concern. Nor is the fact that Dáil representatives are elected for a constituency this year and in two years time find that that constituency is changed and that now they have to adjust themselves to represent other areas for which they were not elected.</P>

We have been considerably handicapped as regards knowing what was said on the last Stage, the attitudes that have been adopted and the various nuances that have to be taken into consideration. In drafting suitable amendments for the Report Stage, it is very necessary to have the benefit of the report. From my experience, I cannot see it being available for Tuesday. I think we have gone a good distance to accommodate the Government in this debate and we are quite prepared to finish the debate on Wednesday.</P>

      <P>Before we enter into consideration of the Committee Stage of this Bill, the Chair suggests&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) In order to avoid duplication of debate that, as in the case of the Third Amendment Bill, consideration of sections 1 and 2 be postponed until the Schedule has been dealt with and that the sections be then passed formally.</P>
      <P>(2) That the Schedule be dealt with on the lines followed in the case of the 1958 Bill, namely:</P>
      <P>(a) Subsection 1º in Parts I and II be discussed together;</P>
      <P>(b) Subsection 2º in Parts I and II be discussed together;</P>
      <P>(c) Parts III and IV be discussed together;</P>
      <P>(d) in Parts V and VI each section to be taken separately [i.e. section 3 Parts V and VI; section 4 in Parts V and VI; and so on], and</P>
      <P>(e) When (a) to (d) have been disposed of, the question on the Schedule will be put formally and decided without debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two points on which the agreement of the House is necessary. No. 1, agreement is necessary or desirable for consideration of sections 1 <Col N="2326" /> and 2 to be postponed until the Schedule has been dealt with, and after that, sections 1 and 2 will be passed formally.</P>

The suggestion from the Chair is that the various parts of the Schedule which are cognate will be discussed together, in other words, the Schedule will be broken up for the purpose of discussion, and when that discussion is concluded there will be no general debate on the Schedule as a whole.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have no particular desire to prolong the debate on this Bill any more than the debate on the previous Bill, I feel bound at the same time to draw attention to the fact that the provision contained in this subsection for single-seat constituencies rather than the present system of multi-seat constituencies is something for which there has been no demand up <Col N="2327" /> to 1959 or since 1959. I do not think the Minister or any member of the Government can point to any widespread demand for single-seat constituencies.  As has been said already on the Second Stage of this Bill, the purpose of this provision is to enable the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party to entrench themselves in office with upwards of 90 seats. That figure is conceded on any calculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not conceded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Having entrenched themselves with 90 seats, some of these Deputies, instead of spending their time attending to the needs of the nation, instead of directing their energies towards the formulation of national policy, instead of spending their time sitting in Dáil Éireann and making their contributions on the various measures and schemes and White Papers which appear before the Dáil from time to time, will spend their time going around every part of their small constituency cultivating it intensively in their own personal interest to ensure their return to the Dáil on the next occasion, to the neglect of their more serious parliamentary duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of electing a Member to Dáil Éireann is, first of all, to provide representation for the constituents and to represent the views of the people, and, perhaps, equally important to provide a Government that will govern. That can be achieved and has, in fact, been achieved over the past 46 years. No one can say that at any stage the people have been deprived of representation in the Dáil by reason of the fact that we elect representatives in multi-seat constituencies. A great advantage of the multi-seat constituency is that, not only can a person express his preference for a particular Party, but he can also express his preference for different members within political Parties. We all know of cases where the person chosen by the local organisation, and delegates at conventions, has been turned down, sometimes for good reasons, and sometimes for bad reasons, by Party headquarters and someone else implanted or imposed by Party headquarters. In a single-seat <Col N="2328" /> constituency what will happen in future is that if it is a safe seat, as it is known in Britain, the electorate will merely be asked to endorse and rubber-stamp the selection of the political Party which happen to have the largest number of supporters in that constituency. That, to my mind, is not democracy. It is political dictatorship. That would be one of the effects of substituting the single-member constituencies for the multi-member constituencies which we have known since 1922.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from that, the argument is being put forward by the Government that Deputies must be in touch with their constituents. Whether 90, 50, 70, 60 or 10 seats is the outcome of a particular election, there will be a large number of people in every constituency who will not have voted for the sitting Deputy. It is idle to think that in a case where a man not only did not vote for the sitting Deputy but campaigned actively against him, he will get from the elected Deputy the same kind of support as he would get from a member of his own Party elected in a multi-seat constituency. In a small constituency of 20,000 souls with an electorate of 10,000 or 11,000, perhaps, it would be very easy for the gauleiters to know who voted for whom, and the sitting Deputy, especially if he happened to be in a constituency with a comfortable majority, just will not bother his head when he is asked to make representations for someone who voted against him. I know that Senators on the other side will stand up and protest and say that when a man is elected he is elected to represent the constituency and he will work for everyone. That does not always happen.</P>

      <P>There will be people, especially those who have worked actively against the only representative in the constituency, who will find that the representation they want to be made on their behalf will not be made or else will be made in a feeble or ineffective way. So far from giving that kind of person that service, the new single-member constituency will work against him.</P>
      <P>I do not know how the new single-seat constituencies will be drawn up. That remains to be seen. I cannot see in, say, a place such as County Mayo, which I know perhaps better than any other, what advantage it will be to the population there to be put, say, in the four different constituencies consisting of Mayo North-West, Mayo North-East, Mayo South-West and Mayo South-East&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or two Ministers of State, as far as Mayo South is concerned, spending all their time in Dublin and now having transferred their families, as I understand it, to Dublin. I cannot see how the people can be better off or better served in a single-seat constituency than is the case at the present time. At least, at present, people have a choice of <Col N="2330" /> Deputies in a multi-seat constituency if they want to get a particular service. Under the new system, they will have to take Hobson's choice. If he happens to be an energetic Deputy, they may fare well. If he happens to be a Deputy who is an absentee, they may fare badly. They may have a Deputy in ill-health or a Deputy who is not able to do as much as would be necessary.</P>
      <P>However, all of this talk about single-seat constituencies and the accessibility of Deputies is based upon the assumption that people must necessarily go to Deputies. I think that is a false assumption. If our public service were properly organised&mdash;and it merely means not more expenditure but more efficiency in the utilisation of existing staffs and existing services&mdash;there would be a great deal less need for the intervention of Deputies, Senators and county councillors than exists at present.  However, the Government have made no effort whatever to bring these services to the people. At the last local elections, we proposed, as part of our policy for the future&mdash;and we shall pursue it&mdash;to establish citizens' advice centres so that people can go to these centres and find out the information they want. The Fianna Fáil Party have done nothing about that. There are some members of the Fianna Fáil Party who thought this a good idea. It is of interest to note that one of the leading young bright lights of the Dublin County Council, in the shape of a Fianna Fáil member, actually took over this suggestion at a recent meeting of the Dublin County Council and had it adopted, as far as my recollection of press reports goes. He, at least, being only a short time in public affairs, recognises the necessity for the kind of things we have been talking about for quite some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that, if you want to get from any county council or any Government Department an answer to any question, the first thing you have to do is to fill in a form. As I said before, the forms the people have to fill in from time to time are couched in such language that even I, a barrister, trained and skilled in the interpretation of legal documents and documents of all kinds, have found <Col N="2331" /> it quite impossible, on occasions, when asked as a Senator to help people to fill in forms, to know what information the particular Government Department was looking for. It is because of that situation that people are thrown over on county councillors, Senators and Deputies from time to time. It is because people do not get from the public service the attention that their claims and requirements deserve and because they do not get clear-cut directions and clear-cut decisions that so much recourse has to be had to Deputies, Senators and members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is a mistake to think it is necessary, because of that trend, to change our electoral system because as I say, the proper duties of all Deputies and Senators are not those of looking after these trivia in the daily life although these are things which keep people in office. It is not the looking after of these that helps to generate economic prosperity or to bring about further social advancement in this country. Rather it is the proper duty of Deputies and Senators to give detailed study to parliamentary matters in consultation with Ministers, when in Government, and with shadow Ministers, when in Opposition. These are the things which count. It does not matter whether the Deputies come from single-seat or multi-seat constituencies. If they are good Deputies and apply themselves to the matters to which they ought to apply themselves, we shall have a better Parliament and better administration at Government level.</P>
    <P>I speak at very great length on this section, as we could speak at great length on every section of this Bill. However, I do not want to provoke the Minister for Local Government into another long harangue. I want to spare myself, my colleagues and the Members of the House opposite from another continuous, wearying, wearisome, use-less&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The proposal here is to create 144 single-seat constituencies. Today the Minister spent a long time telling us that he wanted to bring in a system which would prevent the breaching of county boundaries and I am wondering how he is going to bring in 144 constituencies without breaching county boundaries as there are only 26 counties. He may in his reply show that this can be done and that we could have 144 constituencies located within county boundaries but in view of his arguments over so many hours I should like to have an assurance from him that he will not breach county boundaries, if and when the necessity for establishing 144 constituencies arises.</P>

      <P>We have examined the figures for elections and we have examined the figures for the county council elections in which Fianna Fáil got a heavy beating. Compared with <Col N="2335" /> 1960, they are on the decline. Where Fine Gael went up by 75 seats Fianna Fáil went up one seat in the last county council elections. In spite of this remarkable forward stride by Fine Gael, so far as representation on the county councils is concerned, we have discovered that this proposed single-seat arrangement with a relative majority will work out in favour of Fianna Fáil. The reason for this is that the people who are very fair-minded believe in supporting various policies and various organisations such as the Labour Party, which is a very widespread and strong organisation, Fine Gael, which is an old national organisation, Sinn Féin which elected four Deputies in the second last general election, the farmers' organisations who sent 16 farmer Deputies to the Dáil in 1948.</P>

      <P>Before Senators go into too much detail, it would be desirable if Senator Rooney could relate this to the operation of the multi-seat system and the single-seat system. That is the issue which should be debated here, and no other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was making was that up to now you could have a Sinn Féin Deputy, a Labour Deputy, a Fianna Fáil Deputy and a farmers' Deputy from a five-seat constituency but now this constituency is to be divided up into single-seat constituencies and those five organisations could not possibly, for obvious reasons, put a representative into each area. The situation will be that you will have five areas and five candidates and only one candidate will be elected under the relative majority system, even if he <Col N="2336" /> only succeeds in getting one-quarter of the votes. We could have a situation then in which one-quarter of the people in an area could have a member in the Dáil representing them while three-quarters of the people would have no elected representative. The multi-seat constituency prevents that sort of situation because it enables the supporters of various political Parties and various policies to be represented in the Dáil. Democratic representation, therefore, will come to an end if there is a change to single-seat constituencies.</P>
      <P>It has been said that, even though Fine Gael jumped by 75 seats in the local authority elections, gaining a great measure of support throughout the country, under this so-called relative majority system, the situation would be that the candidate with the largest number of votes, even though those votes may be in a minority, would be elected. Suppose threequarters of the people did not vote for a Fianna Fáil candidate and one quarter did and got their candidate elected and suppose the three-quarters wanted to have some matter raised or some question asked in the Dáil, who would table the motion or ask the question for them? Would the Government allow one of their Deputies to ask the Minister an embarrassing question? Would he be allowed to table an embarrassing motion in the interests of his constituents?</P>
      <P>At the moment the interests of all constituents are well served because the various Parties are represented in the Dáil by Deputies from the different constituencies all over the country and they can table motions or ask questions. They can raise matters on the Adjournment if they are dissatisfied with the Minister's reply. Could there be any hope at all that a Fianna Fáil Deputy would raise a question on the Adjournment which might embarrass his own Government?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes. Take County Louth, for instance. The people in County Louth are being punished by the Government and the Minister because the council there is Fine Gael. They have been threatened by the Minister that they need not expect facilities from him so far as schemes and grants of various kinds are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, apparently, Fine Gael must get the credit. Even in a multi-seat constituency at the moment the Minister can say that, because there is a Fine Gael council, the people need not look to him for any kind of justice. I call it justice because it is something to which they are entitled, but the Minister says he is not interested in seeing they get justice. This will be the <Col N="2339" /> pattern in the non-Government areas if this change is made. On the other hand, the Government may penalise the people and force them into a position in which they may decide they had better support the Government because otherwise they will be left out in the cold; they cannot expect anything from the Government if they do not vote for them. The people will be compelled to vote for the Government candidate. There could be an area then represented by an Independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>A rugged Independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>A rugged Independent would be a good Independent. One could be sure of useful questions being asked and useful motions tabled, the latter in both the Dáil and Seanad, and, generally speaking, the people in the constituency could expect good service from the Deputy.</P>
      <P>But what about the Government? It is doubtful that the Government would be interested in being useful to the people of that constituency and there again by penalising the people of that area, they would try of course to displace the Independent Deputy and to force the people into a situation where they would feel obliged to vote for a Government Deputy. So this system of single-seat constituencies certainly favours the Government of the time, whatever Government it might be. They will be able to exercise undue pressure. They will be able to create a feeling among the people that if they do not support the Government, they cannot expect what they are entitled to. I was going to mention some Independent representatives in the other House in the past but I do not intend to do so at this stage. However, you could have that situation under the single-seat constituency system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course there would be no choice of personnel in a single-seat constituency.  Whether people liked the Deputy or not, the Party would decide who the Deputy for an area should be. They would not have a choice of candidate. They could only protest to their Party <Col N="2340" /> headquarters but in the long run the Party would say: &ldquo;Take it or leave it; your candidate, whether you like him or her, will be the person selected as the standard-bearer for the Party&rdquo;. At present the people have a choice of personnel, in addition to a choice of policy.</P>
    <P>The final thing I want to mention is that this arrangement of single-seat areas would leave the Minister in a position to send up four Fianna Fáil Deputies from an area where there are 70,000 men, women and children and in an adjoining area, which would be a Fine Gael area, three Deputies only for 70,000 people, that is the one-sixth tolerance up or down from the average of 20,000 persons. That would be a very unfair arrangement. Fianna Fáil could elect four Deputies for 70,000 people and in another area there would be only three Fine Gael Deputies for 70,000 people.</P>

      <P>I have often heard it said that those who sit and listen also serve. Having listened to <Col N="2344" /> the acrimonious discussions over a week now, I feel relieved at Senator Rooney's speech here today, that we are at least getting pacific in our discussion.  My speech will consist of about 12 sentences. Firstly, I think the people of Ireland should be grateful to the Fianna Fáil Government for bringing in this legislation, for bringing power to alter the system of election to the principal House of the Oireachtas, Dáil Éireann. I think it will save our people from a lot of the difficulties so obvious in the European situation. I saw recently in the papers that there was no Government in Belgium and I have not seen since that they have succeeded in forming a Government. The reason for that is the prevailing situation among the people of&mdash;I will not say coalition&mdash;multi-Party organisations.</P>
      <P>The next point I should like to make is that the Opposition, namely, Fine Gael, should be grateful to the Government for bringing in this legislation. I am satisfied to say that after almost 50 years of efforts under multi-member constituencies, that is, under PR, they have never succeeded in beating Fianna Fáil and will never succeed in beating Fianna Fáil under PR while most of us are alive and our people are alive. It shows a lack of confidence in themselves now to pretend that the single-member constituency system of election will make the situation worse. I say that the best hope Fine Gael have of securing a majority in this country is under the single-seat system. Under PR which they have had for the most of 50 years, they have failed. The only occasions on which Fianna Fáil were not a Government in 50 years were two occasions when we had attempted Coalitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1919 the Government established was the Government for all Ireland. We had the 1916 Declaration of Independence and the 1919 election held over the 32 counties of Ireland, and a great majority, an overwhelming majority, accepted the 1916 Proclamation and a Government was established under the single-seat system. Unfortunately, the split came after the unfortunate Treaty and so the successors of the pro-Treaty people are now featuring <Col N="2345" /> as Fine Gael. It was in 1922 by direction of the British Government that the multi-member constituency was established to maintain the division in this country.</P>
    <P>I said my speech would involve 12 sentences. I have reached that now and I will recap by saying that the people of Ireland should be thankful to the Fianna Fáil Government for introducing this legislation, and Fine Gael should be especially thankful, for it is the only hope they have of ever beating Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>Stop your interruptions. I have only 12 sentences and I shall not answer any of your interruptions. We should be grateful to the Government for their achievements under PR and we are giving the Opposition, especially Fine Gael, the only opportunity they will ever have of beating Fianna Fáil because they will never beat us under PR or the multi-seat constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering the single-seat versus the multi-seat, we have to look at and compare the position in England with our situation here. The first thing we must note is that the Member in England serves a constituency with a population at least four times as large as that of a Deputy here. They have 600 Deputies serving the present British population. That means in point of fact that the average English Member is serving as many as are served by three to four Deputies in any one of our constituencies here today.  That enables a Deputy to keep at a certain distance from his constituents, a distance that enables him to discharge his more important function of legislator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2346" /> Here, unfortunately, we have gone too far in the other aspects of a Deputy's work, that is, of making representations. One would think from many of the speeches that one was electing, say, welfare officers and not Deputies. This tendency has grown apace over the past 15 to 20 years and new and more refined techniques are being used by Deputies of all Parties to encourage this and to make the people feel more dependent.</P>
    <P>I am not saying it prevails in all Parties, but it does to some extent. The first essential, before bringing the Deputy any closer to the people, is to ensure that the people are educated into realising the real function of a Deputy, and his real function is that of legislator, and also into realising their rights as constituents. If they are entitled to an old age pension, if they have reached the age, they are entitled to it and there is no need whatever to call on any Deputy either to fill in the form or to make representations. We can sympathise at present with Deputies because all this unnecessary work is thrust on them. They have to do it if they are to stay in, but it is high time that a concerted effort was made by all Parties, spearheaded by the Government, to enlighten the people about what their rights are and so rid Deputies of this awful burden.</P>
    <P>If we reduce the present level of representation, it will give a greater impetus to this type of what I would only call messenger-boy representation. That of course obviously is not for the good of the community. There are other and higher tasks required from Deputies. The State has taken steps, quite rightly, recently, to increase the salaries of Deputies so that they can concentrate on this work and they will be of a calibre that merits those salaries.</P>
    <P>Again, in smaller constituencies of one seat, we have the situation where obviously only one can be elected. That means if a leading member of one Party, say, the Government Party, in his area is a candidate the Opposition have no choice in such a situation. They have either got to concede the seat to the man in possession or else <Col N="2347" /> they have got to get a really good candidate to, as it were, mark the member. It means that in such a constituency if we have one good candidate and say three Parties contest the election, we have three good candidates.  There is no room for the mediocre candidate when there is one really good one in the field. Consequently it means that three candidates in the present situation of multi-member constituencies would be obvious for three seats and would form three excellent representatives. Now they are in competition with one another and only one can emerge. Much inferior candidates from other Parties will probably be elected due to the lack of competition.</P>
    <P>When a swing goes against the Government, it is the ex-Ministers who very often are the people who suffer most. I am not saying this just solely from the point of view that it is hard on the ex-Ministers to find they are cut off and that they are not in Parliament.  That is purely personal. What matters is that in a change of Government, we can be sure that the leading members of the previous Government and of the previous Government Party are available to lead an effective Opposition in Parliament and this means a healthy contribution in that respect. Therefore, any system of single-seat constituencies militates grievously against that, unless we resort, as across the Border, to the safe seat. We saw there in the last election only three out of every five seats were contested. Is that a situation we want to import here?</P>
    <P>Again, we take the question of the lack of choice available. Our people at present are highly critical of the activities of Parliament and no amount of denial by Senator Nash or anybody else will get away from that fact. There is no point in whistling going past the graveyard. Politicians have only got to read the papers, see what the political commentators have to say and see what is said on Telefís Éireann to realise that people are highly critical of Party politics today. I admit a good deal of it is ill-informed criticism, but the fact is that the criticism is there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2348" /> The people have a certain distrust of what they call the Party bosses and the way the Parties are operated, especially at the inner caucus level. Consequently the people have valued down the years, and like to have the final say on who shall be elected. In a three-seat constituency, the people expect the Government in power to offer, say, three candidates, even though it expects to get one, or at the most two, candidates elected. That is only right and proper. The electorate assumes a very discriminatory function in putting those in the order of their choice.</P>
    <P>This very often results in one man breaking through, as it were, the Party machine from being in the position of the reluctant third of the team. This is the choice of the Irish electors, and it is only right and proper that they should have this function because it means that they can exercise their choice of candidates which is made first at Party level and secondly, and most important, at the level of the voters. From that point of view, the people would be very unwise to make themselves simply cogs in the political machine where, if they wish to vote for the Government, they just simply have to put before whatever candidate the Government want, whereas at the moment they can vote for the Government if they wish, but have a choice of three candidates from which to exercise their preferences.</P>
    <P>The single-seat constituencies make any idea of proportion impossible because it just simply means that one person is elected. It does not matter what system is operated under the transferable system, the person represents not just 50 per cent or one per cent of the electors. In other words, you have the rule of the 51 per cent. In a modern democracy where all reasonable shades of opinion should be taken into account, it is not only right but it is highly desirable that those shades of opinion should be expressed within the national Parliament. That cannot be achieved through the single-member constituency, especially in our set-up here where, by and large, the country is rather homogeneous. At least you have only two main divisions: <Col N="2349" /> the rural part and the urban part. Therefore, we cannot take it for granted that Parliament will be representative under the single-seat constituency system by the fact that one shade of opinion gets representation in one area and another shade gets representation in another area.</P>
    <P>This is just like in England where you have certain areas where when it comes to a general election, they will return Conservatives and you have other areas where they will return Labour candidates, and you have the few Liberals who have their strongholds.  We can see no such divisions here and therefore we cannot rely on any balancing up of our national representation in Parliament by this type of chance occurrence. It has been done very well in the past and very satisfactorily on the basis of our own version of proportional representation, that is, where the proportionality has been sharpened to give a bonus to the majority Party by keeping multi-member constituencies, with a majority of three-seat constituencies. That has worked well and we should be very slow to change from it.</P>
    <P>Again, irrespective of whether a change is made or not, we must realise that we are now in the second half of the 20th century, that our parliamentary procedures, our parliamentary forms of representation, the work of the Deputy have not changed for 100 years. Consequently, we have got to get down to that. That is what we should be doing at the present time. It is what the people of the country are calling out for. They have been asked to modernise in everything they are doing. They have been asked to modernise in their work, to become more efficient. They have been asked to participate in all the recent advances of communication and otherwise.  They are demanding that we here in Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann should modernise our approach, to set a lead rather than reluctantly be dragged on behind more progressive sections of our community.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, then, it would be very retrograde at this stage to <Col N="2350" /> depart from multi-member constituencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Opposition Senators are in a certain difficulty in discussing this particular proposal which is, of course, divorced from the question of the system of election, although I think it is reasonably obvious that in common with the public at large, the various Opposition speakers&mdash;and that includes Senator Quinlan&mdash;are clearly themselves basically in favour of the notion of a small, compact, single-seat constituency as compared with the sprawling multi-seat constituencies we have at present. They are merely trying to put up a certain fog of opposition because of their opposition to the voting proposals contained in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I think nearly everybody, certainly, the vast majority of the public, would be in favour of the idea of these small single-seat constituencies, leaving the question of voting out of account. These constituencies, particularly in rural areas, would be very much smaller than the large constituencies we have at present. It is obvious that in certain cases&mdash;I quote Mayo which is well known to Senator O'Quigley&mdash;in certain parts of, say, Belmullet, they have nothing in common with people at the other end of the constituency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, they are all Irish, but if the Senator knew anything about rural Ireland, he would realise that people 20, 30 and 40 miles away are somewhat far removed from you. There are people at the end of these big constituencies who are quite unknown to the majority of the local population. They feel that, while they are all Irish, they have relatively little in common with them except for that very obvious fact of common citizenship.  I think the people themselves would prefer to be able to live in and work in, if they are interested in politics, and vote in a constituency which is small, which is known to them, the bulk of the area of which they would know very well and where they would know many of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These advantages are so obvious that <Col N="2351" /> it is not very likely that anyone will seriously attempt to deny them. These constituencies, of course, will be much more easily managed than the existing ones. While I do not suggest that the interests of politicians should reign supreme in a matter of this kind, it is at least a factor that the various political Parties and various volunteer workers who have to help out at election time will find a much easier task in these smaller constituencies. By-elections, of which there are only too many&mdash;some 50 in the past 25 years&mdash; will clearly be much more easily managed and considerably cheaper not merely to the State but also to those who subscribe to political Party funds and the workers involved, I am sure, would be duly grateful for having a much smaller area to deal with.</P>
    <P>More important than this, in these small areas the voters in general would have a personal knowledge of their Deputy. Not only that but, at election time, they would in most cases know all the candidates. In spite of suggestions made on Second Reading that it did not really matter, I am still unrepentant in my belief that it is an important matter in any democracy that the people, when they go in to vote on election day, should know for whom they are voting, that they should be faced with a ballot paper which consists of the names of candidates whom they know, whom they know about, know their form, their ancestry, what they do, what kind of people they are, what they represent. I may be astray on this, but I am as yet utterly unconvinced that this knowledge on the part of the voters is not a vital and essential part of a healthy democratic system. It seems to me utterly wrong that people should go to a polling station and be faced with a ballot paper on which they may know perhaps one or two names but have a great many more names that they have no personal knowledge of. If they are interested in politics, the voters concerned may have made themselves aware of the names, may have made sure as to what the names of all the candidates are and what Parties, if any, they represent, but they may not have <Col N="2352" /> this personal knowledge of the majority of the candidates which, to my mind, is a very necessary thing.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest advantages, to me at any rate, of these small single-seat constituencies will be that you will have this personal knowledge of the candidates on the part of the ordinary voters, not merely those who are more politically conscious, but also the ordinary people, perhaps the majority of the people, who are not really so terribly interested in elections, but who are still, under the Constitution, given the power to decide on election day what the Government will be and who their representatives will be. It is very necessary that there should be this close personal knowledge of candidates and Deputies on the part of the electorate at large.</P>
    <P>Looking at it the other way round, the Deputy elected in such a small constituency will know his own people well. I agree, on the whole, with, I think it was Senator O'Quigley, on this point that a Deputy should not be in the nature of a welfare officer. I agree that an awful lot of the work a Deputy does at present is unnecessary and wasteful and should be done by somebody else or is not needed at all, though, there is no doubt about it, in these multi-seat constituencies a great deal of the unnecessary work done by a Deputy is merely in competition with other Deputies for the same area, either in his own Party or in one of the other Parties or, perhaps, an Independent. There is no doubt about that at all. I am reasonably satisfied that in the single-seat constituencies some of that wasteful, unnecessary and undesirable competition will disappear.</P>
    <P>But, at the same time, it is desirable that a Deputy should have a close personal knowledge of his people's needs and of their views on national and local affairs. In a small single-seat constituency, a compact area, a Deputy will be in a far better position than he is at present to know the views, the needs and the national and local aspirations, not merely of a section of his constituents but of all his constituents. That is a very great advantage of these <Col N="2353" /> small constituencies. At present, in in these multi-seat constituencies, a Deputy inevitably has to try to deal with the area nearest to him. There are many constituents at the far end of his constituency he never meets and has not much knowledge of or a great deal of interest in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking about the advantages, which I think are generally accepted on this side of the House and also outside it among the public, of the small single-seat constituencies as against the large constituencies we have now. A further advantage which I think is important is that in these small single-seat constituencies a Deputy could represent all his constituents in a way in which he does not do it at present. I know that in theory the Deputy represents all his constituents, not merely the supporters of his own Party but supporters of other Parties, and people who work against him and that many&mdash;probably all, in that case&mdash;are prepared to listen to people and help them in every possible way no matter what Party they may support. If only in his own interest a Deputy will do this, but there is at the same time a tendency, which I think is undesirable, for people who are seeking help from a Deputy or who wish him to take some action on their behalf, to go to a Deputy of their own Party. It is a much healthier and more satisfactory state of affairs where a Deputy can represent all the people who come to him for help, irrespective of what Party they support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dislike these divisive situations which tend to exist in multi-member constituencies where you have one section of the community looking to a Deputy of their own Party and another section looking to a Deputy of another Party. It is much more satisfactory to have a situation where one Deputy will represent all the people, as will be the case in the new constituencies. It is ridiculous to suggest, as has been suggested by a number of Senators, that a Deputy would ignore representations made to him by supporters of the Opposition. Clearly, this is not so. No <Col N="2354" /> Deputy interested in remaining a Deputy for a constituency would dream of doing such a thing because word would very soon go around and there is nothing more damaging to any public figure than for people to begin saying: &ldquo;He was not interested in helping me because I was not a supporter of his Party&rdquo;, or something of that kind. Any Deputy interested in remaining a Deputy will certainly be willing to help in every way possible all the people of his constituency, no matter what their politics may be.</P>
    <P>I suspect that most Deputies would go out of their way to seem to be particularly enthusiastic about helping members or supporters of the Opposition Parties, simply to avoid its being said about them that they were limiting their activities to one particular section of the public. We have an example of this in cities such as Dublin where the Lord Mayor is elected. He belongs to a particular Party or may be an Independent and he is recognised by the whole community as the Lord Mayor, no matter to which Party he belongs. In the same way, in these constituencies, the Deputy will be the Deputy for that area and will be looked up to as the public representative of the area and of all the people in the area, in the Dáil. There is no question, therefore, under this system of any difficulty such as has been suggested by the Opposition. Certainly, a Deputy who began saying to people: &ldquo;I am not going to do anything for you because you did not work for me or vote for me&rdquo; will not last very long.</P>
    <P>The point has been made over and over again on various sections of the Bill that the institution of single-seat constituencies, no matter what the system of election is&mdash;that is another day's work&mdash;will result in there being a large number of safe seats, of Deputies being there and no matter what happens they could remain for ever and need never bother to carry out their duties as public representatives.  This seems to me to be a somewhat irrational attitude, a misrepresentation, a misunderstanding of the situation which would arise under the new system of single-seat constituencies. It would be difficult to visualise a system of election more likely to create safe <Col N="2355" /> seats than PR in multi-member constituencies.  There are many Members of the Dáil who are completely immune from swings of public opinion because they are the leading members of that Party for a particular constituency. Their Party may have two seats, one of which may be marginal. One of the Members will be elected, no matter what happens and his junior partner will come and go as public opinion ebbs and flows. You will have a considerable number of Deputies under the multi-seat constituency system who are there year in and year out and who are in the safest seats imaginable.</P>
    <P>Under the single-seat arrangement, there will be considerably fewer of these safe seats, because every Deputy will become subject to the changes of public opinion in a way that most Deputies are not subject at the moment. The Deputy in a single-seat constituency will know that if the tide turns against his Party, he will be put out, no matter how good a Deputy he is, no matter how popular he is, and no matter how good a vote-getter he is. Therefore, every Deputy in the Dáil will be responsive to public opinion in a closer and in a more direct way than he is at the moment. Inevitably there will be some safe seats, but I do not think there is anything in the suggestion that safe seats will be created on a large scale.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that there is general agreement on this proposition that the single-seat constituency is far more suited to the needs of this country than the multi-seat constituency. I know some Senators, like Senator FitzGerald, are publicly in favour of the single-seat constituency, but I think there are others who may not have come out in this way but who if they were in a position to speak their minds as they would wish, would also support the single-seat constituency. I do not think it is likely leaving elections out of the count that anybody will come out to say he believes that multi-seat constituencies are more desirable than single-seat constituencies.</P>

      <P>Senator Yeats has made, on the whole, a persuasive speech in favour of single-seat <Col N="2356" /> constituencies taken in isolation from the question of the consequences of such a system for the electoral system, for elections, for majorities in the Dáil, and so on. I think the case is quite strong for providing single-seat constituencies.  It is not completely compelling; there are arguments in the other direction which I think will carry some weight with people. There is perhaps not so much force in the argument in regard to safe seats, because there would be quite a significant number of safe seats under this system. On any reasonable expectation of the share of the votes a Party is likely to get within the foreseeable future, in the sense that no seat is completely safe&mdash;at some future time there may be no such Party as Fianna Fáil in this country; the same could happen to Fine Gael or Labour&mdash;it is clear that there would be a significant number of safe seats. Take, for example, the figure of 35 per cent for the Fianna Fáil vote as a possible lower level for some years to come. I wonder would Senator Yeats challenge that. Does he feel that Fianna Fáil's share of the vote is likely to fall below 35 per cent in the foreseeable future because, if not, on that basis there would be for Fianna Fáil about 30 safe seats? The Fine Gael share of the votes at the moment is now around 35 per cent; it was about 34 per cent at the last election and it is, perhaps, 37 or 38 per cent in the light of the by-election and the local elections. On a similar calculation, Fine Gael are unlikely to fall much below 36 per cent, which would give them, perhaps, 20 or 25 safe seats. Labour, I suppose, might have about five safe seats.</P>

      <P>Safe for whom? Not for the Deputy. The whole point of the argument about the multi-seat constituencies is that the seat is not safe for any particular Deputy. He can be ousted. This may be seen as good or bad. It happened, indeed, to Senator Rooney. It happens quite frequently. Whether that is a good or a bad thing is a matter of opinion. It will vary according to whether one is in the position <Col N="2357" /> of being the kicker-out, or the kickee-out, if there is such a thing. It may vary according to one's broad views, one's political philosophy, or one's Party views. The fact is that under the present system no one is safe other than someone like the Taoiseach, who has a very large personal vote, certain Ministers, and a few leaders of the Opposition, but the number of people who would be safe in the ordinary sense of the word, and by the same standards I am applying here, would be very few.</P>
      <P>Under this system, despite the enormous instability about which I spoke, I hope as persuasively as Senator Yeats, there would, nevertheless, be something like 55 to 60 safe seats on any reasonable expectation of what Party votes might fall to in the foreseeable future. The question of whether these safe seats are a good or a bad thing is debatable. I am not saying they are necessarily bad. If, however, they are completely safe, so that even a grave dereliction of duty by a Deputy would be unlikely to shake his possession of the seat because of strong Party allegiance in the area, I think that would be bad, bad first of all because it would tempt the Opposition not to waste time and money in opposing seats&mdash;a temptation to which the opposition in Northern Ireland have succumbed. By the opposition I mean the opposition in the constituencies.  It would also tempt the Government not to oppose Opposition candidates in certain places if such opposition was obviously a waste of time and money. It could lead then to unopposed returns.</P>

      <P>I understood the debate to be about the spot vote in single-seat constituencies. I agree that this section deals with the single-seat aspect. I think it is reasonable for us to keep in mind the fact that, although we have no official knowledge at this point, we will shortly be debating the question of the spot vote. There are rumours to this effect. It is reasonable that we should have some regard to that in discussing this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument is still valid in both cases. This question about the seats will arise with the alternative vote and the spot vote. I am quite prepared to go into that question. Let me recap: if you have the alternative vote in the single-seat constituency, the number of safe seats at 35 per cent is 15 per cent greater. On my calculation at 30 per cent for Fine Gael it is about 15 per cent greater, and for Labour about five per cent greater so, if you are talking about that, there are another 65 safe seats on top of the ones I have been talking about. Whether we talk of 60 or 125 safe seats is not terribly important. The point is that, whatever we do with the next section when we come to it, one way or another we will have a lot of safe seats. It will not be all loss because certainly all the Parties will endeavour to make some use of the safe seat system in order to put people into Parliament who at present cannot easily be got in and who they feel would be useful in Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite possible that one consequence of the single seat would be the raising of the standard of Parliamentary representation. On the other hand, another consequence could be that <Col N="2359" /> there would be a lowering of the standard at the other end of the spectrum. As well as using some of the safe seats to put in people who would be an addition and an ornament to Parliament, and not by any means purely an ornament but an active addition to the work of Parliament, there would also be safe seats which would fall to people who are described by people outside politics as &ldquo;Party hacks&rdquo;. We never meet any of these ourselves, but there are people who are so described by people outside politics.</P>
    <P>Some of these safe seats would undoubtedly go to people who have rendered certain services to the Party, which could range from services in active support at by-elections to financial services in providing funds. Now there is a suspicion, unworthy no doubt, in certain quarters that some of the financial support which is coming to Fianna Fáil for this campaign arises in the hope that some of those financial supporters will be allocated some of the safe seats. Indeed, there is some resentment amongst some members of the Party at this prospect, if what one hears in the corridors and rooms of this House carries any weight. So, the safe seat, a by-product of the single-seat system, will yield, I am pretty certain, both good and bad results. How one weighs that up and where one comes down on the balance is a matter of personal preference. I would find it hard myself to come down very strongly on one side or the other. There are gains and losses and it is hard to weigh one against the other.</P>
    <P>Most of what Senator Yeats had to say was soundly based and persuasive so far as it went, but it was not the whole story. There will be the problem of the unopposed seats in some areas, or a danger of it in any event. There will be the problem of some safe seats being used for people whom we would be better off without in Parliament, people who would neither add to the deliberations of Parliament nor be willing and able to provide the kind of services constituents want, people who cannot be elected under the present system because they are not prepared to work locally, people who <Col N="2360" /> would not, if elected through the safe seat system, do anything or add anything to the deliberations in the Dáil. We have to bear in mind that there is that loss to offset against the possible gain of some raising of the calibre of parliamentary representation at the other end of the spectrum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That loss would not apply to certain constituencies in Waterford and places like that? The Senator is assuming that it is always the Party hacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say anything of the kind. I said I believed all Parties would use this to bring in some good people who at present cannot readily get in or be got in. I said I believed it would also be used in other places for other purposes to get in Party hacks who are not even prepared to work for their constituents and who need a safe seat where they can get away with their laziness. I think both will happen. I do not deny that some good people will be brought in. I do not think we should necessarily assume that all the people brought in will be extremely worthy people who could not otherwise be elected and who will make great contributions. There are two sides to it and one is as likely to happen as the other. Both will happen in different places. Therefore, the argument on these grounds is one which has a certain validity. It is persuasive up to a point, but it is not totally compelling. I think it is open to anyone individually to come down on either side of that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, there is the argument about the unrepresentative character of a Parliament in which all Deputies are elected in single-member constituencies and the fact that this eliminates to a large degree, and could eliminate totally in certain extreme circumstances, the proportionality of representation. This is an argument which I said on Second Stage should command respect. We should be slow to initiate a departure from proportionality and fairness and equity of representation.  I do not think it is totally compelling in all circumstances to say that we should be tied always and <Col N="2361" /> at all times to achieving a maximum degree of proportionality even if this means we do not get more clear-cut majorities. The argument is a strong one but it is rebuttable if it can be shown that another system will yield slightly better majorities and will not undermine totally proportionality of representation and equity of representation.  I think the case could be made for some other system. I do not say the present system is perfect.</P>
    <P>There is another point which has been ignored in this House and pointedly ignored to the degree one cannot help noting as significant. I made the point on Second Stage that in the circumstances of this country's political geography this system will lead to very large majorities far beyond anything which arises under the British system with their political geography. These very large majorities will also be accompanied by great instability in parliamentary representation with as many as 30, 40 or even 50 seats in the Government Party changing hands at elections with the normal swing in votes which we experience at virtually all our elections. This is an aspect of the system on which the other side of the House have decided and I do not think they have honestly decided on it. I see some merits in the single-seat system but not compelling merits.</P>
    <P>If one feels the need to move towards a system of election with a slightly larger bias in favour of clear-cut majorities and a slightly less proportionality, it is certainly open to one to examine other systems that might yield this result. What one is not, in honesty, free to do is to favour this system because one sees merits in single-seat representation and to ignore completely the Irish Party system, with the particularly homogeneous character of Irish political geography, with the absence of a great mass of seats which are held in all circumstances in other countries. There will be political seats here but not in the same circumstances. To vote for the 35 to 45 percentage vote range, within which the two leading Parties fall at the moment and are likely to fall under any situation for many years to come, with, in those circumstances, the instability of the <Col N="2362" /> system, the huge majorities which will yield a huge turnover of seats, is not something which I think is acceptable.</P>
    <P>If one feels the present system is not perfect, if one feels it has serious defects, nevertheless one is not entitled to change it for a system which can be demonstrated to be one to produce results in the Irish context which are clearly undesirable. I am not arguing on the grounds that the fundamental system is wrong: it has undesirable features at any time but, in the circumstances of a country with a particular political geography, it can be so mitigated that the system may nevertheless be acceptable.</P>
    <P>All systems, including proportional representation, have undesirable features. In this country, with our political geography, these undesirable features will not be mitigated or limited but exaggerated to a degree that does not exist in any other country. The reason this system does not operate outside of about three or four countries&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is that it is unworkable, as a system yielding reasonable majorities and change-over in government, outside these countries with their peculiar and particular political geography.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should be very unwise to adopt an electoral system which has not been adopted in or which has been abandoned by other countries, a system which has been shown to be unworkable in any country with a homogeneous political geography. We should be very unwise to adopt such a system when it can clearly be shown that, in the Irish context, it will yield majorrities totally disproportionate to the votes and with a turnover of seats at elections which would undermine the willingness of people to go into politics because the chance of their being defeated at each election would be so high, on the average&mdash;unless one gets a safe seat. If they get a safe seat, they may be happy and they may be lazy. On the other hand, there may be seats which are so unsafe that the chances are evens or more than evens at each <Col N="2363" /> election that they will be material to lose them. That would not be a happy situation. In a great many cases, the safe seats could be occupied by Party hacks and the other seats by people of a rather speculative turn of mind whose occupations are such that they can take a chance of being thrown out of the Dáil at the next election.</P>

It is not enough to suggest they feel they have strong arguments to make against mine. The challenge is there before them.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we can proceed on the basis, first of all, that Senator FitzGerald does not like safe seats. I think we can accept that as his first premise. Secondly, we can marvel at the absolutely definite and conclusive results that are based entirely on the exclusion of what I should call a fundamental element in life, the personality of the candidate. I have never met such conclusion arguments based on the exclusion of the personality of the candidate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald took us on a tour and introduced figures at every nook and corner. It would be a very worthwhile exercise for Senator FitzGerald to go with us on the same tour when we might introduce him to personalities which would show him <Col N="2365" /> that all these ethereal notions that figures are the answer to all these problems will immediately be disproved. I take him as being a strong opponent of safe seats. It is fair to say that not less than 50 per cent, and probably more, in the Dáil at present occupy safe seats. There may be some who had had the unfortunate experience of Senator Rooney of finding his safe seat coveted by somebody&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not less than 50 per cent of the membership of the Dáil occupy safe seats. I do not think we need to name the people who would be regarded as safe. I can give the names afterwards: I do not wish to put them on the record. But, where a Government Party are particularly strong in a four-seat constituency, there is no doubt in the world that two members occupy safe seats. It is a fact of the Irish political scene at present that, where a Fine Gael candidate has one of three or four seats, it is equally almost the unanimous experience that his is a safe seat. The electorate in their wisdom will probably confine Fine Gael to the same representation, that is, one out of three or four, and will hardly be so unkind as not to give them that representation. I am quite certain from the ordinary experience of the people involved in the Lower House that 50 per cent would be prepared to concede to Senator FitzGerald that they occupy safe seats. So much for the abstract notion of what the figures may tell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hard to deal with anything at this stage in any sort of original fashion and if Senator FitzGerald is going to repeat the same arguments as before, it will be even more difficult. In any event, take the situation which Fianna Fáil at present experience more than any other other Party and which the other Parties must experience if they are going to achieve the political status they hope to achieve, the competition between Deputies of the same Party. This is something that the Labour Party have not experienced, nominating as they do one candidate for each constituency. Fine Gael <Col N="2366" /> have had a limited experience because their limited support does not warrant a situation whereby in most cases two members of their own Party are representatives for the same constituency. If the day comes to pass when they achieve that political status which they desire, they will realise that this competition is not at all desirable. Perhaps at the moment they have a little sympathy for Fianna Fáil Deputies who may be faced with this competition but in their time they will see that it is equally undesirable for Fine Gael and for Labour. This is the creature or the first child of the multi-seat constituency and it is certainly excluded from the single-seat constituency.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I want to mention and in this I will, despite the invitation of Senator FitzGerald, confine myself entirely to the balance of consideration between the single-seat constituency and the multi-seat constituency. In the single-seat constituency, the representative will have a smaller and more limited area and as Senator Yeats pointed out, he will be known for his achievement, for his status and he will be known in a more familiar way to the electorate than at present. This being so, representatives will be judged on the two aspects of their work. In many instances at present they are not being judged on both aspects. Where you have three or four representatives in a constituency, the electorate are quite satisfied if one or two of these devote their time to the main business, their legislative function, considering the legislation which comes before them, and if the other two devote themselves to the other business of looking after the personal problems of one sort or another.  By and large they feel that the job is being done by different people in different ways.</P>
    <P>All of us I am sure are anxious to see the day arrive when each man will as far as possible devote the major part of his time to what we all agree is the most important function, his legislative function. It is quite clear when one individual only represents a constituency, he will have to satisfy his electorate that he is doing this very important part of the work, that he is <Col N="2367" /> at national level, with which many of them at present are not concerned because other representatives are doing this for them, projecting the type of idea which the electorate want him to project. At the same time, he must not exclude himself from the personal problems in which so many of the electorate need to be assisted. I for one, having had as much experience as anybody in dealing with this type of problem, do not want to downgrade the experience one gets from coming in contact with people and their problems.  In fact it would be a very salutary experience for many to see the type of problems dealt with at weekend sessions in the country and in the city. They would see personified before them the type of problem representatives are concerned to solve. It is a very salutary and in many cases a very trying experience and it certainly is a very profitable one.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as saying that in promoting what I regard as the first duty of a representative, he should ignore the other duties. The second aspect of the work confers as much benefit on him as on the people he may assist. Both can be achieved in conjunction and this work must be done with the realisation that the essential job must at all times be in the forefront. I suggest that the electorate in their discretion and in their knowledge would have considerable regard to this particular aspect of a representative's activities. Far from increasing the load of what in many cases is regarded as useless work&mdash;and there is some useless work involved&mdash;the single-seat constituency would clearly reduce that load. The competition both from one's own Party and from other Parties will automatically go and you can offer yourself to the electorate as the man you are, for the work you do, to be accepted or rejected in the next election.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion has been that under the single-seat system the Party machine would move in. I cannot quote figures to support my argument, but I can point to a certain amount of experience and the attitude generally throughout the country is that where there is a man who is prominent in his <Col N="2368" /> community and who has proved that he has a significant contribution to make, then whatever Party may be involved would have a very difficult job over-riding his selection because he will be a well-known representative in a small area in comparison with the present extended area. If his achievement is such, no Party could overlook him and bring in some of the hacks about whom Senator FitzGerald is concerned. Therefore, with these limited constituencies it is obvious that one could see the emergence, not on any significant scale, where there are such individuals who may not be associated with any Party, of very prominent Independents. I do not see that this is at all impossible under this system and in such a limited constituency. Such Independents would be men of achievement and their contribution in the House would be very significant. What one should always have regard to in considering the single-seat constituency is the fact that we will be dealing with a quite limited area, an area in which each person will be fully aware of the ability of the man offering himself for selection and, on that basis, I think the man's ability will be a matter of most immediate concern.</P>
    <P>Another matter which Senator FitzGerald and those who oppose this suggestion must be reminded of is the fact that this will give rise to a situation in which potentially effective representatives will be given an opportunity of standing for election in a single-seat constituency, whereas, under the present system, they could never get that opportunity because, human nature being what it is, one could not expect a sitting TD to support or promote a promising fellow candidate who might well become the sitting TD after the next election. Human nature being what it is, the sitting TD would, if anything, promote the weak candidate. The result might well be that weak candidates might be promoted and supported while strong and able candidates might be impeded. If we looked at our own personal experiences, we can all of us think of a few such candidates who, if we did have a single-seat constituency, would now be sitting <Col N="2369" /> in the Dáil and would be a significant addition to that House. Under the multi-seat constituency, potential members may never get that opportunity.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as condemning the multi-seat constituency out of hand. It has its advantages. Neither do I want to be taken as referring to any particular case, but I think each one of us must concede that what I have said are the facts of the situation.  Far from being safe in a single-seat constituency, a representative must always be concerned with what the public reaction to his achievement is. This will keep him constantly on his toes in ensuring that the public do not become either tired of his image and antagonistic towards it, or determined to remove him from political activity. He will have to remain on his toes at every level of political life because he will be the only person on whom the electorate can focus their attention. Under PR there were four or five representatives. Under this proposed system, there will be only one and the electorate's attention will be devoted exclusively to him and to his achievement and on his maintaining his record, both inside and outside the House, will their continuing judgment and support for him be based. Whatever about the arguments in regard to the system of election, I should have thought that initially the whole House here would be in absolute agreement about the benefits to be derived from the single-seat constituency as compared with the multi-seat constituency. I am not at all surprised that Senator FitzGerald in his pretence of opposition to this notion could call on no better advocate in his favour to prove his position than these figures which are based entirely on the exclusion of the personality.</P>

      <P>I made my position clear on the Second Reading; we are opposed to these Bills and the quicker they are booted out by the people the better we will like it. However, in case it might be assumed we have no views about this, I want to put them briefly now. May I say that, after listening to weeks of debate. I have come to wonder <Col N="2370" /> more and more why people cannot make their point briefly and sit down. That is what I shall do.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the various views expressed on this, it is, I think, a fair comment that the single-seat constituency is good for the occupant but bad for the constituents and all the arguments I have heard so far convince me more and more on this point. We have been told about the evils of competition between Deputies of different political Parties, which is understandable, and also about competition between Deputies of the same Party sitting in the same constituency. We are told this is a bad thing. It may be uncomfortable for the occupants but I do not think it is necessarily a bad thing for the electorate and, surely, what we are concerned with is not the comfort of Deputies but the interests of the electorate, the people Deputies are supposed to represent in Parliament.</P>
      <P>We are told that the single seat would make things more comfortable and easier for Deputies because they would have a smaller area to represent.  Of course it would. A smaller area with no competition either in their own Party or from other Parties would make things much easier, but a Deputy elected in those circumstances would be the only public representative from that area and everybody would have to go to him. There would be no choice. This would not work with the ordinary Irish people. We tend to take our politics pretty seriously and I can well understand that people with strong political views or affiliations would not lightly or willingly go to a Deputy elected in a single-seat constituency if that Deputy comes from another Party. These are the facts of the situation. I know one can point to exceptions, but the general run of the people have strong political views and will not go to a Deputy who belongs to another Party. If this were to operate, they would have no choice, in which case they would probably not approach the Deputy at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Look at the position in Britain. Senator FitzGerald has made a point, which is not exactly comparable because there are differences. How does the system operate in Britain? I have <Col N="2371" /> spoken to Members of the British Parliament&mdash;most of us here have spoken to them on occasion&mdash;and the truth of the matter is that many of the Members representing constituencies in Britain have never been in their constituencies until they came to be chosen as candidates. That is quite different from the position here. A Deputy here ordinarily lives in his constituency, has contact with the people in his constituency, has to keep in touch with them; otherwise, he is in danger of losing his seat as a result of competition either within his own Party or from other political Parties. That is tough on him but it is good for his constituents.</P>
    <P>In Britain, on the other hand, a Member of Parliament in many cases does not live in the area he represents and probably has never seen it until he comes to a selection conference, either nominated by a trade union or whatever the Conservative organisation is, and is vetted. I believe the fashion now is that not alone do they vet the prospective candidate but also his wife. It is at that stage in all probability he first sees the constituency and comes into contact with some of the people in that constituency and a very select group of people, maybe 20 or so, which is in complete contrast to the sort of selection conferences that operate here in the political Parties. He meets a very select group who vet him and his wife and on whatever basis they have select that person. He then is the candidate. If he is elected, he continues, in practically all cases&mdash;and I have checked this with people I know &mdash;to live outside his constituency. He makes occasional visits to the constituency but the work is done by a paid official, what they call, I think, a parliamentary agent. He is there in the constituency, but the Member does not live there and only occasionally visits it, perhaps for a general election, <i>et cetera.</i> That is the position in Britain. I do not think that position would be acceptable to the electorate of this country. As I said, this is probably a much more suitable arrangement, much more comfortable, for the occupant of the seat but not to the benefit of the constituency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2372" /> I come now to my last point. All this, of course, is a matter of opinion I express, a guess as to what the position would be here if this system operated.  Equally, the people on the other side put forward their guesses as to what would happen if we adopted this change, if it were approved in the referendum. The whole point of my argument on this section and on the other sections is that there is no need to experiment. There is no need to take a risk on this matter. The present position of multi-seat constituencies is successful. It operates successfully. It has operated successfully in the life of the State. It has maintained parliamentary democracy in this country. We have no right to take a chance, to take a guess, to leap into the dark and say: &ldquo;This, in my opinion, in my guess, is what the position would be in Ireland if we changed this.&rdquo; That, I think, is irresponsible.</P>

      <P>The more I listen to this debate the more I am inclined to the belief that it would be a disadvantage to have only one TD representing a constituency. I believe that a sizeable majority of the electorate will vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; to this amendment of the Constitution when the opportunity presents itself for them to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about Deputies and the way they do or do not represent the public. I feel that the Irish people have placed a tremendous amount of trust in the public representatives down through the years. This stems, I think, from the tremendous work of eminent parliamentarians going back to O'Connell, Parnell, the Dillons, Davitt and a whole host of other eminent men. It is difficult for the Irish public to get the image of this type of parliamentarian out of their minds. People have commented here that Deputies were given too much of the wrong kind of work to do. This stems from the fact that before we were an independent State the ordinary man and woman had not that much <Col N="2373" /> trust in the Establishment as it was then and they relied on and placed their confidence in their elected representatives.  I believe that the Deputies of all Parties have, by and large, down through the years served the public well.</P>
    <P>I cannot forsee the ordinary voter throwing away the choice he now has of placing his case before any of three or five men who may be elected in his constituency and I think that this is a wise decision for him to take. As I see it, people approaching their TDs at the present time do not religiously go to a particular Party man. Each and every one of them has his own favourite choice, the one whom he feels will serve his particular case best. Ironically enough this man may not even be the person for whom he voted. I feel that the people will hold on to this position of having a number of people in each constituency from whom they know they will get this service and help and they will have one or other of them to champion their case. The position in this country in that regard is, perhaps, almost unique. The Deputies have given this great personal service and in many of the rural areas a Deputy knows, even in the larger constituencies, a tremendous number of people he represents.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I feel that when the ordinary voter gets down to marking the paper he will realise that if he votes for this amendment most certainly it means that he will no longer have the trusted friends who have served him over, perhaps, a few Dáil terms. I think the people are no fools and despite things that have been said to the contrary they understand the present system very well and operate it excellently. A change in the voting system would not bring any benefits to the ordinary member of the public. On the contrary, he would lose his choice of Deputy. Under the present system the ordinary voter has only one day out of three or four years, election day, in which he has to pick out the candidate to whom he will give his No. 1. Many of them vote 1, 2 and 3 down the line religiously, wishing, perhaps, that they could have given No. 1 to more than one. When one is watching a <Col N="2374" /> count one sees that many people vote not for Parties so much as for individuals.  They vote for the people whom they will approach if the occasion arises when they have problems. I think the Irish people will think twice before they make this change. They have done so before when there was a very attractive bit running alongside this proposition and when they get an opportunity this time they will in no uncertain terms register &ldquo;No&rdquo; against this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentMcHugh" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>On this question of the single-seat versus the multi-seat constituency, I should like to make a few points. The Fianna Fáil Party are determined to get this question through, irrespective of whatever arguments are used against them. One must query their motives. Why there is this insistence? One could understand a Minister coming before the Oireachtas and saying: &ldquo;This is a good idea, the single-seat constituencies&rdquo;. It depends on whether you agree with single-seat constituencies or not; but what is not understandable is the Minister and the Government coming before Parliament and saying: &ldquo;We will have single-seat constituencies, irrespective of what the opinion of Parliament is. The Government have decided; we have the strength and that is the position that will obtain.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When you have that attitude, then you ask yourself what is the reason? The reason is obvious. Fianna Fáil are seeking to ensure that whatever happens after the next election, the result will be a Fianna Fáil majority. They are not concerned whether or not it will be a Fianna Fáil majority with multi- or single seats, but they believe that under the multi-seat system, they will not be able any longer to command the majority they had in the past and, therefore, their only chance now is for the single seat, in other words &ldquo;go for broke&rdquo;. If we win, we do not care; if we lose, we are no worse than we were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one considers this position one finds it is at times amusing to listen to the Fianna Fáil Party put forward these arguments. They are utterly incapable of covering up their motives. They will use any argument, the first <Col N="2375" /> one that comes to their mind. People like myself who are backbenchers find it amusing to listen to the arguments with very little original thought at the end. You can see the trend right to the top. There is no original opinion. It would be amusing, as I say, to listen to all these except for the horrible thought that often strikes me. Fianna Fáil think the electors can be fooled. A more horrible thought than that is that Fianna Fáil believe it themselves at times. However, instead of being amused by these arguments, one is infuriated at the insistence of the same arguments, no matter how they are countered by intelligent argument from the other side. You seem to have this insistence that &ldquo;We are right; our arguments are right&rdquo; and nothing that can be said or done by the other side is of any use. This kind of thing is infuriating and would infuriate one intensely were it not amusing at times.</P>
    <P>One asks what is the motive. The motive is to try to get a majority. When they are looking for this majority, one would imagine that they would be able to come before either House of the Oireachtas and say that there is a clamour and a demand for this change. Occasionally some of them, singly, occasionally some of them together, when they get into full cry after the Leader of the House will show you where the demand comes from and suddenly one sees that it comes from the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis, from the 1,500 delegates of the Árd Fheis.</P>
    <P>I come from a constituency which is predominantly Fianna Fáil and I know something about what goes on at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis just as I know the calibre of the Fine Gael Árd Fheis and the Labour Árd Fheis. This Árd Fheis, no matter what anybody says, is an annual outing. All the local branches of the cumann go and have their say and they go home satisfied. We all know that. That is what these things are designed for, particularly when you have a Party like Fianna Fáil. I know the delegates. Some of them are friends of mine and many of them we have entertained in this House after the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis. I know what <Col N="2376" /> brings them here. It is the same as brings my own friends. They have no thoughts about making decisions. They come out to enjoy themselves. Admittedly many of them are very sincere, but they come to Dublin to the Árd Fheis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are told, a Chathaoirleach, that the decision and the clamour for the single-seat constituency, and against the single-seat constituency, if I am not wrong, was made at the Árd Fheis, not here. I think I am right in that, but you bring me back to my train of thought. I think the decision about the single-seat constituency was made at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis. You are as well aware as I am about what went on there, more so perhaps. I cannot help thinking in looking at the demand for the single-seat constituency made at the Árd Fheis how the Holy Ghost descended on these 1,500 delegates and inspired them. Therefore, the decision is made. To the strains of the legion of the rearguard? That is what we are told happened. When the Leader of the House or a Fianna Fáil Senator has no constructive thought and just gets up and says something, it has to be accepted as gospel by this side of the House. I wonder have we as representatives of the people to accept everything Fianna Fáil say. I want to quote for the House.</P>

      <P>I think I will follow the example of Senator O'Quigley rather than that of Senator FitzGerald. I think I have adequately dealt with the more general aspects of the proposals <Col N="2378" /> we are making. Senator O'Quigley maintained that there was not any demand for single-seat constituencies. I dealt with the question as to whether or not there was a demand for the overall proposals we are making when replying to the Second Reading debate. I pointed to the clear indications there were after the last general election that there was a likelihood of proposals being put forward to provide ourselves with a more rational and a more justifiable system of election and representation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of single seats as such, as has already been pointed out by other speakers from this side, a number of units of our organisation from different parts of the country had resolutions on the Clár of our annual Árd Fheis asking exactly this thing, that there should be single-seat constituencies established. Senator McHugh claims that the Ard Fheis consists of 1,500 people. I would have said that the total would have been nearer to 2,000.</P>

      <P>It is because we have been keeping in contact with the people that we have been able to retain their support. I repeat that I do not know of any body of people in this country who are more representative of a cross-section of the community than those at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis. There certainly is not any body of people that is more in contact with the people of the country as a whole than the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis, representing as it does every parish in the country from one end of it to the other. This Árd Fheis, this group of people, representative also of our organisation in the areas from which they were sent as delegates unanimously, as both myself and Senator Ó Maoláin believe, but if not absolutely unanimously, practically unanimously, requested this exact thing we are discussing, here, that is, that a system of parliamentary representation by means of single seats should be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that that constituted a unanimous demand from the people of the country but it certainly indicated that a large section of the people wanted this. As I said, there were other indications also which arose out of the unedifying and discreditable evidence produced by the long recounts, producing different results every time the votes were counted, that there was something amounting to a general expectation that the people would be given an opportunity of ridding themselves of this system of election and representation. In view of that fact that we ourselves in Government and in the Fianna Fáil Party were already aware of the many advantages of single-seat <Col N="2380" /> constituencies and the many disadvantages and evils of multi-seat constituencies, we decided to accede to the demands made at our Árd Fheis and to the expectations of the public in general and put forward proposals for a system of representation based on single-seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need deal with Senator O'Quigley's reference to the various projections that have been made by people who like to indulge in attempts to forecast the future with regard to the number of Deputies that Fianna Fáil may obtain under the system we propose. Senator O'Quigley described it as the obtaining of 90-odd Members. I think Senator FitzGerald was even more optimistic on our behalf. I will agree with both of these distinguished Senators that it is quite likely that Fianna Fáil will continue for some time in the future to retain the support of the majority in the country.</P>

      <P>I would, however, like to make some further references to this question of safe seats. On this aspect, the Fine Gael Party display even more definitely than on some others their facility for taking two contrary viewpoints at the same time. We have had a number of Fine Gael Senators here taking the same attitude as nearly all the Fine Gael Deputies in the Dáil took&mdash;not all, but nearly all&mdash;that there would be a large number of these safe seats all over the country and at the same time, we had some Senators here, the same as we had a few Deputies in the Dáil, saying that this country was a different type of country, that we had a more homogeneous community here and these constituencies with definite traditional voting patterns did not exist here.</P>

As I say, Senator Dooge and others maintained that this was not the position and at the same time, others of the Opposition based part of their case on the emergence of these safe seats all over the country. I pointed out before, and other Senators on this side who have spoken pointed out again here, that it is under the present system that safe seats develop.</P>

      <P>It is possible to have safe seats where there are large constituencies, <Col N="2382" /> that where a comparatively small quota of votes can be gathered up and also where there is this extraordinary and unjustifiable provision for the allotting of votes to candidates for whom they were not cast at all. It is in these circumstances that Deputies can acquire, and have acquired, safe seats to the disadvantage of the electorate in the constituencies concerned. As I say, I do not want to attempt to compete with the eminent Senators on the Fine Gael Front Bench in forecasting what will happen.</P>

      <P>In so far as Fine Gael are concerned, this is decided at Party headquarters but in so far as we are concerned, it is decided by democratically summoned and constituted local conventions. So we have this argument that is put forward by the Fine Gael Party, first of all, that we are a homogeneous society and that therefore there are not these strong areas where the people will continue to vote for the same Party. Secondly, we have the argument that there will be these safe seats to be allocated to Party hacks. As I say, the fact of the matter is that there will not be these safe seats and secondly, that so far as we are concerned our system would not permit of the allocation of seats in this way and, thirdly, we have not got that degree of contempt for the intelligence of the electorate that, even if it were possible to select candidates from Party headquarters, we would not do it because we know the electorate, quite apart from our own organisation, would have too much intelligence to accept that sort of imposition. If we had that degree of contempt for the people's intelligence, then, of course, we would have no more representation in the Dáil than the Fine Gael Party has. These safe seats just do not exist and, in my opinion, will not exist and, even if they do, in so far as we are concerned, at any rate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Senator went on to say that he does not know how the constituencies will be drawn up. Of course he does. If he read the Bill, he knows that it is provided in the Bill that they will be drawn up by the Constituency Commission. He maintains that our argument is based on the assumption that people must necessarily go to Deputies to obtain things which are theirs of right&mdash;conferred on them by legislation passed by the Oireachtas. Of course, we do not base our argument on any such assumption. It is quite clear that there will inevitably be much less of this type of activity under the system we propose. But in present circumstances in which Deputies are in competition, this will obviously tend to become even more common. This is because Deputies are in competition and any Deputy who wants to disabuse his constituents of this idea&mdash;I admit it exists among our people because it has been fostered by the system of multi-member constituencies&mdash;will find that his colleagues, and even possibly his colleagues in his own Party, will undermine any such attempt. But under the system of single-seat constituencies, it will be possible to disabuse the people of this belief.</P>
      <P>In addition, because single-seat constituencies will be of more reasonable size, it will be possible for Deputies to really attend to local matters that require attention. There are such things but under the present system, when Deputies are cluttered up with a lot of things that do not really need attention and when the constituencies are too big to allow them keep in touch with them, the things that really require attention are perforce often deprived of proper attention from the local representatives and are not adequately dealt with by them. It is quite clear the people will gain in better representation from the system of single-seat constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, it must be obvious that the Civil Service will become more efficient. First of all, a lot of unnecessary matters will not be the subject of representations at all. In regard to those on which representations are made, there will only be the one letter instead of three, four or five letters at <Col N="2385" /> present to Deputies and letters also to Senators and county councillors.</P>
    <P>Senator Rooney asked me how I will ensure that county boundaries will not be breached under the system of single-seat constituencies. As Senator Rooney should know, this will not be a matter for me. It will be a matter for the Constituency Commission which is provided for in this Bill. In spite of the terrific effort made by the Opposition Parties to insert a second Commission in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, it is really amazing that they were able to ignore the fact there is provision in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill for a Commission. On the Bill where there is not a Constituency Commission, they were making all sorts of allegations about the necessity for it. But where there is provision for it they just ignore it and assume the Commission equals the Minister.</P>

      <P>It so impressed the Senators that they wanted two Commissions instead of one. But, when it is in, they assume it is of no consequence at all. Again, obviously they are merely repeating parrot-like the arguments they made the last time in 1959. But their attitude to the Constituency Commission in 1959 was quite different from the attitude they have taken up now. In 1959 they said there should not be any Commission at all and they put down an amendment proposing to delete the proposal for a Constituency Commission. Instead, they said the Minister should <Col N="2386" /> take the responsibility for it, that he should bring it into the Dáil, where it could be discussed in the open light of day with the press looking on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>But it was because of the interruptions, a Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>To reply to Senator Rooney, it will not be my responsibility to try to avoid the breaching of county boundaries, but it will be the responsibility of the Commission. They will be required to do so by the provisions of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill. Even the courts can be asked to rule on the situation and I have no doubt that the lawyer members of the Opposition, who specialise in constitutional wrangling, will make sure it will be done.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinlan sympathised with Deputies because of all the unnecessary representations they have to make. Of course, he ignored the fact that this arises largely from the fact that they are Deputies in multi-member constituencies.  He said that the calibre of Deputies should be improved. The system we are proposing of single-seat constituencies will gradually do that. Each Deputy will be isolated in his constituency and his constituents will be able to see him as the sole representative of the constituency. If he does not measure up to the required standards they will replace him if they are wise; and, if the Parties are wise, they will give the people suitable candidates from which to choose a better representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I could interpret what Senator Quinlan said, he appeared to admit that this system was likely to produce good candidates from all <Col N="2387" /> Parties and that we were likely to have good candidates opposing one another. Although Senator Quinlan argued there was a need to improve the calibre of candidates, on the other hand, when he came down to saying we could have good candidates from different Parties opposing one another and only one could be elected, he also saw something objectionable in this. I would have thought it an obvious advantage of the system that each Party would find themselves compelled by the circumstances to put forward the best candidate in each constituency, to put forward the 144 best people they could find on the basis of selecting people appropriate to different constituencies, whereas in the present system that incentive obviously is not there. Senator Quinlan does not have to go outside his own Party of Fine Gael&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon &mdash;the &ldquo;rugged Independent&rdquo; again. He does not have to go outside his colleagues in Fine Gael to see this built-in disincentive for the selection of the best candidates because of the multi-member constituencies. That is exemplified by what happened in the constituency of Dublin North-East, to which I referred already, where the two sitting Deputies found it necessary in response to the instinct of self-preservation to eliminate from their Party a potential danger, a person who was obviously a potential Deputy, but in the system we propose the potential Deputy would be the most desirable addition to any Party and there would not be this built-in incentive to eliminate such people. Rather they could be nurtured and encouraged in the hope that they would build up the Party to a greater number of seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinlan apparently wants only one good candidate per constituency.  I agree that if that situation did obtain we probably would arrive at the situation where we would have safe seats because people would have sufficient intelligence to choose the only one good candidate, if that is all there was. It is quite desirable on the other <Col N="2388" /> hand that all the candidates standing for election should be good candidates and that the people should be able to make a choice between them.</P>
    <P>I come now to Senator FitzGerald and, as usual, it is hard to know what he is in favour of. He agreed that there were arguments in favour of the single-seat constituency and I was beginning to wonder was it possible that the two Leaders of the Fine Gael Party were outvoted at the famous all-night session; both Deputy Cosgrave who was in favour of our proposal and was known to be in favour of it and who is the titular Leader of the Party, as well as Senator FitzGerald who, during the debate here has been giving undertakings on behalf of his Party, as he describes it. Apparently, both of them were outvoted by the rank and file of the Party but apparently they are both still the Leader of the Party. I must say it is a rather peculiar position&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <P>How anybody could be expected to accept Senator FitzGerald's undertaking on behalf of his Party when not even the Leader of the Party can speak for Fine Gael, I do not know. Apparently, both were outvoted, the official Leader and the power behind the throne, the drafter of such policies as the recent one for the elimination of the rural community. Senator FitzGerald went on to speak about &ldquo;huge swings&rdquo; and challenged comment on that. He suggested these are going to occur under the present system. That is another characteristic of the Senator. He makes statements without any substantiation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not object to him assuming that something is so because he has said it is so but for everybody else to assume that because he says a thing is so, it is so, is too much. Much as I dislike to deflate his opinion of himself I must tell him that so far as we on <Col N="2389" /> this side of the House are concerned, so far from assuming that because Senator FitzGerald says such a thing is so, it is so, or more definitely still, so far from assuming that because he says something will be so, it will be so, we believe it is more likely to be wrong than right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>He has an extraordinary facility for using diametrically opposed arguments because he followed on this assumption that there would be huge swings because of the non-existence of safe seats, by saying that there will be a liberal supply of safe seats for people whom he described as ornaments, for people who would be useful additions to the Dáil but who the people would not elect except for the existence of safe seats, and for people he described as political Party hacks and for a fourth category, substantial subscribers to Party funds. We are going to have this supply of safe seats and in addition we are going to have huge swings because of the non-existence of safe seats, according to Senator FitzGerald.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator seemed to be affronted because I did not deal with this assertion of his that there would be these huge swings.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Murphy alleges that the whole idea behind this proposal of single-seat constituencies is the comfort of Deputies and the elimination of competition between Deputies of the same Party. The question of the comfort of Deputies does not arise at all although I do think, as did the British Royal Commission which considered the possibility of introducing this system into that country, that a strong argument against the present system is the disproportionate effort and expense and, as the commission says, the unnecessary electoral turmoil involved in by-elections. I think there is a disproportionate effort involved in covering large constituencies, in order to elect a fraction of the representation of these constituencies. For instance, in the recent by-election in East Limerick all parties tacitly agreed that the seat was a Limerick city seat, but despite that, we all found it necessary to go <Col N="2391" /> down and canvass the extensive constituency of East Limerick, including rural areas. And Senator FitzGerald found it necessary to organise the disruption of Fianna Fáil meetings and so on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On Senator Murphy's point about the comfort of Deputies, as I say, although this was a Limerick city seat, the whole constituency had to be involved in the election.  You can take any other constituency you like in which there were <Col N="2392" /> by-elections. For instance, in the constituency of Clare, the whole constituency had to be canvassed, had to be brought to the polls, and all the necessary administrative arrangements over the whole constituency had to be made in order to elect one-quarter of the representation.</P>
      <P>While as I say, the question of the comfort of Deputies is not the reason for bringing in this Bill, it is obvious that if in Clare only an area appropriate to the job in hands had to be covered, and that would be a quarter of the constituency, and, similarly in Wicklow, one-third of the constituency, then there would have been, for one thing, less disruption of the proceedings of the Dáil and Seanad and, for another thing, there would have been less demands on the stamina and fewer adverse effects on the health of Deputies, because a smaller number could have been employed and it would not be necessary to press people into service who possibly were not in a fit condition to undertake that kind of activity at the particular time.</P>
      <P>The smaller area will result in better representation for the people and also better attention to local matters requiring attention. It will also provide a better opportunity to the elected representative of the people to attend responsibly to his fundamental duty as a Member of the Legislature.</P>
      <P>I think it was Senator Murphy also who put forward the rather naive suggestion that people would not go to a Deputy of another Party. I wish Senator Murphy could see some of the files either of the Department of Local Government or of the Department of Social Welfare and he would see that not alone will they go to Deputies of other Parties but that they will go to every Deputy, to every Senator and possibly to every county councillor as well. He will see the vast amount of unnecessary work that is involved for the Civil Service in ensuring that these people who make representations get the exact same reply in the exact same terms and at the exact same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Far from people not being prepared to go to a Deputy of more than one Party, I remember the first week that I <Col N="2393" /> became Minister for Defence, I got a very gratifying type of letter from an individual who welcomed me to the Department. Although he was not from my own constituency, I was pleased that he had such a high opinion of me. He welcomed me back and welcomed the fact, in particular, that the &ldquo;other crowd&rdquo;, as he referred to them, had been got rid of. Having dealt adequately with the merits of the Fianna Fáil Party down the years and the demerits of their opponents, he said that no doubt the pension of which he had been unjustly deprived for political reasons by my predecessor, General MacEoin, would now be awarded to him.</P>
    <P>It was a fairly voluminous file, and I looked back to see just what exactly the case was and how General MacEoin had so maliciously deprived this man of his pension. I came on a letter with some date in 1954 where General MacEoin, having been addressed &ldquo;Dear Seán&rdquo;&mdash;I had been addressed &ldquo;Dear Kevin&rdquo;&mdash;had been welcomed back to the Department. The correspondent thanked God that the &ldquo;other crowd&rdquo; who, in this letter, were Fianna Fáil, had been got rid of. I leave it to the Senators opposite to imagine the disparaging references that he made, for instance, in respect of the Taoiseach who had been displaced in 1954, because they would be well able to supply this type of reference themselves.</P>
    <P>Investigating the file further I found a similar letter addressed &ldquo;Dear Oscar&rdquo;. It welcomed back the late Mr. Oscar Traynor as Minister for Justice, and described the appalling injustice that the late Deputy Dr. T.F. O'Higgins had inflicted on this individual by depriving him of a pension over the years. There were all the disparaging references to Blueshirts and so on, and now he was quite sure that justice was going to be done.</P>
    <P>There was a similar letter in 1948 welcoming the eventual emergence of the only decent Party in the State, Fine Gael, and the fact that at last the iniquitous Fianna Fáil Party had been got rid of, and no doubt now the pension that this gentleman had been deprived of would eventually be received by him.</P>

      <P>As I said, the file on practically every social welfare benefit and the file on practically every local government grant will disclose that in practically every case in which representations are made by a Deputy of one Party they are made by Deputies of every Party, and also as a general rule by Senators who happen to be located in the area, and in many cases also by the local county councillors.</P>
      <P>I do not know that there is any need to refer, certainly in any great detail, to Senator McHugh's contribution. He alleges the Government have decided, by virtue of their majority, that they are going to have this system of single seats. We have not decided that at all, because we cannot decide it. What we have decided is that the people will be given an opportunity of providing for themselves this more normal and rational system of representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt already, and other Senators here have dealt already, with the suggestion that the purpose of this proposal to have single-seat constituencies is to perpetuate Fianna Fáil, and that that will be its inevitable effect. I have invited Senators opposite to explain just why this should perpetuate Fianna Fáil, just why it is that, although they continue to contend that their proposals for the conduct of the country's affairs are better than ours, and just why, in circumstances that we propose here of a clear confrontation in every constituency between the best candidates that each Party can get to put these proposals before the people, it should be that Fianna Fáil will be <Col N="2395" /> perpetuated in Government, circumstances in which, for instance, outstanding Fianna Fáil Deputies like the Taoiseach and Deputy Seán Lemass and my gracious colleague, Deputy P.J. Burke, will be able to elect themselves only and every Fianna Fáil candidate will have to stand on his own feet. Apparently this must result in the perpetuation in office of Fianna Fáil because in addition every Opposition candidate will have to stand on his own feet also. No doubt it is because of the fact that there are prominent members of the Fine Gael Party who do not stand on their own feet that people like the senior Deputy for Laois-Offaly are so definitely in favour of the proposals we are making.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clear up one or two points. The first is in relation to the safe seats. What has been said can be summed up by saying that under the multi-seat system, which we have at present, seats are made safe by the excellence of the candidates concerned and by the contributions which they made in Government or in Opposition, but under the single-seat system, seats will be made safe largely by the voting strength of the Party at that period. No individual contribution will be nearly as significant as it is at present under the multi-seat system. Any member who has performed well in the outgoing Parliament is pretty certain to be re-elected under the multi-seat system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister twisted what I said about one candidate marking another. When we have an outgoing Government, Ministers will all be experienced and will be worthy of being representatives in Parliament, although they may not be fancied by everyone as Ministers. Practically all outgoing Ministers would be a considerable asset to a new Parliament. At present outgoing Ministers are pretty certain of re-election even if there is a strong swing against their Party. They will not be defeated, and quite rightly so. On the other hand, in a single-seat constituency the Opposition have got to decide either to give the Minister a walk-over or put up an outstanding <Col N="2396" /> man to oppose him if they think there is a chance of defeating him. The result is there are two good candidates in competition with each other. We need both in Parliament and only one can succeed.</P>
    <P>In the vast majority of constituencies, there will be candidates competing who could not compete with either of the two I have mentioned. This is further aggravated by the television age when confrontations of Parties are becoming the rage of the time. In future if we have single seaters, we will have confrontations between those seeking election. Again a big man has to be put up to mark another big man. This will lead to great waste.</P>
    <P>The Minister harked back to the long counts. I can assure the Minister that by next week I hope to be able to present to him with my compliments a fully operational electric computer that can carry out any count, whether it is for a Seanad Éireann election, a students' council election in the universities, the Labour Party executive election or any other election under the rational process of PR.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister argued the long counts against the multi-seat constituencies. This has been running through the debate in recent weeks. I can assure the Minister that there are good tidings in store for him and in future he can drop that argument.  It will be like someone saying you cannot go to America because it is too far and the sailing ship takes 30 days&mdash;a person who never heard of the jet age or of jets going to America in five or six hours. We will have another system within ten years whether in the single-seat or the multi-seat system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy made a balanced speech but he appeared to me to attach too much weight to how the legislators will be judged as between dealing with constituency problems and legislative work. A legislator who spends his time legislating is pretty certain to be returned under the multi-seat system and the person who devotes his time to <Col N="2397" /> other questions also has a following. Therefore it gives a wider choice.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Kennedy also suggested that a sitting TD at present promotes a weaker candidate, that is to say, that a TD who is selected to contest one area will have a very strong say in who will contest a neighbouring area. Are we to believe the Minister when he says that every single-seat constituency will be a republic in its own right? Are we to have republics within county boundaries and single-seat constituencies with inner republics and the local Party bosses, whoever they may be, making the choice unfettered and unlettered? We are generating into a series of mini republics and I do not think that is the way to progress. I do not believe that at the present stage of our development the electorate will give up the freedom and influence they exercise in selecting their representatives from candidates proposed to them by the Parties.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinlan's purpose, apparently, in getting up was principally to re-state that, in his opinion, the single-seat system will give rise to safe seats. The Opposition can have it both ways and are insisting on having it both ways. Senator FitzGerald said there would not be safe seats. Senator FitzGerald maintained that the calibre of the Opposition will be reduced, on a change of Government, because Ministers are the most likely to be defeated. On the other hand, his colleague, Senator Quinlan, said Ministers could not be defeated in any circumstances under this system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly was. He went on to allege that one of the main arguments used in favour of this proposal is the fact that there were long recounts at the last general election. It is not the actual length of the recounts that I think proved so unedifying to the public as the obvious fact that each count could produce a different result. This undermined confidence in the system. It disclosed that the element of <Col N="2399" /> chance which arises from the random selection of votes for redistribution plays a very significant part in the result in circumstances where there is a close result and that, in fact, depending on where the group of votes for distribution is taken from, one candidate or another could be elected. It would be just as logical, just as justifiable, to toss a coin as to base the decision on a count carried out under this present system.</P>
      <P>With regard to local authority elections, as Senator FitzGerald knows, the system of election to local authorities is not specified in the Constitution and that does not need a referendum to deal with it: it can be dealt with by legislation. In fact, at one stage, the Fianna Fáil Party had put legislation through the two Houses of the Oireachtas to establish a system of single-seat constituencies but fell for the gimmick that has been tried here, namely, accepted a minor amendment in the Seanad and a general election came and ensured that that did not happen. That seems to be the only hope the Opposition would have now, that they would succeed in getting an amendment accepted here which would delay the proposals so that it would be too near to the date of a general election to put them into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of what the Minister said does not merit a reply but there seems to be confusion on what I said in relation to safe seats. The Minister may genuinely have misunderstood what was said on this point. Under the single-seat system, some seats will have a degree of safety which cannot attach to any seat under the multi-seat system. Therefore, for some seats, the degree of safety is enhanced. They become much safer for individuals than they could conceivably be under the multi-seat system under which, if a man does not work for his constituents and is not active in public life, he can be displaced by another colleague, which does not happen in the single-seat constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2400" /> In the Irish situation, where the number of safe seats will be less than in Britain because there is not the uneven distribution of political allegiances that there is in Britain, the swing in the range between 35 to 45 per cent of the vote will be far greater than in Britain. There is no contradiction whatever between these two statements. The number of safe seats will be much less than in Britain and therefore the swing will be much wider&mdash;but the safe seats will be much safer than is the case under the present system with the multi-seat constituency. No Deputy can feel completely safe under the multi-seat system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pleasure in assuring the Minister and the House that this element of chance, which he has suddenly awakened to as being present in a very microscopic way in the present proportional representation elections, will totally be eliminated by the computer programme with which I hope to present him next week&mdash; another great argument gone, unfortunately, for the Minister. That, unfortunately, is the price the Minister has to pay for scientific progress. He has to keep his system up-to-date, too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator FitzGerald has made a very lame attempt to justify his adopting two completely diametrically opposed assumptions in opposing this. He now says it is the degree of safety he is taking into account. I do not think there can be anything more safe than that some Deputies have retained their seats right from the institution of this Parliament up to the present day. If any seat could be safer than that under the system we propose, it would be a very safe seat indeed. It is absolutely clear that it is under the conditions of multi-seat constituencies that seats can in fact be safe. Needless to say, the number of safe seats will be fewer here. The total number of seats here is also much less than in Britain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinlan maintains that it is only in a microscopic way that this element of chance <Col N="2401" /> has influenced elections here. In practically every close result in which a surplus was distributed, this element of chance has entered into the final result. Senator Quinlan maintains that this will be eliminated by computer. In fact, the electoral system can be changed only by referendum. I do not think you can substitute a computer for a referendum, as I understand it. The system is described in the Constitution.  If Senators opposite maintain that it is permissible to alter the actual rules for the single transferable vote, that could solve a lot of problems if you could do that without breach of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>This would need to be done if the element of chance is to be eliminated whether by Senator Quinlan's computer or by any other means.</P>
