    <Title>Fishery Harbour Centres Bill, 1967: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's intention to develop the major fishery harbour centres provided for in this Bill was originally set out in the Programme for Economic Expansion and details of the development plans were published later in various announcements about the programme of sea fisheries development.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to make statutory provision for the establishment and development of five major fishery harbour centres at Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Killybegs, Galway, and Howth and also to provide powers for the acquisition, by agreement or compulsorily, of lands required for these centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of the major fishery harbour centres arises from the need to concentrate our main fishery activities at specially developed modern fishery harbours having adequate berthage, flotation and shore facilities for our expanding fishing fleet. The development <Col N="292" /> of these centres is also essential for the national organisation of the fishing industry and the centralisation of activities in regional areas in the processing and marketing fields.</P>
    <P>The selection of the five harbour centres mentioned in the Bill was based on a report made by a renowned Swedish harbour consultant, Mr. Carl. G. Bjuke, who carried out an intensive survey of the Irish coastline and its various ports and fish landing places. His report, which was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, was a comprehensive document and provided most useful information and recommendations on plans for fishery harbour development.</P>
    <P>Since then, work on the provision of the new harbour centres at Dunmore East, Castletownbere and Killybegs has been in progress at a cost of over £½ million, involving preparatory work, dredging, the re-shaping of harbour areas by reclamation and the provision of new landing and berthing piers. It is estimated that a further £230,000 will be spent at these three centres in the current financial year. Preparatory work has been completed also at the other two centres&mdash;Howth and Galway. At Howth extensive dredging is at present in progress and a new design for the Galway major fishery harbour has been adopted to facilitate recent expansion in activity at the nearby commercial harbour centre. The general development of all five centres is designed to be carried out in stages and the work in progress now at Dunmore East, Castletownbere and Killybegs is at stage one. The other stages for which plans are already drafted will be undertaken when there is satisfactory evidence that they are required to meet current or anticipated further growth in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>It was envisaged from the outset that legislation would be required to facilitate the acquisition of land needed for the new harbour works and to set up the machinery for the control and operation of the new harbour centres. The stage has now been reached when it is appropriate to enact the legislation and so this Bill now comes before the House. To facilitate Senators in their consideration of the Bill, I would like <Col N="293" /> to explain in broad terms the various provisions contained in it.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill will empower the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to declare and define the harbour areas which are to be established and developed as fishery harbour centres. Orders made under this section will transfer to the Minister's control each of the five harbours named in the Schedule and constitute in him a new and single harbour authority responsible for their maintenance, operation, management and development. The object of acquiring lands adjoining the harbours is to ensure that adequate space will be made available not only for the building of the harbour but also for essential shore-based activities including, for example, fish processing industries.</P>
    <P>It is intended to include in a harbour centre only such area of land as will be absolutely necessary for the development of the centre. The effect of a fishery harbour centre order will be to transfer and vest in the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the harbour and any land which shall be the subject of that order together with any other assets and liabilities of the existing harbour authority. Existing harbour authorities and their officers will cease to carry out any function in relation to the harbours and for the future the Minister will exercise these functions.</P>
    <P>The effect of the orders will be to transfer to me Castletownbere Harbour from Cork County Council; Dunmore East and Howth Harbours from the Commissioners of Public Works; and Killybegs Harbour from Killybegs Harbour Commissioners. The latter will then stand dissolved. In the case of Galway, the new fishery harbour centre will be adjacent to the commercial harbour which will continue to be the responsibility of Galway Harbour Commissioners. The provision in this section relating to the prior consent of the Minister for Transport and Power to the making of a fishery harbour centre order refers to Killybegs harbour and also to Galway commercial harbour in so far as the proposed fishery harbour centre at Galway may impinge slightly on <Col N="294" /> the area within the jurisdiction of Galway Harbour Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Safeguards are provided in this section for any person who may be affected by a fishery harbour centre order. This is ensured by the requirement that notice must be given of my intention to make the order and consideration must be given to objections raised. If the objections are not withdrawn a public inquiry may be held.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, adequate space will be required at fishery harbour centres to provide for essential harbour and shore facilities. The shore facilities include the servicing of fishing vessels, space for the handling and sale of fish, fish processing industries and also facilities for boat repairs and maintenance. Some land has already been acquired for these purposes at the centres by agreement with the owners but due to difficulties about title in some cases and because of failure to reach agreement or unwillingness to sell in others, it is necessary to seek statutory powers for compulsory acquisition.</P>
    <P>Provisions to that effect are made in section 3 which relates to the acquisition of land <i>et cetera</i> in fishery harbour centres held other than by harbour authorities. This section is drafted on standard lines and contains the customary provisions. In addition, there is a special provision whereby land, or rights in relation to land or water used in connection with the operation of commercial shipping or the exercise of the public right of navigation, shall not be acquired compulsorily without the consent of the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>Provisions are made in section 4 of the Bill to give the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the necessary powers to carry out his future functions in the management, control, operation and development of each of the five fishery harbour centres. This section will enable me to make whatever bye-laws are necessary and to make orders fixing rates, tolls and other charges for the use of facilities and services in the harbour centres.</P>
    <P>Existing orders, regulations and bye-laws relating to the harbours which are in force at the time of transfer will continue to apply to the harbours in <Col N="295" /> question until they are amended or revoked. In addition to having the responsibility of providing adequate facilities at each centre for the sale of fish landed at the centres, the section will enable the Minister to require that fish landed at the centre be offered for sale at the centre and will also enable him to specify the manner in which sales shall be conducted. Whether it will be necessary to use any or all of these powers will depend on the circumstances obtaining from time to time.</P>
    <P>It will be obligatory on the Minister to publish notice whenever he intends to make orders or bye-laws relating to the future management and control of the five harbour centres. He must also state the purposes for which they are to be made. The customary period of 21 days is specified within which interested persons may submit objections to the proposed instruments and consideration must be given to any objections raised. Having considered the objections, the Minister may make the order or bye-law with or without modifications as he may think proper. Notice of the making of the order or bye-law must be published in<i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> The usual provision is also made for penalties on persons or bodies who contravene orders or bye-laws or who may be involved in such contraventions.</P>
    <P>In section 3 provision is made whereby the Minister may with the consent of the Minister for Finance delegate any one or more of his powers relating to the acquisition of land in fishery harbour centres to the Commissioners of Public Works. As it may also be convenient and economical for the Minister to delegate some of his powers and functions relating to the management, control and maintenance of any one or more of the five harbour centres, a similar provision is made in section 4 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>To facilitate financial control and accountancy in the provision and operation of the major fishery harbours, the Bill establishes a special fund to be known as the Fishery Harbour Centres Fund. The account of this fund, which will be audited by <Col N="296" /> the Comptroller and Auditor General each year and laid before each House of the Oireachtas, will indicate the annual income and expenditure related to the fishery harbour centres. All moneys received in respect of rates, tolls and other charges and the non-repayable grants referred to in section 7 will be paid into this fund. Out of the fund will be paid all outlay and expenditure in connection with the operation of the harbours.</P>
    <P>The five harbour centres&mdash;Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Galway, Killybegs and Howth&mdash;are reasonably well distributed around the coast. With the good berthage, shelter and flotation which they will give to our growing fishing fleet together with the first-class shore facilities which they will offer for fish processing and ancillary industries, I am satisfied that they will assist considerably in the expansion and economic development of our sea fishing industry in general.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that this proposal was referred to in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion. It is a matter for concern that it has taken so long to get to the point of doing something about it. We are at the point of preparation for the Third Programme before the first steps of implementing this stage of the Second Programme have even been considered. Everybody on this side of the House shares in the sense of frustration that the potential which this industry has of being exploited during the whole period of the independence of this State has not been achieved in the way everybody had hoped. Our role in the development of the potential of this industry is no credit to us because after 50 years the fishing industry is on a scale so small as to be almost incredible in relation to the riches which lie around our coasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, during the past few years some progress has been made and the reorganisation of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara on a much more effective basis has given us the first real prospect of a breakthrough in this respect. The problem now is no longer so much the <Col N="297" /> inadequacy of facilities for reorganising the industry&mdash;the resistance of fishermen to change is no longer an obstacle as it had been until recent times. Had money been provided, it might not have been easy to spend it usefully and effectively. This is no longer true and those who are now concerned about the industry feel it could usefully be endowed with more financial resources than it receives.</P>
    <P>The capital investment in the fishing industry is very small as a fraction of the total Capital Budget and though this is in line with past arrangements, and though the sums allocated to the industry are greater than in the past, it is now under-financed in relation to the prospects of getting useful returns in relation to the moneys invested. This is an aspect of the Capital Budget to which more concern should be given because there is now the interest in the industry; it is now so much better organised; there are people interested in developing the industry, in being trained for the industry&mdash;there is growth, expansion and ability in the industry which had been lacking for a long time. By giving more money for boats and, as in this Bill, for the development of harbours, there is a real prospect of securing very rapid growth in the industry.</P>
    <P>It may be that the growth prospects here are greater than in any other sector of our national life and for that reason this Bill is welcome as a useful, if very belated, step in the right direction. The concentration on a number of fishery centres is sensible if we are to establish a fishing industry with potential of a size sufficient to be efficient and effective in our conditions and the shore facilities needed for this purpose. We cannot hope to developevery little harbour around our coasts but we should hope to provide facilities sufficient to handle the scale of activity required if the industry is to be expanded.</P>
    <P>I hope that in this development we shall have the co-operation of the fishermen and it is a hopeful sign that there is much more interest in the industry and in expanding it, a much more open mind towards change, than in earlier years. Nevertheless, in recent <Col N="298" /> years we have had the problems at Dunmore East which jeopardised the targets set for the industry in the Second Programme for Economic Expansion. Unless we can be guaranteed that these problems can be solved, we cannot expect to achieve the full potential in the industry of which it is capable. I do not think the Minister has been able to overcome the problems that gave rise to these difficulties. He mentions in his opening statement in a very general way proposals for developing these harbours and they seem to be flexible and not at this stage to be very concrete in form as he talks of certain developments taking place as and when the demand for them arises. I think it would be useful at this stage if he could consider publishing some kind of White Paper or statement which would set out in detail the proposals for the development of these harbours and roughly the different stages involved. One would of course recognise that the timing of these different stages of development is something about which he would not want to be too precise at this stage but it would be useful for the fishing industry and for the people of the locality concerned to see in some detail what exactly is proposed for each harbour, what area of land will have to be acquired, what kind of facilities will be established, what the capacity of the port will be at various stages, what the ultimate plans are for the maximum development when this job is finished. I think the fishing industry should know a little more than the rather vague statements in the Minister's opening remarks. I do not fault him for that because if he had gone into great detail some of us individually might not know enough about the different centres to be interested, but from the point of view of the public interest generally and the fishing industry in particular, he could give in some such form as a White Paper details of the proposals for each of these centres.</P>
    <P>One thing I am not very happy about in the Bill is the proposal for Ministerial control of these harbours. This runs counter to the general trend in this country for many years past <Col N="299" /> towards transferring executive and administrative functions of this kind from the Government Department and political Ministers to State bodies with the necessary flexibility to undertake this kind of commercial or semi-commercial work. Even at this very moment, I think several of our airports which are currently managed by Government Departments are about to be handed over to a State body which is already managing one of our airports. The proposal here to take away from the existing harbour authorities these harbours and vest them in a Minister runs counter to the whole trend of thinking, I do not mean just the trend of thinking on this side of the House but the trend of thinking on the other side of the House as exemplified by the legislation of many Government Departments in recent years.</P>
    <P>I think this is something to which we should give consideration. I would accept that the existing harbour authorities may not be effective bodies for this purpose, that a substantial reorganisation may be needed, that it may be necessary in order to achieve the kind of developments that are needed to have a central fishery harbours authority with local departments then handling each of the individual harbours, but I am not satisfied that the right answer is that this should be handled by a Government Department under a Minister. This is not the way we do things. This is not the way we have been doing things in this country for a long time past. I do not know if any significance is to be attached to the fact that it is once again the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries which is going in the opposite direction to the rest of the country, a practice which it has been engaged in ever since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Minister would reconsider this, and that either by further legislation or by exercising his powers of delegation under the Bill, he would establish an appropriate authority to do this work with the necessary flexibility for this purpose and that it would not remain something <Col N="300" /> controlled centrally from a Civil Service Department in Dublin and a Department that has&mdash;I was going to say many other fish to fry&mdash;but I realise that would be an inappropriate metaphor in this case.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what the Minister proposes to do about managing those harbours. There is provision for delegation of authority. Does he propose to establish some kind of committee or board in his Department under his supervision or does he propose that there will be a manager appointed in each harbour with a fair amount of authority to get on with the job, or does he propose simply that this will be a Civil Service department operation without any commercial approach or any modern management approach? We would like to know something about how he proposes to exercise the powers of delegation which he has very properly taken in the Bill, very properly once one faces the original decision that the authority should vest in him.</P>
    <P>There is one small point I did not understand in the opening statement. It is the proposal that the permission of the Minister for Transport and Power should be required before certain things are done extends not only to Galway harbour where reasons are given in the Minister's opening statement but also to Killybegs. Is there some technical reason for this or why is it that the Minister for Transport and power is involved in Killybegs as well as Galway where there is a substantial commercial harbour? Is it that there is also a commercial harbour situation in Killybegs that does not exist at Castletownbere, Dunmore East or Howth?</P>
    <P>Finally, on the financial arrangements which the Minister referred to, he said that there will be a separate fund established so that the finances will be accounted for separately and one can see what is involved. I would like to ask what kind of accounting there will be. It is the practice in many Government funds to adopt very old-fashioned accountancy techniques in which all the money is paid in one side and all the expenditure lumped in on the other, with no distinction between capital and current. Can we <Col N="301" /> ask whether in this case the fund shall be so accounted for that there will be a balance sheet showing the capital position and then a current profit and a loss account&mdash;I suppose it will be a loss rather than a profit account &mdash;a current expenditure and income account as well, rather than simply having no balance sheet as is the position in many other cases where Government Departments manage enterprises and capital and current expenditure and income are dumped in together in an account which is virtually meaningless? I should like some assurance as to the form in which the accounts will be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is much point at this stage going into the sorry history of neglect of this whole question of our fishing industry, but I think that when Senator Garret FitzGerald states that he is sorry that this industry was not exploited, he is making a very sad mistake in his method of explaining the view because if ever an industry was exploited, this is the particular one. The consumer has been exploited and the producer has been exploited in the person of the fisherman down through the years and the market has been at the disposal of and manipulated by what we can only describe as the princes of the fishing industry, namely, the fish factors and fish auctioneers. It is beyond contradiction that the neglect of this industry by the Government has allowed certain elements in this country to branch into millionaire status at the expense of the fisherman and the public and at the same time, leave the industry itself in a sad and sorry difficulty. What could be the biggest industry in the country, on which a number of other major industrial developments could be based, has been the Cinderella as far as the State is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fact that 100 years ago there was a flourishing fishing industry in this country. Today in many parts of the coastline remains of the harbours are to be seen and indeed in the West you have actually storage accommodation and the remains of premises where curing took place on a tremendous scale. At that time there was a huge market in America, and indeed in <Col N="302" /> Russia and elsewhere, for fish caught off the west coast of Ireland. I do not know whether there are less fish available today than then. I am not an expert in that field and do not pose as such, but I accept the view put to me that there are quantities of fish available today just as great as there were at the time I have referred to, but that due to the neglect of the industry, other fleets from the four corners of the earth are able to catch the fish off our shores and give a good living to their fishermen and excellent work in their processing plants and much-needed foreign currency to their Governments.</P>
    <P>This country has come in for tremendous criticism by European countries who have no access at all to the sea. They cannot understand the mentality of the Irish who boast of being a maritime race, proud of its connections with the sea, while this major industry has been so neglected throughout the years. When at last there is an awakening of interest&mdash;and that cannot be denied&mdash;it would be a pity if the development of the industry were on wrong lines. Here there is a tremendous opportunity of getting the confidence of the fishing men and the people really interested in the industry itself. I am not too concerned, and I hope that the House would not be too concerned, about the welfare of those who act as auctioneers. They will manage to look after themselves, but if we are really keen on and interested in expanding our fishing industry, we must give some kind of real interest and power to those who do the fishing themselves. If we are serious, the stage is ripe to run the fishing industry on a co-operative basis.</P>
    <P>I think that there was never better opportunity to make a start in that direction, rather than to lay down lines that will make it difficult at a later stage when vast vested interests become established. If we decided that the people who do go down to the sea in ships&mdash;small ships in the past and now major boats, big fishing fleets&mdash; would have a say in the control of the industry, in addition to the consumer, I believe that if the industry is planned on that basis, it will be successful. But <Col N="303" /> if we are just to bring in legislation in this House and approach this as a State or semi-State industry, then the question of success is very doubtful indeed.</P>
    <P>The idea of a State board in this country is not welcomed because of the manner in which many of those boards have been hamstrung in the past and because of the attempt to run State and semi-State boards on the same lines as private enterprise. That is the mistake that has been made. They should never be run on those lines. The result has been that those who favoured private enterprise are given a glorious opportunity of condemning what could be a tremendous means of exploitation for many people. That is why the co-operative system, which includes State representation in a big way, should not run on the purely Civil Service lines of the Department of Agriculture or any of those other Departments involved. It is necessary, of course, to give powers to such a group, such a co-operative undertaking, with regard to the acquisition of necessary land in so far as the provisions of this Bill are concerned, but what I want to get at is to give the powers given to the State in this Bill to a co-operative, not on the lines suggested in the Bill, of another group taken under the Minister's wing.</P>
    <P>We know what has happened in the past when power of that nature is exercised purely on a Departmental basis. If that particular change could come about&mdash;I do not suppose that there is much hope at this stage in appealing to the Minister&mdash;if we do tackle the fishing industry on that line, I believe success will attend the effort. The markets are there: there is no doubt that for processed fish in a variety of forms, there is a tremendous market all over the world, particularly behind the Iron Curtain, in Eastern Europe. If only we had the initiative and energy and drive in that regard, this market could be captured. Look at what it can mean to our young people to have an industry which is based on raw material within our grasp, a much more secure type of <Col N="304" /> livelihood, and a much better proposition for the country as a whole than depending on industries for which the raw material must be carried thousands of miles and over the availability of which we exercise no control.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes provision to regulate the sale of fish but I would like the Minister to elaborate a little more on that point. He says that at each centre &mdash;I presume he means the five centres referred to in the Bill&mdash;adequate facilities for the sale of fish landed will be made available, and also that the fish landed at the centre will be offered or should be offered for sale at that centre. The Minister will also be enabled to specify the manner in which the sale shall be conducted. I should like the Minister to give us some information on this very important matter. I know that he says that whether it is necessary to use any of these powers will depend on the circumstances obtaining from time to time. This is the type of thing that leaves the Minister in a position to be very vague on how these powers will be exercised.</P>
    <P>The House will recall the straitjacket position in which this industry found itself a few years ago. For instance, fish caught in Galway was transported to Dublin and auctioned there and then transported back to Galway for sale in the town. That was the official position. The fish did not improve as far as freshness is concerned. If ever there was madness in the approach to the fishing industry, it was apparent in that particular instance. That is why I am anxious to know what the Minister means in regard to taking the necessary powers for the sale of fish where it is landed.</P>
    <P>There can be no denying that it is those people who control the distribution and sale of fish who decide what price the fisherman is going to get and what price the consumer is going to pay. That is even done before it can get down as far as the harbour. The question arises, therefore, of protection for those who catch the fish, and it reinforces my point that there is terrible exploitation of those who work so hard and are anxious to expand their efforts but who have been exploited and have no say in the <Col N="305" /> prices of their catches and no rewards for their skill, and the housewife also is at the mercy of the same group who act as factors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator say who would decide the price under his proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the question of the distribution would be got over if the whole distribution of fish were through a co-operative system. I think that Senator Ó Maoláin would agree with me on that, that it would be a much better proposition if it were on a co-operative basis. I am sure he would agree with his former leader in that regard, who sought to persuade members of the Fianna Fáil Party to give the co-operative systems a chance as far as distribution is concerned. It would provide the means of giving the public a continued supply of fish, and a steady supply with nothing irregular about it.</P>
      <P>No doubt improvements have taken place in regard to plant, equipment, freezing equipment and so forth in recent years. But the control is still exercised by the people at the ports who say: &ldquo;This will be the price&rdquo;. That is all right where private enterprise is stalemate. This is a national industry and we should not put money at the disposal of people to exploit it for purely personal reasons. The interests of the community are not served in this regard. There are many other areas where private enterprise can be allowed to flourish but certainly not in the second major industry in the State. I hope the Minister will comment on the points I have raised when he replies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is-rather sad to see a national resources so greatly needing development as our fisheries once again being used as just another step in the spread of State control in this country. This Bill could have been reduced to three lines saying that the Minister can do everything he likes in the development of these harbour centres. I think the previous speakers rightly showed the proper and logical way in which development should take place. If ever there was a case for the development of the co-operative <Col N="306" /> movement and the co-operative spirit it is in this. The opportunity has been lost. In fact, the reports we have had over five to seven years on the development of a co-operative movement in this country might as well have never been prepared because there does not seem to be the slightest intention by the Government to act on any of them. Once again a major opportunity of acting in the spirit that has made Nova Scotia great in the development of its fishery industry, acting in the spirit that has made Denmark great, has been lost.</P>
      <P>This is to be killed at birth solely in the interests of creating one other big section in the Department of Agriculture as if it were not big enough already. We are given absolutely no details about this section. Will the section be developed and headed by people from within who have little or no contract with the fishing industry or with the development of fishery harbours in the modern sense?</P>

      <P>Are we to have a proper set-up with specialists recruited from people who have been abroad, who have seen how these things should be carried out in a technological fashion and who are not stifled at the top by administrators who have no knowledge of the industry? It is sad to see such an abortive attempt being made at developing our harbours. It is sadder still when you know the inside story, when you know what has been subscribed to some of these harbours which are now brushed aside like Cork County Council in relation to Castletownbere. Perhaps the Minister would explain why Cork County Council cannot be allowed to go ahead with the development of Bantry harbour and why the small toll for tonnage was not given. All those in Cork who had ability to judge judged rightly and, consequently, it is just again another case of the Civil Service machine cracking down on the local initiative and failing to allow the harbour authority go ahead as it should. If there were a case there it is for the regionalisation of those harbour authorities <Col N="307" /> and I cannot see much difference between the technique and the ability required to develop a proper fishery harbour and that in regard to the development of some major harbour like the port of Cork or the port of Galway.</P>
      <P>Indeed, if ever there was a case for leaving that to the local authority and allow them get on with their work this surely is the opportunity. If they had been proud to join in in some way in the involvement needed in industry of this nature on a co-operative basis, then we should see a structure that would have within itself the same dynamism and drive for success as has been evident at all times in the recent upsurge in Nova Scotia, through Antigonish, among industries other than the fishing industry. It may surprise Senator Ó Maoláin to know that the dynamism there came from the university. It came from their bridging of a local credit movement putting their money out to work with the people in the industry to lead them on to help themselves. It seems to be the one thing we ignore here. It is amazing in a country committed to Christian principles, at least from the point of view of lip service, that when it comes to practical organisation we are more totalitarian than any western European country except when it comes to introducing the supremacy of the almighty State Department.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is not too late to learn from the real discontent in the present troubles in France, in so far as it is real and not acted on by people jumping on the band-wagon. The real discontent, revolt and rebellion, is against French bureaucracy. That day is not too far off here and the greatest culprit is the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and, indeed I might say in parenthesis, the Department which has got least from the Irish economy of what that economy is capable of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it too late to reject this Bill and introduce one that would set this up on a proper basis, avoiding the reference of every decision to the Minister's Department in Dublin, to a section that has probably never been geared to modern technological advance; in other <Col N="308" /> words to a section in which administration and not proper technological development is all important?</P>
    <P>It is sad to read this. It is sad to go through and see that the whole new authority is dismissed in one line on page 2 of the Minister's speech where it says:</P>
    <P>Orders made under this section will transfer to the Minister's control each of the five harbours named in the Schedule and constitute in him a new and single harbour authority responsible for their maintenance operation, management and development.</P>
    <P>When I think of the time we spend discussing various other semi-State bodies and the careful way we go into their constitution, their scope, their powers and so on, it is sad that here we have opted to give a blank cheque to the Minister to rub out authorities who never got a chance to get going and to substitute one unlimited, unknown and unfettered authority for this. Are we going mad? The only remedy for everything is State control. The illogicality and inhumanity of that would not be tolerated in countries in which there is State control. I appeal to the Government to learn from Antigonish, to learn what can be done in small regions with local groups sharing in the development of our resources. If there is one industry that should be localised, depending on the character of local groups, it is the fishing industry with the development of the local harbours together with all the other ancillary works. There is no room in the State to operate this industry and there is no room in the State to rule from the capital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many points where the fishing industry is in need of rejuvenation and overhauling. One of the main problems of the industry is that of distribution. It always seems illogical to me, when listening to the fish marketing reports on the radio, to remember that when one goes looking for fish within a radius of 50 or 60 miles of Dublin, one finds that the prices are from seven to ten times greater than they were at the auction that morning. Many of our <Col N="309" /> people are being deprived of fish in that way. Now that the State is taking such a great interest in the fishing industry, there is hope that the Department will look into this important matter of distribution.</P>
      <P>I also feel that something should be done to protect our coastal fisheries. Time and again we hear of the lack of fishery protection and, while I know that this is the function of the Department of Defence, now that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries seems to be taking a hand in the development of the industry, perhaps he will do something about protecting our rich and valuable fishing grounds from the foreign trawlers who spend too much time too near our coasts.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers have raised many points of interest and, perhaps, the Minister will, in the course of his reply, enlighten the Seanad a little as to the reason why in this age of decentralisation and the great move to the West, his Department would appear to be doing quite the reverse. If it is logical for one Department to go through the process of complete decentralisation, it is difficult to understand why the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries should challenge that move to such an extent as to take over completely the running of the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help thinking in reverse to some of the opinions I have heard in relation to this Bill. Every maritime county in this country has a number of ports, large or small, which were used at some time or other for inshore fishing. Perhaps, because of the non-profitability of this operation, the people mainly engaged in it were small farmers and they gave it up. Every county council is saddled with ports of all sizes which they do not want at all and on which they do not wish to spend money. In my area, between the Shannon and the west coast, there must be ten or 15 of them, small ports that are derelict and no use to anybody. Everybody moves away from the question of providing money for them and the local councils do not see any future in providing money to modernise ports for which there is no use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every time there is a proposal to <Col N="310" /> spend money on these ports the proposal is sent back to the Department and it is suggested that they are responsible. So far as I can see, the Minister is now accepting the responsibility that is being handed back to him and he has selected five important ports for development for the fishing industry. The first thing you have to do is to catch the fish and to my mind, there seems to be quite a gap between the landing price of the fish and the price the public are being expected to pay for that fish. For a maritime nation we must provide the smallest market in the world for the consumption of fish; we are not a fish-eating people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but, whatever the reason, the market is not there. People who catch fish along our coasts do not find a ready market for it. I think the Minister is doing no more than accepting the responsibility which is being handed back to him by the people who have possession of the harbours and know that something needs to be done for them but do not wish to spend the money on doing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in agreement with Senator Honan on this matter and I would appeal to the Minister not to allow himself to be frightened by Senator Quinlan. Senator Quinlan takes fright at the use of the word &ldquo;State&rdquo;, not realising that the State is all of us, that the State is the community. In so far as we can keep control over the Government and its Ministers, they are generally active for the good of the community when they introduce legislation of this kind. There is an attraction in the idea which was put before us, a suggestion that it would be better to embark on the development of the fishing industry on a co-operative basis but in the deprived and under-capitalised state of the industry this is not possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should be congratulated on introducing a measure of this kind. Under such measures the community interest predominates but I should also like to see the Minister's active concern with the problem of excessive profits for middlemen, with the <Col N="311" /> problem of better distribution and with the question of the more equitable distribution of the money derived from fishing amongst those who do the actual work. It is evident from this carefully-worded Bill that the Minister is taking power to enable him to do this kind of thing. We have to believe that his intentions are good and I cannot help feeling that if we had a Minister for Housing who would be seriously preoccupied with the acquisition of land for housing, and who would not allow the speculation and racketeering that goes on, such a Minister could learn a lot from a Bill such as the one we have before us.</P>
    <P>I do not think we need to be ashamed&mdash;I have been critical, on occasion, from the point of view of detail&mdash;of our State enterprises. The ESB have done an excellent piece of work; Bord na Móna are a body of which we should be proud; the Sugar Company and many others have shown the way by taking a few steady steps towards socialism. They have shown the way along which our fishing industry also can go and therefore when I find the Minister also, in manner unafraid, taking a few steps on the path towards socialism, the path along which he was directed two or three years ago, if my memory serves me correctly, by Deputy Seán Lemass &mdash;who said the time had come for this country and his Party to move further to the left&mdash;I congratulate him. My hope is that he will insist, by the powers vested in him by the Bill, that community interests shall prevail and not private greeds which claim much of our economy and which take precedence over community weal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker has to some degree answered in a very definite way some of the criticism, badly founded, made by other speakers. However, I shall leave that general issue aside for the moment. In reply to Senator FitzGerald, who spoke about this being a very belated measure, the fact is that it was not needed until now in the sense of the needs of present circumstances. It is also right to draw the attention of the <Col N="312" /> House again to the fact that though the legislation is only now before the House, £500,000 has been spent on the development of three of our five harbours and a further £130,000 is being spent during the present year.</P>
      <P>This is a long way short of the &ldquo;too little too late&rdquo; philosophy we have been hearing. It is a long way short of the fact that this started as long ago as 1963 and that we have progressed since to the point at which £500,000 has already gone into the preparatory work of dredging and so forth and that £130,000 more is being spent this year. As well, other plans have been prepared for all of our harbours in various stages of development in the immediate years ahead. We need this Bill to enable us to go further because far from the idea being correct that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries wants to grab something which is of some value to somebody else, the fact is that without getting the powers provided for in this Bill, particularly in regard to control and land acquisition, we have gone as far as we can in the development of fishery harbours, and unless we get the finances and the authority from the Oireachtas, we cannot go any further. This legislation, then, has been to a degree forced on us rather than that we are grabbing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, it is not true to say that we have been doing nothing since it was announced in the Second Programme. The fact is that we have been doing positive work during the intervening years. There is a great deal that can be said about fishing, all of it uncomplimentary, which is what we generally hear. With all of our natural advantages due to our location, to our coastline, to the existence of some of the finest fishing grounds in Europe, particularly off the west coast, we should keep in mind constantly that all the talk about the great times we had in fishing in the past must be contrasted with the situation that there are few people, including those who had a fair personal knowledge of the circumstances of those days, who would go back to them, back to the drudgery, the slavery, the dangerous occupation as against the improved <Col N="313" /> situation and the improving job fishing now is.</P>
    <P>Due to many and varied developments, none of which came about without action, help and participation of different Governments for quite a long time, this is something we should take in its proper perspective. We should stop weeping and wailing about the great fishing days in the past when it was abject slavery, when people only did it because there was just nothing else for them to do or because they did not know any better. We should now concentrate on the future, on the value of developing our fisheries along modern lines. In order to do this we need a number of things. We need trained personnel for the craft of the day if we are to take any worth out of the sea with much less drudgery and danger than in the past. We need harbours wherein to land the fish and to anchor safely our boats which have cost us vast amounts of money and which are virtually small factories in their own way. We want more of these better and bigger craft with all the modern appliances being devised and now being used by fishermen here and throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Of course we want marketing and distribution systems and the question is which of a number of these things should we put first. It is very difficult to say which comes first. We need them all if we are to have a thriving fishing industry. We shall learn fully only as we go along, but trained personnel is the first requirement and this we have attempted to get. We are stepping up our training facilities and establishments which heretofore had been doing a job sufficient for the time but which will not be sufficient for the needs of the future.</P>
    <P>All sorts of arrangements have been made by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara in the matter of the making available of boats, with credit facilities, from outside in addition to the building of boats here at home. Very attractive grants and subsidised loans, with attendant bonuses have been provided. Surely this is indicative of the wish of this Government and past Governments to push on with this industry to whose potential we are not <Col N="314" /> blind? I agree with one view expressed here today, that there is colossal potential in the fishing industry. However, it is not by talking about it but by working for it that we shall get something done about it, and when I hear the holy redeemer attitude of the Senator from Cork when speaking about co-operatives and credit unions, as if this name &ldquo; co-operative&rdquo;, if used in the proper way, will itself do the job, I find myself deciding that this is the sort of talk we hear far too much and too often in regard to many of our problems.</P>
    <P>Apparently, so long as one mentions &ldquo; co-operative&rdquo; in the proper manner, the job will be done in a better way. People who use these terms are those who are challenging people like me and others in Government as to what we mean when we say clearly what we do mean. They give us the alternative of a co-operative and when they use the word, they say it will do everything better. This is the greatest fallacy on God's earth. It has been preached to the agricultural community and to the fishing industry until I am sick of hearing it, and indeed to the point where it has done damage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take you back to the Nova Scotia thing and where it emanated from, but I want to say that it has been said that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries is the biggest failure as regards lack of progress but the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries is the Department that has had delegated to it the greatest amount of co-operative movements. Am I right? Is there a lesson to be learned from that? All this free talk by people who are non-doers about what cooperation can do is spoiling a lot of our people at the moment and making them believe, because they hear it talked of in a nice and good way and in a respectful manner, that this all-embracing matter of co-ops can do the world and all without working. This is what is being hammered across and instead of its helping to forward <Col N="315" /> real co-operatives, it is breeding the view in the minds of many of our people that all you have to do is get together, call yourself a co-operative and Bob's your uncle, the job is done. There are far, far too many, like Senator Quinlan, who talk in those terms and do nothing and this is really the core of many of our problems today, that we have far too many talkers and too few doers and this applies in fishery just as in farming or any other walk of life.</P>
      <P>In so far as distribution is concerned, this is in the last analysis, so far as the home market is concerned, the vital element in my estimation. Again, we have not been standing still in this matter. We have been providing, and are at this present time providing, with the greatest possible expedition the stores and the iceplants that are essential if we are to have distribution done on an original harbour to harbour basis. We must have this. We must have the ice; we must have the carrying capacity so that supplies are continuous rather than the day there is good fishing, everybody is fishing and the day there is bad fishing nobody is out. This is not the way to service the market if you want to hold it. Therefore, we have provided, and are at the right point providing, storage, providing iceplants in order to keep over fish from the day you have too much to the day you have not enough and realising that fish are just not harvested by numbers, day to day, that there are all sorts of things that emerge, that change the take and change the catch, and that you cannot and will not get our people or any other people to eat fish merely when we have it but rather that we must provide it as they want it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must provide it steadily and continuously; otherwise we cannot have a real demand for fish in this or any other country. This is probably why we have not got the taste for fish, particularly away from the coast, we might have. At the coastline itself, one of the probable reasons we have not got a taste for fish is that maybe for too many years they got too much of the taste of fish and not enough <Col N="316" /> of the taste of anything else. This is an aspect that people must take into consideration, particularly if one comes from near the west coast and realises that this may still be so. If we are to harness our own market in the future, we must have continuous supplies in good condition and this is the only way the public will give to the fishermen of this country a ready market.</P>
    <P>In so far as the costs and the difference between what the fisherman gets and what the consumer pays, this is a matter that must undoubtedly be gone after and gone after strenuously but remember again our marketing arrangement in the country as a whole is practically non-existent. It is haphazard and non-continuous. The quality may not be good but we are heading towards the curing of these things. When we have got to the stage where this has been done to a proper degree, then I think that if it is necessary, we can really get after this question of profit margins; but remember if we are haphazardly selling as we are doing at the moment, without any proper storage facilities, we cannot expect that fish will be sold at a level that would be regarded as a reasonable profit margin because fishing is an unreasonable business trying to get it from point to point when you have it and so forth. To get it into a regularised system we need more fish landed, more regular storage, better distribution of marketing and remember this is being done with the actual encouragement of those of us engaged in this matter.</P>
    <P>Our people are beginning to cook fish as if it was something worth cooking rather than just doing it on Friday when we, as one particular majority religion, have had to eat it or do without. This is the way in which we have treated our fish. This is the way in which we approached our fish. Taking all these things into consideration, it does not surprise me at all that we have not got a market, but neither does it discourage me. I believe that if we can cure all these little things&mdash;and they are little things&mdash;we can develop a very good market in this country for fish, not only to the benefit of the fishermen but to the benefit of the people as well, but we need it cooked <Col N="317" /> better, treated better, stored better, presented better and supplied in an even, steady, continuous flow. At that stage we will have no trouble selling more fish in this country than we are prepared to take at the moment.</P>
    <P>Outside markets are still a problem and will continue to be but again in that regard we would hope our marketing organisation will find ever-expanding markets. Again we have got to build up our fleet, to build up our take and we cannot be going into the market today with a big catch of fish when everybody else has fish, too, and not going in at all tomorrow when there is a shortage. The thing is to have supplies that you can present, as and when they are needed by the customer. The customer is not going to stand around waiting until you have too much fish. He will not be there then. You must supply him on the day he needs it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion of State and semi-State bodies being a better way of doing things than the Minister doing them and taking control into his own hands which was mentioned, in so far as those harbours are concerned, they are being taken over and, for instance, in Cork, the county council were delighted to get rid of Castletownbere. We hear it being talked about here. Why did we not facilitate them in Bantry? This has nothing to do with my Department. Whether or not they were facilitated is something I do not know.</P>

      <P>In so far as Castletownbere is concerned, for the information of the Senator from the south, Cork County Council did not want Castletownbere and when they had it, they were not doing anything with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="318" /> Likewise, the other ports that are being talked about here are now valuable merely because of the fact that this legislation indicates that the Minister for Agriculture has taken them under his wing. They were not valuable yesterday or the day before. It would be very interesting and enlightening and educational for the Senator if he sought out what the fishermen of these areas thought about whether or not these harbours should be taken over by the Minister. It would be very interesting to hear their views.</P>
    <P>These are the points that should be recalled and remembered in our approach to this. It is not good enough to come in and criticise merely because of the fact that the Government, acting through the Minister for Fisheries, are prepared to do something and while doing it, are prepared to take the responsibility of doing it and do not believe in handing that responsibility of Government over to some faceless people who have no responsibility and who cannot be challenged by the Members of this or the other House. I do not believe that is the way to approach things, and I have no intention of reversing engines merely to satisfy those who feel that because they themselves do not back the present Government and have no hope of ever becoming the Government themselves, everything should be handed over and given away by way of power, transferred to autonomous bodies responsible to no one and answerable to no one and never having been elected. That is the negation, surely, of democracy as we know it, and it is about time that it was spelled out really for those who go on warbling about the great benefits there are to be gained if we only give away the powers which we as the Government have been elected by the people of this country to wield in their interest and on their behalf.</P>
    <P>Why should we? This is running away from government, and, as I said yesterday in the Dáil on another similar matter, it seems to me that the people opposite us here are so bereft of any thought that they will ever get into Government in their own time that they want to dissipate whatever power the Government enjoy because Fianna <Col N="319" /> Fáil are in office. This is something that we should seriously think about. I know that you have enough to think about at the moment. You have your troubles, God knows&mdash;there is no doubt about it.

      <P>About Nova Scotia, in my haste to get finished, I neglected to say that the difference between Nova Scotia and people who formulate the co-op movement here is that apparently they have workers who put the idea into operation whereas those who formulate the co-op movement here think that all is well when they are talking but they do not have to do anything.</P>

      <P>To get further on, I will try to answer some of the other queries which were raised. Fish, it has been suggested, should be sold at the port of landing; but I thought that I had already made it fairly clear that the intention would be that where it is feasible and desirable in the best interests of the fishermen and of the industry as a whole, it is the intention to do just that. It is fairly specifically mentioned in the Bill as one of the powers and functions that I will be exercising in the future. This idea of the Galway-Dublin and return journey merely for the sake of getting across here for auction and going back in a much inferior condition is something of which I have had experience over a number of years from my own county. I am fully alive to the fact that it is just not sane, but the point is that we had to do in the past some things which were queer and which happened to the detriment of the producer and of the consumer as well. I hope that we can rearrange things better in the future and avoid unnecessary cost, unnecessary handling and deterioration of fish as a result.</P>
      <P>The suggestion was made by Senator Garret FitzGerald that the fishing industry is under-financed. I think that probably in one context this could be said to be true. On the other hand, it is true that to-day we have reached the point where in so far as the provision of boats is concerned, for the bigger boats we require trained personnel and we are training and providing them as fast as possible, and there is a fair ratio as between the supply of boats with more facilities and the demand for suitably qualified skippers at the different ports on the coast. I had hoped that both these things would move in unison in the future and that more and more people will be suitably equipped from the training point of view and that boats will be available requisite to their needs and experience as they become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Side by side with that, apart altogether from these major harbour jobs we are talking about here and the developments foreshadowed for them, <Col N="322" /> we have other jobs going ahead at different places throughout the country. For the past 18 months, and it is still continuing, such a survey is being carried out, starting away down on the south coast and moving now right up the west coast and soon to the north coast, giving us their best advice as to what developments in harbour and anchorage facilities should be provided in addition to the five major harbours covered in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I feel that we are moving on a pretty broad front. We are moving to train and educate our fishermen and are making provision for suitable boats and the development not only of the major harbours and of auxiliary processing facilities but also giving attention to more minor, or less major, harbours throughout the country. The provision of iceplants and storage at many points throughout the country now is also the basis on which better distribution for better home marketing, apart altogether from export, can be provided. The position has now been reached that those iceplants and stores are being provided and&mdash;this would probably be some little consolation to Senator Quinlan who talks about the co-op here&mdash;we are encouraging fishermen's co-ops at several points on our coasts at the moment. We have the IAOS down there with our blessing, and in many cases at our invitation, to help to form those co-ops and to give them a lead as to what they mean, and we are also helping financially the IAOS to aid those people by our major contribution annually which is provided for them under my Department's Estimate. These are the things which I think people should be looking at rather than crying &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; and making a lot of to-do about nothing when it comes down to the point.</P>
    <P>There was a request for a White Paper or for more details being given in some general form and I will consider this. I did feel that the requirements in the Bill itself would bring about a situation wherein the information and the detail about what is to be done would have to be given when I make any orders in regard to my functions under the Bill. Under section 2 (6) (a), I am obliged to give notice of intention to make orders and <Col N="323" /> to specify what these are intended to encompass. I was relying on this for this type of forewarning or advance notice in regard to what we intend to do. I will certainly have a look at the position to see whether we might have a composite overall projection of what was proposed for the next five years in a White Paper or a memorandum and see if there is a useful exercise on which to embark.</P>
    <P>Finally, Dunmore East was mentioned as a problem which had arisen in the past in regard to auctions and selling and as to who should land there and who should not. I had hoped that the powers vested in me by this Bill would enable me to overcome that type of problem. The Dunmore East problem as we knew it does seem to have diminished or run its course. I hope this is so. The powers in the Bill are such that we should be in a better position to deal with such a situation in the future than we were in the past. Other matters of greater detail can usefully be discussed and answered, if answers are needed, on Committee Stage. I thank the House for facilitating me on this Second Stage.</P>

    <Title>Industrial Grants (Amendment) Bill, 1968    (Certified Money Bill)    : Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo; That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for an increase in the overall figure of £30 million in the grant money payable by An Foras Tionscal. The House will be aware that the statutory ceiling on the total <Col N="324" /> amount that may be issued in grants to industrial undertakings has been raised on a number of occasions since 1952 when the first sum of £2 million was provided for grants in the undeveloped areas.</P>
      <P>The present limit of £30 million was provided in the Amending Acts of 1964 and 1966. At 31st March, 1968, grant payments had amounted to £27,319,179 and expenditure on the industrial estates at Waterford and Galway came to £1,133,812. This brought the total expenditure by An Foras Tionscal to £28,452,991 at that date. Grant payments falling due in the first months of the present financial year have all but exhausted the balance of the £30 million sanctioned by the Acts, and the provision of additional funds to enable An Foras Tionscal to carry on its work and to meet obligations has become a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>Senators will understand that there is always a time lag, sometimes of years, between the approval of an industrial grant by An Foras and the time when the grant becomes due for payment. This was discussed in the House recently. Consequently, the additional provision now being sought, an extra £10 million, will be needed for the most part to make payments on commitments entered into some time back, and would cover such payments for the next year or so.</P>
      <P>I mention this to indicate the limited nature of the present Bill. Although it has the Long Title of an Act to amend and extend the Undeveloped Areas Acts and the Industrial Grants Acts, it has the sole purpose of providing additional money to enable An Foras to continue to discharge actual claims for grants which have been approved under existing legislation. It is not a vehicle for carrying through any changes in the structure of the grant system or any additions to or modifications of industrial incentives. All this will be for another day and, I hope, an early one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will know that reviews have been made of the working of existing schemes, and consultants have been employed to give views on the pattern of incentives suitable to our needs and <Col N="325" /> capacity. When the proposals to amend the structure of our incentives are brought before the Seanad, it is intended that Senators will have access to fuller information about these matters. I do not wish, therefore, to anticipate the debate on the restructuring of our incentives for industrial development. The question of the global provision of money to carry out such a programme will, of course, also come up for discussion then.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the position at this moment is that the present statutory ceiling on grant issues has been reached, and an interim increase is required to cover the existing situation until the broader legislation can be enacted. The Bill before the House does two things: it increases to £40 million the maximum that may be issued by the Minister to An Foras, and also sets this new limit of £40 million on what An Foras may pay in the aggregate by way of grants and on industrial estates. I recommend the Bill for the approval of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us that the restructuring of the grant system is for another day, and I hope an early one. I wonder how early? Can the Minister give us any indication when this legislation is to come because here as in so many areas the time-lag that occurs between a proposal being put forward and the Government's decision on it is disturbingly long. I think I am right in saying that something approaching a year has elapsed since the Minister received the report of the consultant, A. D. Little, proposing changes in the structure of the grant system. It is over six months since he received the comments of the NIEC on that report. Over this period we have been promised this new structure but time goes on and we still have not got it. The Minister at this stage would want to give us some indication when the legislation will come because we are approaching a time of the year when new legislation which is introduced now has little chance of getting through. Is it then the case that the legislation will not be introduced until the autumn and will not be put through until the <Col N="326" /> end of the year? If so, that will be a year and a half since the report on which this particular proposal is founded was received by the Minister and 18 months is a very long time to act on a report, although there are certainly many precedents.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Minister, in considering the report, will have regard to the recommendations made to him by the NIEC. He and his predecessor have not always accepted the views of the NIEC, in some cases, I think, mistakenly. I recall several years ago that a recommendation was made&mdash; it was made originally, I think, by NIEC's predecessor, the Committee on Industrial Organisation&mdash;in respect of grants; it was a recommendation to the effect that there ought to be no discrimination against capital intensive projects. Hitherto, in this country, we have taken a very shortsighted view on capital intensive versus labour intensive projects and we have thought in terms of which type of project will give us the most employment immediately, directly, in the short run, without regard to the long-term consequences for employment and the welfare of the community. Recognising this fact, a recommendation was made to the Minister by the CIO that future legislation should remove this kind of discrimination, which had the effect of distorting our whole new industrial structure in favour of projects which were labour intensive and provided more jobs in the short run, but which, for that very reason, may be less desirable in terms of the type of employment provided, the value of the employment and the survival prospects of the industry concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are, it must be remembered, in the intermediate stage between fully industrialised and developing countries, some of which are catching up on us, and if we concentrate on industries which are labour intensive and can be undertaken without much skill, expertise, or capital, then we are concentrating on industries in respect of which competition will be most acute in the years ahead. What we should be doing is what Northern Ireland is doing. It is concentrating on industries which provide substantial employment <Col N="327" /> and, indirectly, through other industries linked with them, very substantial employment and, by virtue of modern technology and capital involved, they are much less likely to meet this low-cost competition from developed countries to which we have exposed ourselves for years past. It was in recognition of this fact that they proposed that these aids should be done away with. Despite a misleading statement that the recommendation was being accepted, it was, in fact, rejected because, in the new legislation, this discrimination in favour of labour intensive projects continued, irrespective of expert views that this was contrary to long-term employment interests. I would hope that the Minister will have full regard in this instance to the recommendations made to him by the NIEC in respect of the restructuring of our whole grants system.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister about several reports other than the one I have just mentioned, and which was handed to him a year ago. What is the position with regard to the report on the performance of new industries, which the Taoiseach mentioned, and upon which he spoke at some length at the conference of the Irish Management Institute in Killarney? This report has been available for some time past. The Taoiseach selected certain facts and figures from it and presented them to the conference at Killarney. Nothing has appeared since. The report is apparently a factual report telling us what results have been achieved over the past ten years and, judging by what the Taoiseach said, some of the conclusions are interesting and valuable. In the nature of things, this is not a report which would be particularly confidential but, if there are references to particular firms, I take it they could be deleted.</P>
    <P>The main body of the report is a general review of progress and it is a puzzle to me and others why it has not been published, despite considerable pressure for its publication. It is unsatisfactory that the Taoiseach should select from a report which has not been published certain facts and figures and <Col N="328" /> publish them selectively. Some time has elapsed since then. The Taoiseach's selection was arbitrary and ill-connected; the items did not hang together and there were a number of inconsistencies. I am sure all this can be explained away but the selection was so arbitrary and so badly done that it left one in grave doubt as to what interpretation to put on the figures. I know some of the explanations for some of the discrepancies. For example, one set of figures included Shannon and another did not. But the Taoiseach did not say that. That is not the way to publish information. This is a useful internal review of what has been achieved over the past ten years, or so, and it is in the public interest that it should be published. It should not be published piecemeal and it should not be produced in such fashion that one can make nothing of it because of lack of skill in selecting the data and because of patent inconsistencies in the information produced.</P>
    <P>One is in a difficulty in discussing this kind of subject because one has only this incomplete information. Some of the things the Taoiseach said seemed to be good sense, but it is difficult to comment because one has not all the facts. He said the failure rate was relatively low and it might have been wiser for us not to be so selective and accept a higher failure rate for the sake of getting more for the grant. That could be true. Indeed, I have always taken that view myself in ignorance of the facts, because the facts are not available, but we cannot judge accurately because we have not got the report. I would press the Minister to overcome whatever reluctance there is about publishing this report. Let us have it. Let us make up our own minds on the progress being made. It is difficult to consider this Bill without having that information and it will be impossible to consider a Bill proposing to restructure the whole grants system unless we have the report before us and unless we have adequate time to consider it.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister at what stage is the Buchanan Report? It involves the preparation of plans for five or six of the physical planning <Col N="329" /> regions not covered by the Litchfield and Wright Reports. This Buchanan Report is of great importance from the point of view of industrial development. Some of our policies for industrial development have taken a certain shape and gone on certain lines which may be invalidated as a result of the conclusions drawn in this report. The Minister will be aware that our physical planning regions at the moment were selected some years ago quite arbitrarily, without any expert knowledge or evaluation, and without any departmental consultation, as far as I am aware. The selection was defended at the time on the grounds that it was purely to get the thing off the ground; it did not represent any final commitment to these particular areas and it did not matter very much what areas one chose so long as one broke the country up into some kind of areas. Fallacious reasoning!</P>
    <P>It is my understanding that the terms of reference of the Buchanan Report are wide enough to permit of reconsideration of these regions ultimately should they happen not to be the right regions for regional planning. It is of some significance that Bord Fáilte regions and the siting of regional schools cut across these regions, suggesting there is a divergence of view in Government circles on this matter. It is important this should be settled because the whole development centre policy around which our industrial programme will revolve in future depends on whether the present regions will be maintained or whether they will be varied because the way in which selection is proposed to be carried out is by basing it on these regions.</P>
    <P>We were told, first of all, that this was arbitrary, not very important, and could be rectified. Then we were told that the development centres would emerge from the planning work being done in regard to these regions and from that it emerged that the intention was that there would be a development centre in each region. Therefore, the decision about physical planning regions, which was said at first to be not very important, necessarily arbitrary and purely temporary, became at that point vital to the <Col N="330" /> question of how many development centres there were going to be. Now we are in the position that the Buchanan Report is, apparently, reviewing this whole question of how many regions there will be and this affects the question of how many development centres there are.</P>
    <P>This is crucial to the Minister's industrial development policy because there are fears among people who have given thought to this subject, who have studied the experience of other countries in this regard, that the attempt to develop more or less simultaneously as many development centres as there are physical planning regions would be a mistake, that the volume of capital available, the volume of new industries coming to the country, are insufficient to secure the development simultaneously of eight or nine different development centres in the country and, therefore, if you are going to base your development centres on physical planning regions arbitrarily selected and, perhaps badly selected, and if the result of this is that you are forced into a policy of having eight or nine centres, which would be excessive and would lead to none being large enough or strong enough to succeed, the policy is defective.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we should know what are the recommendations of the Buchanan report. Are the present regions to remain? If they are to remain, are their boundaries to remain unchanged and what recommendations will emerge from this report as regards the selection of development centres, as regards how many there should be, where they should be and the rate and tempo at which they should be developed? The Minister would need to have this information perhaps, before he makes up his mind finally on the new policies for industrial grants.</P>
    <P>However, if waiting for the Buchanan Report meant holding up this process for any length of time, I would not recommend it but I understand that although there were earlier fears that the Buchanan Report might be held up considerably, it has, in fact, made better progress than was thought <Col N="331" /> likely and it will probably be available to the Minister to help him in making up his mind on the structure of our industrialisation policy.</P>
    <P>It would be difficult to place too much emphasis on the importance of this because our whole industrialisation policy has at all stages been misguided in conceiving the problem on too small a scale and being too local in approach. The Government's unsophisticated aim ten years ago was to have an industry in every little town and village, dispersed rather than concentrated development. The experience of every country which has faced this problem has gone to show that this is a mistake and the whole tide of expert opinion in other countries and in Ireland has gone against this and the Government have been reluctantly&mdash; with obvious reluctance at times&mdash; attracted in the direction of a more concentrated programme to the point that several years ago they finally approved of the concept of development centres, quite a number of years after the idea was first put forward.</P>
    <P>The reason for the reluctance is evident. It is a reluctance which any Government would feel in some degree because, if you select certain centres for development, you do not select the rest of the country, which has more votes, and, politically, it is a difficult decision. It is unfortunate that the Government have been so slow to come to this decision because of the political implications and unfortunate that in coming to it they have rather plumped &mdash;and this in public statements by Ministers&mdash;for a number of development centres in excess of what is likely to prove successful. It is upon the whole policy of concentrated development that the future of the country will depend and the future of this country outside Dublin will depend.</P>
    <P>The only hope for true decentralisation and for the growth of population and of economic activity in the areas outside Dublin lies in the emergence of centres big enough to be viable on their own, not just satellites to Dublin. It would be very unfortunate if this were prejudiced by the Government's unwillingness to concentrate their efforts sufficiently and by half measures <Col N="332" /> involving the dispersal of activity so that out of any eight or nine development centres, none was successful, none was able to rival Dublin, none was able to hold its own, so that the magnet of Dublin would continue to draw to it far too large a share of the industrialisation of the country.</P>
    <P>The scale of Government thinking has been too small in this matter also because it has visualised at all times&mdash; this the Government will not readily admit but it is the clear implication of their approach to these problems&mdash; relatively small industries coming. The industries we have got have been relatively small. We regard an industry employing 500 people as big. It would be regarded as small to medium-sized in other countries, including Northern Ireland. Government thinking has been related to this scale of industry because, in fact, nothing has been done in the past ten years to develop the infrastructure anywhere in Ireland, almost including Dublin, on such a scale as to be able to absorb a really large industry if we could attract one and because there is, nowhere in Ireland, even, perhaps, including Dublin, where you could put a really large industry with water and sewerage facilities, roads, communications and the housing required for workers, we have not attracted such industries. All such industries, without exception, have gone to Northern Ireland. The nearest thing to large industries that we have attracted are a couple of factories employing 1,000, almost all young women, and in a country where we have a pretty even balance of supply and demand for women workers and where there is a very substantial number of male workers, that is not really the kind of industry we most need.</P>
    <P>There is nowhere in this country where we could put a really large industry. If one of the industries that Northern Ireland attracts, employing 2,000 men, were willing to come here, to what existing centre in Ireland could it be sent, where it could be absorbed, where there would be houses within the time-scale required, where water and sewerage facilities, roads and communications, schools, education could be provided? Not only have we not got <Col N="333" /> that anywhere, but our administrative structure is still so cumbersome, so out of date, that we could not readily within any acceptable time-scale achieve that position. The time taken from the time when a need is established until it is fulfilled for housing, sewerage, water supplies, roads and schools in this country is so long that no modern industry would be prepared to wait that long.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland, on the other hand, recognising this problem, they have built up certain areas in such a way, that Northern Ireland programmes, having flexibility in regard to housing them, can attract such industries and guarantee that facilities will be available within the short space of time required and that workers will be available and housed. We have not yet tackled this problem seriously. We are still thinking in the small-scale, piecemeal terms of the 1950s and have not begun to think in terms of the 1960s, never mind the 1970s.</P>
    <P>Here, the Minister has a lot to do. It is not an easy job because it is not all within his compass. If the problem were really one for the Department of Industry and Commerce, then the Minister, by applying his energies, could hope to solve the problem fairly easily. The difficulty is in so many Departments being involved and the structure of our Departments, so many Departments with very independent-minded Ministers, not always co-operative with each other, and very independent Departments operating separate policies and absolutely opposed to any type of co-ordination very often, as distinct from agreement to co-operate on their own terms, simply not adapted to solving these problems with the speed required.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in criticising the failures in this area I am not criticising the Minister particularly but the whole structure of Government. It is simply inadequate for this purpose. If we are serious about decentralisation and propose to try to do something to create really dynamic centres of growth outside Dublin, as distinct from shifting reluctant civil servants to towns which happen to suit the Ministers concerned, we will have to revise our policies <Col N="334" /> pretty drastically and revise the whole way in which decisions are taken within the public service.</P>
    <P>If we are to be able to offer to large industries the kind of service they want, we must be able to say to the American manufacturer willing to establish an industry here employing 2,000 male workers, wanting to get going within 18 months: &ldquo;Yes, we will be able to provide you with a site, with a water supply, sewerage, roads, houses, schools and workers within that time because we have a system of working under which all this can be put into operation and in which the red tape is cut and the different interests concerned co-operate in such a way as to produce a dynamic result.&rdquo; Until we can get to that point, we will continue to trot along as we are now, getting medium-sized industries and small industries, dispersed around the country. The rate of growth of industrial development is totally inadequate to absorb those leaving school and leaving the land. Until we tackle this seriously, we will continue along that path and in that way.</P>
    <P>The unwillingness effectively to decentralise authority has been evident in the work of the Industrial Grants Board, An Foras Tionscal, in respect of the new industrial estates in Waterford and Galway. This is a matter I have raised several times in the House, including no later than last week. This Government throughout their life have shown great reluctance to devolve authority at local level, and indeed in the last few minutes of the speech of the Minister for Agriculture, reluctance to devolve authority even in the field of State enterprise. I thought his remarks on this subject extremely revealing of the attitude of mind of Government Ministers. He made perfectly clear his determination to take power to himself and to hold on to it, and showed his contempt for other Ministers who might think of allowing anything to be done in their area of competence by State bodies which he described as faceless men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is. The House can judge. This unwillingness to devolve authority is particularly unfortunate in the area of industrialisation. I particularly welcome therefore that there has been a small breakthrough here, which we had last week when we had the Minister for Transport and Power in the House on the subject of Shannon industrial development, the breakthrough being the handing over of some authority to the Shannon Free Airport Development Authority for the development of the Limerick/Clare/North Tipperary region. I hope this will be followed elsewhere. It is not of course the full devolution of authority one would like to see ideally in that this body is not a democratic body: it is not a local body in the sense of being one locally controlled. Nevertheless, it is at least local in the sense that it belongs in a particular region and is concerned primarily with the interests of that region. It is following along these lines which An Foras Tionscal have shown themselves so reluctant to do in the case of the Galway and Waterford Industrial Estates, that we shall eventually get the kind of combination of local enthusiasm and the participation of professional administrators, without which combination we will never make real progress. One of the great weaknesses of this country is the fact that local voluntary effort and the professional services of administrators are so rarely brought together and combined because of the natural suspicion and unwillingness of the two to come together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the subject of local regional activity in the field of industrialisation, it is important that we should think in bigger terms than small localities. That is why this regional development is important. One of the reasons there has not been an effective local effort in attracting new industries, preparing the ground for them and integrating them into local communities, is that local development associations show extraordinary reluctance to co-operate and come together. Each town and village has one. The last check I have been able to make shows there are something like 200 throughout the country <Col N="336" /> as a whole, not one of them having the resources to make it in any conceivable sense effective. They are codding themselves&mdash;and we, if we do not say this to them, are codding them&mdash;if they think that such voluntary effort, without some full-time executive giving his whole time to the job and without the resources to employ also outside expertise, could ever result in their becoming a really effective body in attracting industrialists to establish themselves here.</P>
    <P>If they are not effective bodies, then the administrators understandably treat them without respect as nuisances and pressure groups who come looking for industries but have little to contribute themselves and who have not the financial resources or expertise to do the job. If they could only get together on a regional basis, pool their resources and get away from the idea of the individual local town that has to be pushed, then you might get regional development bodies on a scale and with sufficient resources and sufficient expertise to really do the job. At that stage the more enlightened administrators would be glad to hand over to them some of the authority. We know there are many administrators and some Ministers who want to hang on to power, but it is not true of all. Much of the failure to bring local interests into this work has been because they have not been able to organise in a manner that could gain the confidence of reasonably enlightened administrators. Only by such a combination of regional groups can we get the regional development we need.</P>
    <P>In a particular county some years ago, I was asked if I would do some work to help the local development association of a particular town. I said I could but that it would be a waste of time because they were operating on too small a scale. Unless they got together the other towns, at least on a county basis, if not a regional basis, they would not be effective and the money they would be putting into buying my services would not be well spent. An effort was made to bring them together but the result was that it foundered through local jealousies of one kind or another. It turned out <Col N="337" /> to be to my disadvantage to have given them this advice. The result was that nothing matured from this because of the reluctance to work together in the interest of a wider area.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the need for a more sophisticated industrialisation policy, of the need not simply to sit back and wait and see who turns up wanting to establish an industry but the need for us to work out for ourselves with the necessary expertise what kind of industries could profitably be established here, to prepare feasibility studies showing what can be done, what resources we have and how they can be applied and to put them to those who might be attracted by the proposition. Other countries are doing this. We cannot expect to attract industrialists if we are not prepared to go to them with concrete propositions showing we have done our homework and that we have the resources and the skills they need. This is not an area of activity in which you can have passive promotion. We must be active not only by having salesmen out in the field but somebody who has with him concrete propositions showing how particular types of industries could usefully be established, how natural resources are available locally, what could be brought into the country at reasonable cost and how the superficial disadvantages of our geographical location could be overcome because transport costs might not be such a burden in particular instances as might have been at first foreseen. We must show how the proposal is an economic one and how the firms concerned could usefully establish here.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of approach we need. I know the Minister has taken steps to get our industrialisation effort here on to that level of sophistication. It is important that it should be done as rapidly as possible. There are examples in other countries. For example, there is the study by Ital-consult in the Bari-Taranto region of Italy. One can exaggerate the results of that. Nevertheless it did play a role and it shows the kind of work that can be done in this area by working out the various ranges between different industries and showing how a balanced <Col N="338" /> complex of industries, one industry using by-products and another supplying materials, could be built up in an area of this kind giving development of the kind we also need in Ireland.</P>
    <P>One difficulty with our industrialisation problem has been the separation of foreign firms from Irish firms&mdash;the surprising reluctance of foreign firms to enter into association with Irish firms. In other countries it is quite a common practice for foreign firms to seek a link with established native firms to facilitate their establishment which they can do because of the local expertise available to them. In this country we have not had that and extraordinarily few of the firms coming here have in fact established such links. This it not for want of trying on the part of the Industrial Development Authority and, that being so, one can only conclude that there is something about our own industrial structure that is not sufficiently attractive or our industries are too small, or not sophisticated enough, or have not themselves sufficient interest in this kind of linkage to form an organisation of this kind in such a way. The result has been that new industries established here have very little roots in the country and are not using any Irish associations. They are nearly always wholly-owned subsidiaries of foreign firms and because of our policy of insisting that their products are exported, they have no interest in the home market. Also, in many cases they use none of our materials.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this is because our manufacturers have not been quick enough in developing new kinds of production that would be useful to them. All we have here is solely the unit of production and the industry itself is totally divorced from this country while what we want is industries that will settle and create deep roots here. In many cases these firms do not involve themselves in the community in which they exist. Their managers do not become members of our industrial federations and so on. They remain very isolated. We should be concerned about this. We should want new industries established here to put down roots in the country that would not be easily disturbed. <Col N="339" /> We should not be happy with the situation where many of them are only lightly rooted and have no deep attachments or links with this country.</P>
    <P>Also, we should not rely entirely on foreign industry for our new development. The Minister, by the establishment of the Small Industries Branch, has done something here to encourage existing small industries to develop new lines and to expand and contribute to the growth of our economy. This is a useful move, but even with this, we are still not getting sufficient local development, and the proportion of the total increase in activities in industrial output and exports which is accounted for by the new firms coming in from outside seems to be disturbingly large. It seems as if we are not contributing to our own industrial growth and expansion but are simply attracting foreign firms to set up subsidiaries here. That gives employment but it is not sufficient. The State could be more active and more imaginative in the matter. Very few of the State bodies have taken seriously what was said to them by the former Taoiseach some years ago about diversification. One or two have, but for the most part they have been happy to carry on in their existing rut. In some instances their idea of diversification is not successful and has, if anything, worsened the economics of the firm rather than improved it.</P>
    <P>There are reasons why State enterprises have not contributed sufficiently to the growth of industry in Ireland. One is that they are inhibited from doing so by fears of competition on the part of the private sector. These fears are understandable but should be allayed. They are real fears in some respects and justifiable because the position has been that the Government impose on them certain social duties and then offer them some form of subsidy or the benefit of free injections of capital without requiring in many cases interest payments or dividends. Private industry, seeing State enterprises put into this unfairly advantageous position as is happening because of the social obligations imposed on them by the Government <Col N="340" /> for employment purposes, are naturally suspicious and resentful of any expansion or diversification of these State industries which would put them into this unfairly competitive advantageous position.</P>
    <P>It would be much better to cut this Gordian knot and end this unnecessary and imaginary conflict between State and private enterprise by removing the social obligations from the State sector and imposing on them the duty of being commercially successful undertakings, by taking away their privileged access to capital and then turning to the private sector and saying: &ldquo;Your legitimate complaints about State enterprise have been removed and State firms are now competing on fair and equitable terms. There is no reason why they should not freely diversify and expand even if it means the competition is directly with you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that the reaction of private enterprise would be one of unremitting enthusiasm but one could talk in those terms with some confidence, knowing one had solid ground to stand on. At present one cannot do that because of the reasonable fears of private enterprise of the expansion of State enterprise. Until the Government are prepared to face this&mdash;I have raised this problem on several occasions in this House&mdash;and to get away from the old-fashioned policies of social and political pressure, with subsidies and free capital and so on in the public sector, they will not get rid of the fears of private enterprise about the development and expansion of State firms.</P>
    <P>Some of our State firms have great resources of management, expertise, dynamism and energy which, if released, could be of tremendous benefit. These resources are locked up because of wrong pressure from the Government, but, if released, it could give us a useful source of growth. I do not suggest this should be done entirely separately from the private sector. I think it undesirable that such State bodies should establish jointly-owned subsidiaries with private interests here or abroad but that there should be minority shareholding by the private sector. The only case of a <Col N="341" /> jointly-owned State company here is that of Arramara Teoranta. That is an unsatisfactory situation. We are creating a problem for ourselves by making a clear-cut division between private and public enterprise while we should be trying to confuse this distinction. If we put our State bodies on a fair, competitive basis with private enterprise, then they could be given their head and told to get on with the job. We would not be dependent to the same degree on foreign enterprise for industrial growth and expansion of exports. We would have a more dynamic State manufacturing sector working together with the private sector which is becoming more dynamic itself in growth and expansion but which is not contributing sufficiently towards giving the employment we want and which is leaving us to far too great an extent dependent on new, foreign-owned firms.</P>
    <P>In this particular area, there are, as the Minister knows, far too many bodies, and while in the past the Government have resisted rationalisation when it was pressed on them, I think the Minister must at this stage be considering it seriously and the proposals he is going to put to us for restructuring our grants system will, I hope, include some rationalisation of the present structure. We have the IDA promoting industry, An Foras Tionscal giving grants, Shannon Free Airport Industrial Estate promoting and giving grants. We have the Industrial Credit Corporation giving loans and An Taisce Stáit Teoranta giving another kind of loan and also there are other sections involved where particular projects affect the area of responsibility of Departments, such as the Department of Agriculture or indeed in some cases the Department of Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>The result is that when somebody wants to establish an industry, the time taken to get the approval of all these bodies can be incredibly long. By the time the board of IDA has communicated with An Foras Tionscal, which has consulted An Taisce Stáit Teoranta, which has communicated with the Industrial Credit Company, which has consulted An Foras Tionscal <Col N="342" /> as to whether it should give approval and the whole thing has gone round&mdash;this is not an imaginary route; I think it has actually happened&mdash;we are very lucky if the foreign industrialist has not gone home or gone somewhere else. It is quite an unnecessarily cumbersome system.</P>
    <P>I had thought we are better doing this through the medium of State bodies rather than a Government Department but I have been shaken in this belief by talking to the people in Northern Ireland in the Ministry of Commerce where in accordance with their very simple system, the Government Department does the whole thing. They are in the position of being able to give a quick answer without consulting any boards. I should be reluctant to adopt that system because I do not think our public service is sufficiently flexible in this country to undertake this work but unless we can simplify the present rash of bodies, we may be forced to go back to the old system and copy Northern Ireland, because they claim&mdash;and they know something of the contrast between our performance and theirs&mdash;they can give a decision in a fraction of the time it takes to get a decision here. It is something which can be done immediately by the Minister. It is a very business-orientated Department with a very business-orientated Minister. He may have other defects from our point of view, but he is a man willing to take quick decisions and to stand over them. We need to reconsider our present structure drastically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will appreciate another essential difference is the fact that they are not accountable to Parliament for the grants given, and do not account for them except in the event of failure. No disclosure is made of the amount of the grants given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The system of accountability is different. It is true no disclosure is made in the same way as here, but they publish more information than we do in respect of these projects. Some years ago I was able to get details of the square footage of every grant-aided factory there. I never got such information from the Minister's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> There are two other points I should like to make before concluding. One is that it is important to eliminate any distinction between the treatment of domestic industry and foreign industry. I know the Minister and his predecessor have made a number of decisions that are useful in this respect. The fact that they took so long to make them reflects a lack of imagination. For years anybody who raised this point was told: &ldquo;there is no legal difference. We do not discriminate against the domestic firm.&rdquo; However, the foreign firm could go to the IDA, while the domestic firm had to deal with the Department of Industry and Commerce and could not get the benefit of the IDA's experience. The fact is that an existing firm would be extending its activities and getting a grant only for the expansion, while the new firm would be getting a grant for the whole of its activity. There is an important difference and one which appears to the Irish manufacturer, wrongly it is true, to be an unfair difference.</P>
    <P>There was a failure in imagination not to appreciate the way the Irish manufacturer saw it. However wrong it might be, it is a factor we should have appreciated sooner. In recent years there has been a greater appreciation of the psychological problem one creates by appearing to favour the foreign firm against the domestic firm, and something has been done to remedy this. It is important in any new grant structure which will emerge from the present review that to the maximum extent any appearance of a difference in treatment will be removed, so that the Minister will be able to say to and to convince Irish manufacturers that they are being treated on exactly the same terms as the foreign firm.</P>
    <P>The other point I want to make is the restriction on the right of a foreign firm to sell in the home market, a restriction imposing on them the obligation to export 90 per cent of their production. This is a thorny problem and must be considered over a period. Irish industry considers that a firm which gets a grant to set up a factory here should not be allowed to sell in <Col N="344" /> the domestic market against the products of an Irish firm which gets no grant. The Irish firm feels it is unfair competition. This is a problem about which we must do something, partly because the present situation leaves the foreign company without roots in this country. Nevertheless, it is a difficult position and the Minister will have to move carefully in this respect, but the present restrictions are unduly severe. The last obligation under the Control of Manufacturers Act came to an end in January this year. Anybody who now establishes an industry here with the aid of a grant can compete in the home market. What we are left with is the contractual obligation imposed that the firm is not to sell in the home market. This is something we would want to ease carefully as time goes on or we are going to have a very odd industrial structure in this country over a period of years.</P>
    <P>These are the things that struck me in relation to this Bill. It is true that some of them are more related to future legislation than to this Bill, which is a very temporary one. Nevertheless, I think it has been useful that this Bill has been brought in and has had to be brought in. It means there is an opportunity for this House and the other House to give their views on the shape of the future legislation which the Minister is at present considering. One of the troubles about our legislative system is that the Government take a decision and then it is discussed in Parliament. At that stage the views of Parliament often cannot weigh very heavily because such a loss of face would be involved in the Government's changing their decision. Anything that gives us an opportunity of discussing the legislation before it takes shape is therefore useful, even though in this case it is by accident we have had this opportunity.</P>
    <P>I hope from this debate the Minister will take away some useful ideas for the tasks he has in hand which I hope he will complete in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Under the new system in operation I hope we can look forward to the prospect of a further rapid expansion <Col N="345" /> in industrialisation in 1969 and the years immediately after. This is very important because the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement shoe will begin to pinch from 1969 or 1970, and unless there is new industrial expansion, we are going to be in a bad way for employment in a few years time, because of the Government's unfortunate decision to go ahead with the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement without getting compensatory benefits. However, that is not a matter for today's debate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to go outside the scope of the discussion, particularly in regard to what the last speaker has said, in view of the fact that other legislation will be introduced on this matter. At the same time, it is only fair to say that in regard to planning industries in various parts of the country and in the general policy of trying to absorb, through industry, much of our manpower which is leaving the land, the Government have acted for the betterment of the country. It is a policy that has been challenged on many occasions. Down the years it was often scoffed at and made little of; indeed away back in the early days of Fianna Fáil when they decided to establish this useful industrial arm to which I have referred, the usual propaganda was that the Irish workers were not equal to the task, that the goods they would manufacture would not be fit to compete in the home market or on the foreign market. In general, there was an air of despondency created all over the country, that Ireland was a place where cattle <Col N="346" /> were reared by ranchers. This was typical Fine Gael policy, that as far as manufacturing goods from our own raw material resources was concerned, there are people who would be unable to adapt and perfect themselves in the knowhow in the manufacturing industries and that as a whole this was a daft policy. We are very glad to see that things have changed immensely in that respect. Today we have the Minister talking about big industries and that the Government are going all out to attract them to this country. I agree with that. Naturally anyone who had the interest of the nation at heart would like to see more and more industries coming in but the Government's efforts to bring these in are very often severely criticised. When the Opposition talk of the lack of big industries, they should reflect on their own attitude in this respect. Their adverse criticism of such projects as Tynagh mines, the Verolme Dockyards and the proposed Smelting Bill, makes it clear that they&mdash;at least the Fine Gael Front Bench&mdash;in some constituencies are not in agreement with what the last speaker said in regard to big industries. Indeed, in their election literature, they made it quite clear that they disagreed completely with it.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to criticise the Government in these respects but it is the Government who have to accept the responsibility for finding the money necessary to assist these people and for taking it from the taxpayer. The Government have to be serious in their commitments and have to examine the pros and cons of every penny spent in this respect. We can say in all fairness to the industrialists from abroad that the first thing they look to is the structure of government working in the country in which they are to establish their industry. If they are good, sound-headed businessmen and I assume they are, they will plump for stability.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the success of the industrial revolution here has been the stability of government here. The industrialists coming in have faith in the Irish Government lasting out and that things will not happen as they happened when the Government <Col N="347" /> changed and the Coalition came along and sold out some of these industries just when they were getting established. They also sold the Constellation planes and the shortwave station. These are things people would look to and foreigners coming to invest their money have to be careful and have to assess as best they can the stability in the country.</P>
    <P>For that reason, the greatest encouragement they could get is a one-Party Government, a Government well aware of what is necessary to attract capital in, from outside, so that they can be reasonably sure that the business will not go wallop overnight and that they will not lose their money. They also like to see that their employees will have a good way of making a living in stable, respectable employment.</P>
    <P>This Bill emphasises the Government's anxiety to ensure that more and more industries, big and small, will be established here. There are some areas to which small industries are better suited, and were I to speak from a personal point of view, I would like to see an industrial centre going up in the north-west, in my own area. I live along the Border and I have a fair idea of that territory. I have not yet seen any of these big industries we hear talked about up there employing the thousands the last speaker referred to.</P>
    <P>It may be very easy to raise these large sums in the Six Counties, but I understand the money comes from England and the Six County Parliament has not to raise it. I think the members of the Industrial Development Authority are a body of dedicated men who have done excellent work. Our Minister for Industry and Commerce is a first-class man who has good contacts, who knows his job and is making a tremendous success of it. Industrialists coming in here while he is at the helm in the Department of Industry and Commerce will know that they will get fair treatment. There will be a fair chance of their commanding a good market abroad for their finished products. They will get every support from the Minister and they will respect the efforts he has <Col N="348" /> made to ensure that industries already established will avail of the grants already there to adapt themselves to free trade which eventually will come to us.</P>
    <P>I shall reserve any further comments I have to make for the new industrial measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true, as the Minister said, that the present Bill is just an intermediate measure to increase the availability of grants before we face the important task of reviewing the whole structure of these grants and deciding whether they are achieving their purpose or not, and whether the money is being spent to advantage.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Garret FitzGerald, I was rather perplexed by the statement of the Taoiseach at Killarney. I was at the meeting where he quoted figures and the percentage of failures seemed to be extremely low. I should like strongly to support Senator Garret FitzGerald in his plea for publication of this information so that Foras Tionscal and others will be able to gain access to this very valuable survey and draw from it the lessons it contains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am encouraged at this stage by the Senator's concern and also by the openmindedness of the Minister to make a few surveys that may be useful in relation to the tasks ahead. I have a high regard for the present Minister and his openminded and fair approach to these matters. This is a time when we have to get back to principles and to realise that when our principles are <Col N="349" /> sick, there is little hope of building a successful edifice on them. The first task we have to face is that of creating a better industrial climate. Our climate, while it may be as good as in other countries, is certainly nothing exceptional and is no great credit to us. I would feel at this juncture that we should be able to involve our workers in more active participation in their industries. With this in mind, I would like to feel that the very liberal grants we are giving to set up industries here, part of which are repayable, would be regarded as community investment in the project, as they are, and that part of that project would be a direct incentive to those putting up some of the remainder of the capital which would be earmarked to encourage future workers in the industry to acquire a portion of the shares in the company.</P>
    <P>If we are to achieve that, I think we would break down the great distrust that at present seems to prevail between workers and management. I would like to see the situation where the worker would get part of his pay packet through dividends on shares in the company which he is enabled to obtain by taking over part of the State investment. I have in mind especially the repayable parts of the grant. We can say at present that almost all our workers would find it difficult to do this out of their ordinary earnings. Therefore, I think that special opportunities should be provided to enable workers to earn additional pay and overtime so that they may acquire shares in their undertaking.</P>
    <P>I have in mind that most of our new industries could very well operate for a half day or for all day on Saturdays and that the money so earned could be earmarked solely for the purpose of allowing the workers concerned to convert their earnings into share capital. If we can do that and go further with the idea of workers' councils and other meetings between management and workers, we could step into the 70s with a new type of industrial structure more suited to our climate. This is especially true when we speak of developing regional centres. If this means anything the emphasis must be on the <Col N="350" /> region and on the development of local personnel in that industry, so that when things begin to get difficult, like the small farmer and other self-employed people, the workers concerned will work harder and will work longer hours. In an industry in which the workers are part owners they will likewise meet the onslaught of hard times and tougher competition by the only answer of harder work, longer hours and a more efficient use of technology to become more competitive.</P>
    <P>Further, in the development of those regional centres I would ask the Minister to press for the delegation of authority. The delegation of authority laid the foundation of the success of the Tennessee Valley Scheme in America. Why should anyone assume that an impersonal body in a capital city should be more knowledgeable and more conversant with what is necessary than a local body which has everything to lose if a project is not successful? I hope the Minister will use his weight within the Government to see that this devolution of authority is carried through and that we will not be faced with the situation that these developments will lead to the grabbing of still more power by the Civil Service departments. I hope the Minister and his Department will be quick enough to realise that they can do far more in partnership and by giving authority to outsiders than by an agglomeration of everything in Kildare Street so that the setting up of a new project will not simply mean that it will be put in charge of a new principal officer in the Department. That would be the building-up of an overwhelming bureaucracy that cannot achieve success.</P>
    <P>In the delegation and the devolution of authority I would ask the Minister to give a special place in his grant schemes to co-operative effort. I should like to see the Minister tell the Government that the time has come when this country which once pioneered the co-operative movement under Sir Horace Plunkett and Father Finlay, is once again ready to take up that movement. I hope that the Minister and the Government have been wise enough to see and follow what <Col N="351" /> the co-operative movement has achieved for Denmark and Nova Scotia. I would ask the Minister to read the puerile statement made by his colleague on the previous Bill before the House with regard to the success of the co-operative movement in Nova Scotia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I discovered it long before the Senator discovered or heard of the success of the co-operative movement there. We have difficulties here in the setting of demarcation lines between the various Departments. Last week we had the case of the Shannon Department Authority which with regard to tourism comes under the control of the Minister for Transport and Power and, in regard to another aspect of its operation, comes under the control of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Is there no way of simplifying that structure?</P>
      <P>I would say that today there is one particularly neglected industry in this country and that is the educational industry. At secondary school and university level there is plenty of opportunity of putting that industry on a business basis and of obtaining fees that are both realistic and economical. If this should occur there would probably be need for demarcation between the Department of Education and the Department of Industry and Commerce, but in my opinion any development of education as an industry should come under the same heading and should be part of the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>We have the whole question of changing incentives in order to provide employment for our people, and is it not sad that we take up today's Order Paper and find on it, as we have found on it for some considerable time past, motion No. 10 which says:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the National Industrial Economic Council Report on Full Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was on St. Patrick's Day, 1966, that the Minister, Deputy Childers, spoke <Col N="352" /> on this in London and said what a wonderful document it was. It is certainly relevant to matters now coming before the House and I hope an opportunity will be given to the House at an early stage to discuss this important report as an aid to the Minister in his task of formulating the changing policy of industrial grants and promotions.</P>
    <P>If we lived in a modern democracy like Holland we would have a Committee of the Oireachtas sitting on the issue of the need to change our industrial grants structure and the steps to be taken in doing so. You would have a responsible committee working fulltime on that matter and on that committee you would have members of the various development authorities, the Department of Industry and Commerce and others who would come together to discuss our records in the past and our hopes for the future.</P>
    <P>That would be done before the Bill was committed to writing, but unfortunately, here, working as we are under a 19th century antediluvian system of committee work, in which this House is purely on the floor with no adequate committee system, we have not the opportunities. Perhaps the Minister might arrange for some <i>ad hoc</i> committee, drawn from the Oireachtas and other bodies, to get down to this problem before he produces a Bill, because when the material appears in the form of a Bill it is regarded then as more or less a prestige matter for the Minister and the Party concerned not to deviate in any big degree from what has been put in the Bill at First Stage.</P>

      <P>In conclusion, I wish to appeal to the Minister now that he is about to break new ground in setting the pattern of industrial grant utilisation in the coming decade to break new ground also in his approach to this matter. Let us see a frank committee approach and I appeal to him above all to use this House. This House, if it has any existence or any right to exist it is only in the framework of an adequate committee system. I ask the Minister to give it a trial on this occasion. I also ask the Minister when introducing this measure that he might consider introducing it in the Seanad first where we could calmly and dispassionately over quite a period of time go through its procedures and contribute what we could to its evolvement. Above all, I would ask him to see that the new approach strikes out in a radical approach to labour relations with new labour involvement in creating and putting up part of the capital structure of the industries and also that he harness to the full the local spirit of pride and self-reliance in developing the regional centres. If he does that, I think we can look forward with hope and confidence to the next phase of our industrial development. Above all, I appeal to him to utilise the co-operative movement in the work ahead, because let us learn from the lessons from Denmark, Nova Scotia and elsewhere, see that it is self-reliance rather than central direction that gets most results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put these points to the Minister because I know that he has an open <Col N="354" /> mind and I am looking forward to his making a characteristic fresh approach to this very difficult and important Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little difficulty in recommending the House to accept this Bill, and I do not think that I would rise at all to support it, because Senator Garret FitzGerald has supported it very ably and eloquently, but for some observations which fell from Senator Dolan on the Front Bench of the Fianna Fáil Party. I suppose that if there were a top twenty of purveyors of false propaganda against Fine Gael in the Fianna Fáil Party Senator Dolan would find a very high place in the top twenty. He never misses an opportunity of inveighing against Fine Gael policy, which he neither knows nor understands, and criticising the activities of the Fine Gael Party in the Coalition governments or the inter-Party governments in the past, about which he has never taken the trouble to acquaint himself.</P>
      <P>I want to point out that it is well to place on record now in 1968 what Senator Vincent McHugh did last week in relation to the Shannon Free Airport Development Bill about the Industrial Development Authority Act, 1949. I am sure that it was a shock to some members of the Fianna Fáil Party, as, indeed, it would be to most members of the public, to realise that Deputy Lemass, then Minister for Industry and Commerce and later Taoiseach, said in 1949, when the Industrial Development Authority was established, that he would disband that Authority and repeal the Act if and when Fianna Fáil came back into government. Of course, he did not. We all know that the reason for the great increase in industrial production in this country and for the consequent increase in employment and industrial exports was the establishment of the Industrial Development Authority in the first place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely recounting what Senator Vincent McHugh <Col N="355" /> said last week, though I do not want to delay too long. The second measure which was responsible for the increase in industrial production and employment in this country was the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, and, together with the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, was the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1956, which for the first time granted relief from income tax for profits made on exports. That measure was vigorously opposed by Deputy Lemass, and the Industrial Grants Act was equally vigorously opposed by Deputy Lemass. We all know that since those two Acts were passed no new principle of any worth, no new scheme, has been devised by the Fianna Fáil Government to expand our industrial production and to provide incentives to foreign capital to come into this country.</P>
      <P>On this particular Bill, it may not be very palatable history for Senator Ó Donnabháin, but on this Bill it is apposite to recall what Deputy Lemass had to say about the Industrial Grants Act, 1956. I propose, subject to the ruling of order of the House, to quote some extracts from Deputy Lemass's Second Stage speech on the Industrial Grants Bill as it then was, 1956. He was completely opposed, as he indicated throughout the Second Stage speech, to the granting of any money to anybody to establish undertakings outside the undeveloped areas. He made that perfectly clear in his speech at column 1948, Volume 160, of the Official Report where he had this to say:</P>
      <P>The Minister is taking power for the Industrial Development Authority to give grants to any new industrial enterprise anywhere.</P>
      <P>We had talk this evening about the Verolme Dockyards, but they would never have been established but for the Industrial Grants Acts, 1956 because the Undeveloped Areas Act was confined to undeveloped areas in western areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is like a magician. If he is not always producing rabbits out of a hat, he is producing them out of Shannon. To return to what Deputy Lemass had to say in 1956: he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The danger is that no industrial enterprise will ever start again without getting this free grant from public funds. We have a provision <Col N="357" /> in this Bill which obliges the Industrial Development Authority to take certain things into account and a section which also gives them power to impose conditions.</P>
    <P>I will be returning to the business of imposing conditions at a later stage in my speech, notwithstanding the interruptions.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>These are provisions which I think are likely to be far more effective in retarding industrial development than helping it. I believe that over the main part of the industrial field, private enterprise is the best force on which to rely.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;a sentiment which will not appeal to Senator Sheehy Skeffington.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Then at column 1949, he delivered himself of this confession:</P>
      <P>I must confess that I have a very considerable dislike of most of these proposals for money for nothing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;what we were trying to do was to provide money for employment and an increase in the industrial expansion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and, in the past, whenever I had as Minister to bring propositions here involving Government grants of any kind, for any purpose, I felt obliged to defend the proposal in full, and the absence of any attempt to defend this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;mark you, we were to defend the kind of thing the Minister for Industry and Commerce is perpetuating today&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by the Minister in introducing it, the unwarranted assumption upon which he based his remarks, indicate to me that no very great thought has been given to this proposition at all.</P>
      <P>Time belied, and will continue to belie, the prognostications of Deputy Lemass, because, as the Minister said, this is only a temporary measure to meet further requirements in the field of industry.</P>
      <P>At column 1950 Deputy Lemass went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that this Bill introduces <Col N="358" /> an undesirable principle in the operation of industrial policy, that it is unnecessary, that the aid which industry requires is not this type of aid and that the whole origin of the Bill is the inability of the Government to think beyond the surface of things, to get down to an understanding of the real causes which are holding up national development, their desire to appear to be doing something, whether they get results or not, in order to safeguard their political position for the time being.</P>
    <P>Again, time and the statistics produced by the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Central Statistics Office show how valuable this measure was and how right and proper it is that in 1968 we should increase the moneys available to the Industrial Development Authority, as suggested in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Then Deputy Lemass at column 1950 said:</P>
    <P>The Minister can have his Bill as far as I am concerned, but I want to make it clear that, in my view&mdash;and I may at some time in the future be empowered to influence Government policy&mdash;I think it has no importance whatever in relation to our industrial development and it represents a completely wrong approach to the problems of Irish industry as they exist today.</P>
    <P>That was Deputy Lemass in 1956, and now in 1968 we have a sum of £30 million being provided for grants under the Act. Deputy Lemass took the trouble some time after his Party had been returned to office, after 1957, to repeal that Act. He did of course, but the principle contained in the new Act was the same, and we merely got rid of the body that was administering the Undeveloped Areas Act and amalgamated it with the Industrial Development Authority. Of course, the idea was that the Industrial Grants Act would continue to be in operation but it would have been enacted during Fianna Fáil's terms of office.</P>
    <P>It is right and proper to point out that it was the late Deputy Norton, as Minister for Industry and Commerce in the inter-Party Government, who introduced that Bill and on the same <Col N="359" /> day, the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, another stimulus to industrialists and exporters, was introduced by Deputy Sweetman, then Minister for Finance. Now, that is dealing with some of the malicious&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Minister for Auctions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Minister for Finance. That is merely by way of dealing with some of the false, and to his knowledge false, propaganda about Fine Gael and the inter-Party Government. In this Industrial Grants Act, 1956, there was power, and I rather think there still is power, for the Industrial Development Authority to impose conditions. One can see a variety of conditions related to industry which are desirable and necessary to impose, but I regret, and I think the Minister will share this regret, as well as the people at large, that an obligation was not imposed on all persons getting these grants to employ trade union labour and trade union labour only.</P>
      <P>Some people might think that this would frighten foreign capital away. If it frightens foreign capital away, if they do not want to live in Ireland in Irish conditions, they are not wanted here. Most foreign industrialists would undoubtedly have accepted that in the mid-1950s and in the 1960s, in a world in which labour is having its say, in the age of the common man, it was only right that trade unions should exist and that foreign investors who are going to make a profit out of their investigations here should be required to employ trade union labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There does not seem to me to be any reason why that condition should not have been imposed. It appears in all Government contracts, whether they be for the building of a school, the building of a Department of State or the building of an office block under the aegis of the Government: the labour to be employed under the contract must be trade union labour. I see no reason why we should differentiate between foreign industrialists, who are getting grants, and native industrialists or native <i>entrepreneurs</i> obtaining Government grants. If that stipulation <Col N="360" /> had been incorporated, the unholy and unwholesome development with the EI at Shannon would never have occurred, because, from the beginning, they would have employed trade union labour and, had that been done, there would now be no need for Government commissions or inquiries, and we would never have had the position in which a member of the Garda Síochána nearly lost his life because foreign industrialists refused to employ trade union labour.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure for the future that we shall not have a repetition of this type of dispute, it should be a condition imposed by the Industrial Development Authority, when making the grant, that only trade union labour will be employed and, if a foreign industrialist is not prepared to accept that condition, then the industry or service he proposes to establish or give is doomed from the beginning to disharmony and disruption and will never be a success. In this country trade union labour is so strongly organised that in the end&mdash;let there be no doubt about it&mdash;it will prevail. There may sometimes be disastrous consequences on one side or the other but&mdash;let there be no doubt about it&mdash;organised trade union labour will always prevail and, therefore, anybody coming in here ought to be brought face to face with the realities of Irish industry and Irish life. I urge on the Minister the amendment, if it is necessary, of the Industrial Grants Act so that the Industrial Development Authority will have power to prevent a repetition of the kind of situation we have at the moment at Shannon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, when introducing this Bill, it is a very limited measure. It has only two purposes&mdash; one, to raise to the sum of £40 million, the total amount which may be paid out by An Foras Tionscal by way of grants or on the development of industrial estates and, secondly, to raise to the same amount the total sum which may be paid by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to An Foras Tionscal to enable them to do that. Despite that, the debate has ranged somewhat wider than these limited <Col N="361" /> purposes might suggest and I do not propose now to follow the whole range of that debate. There are, however, a few points upon which I should comment.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to a survey of grant-aided industry which was carried out some little time ago and from the report on which the Taoiseach quoted recently in Killarney. There seemed to be some suggestion by Senator Garret FitzGerald that there was a reluctance to publish this report. I want to assure the Seanad that there is no such reluctance. The report is being printed at the moment and will be published as soon as it is available.</P>
      <P>Secondly, there was criticism, also by Senator FitzGerald, of the fact that the proposals for the changes in our industrialisation programme have not been brought forward sooner, having regard to the length of time during which the report of the consultants, A.D. Little, Incorporated, has been available. I want to make it clear to the House that the review carried out of our whole industrial programme is considerably wider than the scope of the consultants' report and did necessitate a good deal of thought, research and consultation. Some of the effects of that have already been announced. I expect a great many more of the effects will be announced within a matter of weeks. It is true, of course, that the preparation and enactment of the necessary legislation in this regard will take time. It would be quite unrealistic to expect it before the Summer Recess. However, the announcement of the Government's decisions in these various fields should be of considerable assistance in enabling those concerned with industrial development to know where they are likely to stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to assure the Seanad that, in arriving at these decisions, I and the Government had available to us the views of the NIEC on the Little Report and they were taken into consideration in arriving at decisions. I want to make it clear that they are the views of the NIEC. The ultimate responsibility in this matter rests on the Government. While we are very glad to have these views available and to take them fully into account, nevertheless the proposals will be the proposals <Col N="362" /> of the Government and of nobody else.</P>
    <P>I deny the suggestion that there has been in the past&mdash;certainly in the recent past&mdash;and that there continues to be a prejudice against capital intensive projects. I understood Senator FitzGerald to say that this prejudice is enshrined in existing legislation. I cannot think of any basis for that statement unless he means that where the level of grant in a project is particularly high, the project must be approved by the Government. If that is what he is referring to, this is merely an administrative precaution and does not represent a prejudice against capital intensive industry. Neither does it operate as a brake on the establishment of projects. There are, in fact, in the pipeline at the moment some projects which are particularly capital intensive and, under our existing legislation, there is no reason whatever why they cannot be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Decisions have been announced by me in regard to the setting up of regional offices of the Industrial Development Authority in different parts of the country and the conferring on the Shannon Free Airport Development Company of the responsibility for the promotion of industry in the Limerick/Clare/North Tipperary region; I want to make it clear now that the regions for industrialisation purposes may not necessarily correspond with the physical planning regions dealt with in the Buchanan Report. Indeed, I did make it clear that it seemed possible, and likely, that the number of regions for industrialisation purposes would be smaller than the number of regions dealt with for the purposes of physical planning.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan had some interesting observations to make. I do not propose to follow them as I do not think it would be appropriate for me to do so on this Bill, but he did talk about the necessity for the devolution of authority. This is a principle with which I agree, a principle which is being put into practice in the conferring of power on the Shannon Free Airport Development Company in regard to the region I have mentioned and in the proposed setting-up of <Col N="363" /> regional offices of the Industrial Development Authority. I believe that we can probably do a great deal more effective work if we can combine and co-ordinate the enthusiasm and the knowledge in particular localities which could not be available to a central office in Dublin and, indeed, that a certain amount of competition between the regions will be a healthy thing. On the other hand, it should be quite clear that there are some things which cannot be left to each region, that if you had a situation where each region was competing abroad in its publicity and at home for foreign industrialists arriving in this country, you could end up with a chaotic situation which would ultimately do us a great deal more harm than good. So that the proposals we have in mind are designed as far as possible to utilise local enthusiasm, local knowledge, local expertise, but at the same time, to exercise sufficient central control to prevent the development of the kind of chaotic situation I have indicated.</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion also that there is overlapping of the functions of Government Departments and that this is a matter that could easily be overcome. There is, of course, an overlapping of functions of Government Departments in various fields. This is quite true. What is not true is that it is easy to overcome and this is not because of empire building on the part of either Ministers or civil servants. Somebody&mdash;it may have been Senator FitzGerald&mdash;referred to the situation in regard to the Shannon Company and the fact that it will be answerable in portion of its activities to the Minister for Transport and Power and in other of its activities, to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I am not sure if it was Senator FitzGerald who said this&mdash;it might have been Senator Quinlan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The mere fact that this happens is not of itself evidence of an overlapping that could easily be dealt with and is not dealt with. Of course, <Col N="364" /> it is quite simple to deal with it by dividing the Shannon Company into two companies and saying that one will be answerable to the Minister for Transport and Power and one will be answerable to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but this would be an impractical solution, as anybody who knows the situation in Shannon will understand. There is another question, especially in the context of giving the Shannon Company much wider responsibility for the development of the whole region, namely, whether it is not more desirable to have it dealing with the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I think, on balance, this is a better situation, that it should be dealing with the Department of Industry and Commerce in this regard. The fact that it will be dealing with and responsible to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in that regard is, as I say, on balance, the better solution.</P>
      <P>It is not, perhaps, the tidiest solution on paper but I think it is the best solution we can get, and the fact that it will be answerable to two Ministers is not of itself evidence of failure to cut the red tape or evidence of empire building on the part of one Department or another or one Minister or another. It is simply that, when you get down to brass tacks, there are functions which necessarily overlap and, indeed, Senator FitzGerald, in a slightly different context, referred to the same thing when he referred to the necessity to have co-ordination of efforts in regard to, say, housing, sewerage, the building of factories, the attraction of industry, and so on. This is quite true. Of course, it is necessary to co-ordinate these and this is one of the advantages of a regional approach, that it should be possible to get better co-ordination in that regard. But, no matter how far you co-ordinate in this way, if you keep on co-ordinating and keep on avoiding this overlapping of functions, you can end up with a beautiful structure with one man on the top of it but everything else is under him.</P>

      <P>To get back to what seemed to me, perhaps, the only point of relevance to our situation today made by Senator O'Quigley, he spoke about what I think is a very serious and important matter. He advocated that we ought to make it a condition of any grant from An Foras Tionscal that the firm concerned should employ trade union labour. As I say, this is a very serious matter, especially in the context of the dispute of which we are all aware, but I think we ought to hesitate before we rush headlong into this. I do not think there is much doubt that most people in this House and in Dáil Éireann would sympathise with this view. Lest there be any doubt, let me make it quite clear that any foreign industrialist coming to set up here in Ireland is very strongly advised by the Industrial Development Authority&mdash; very strongly advised&mdash;that he should enter into negotiations with a trade union for the organisation of the workers in his factory. Indeed, the vast majority of them accept this advice. But to go the whole hog and make this a condition of the giving of a grant is another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> I would remind the House that when the late Deputy Norton, who was then Leader of the Labour Party, was Minister for Industry and Commerce, he must have considered this matter very seriously and he obviously decided against it. I should imagine his colleagues in the Coalition Government decided against it also, for what I think is a fairly good reason. If you want to do this, you must also provide that every industry in Ireland, home or foreign, should employ only trade union labour.</P>

I do not know what is going to emerge from them but there are some indications that a satisfactory solution may emerge. I am quite confident in these cases a solution can be found ultimately with patience. That we may tend to lose patience does not justify losing sight of the objective of providing more employment for our people in reasonable conditions. As Minister for Industry and Commerce, this is my objective. This is the one I have to keep my sights trained on. There are certain things I am not prepared to sacrifice in order to achieve that objective, but neither am I prepared to sacrifice that objective for something that would perhaps be achieved more easily than by sacrificing that objective. For that reason I am concerned very strongly that we ought to think and think again before we would introduce the kind of condition that has been suggested in this regard.</P>

      <P>This amendment is being introduced in implementation of a recommendation by the Conciliation Council for Secondary Teachers at its meeting of 7th October, 1966. National Teachers have enjoyed a similar privilege since 1962.</P>
      <P>The amendment provides for the retention in approved teaching service, of those members of the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation Scheme whose date of birth occurs in the last quarter of the school year for a period of not more than three months, provided such retention enables these teachers to complete an additional year of service for pension purposes.</P>
      <P>Only completed years of service as a member of the scheme are reckonable in the calculation of pension and gratuity and this amendment provides certain members who would normally retire with a year of service almost completed with the opportunity of completing the year. It comes into force on or after 31st July, 1966. I think it will be generally welcomed by the secondary teaching profession as bringing them into line with the primary teachers in this respect.</P>

      <P>Yes. I hope this will be retrospective. The only other point that occurs to me is that this matter was approved by the Minister for Finance on 19th February, 1968. Does it not take a great length of time before the machinery of the Civil Service and the whole apparatus of Government and of Parliament gets into action to get this scheme ratified?</P>
      <P>I do not want to delay any longer but I want to stress one point. The Minister for Industry and Commerce was engaged on a Bill the other day on which I was suggesting that certain orders which were in fact amending sections of the legislation should be laid in draft before each House of the Oireachtas. I had pointed out to him that traditionally when such draft orders came before the House, they went through very quickly. I made the same suggestion on the Road Traffic Bill and on the Military Pensions Bill. So also this particular scheme comes before the Oireachtas and the Minister has no difficulty whatever in getting it through so far as this Party is concerned, and I doubt if the House will delay it any longer than I have delayed it so that any delay there is in bringing in the scheme rests with the Minister's Department.</P>
      <P>It is very appropriate that matters of this kind should require confirmation. There are certain regulations which will always be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas or, as in the case of this regulation, will require confirmation. In normal circumstances, neither of these procedures will entail great delay but they do maintain the supremacy of the people over the established Civil Service and that is very important at this time. It is very important that the people's Parliament should be supreme and not the civil servants who do things surreptitiously by making regulations and laying them before both Houses of the Oireachtas in the hope that nobody will ever read them. I hope there are some Members now assiduously looking at this regulation.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the <Col N="373" /> National Teachers' Organisation, I am pleased to welcome this regulation, which has enshrined in it a concession already negotiated by the INTO some years ago. It is a further step in the direction of a unitary teaching profession. I should like to appeal to the Minister and his advisers who are present to cut through the jungle of these pension regulations and rationalise the situation. It is totally inequitable that pension and gratuity on retirement should be based on completed years of service. It is grossly unfair that a person who has given 364 days of service is denied credit for that service just because it is not a completed year. All service must be taken into account in the calculation of pension and gratuity. If it is 39 years and 364 days, credit must be given for that total amount. I appeal to the Minister to have a look at this whole question of pensionable service as applying to the teaching profession and to rationalise it and up-date it to the situation which exists in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Brosnahan. As a teacher myself, I am glad to see the Minister is pursuing his already well defined policy of breaking through the barriers that exists in the various grades of education, national, secondary and higher, and that he is also extending that way of thinking to the various teaching professions. As primary teachers, we are glad that the same facilities apply both to ourselves and to the secondary teachers as regards salary and pension.</P>
      <P>I also want to support the plea regarding years of service. I am sure there are many teachers, both national and secondary, who gave many years of service in a temporary capacity and did excellent work at a time when there was a surplus of teachers. I should like the Minister to take cognisance of that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. I welcome the fact that the Seanad sees in this motion a practical effort to get around to what I believe in very strongly, greater unification of the teaching profession at primary and <Col N="374" /> post-primary levels, so that we can get away from what I believe are outmoded compartments in education between primary and secondary education and we can unify them all under the one system of education. Indeed, this order brings this one aspect of superannuation in regard to secondary teachers into line with what has existed in regard to national teachers. I should like this to go much further, and the recent tribunal report is an effort in this direction as well. All in all, I should like to see the time when there is a regional educational authority in every region in the country that would supervise all primary and post-primary education as we have known it heretofore and ensure that there is fertilisation among the various branches of education and that there is an overall administration which will provide the acquired co-operation among them. This is a matter to which we are giving a lot of attention in the Department. I have already made reference to it and I hope to be able to announce some practical results inside the next few months. I believe very strongly that we must get away from the old compart-mentalising of these sectors of education and get around to the idea of regarding them as one. This order is a step in that direction, a small step, but there will be far bigger steps which I hope to take in the coming months in this direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is the culmination of a great deal of effort in the educational field in recent years. The fact that free post-primary education is now generally available, and the need for post-primary scholarships consequently ended, has enabled the Government to turn its attention to the financing of higher education and to <Col N="375" /> the provision of as much money as our resources will allow to enable students, who otherwise could not afford it, to proceed to courses of higher education.</P>
      <P>The first thing to be said about the scheme envisaged in this Bill is that it will provide equal opportunities for all who come within its scope. In the former scholarship schemes, if a candidate came from a poor county with few scholarships he could be unlucky, while a candidate with lower marks from a more affluent county could be awarded a scholarship. The scheme now proposed is on a national basis and all candidates, no matter where they come from, will get their appropriate grant provided they satisfy the academic and means requirements laid down. Thus, the door of opportunity will be opened to many from a segment of our population who hitherto were unable to go as far as their abilities could carry them. Furthermore, students will be allowed to hold their grants not only in universities but also in other approved institutions of higher education which offer courses leading to a full professional qualification of university degree level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some criticism has been voiced at the idea of associating a means test with these grants. The main purpose of the means test is to enable me to be reasonably generous in the case of those who require it most. Of course, we have the proposition of free higher education for all being made by some people who apparently have not stopped to consider the social and other implications of what they are proposing. Apart from this the practicalities of the situation are that no scheme such as the present one can be considered in isolation. It must be seen in the context of the overall economic requirements of the country and, more particularly, in the context of the general education provision. In the last few years this has doubled to a figure of £54 million. I make no apology, therefore, in insisting that the money available be spent on those who will benefit most from it. This necessitates a means test. Senators will see that the means conditions are fully set out in <Col N="376" /> the explanatory memorandum. From a basic figure of £1,200 they proceed to £2,600 depending on the number of children in the family. The full rates of grant, £175 per annum to students living in or near a centre of higher education and £300 per annum otherwise, correspond to the highest rates of university scholarship offered in recent times. Reduced rates are payable by reference to family income and the number of dependent children.</P>
    <P>The new scheme will, of course, do away with the non-means test scholarships which were a feature of former schemes. It would not be practicable to introduce non-means test arrangements into the proposed legislation, as all element of competition as between candidate and candidate has been done away with. However, I have had discussions with the university authorities with a view to increasing substantially the number of their entrance scholarships on a non-means test basis.</P>
    <P>The standard of attainment for grant purposes in the new scheme has been set at four honours in matriculation subjects at the leaving certificate examination. While some may hold that this standard is too high, I might remind Senators that it was reached by over 1,900 candidates at last year's leaving certificate examination. There is no reason that I can see why we should not put a premium on attainment, particularly where entrance to higher education is involved. We must remember, too, that this is an investment by the community in the youth of the country. Only a certain amount of money can be invested at any given time, so that we must try to ensure the best return possible for the investment made.</P>
    <P>The practical application of these proposals will be that this year, we estimate, over 900 students will be helped along the road to higher studies. When we relate this to the former position, where about 275 university scholarships were awarded annually, it is immediately evident that the scheme represents a very substantial advance and is a further earnest of the Government's commitment to education.</P>
    <P>As to the financing of the scheme <Col N="377" /> generally, we propose to fix the local authority commitment at the amount raised by the County and Borough Councils under the 1944 and 1961 scholarship Acts, in the year 1967-68, a sum of about £280,000. Whatever additional money is needed will be provided from State funds. It is estimated that in three to four years the annual cost will be running at £750,000 of which the State will be contributing £470,000. I should, perhaps, emphasise that the cost to the local authorities will be the net cost of scholarships and continuing scholarships in 1967-68, that is to say, the total moneys spent by them in respect of that year less the amount of the State recoupment.</P>
    <P>In the drafting of this Bill we have kept before our minds the need to fashion a flexible piece of legislation which can be adapted to suit future requirements. This I think we have succeeded in doing. The means conditions and the attainment standards may be altered by me from time to time, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in accordance with the dictates of experience and changing circumstances. It is intended to repeal existing enactment so that the new legislation will be the foundation for all future aid to students in higher education, the basic instrument for social and educational advancement. I do not claim that it will take all the thorns out of the educational bed of roses but it will certainly spread the roses more equitably and remove many thorns from where they hurt most&mdash;in the lower income ranges. I, therefore, confidently recommend this piece of legislation to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>There is no question but that the House will welcome a Bill such as this which gives a substantial increase in the amount of money which is available to help the qualified, the talented but needy student to avail of higher educational facilities. But when the Minister goes on to speak, as he does in his address, of this being &ldquo;the foundation for all future aid&rdquo;&mdash; I quote him&mdash;&ldquo;to students in higher education, the basic instrument for social and educational advancement,&rdquo; I think the House must take a hard <Col N="378" /> look at the Minister's proposals. If those proposals had been brought to us as the best thing to be done in the coming year and the year after, we might well be content to say: &ldquo;Yes, this seems a good stopgap measure. What you propose seems to be the best way of doing something quickly.&rdquo; Proposed to us as it is as being the basis of all future aid, as being an integral part of the planning for Irish education, we must, I think, go beyond mere gratification that more money is to be available in the coming year and the year after, to look at the Minister's proposals, look at the nature of those proposals in the context of long-term educational planning.</P>
      <P>We must, if we are to do this, look carefully at our present position. We must also I think examine the proposals that have been put forward in various directions in order to improve our present position and solve the problems which we have. The Minister has in his approach to this problem, as reflected in the speech he has just made recommending the Bill to the Seanad, shown a failure to grapple with the long-term considerations, a failure to integrate those proposals into a long-term educational plan. The Minister has, for example, spoken in his introductory speech of the fact that, and I quote from his speech, &ldquo;When we relate this to the former position, where about 275 university scholarships were awarded annually&rdquo;, it is immediately evident that the scheme represents a very substantial advance&rdquo;, we must draw the conclusion here that the Minister is talking about scholarship grants by local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the whole picture. We have got to look at the whole picture. We have got to look at our overall position before we can produce an integrated policy for the financing of higher education. We have, of course, very valuable information on our present position in the second part of the Report of the Commission on Higher Education. According to this report there were in 1964-65, the year to which the report statistics refer, just under 1,500 Irish students receiving support from Irish sources, just under 16 per cent. Of those 714 were receiving <Col N="379" /> support from local authorities, at an average rate of £180 a year, 544 were receiving support of one type or another from the various university institutions at an average award of about £100. There were in the Minister's own Department 103 further scholarships at an average award of £230. There were further scholarships from the Department of Agriculture and from some other Irish sources.</P>
    <P>However, while we must relate what we are going to discuss to this general picture the Minister has concentrated on the scholarships which were previously administered, and to a great extent, paid for by the local authorities and which he proposes should continue to be administered by the local authorities and paid for in part by them. Those local authority scholarships, such as they exist at the moment, are certainly more uniform than they were in years past but they are still uneven in number of scholarships, in standards, in value of scholarships, in conditions for renewal and many other aspects. It is, indeed, an improvement that the Minister should in the present Bill do something to redress this situation.</P>
    <P>Our position, as revealed by the Report of the Commission on Higher Education, and before that by the Report on Investment in Education was that approximately 16 per cent of our university students were receiving scholarships. When we set out to review this position and see what can be done about it it is natural that we should compare this with the situation in other countries. When we do, we find an immediate and stark contrast if we compare the situation here with the situation in the United Kingdom and, indeed, the situation in Northern Ireland. In England and Wales 98 per cent of their undergraduate students hold awards. In Scotland it is 90 per cent and in Northern Ireland 82 per cent.</P>
    <P>On the continent of Europe conditions vary very greatly. Though most continental universities are somewhat like the State Universities in America the fees are non-existent or nominal, so that the effect, even where there are <Col N="380" /> no direct schemes for support of students, is that they are, in fact, receiving virtually full remission of fees. If we look at those countries, the Commission on Higher Education tells us that in 1961 Belgium supported 35 per cent of its university students and in that year 42 per cent of new entrants. This is a figure perhaps, rather higher than the average. In the Netherlands it was 30 per cent and in Federal Germany 35 per cent. So, we find in this we have in the past been behind and so we face a very real problem.</P>
    <P>We have to see whether we in the future can really solve our problem of getting the right people into the universities on the basis of a scheme such as we have had. If we look at the comparative figures we find, in fact, if we compare the number of students in Irish university institutions relative to the population with similar figures for other countries, that this country is not very much out of line. On the other hand, if we examine the position in regard to the extent to which different social groups are represented in our student population we find the tendency for manual workers to be under-represented in the universities, which is universal, is even more accentuated in this country than elsewhere. So we find the situation is that, whereas our population of university students is not greatly out of line with that of the rest of Europe, in fact, the way in which this population draws from different sectors in the community is very much out of line.</P>
    <P>We all want to remedy this position but there is no easy solution. University education is an expensive commodity. In some areas it is extremely expensive. It just cannot be available at low cost to all who apply. We are faced with the problem of determining a policy in this regard. There has been a tendency in the discussions in this country over recent years to say that what we should set out to do, as soon as we can, as soon as circumstances permit, is to make university education available to all who can benefit. This is a nice, comfortable phrase but I am afraid we will have to be really more precise about it. While there may be a small majority of people reaching <Col N="381" /> academic standard who, in fact, dis-improve in personality and otherwise during their university careers the vast majority of students will obtain some benefit from a period spent at the university. We may well find, if we try to make it available to all who would benefit even to a small degree, that the problem will be one which is just too difficult to solve. We would, in fact, be giving those people a relatively small benefit at a relatively high cost and at a time when in the community there are competing pressures for scarce resources, this might well not be a good investment.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I think we can all agree that, no matter what our criterion is, a university education should be made available&mdash;and made available as soon as possible&mdash;to all who can benefit substantially from it. Where there is a high degree of benefit, this is justified not only from the point of view of giving the individual the opportunity to realise his own abilities, but also from the point of view of the community as a whole even if interpreted in a narrow economic sense. Those who can benefit substantially from a university education would give in their turn substantial benefit to the community when they returned to it.</P>
    <P>I have said before, when discussing education in this House, that the various objectives of education and the various reasons why we spend large sums of money on education are not antagonistic to one another but are complementary and sometimes reinforce one another. Whether we consider education from the point of view of the development of the individual, from the point of view of the transmission of culture, or from the point of view of training skilled manpower, we will&mdash;notwithstanding these very distinct objectives&mdash;reach a conclusion as to our best strategy which will not differ largely from differing degrees of emphasis on these different points of view.</P>
    <P>We have the position now that there are many people who are unable to enter our universities who could substantially benefit. Why is it? What are <Col N="382" /> the reasons which prevent them from doing so? One reason may be that the person does not enter the university because he cannot reach the academic entry standard required. In some cases this is something which cannot be remedied. The person's particular endowments are not of the academic type which would allow him to do so. There are, however, many people who if properly developed would be able to reach that standard but cannot do so because of the deficiencies in our secondary education system. We all hope that in the years to come this will be increasingly remedied.</P>
    <P>The second reason why persons are not able to attend a university is the reason with which we are largely concerned in this debate. Their parents may not be financially able to meet the expense of a university education, or the family may be unable to forgo the earnings of the child during the period of university education. This is something which will be remedied in part by the proposal the Minister is now making. It is something which money can solve, but even if we were to solve this problem completely there is still a further bar to entry to the university, and one which we will ignore at our peril. It is that there are certain what might be called social attitudes which result in a lack of participation in university education by certain sectors of the community.</P>
    <P>Studies which have been made about choice of career by students reveal that by, far the most compelling factor in the choice of career is the attitude of the family towards the various careers, and the views which parents and other members of the families and other relatives have about appropriate careers. That is by far the largest single factor in the determination of choice of career. That is the reason why even if we were to solve the financial problems completely we would still find that a certain section of the community would not participate in university education to the extent which we would expect from their relative numbers among the community.</P>
    <P>I have talked of the position in the United Kingdom where 98 per cent of <Col N="383" /> all undergraduate students are supported at the university by their local authorities. The position is that at the present time what we might term broadly the working-classes are not by any means represented at the universities in proportion to their numbers. More than 20 years after the Butler Education Act which brought free secondary education, Britain has still not got a balanced participation by all her social groups in her universities. We must remember that this problem is one which must also be solved. I mentioned that what is being done and what will be done in regard to secondary education will remove one of the road blocks in the way of producing in this country an ideal university population, and in getting as close as we can to the ideal where our university population would consist of those for whom it is most appropriate they should be there.</P>
    <P>Of course, the solution of many problems in regard to secondary education as well as in regard to maintenance grants for those now unable to attend will aggravate some of our other problems. The provision of extra money for grants will increase the pressure on university accommodation. This is a very real problem but it is a problem we must face. Everyone concerned, the Government, the legislature and the university authorities sooner or later must face this question of how this increased entry is to be handled. We hope we can remove the faults in the present system but we may in doing so find that we are creating new problems for ourselves. Certainly that is no reason why we should not go ahead. It is a reason why we should be very careful of the manner in which we go ahead&mdash; the fact is that there will be problems; our very success in certain areas will produce problems in others.</P>
    <P>In regard to our position at the moment, we may divide our pupils into different types. Of those leaving secondary school under our existing system, brilliant students get to the university; they get there under the existing scholarship system. The <Col N="384" /> student who qualifies according to the present entry standards, which I for one believe are too low, gets there in one of two cases: firstly, if his parents can afford to send him there or, secondly if his parents think so highly of the value of university education that they consider almost any sacrifice worth while in order to make this available for their family.</P>
    <P>We also have in our universities at the moment some students who are only barely qualified to benefit substantially from university education and I think we have some who, perhaps, would be regarded as not qualified to benefit substantially from university education. In a complete university, it may be necessary to have a leavening of some of the latter in order to have a full university community. Our problem is to use our various resources&mdash;physical, academic and financial&mdash;to see that all those who are really qualified to benefit substantially from university education will be enabled to receive it irrespective of their financial and social background. We are all agreed on this objective. There will be no quarrel in this debate as to whether this should or should not be done. The differences of opinion that will arise will be about the best way in which this can be done. In this, I for one will differ with some of the proposals the Minister put before us. During the past few years, we have had various suggestions and various proposed solutions in this regard.</P>
    <P>For many years, we had the operation of the local authority scholarship scheme under the 1908 Universities Act. This was supplemented by the 1944 and 1961 Acts but these were largely an extension of existing provisions. The various steps taken at those times were taken largely from the point of view that it would appear that, if we made increased provision, things would be better. At those times, we had no facts, statistics or real information on which we could plan ahead. However, in more recent years we have been luckier: we have had a number of studies, a number of publications, which help the Minister, the Government and the Oireachtas to evaluate. <Col N="385" /> far more effectively than was possible before, the merits of different proposals. The first of these was the report on <i>Investment in Education.</i> This report was concerned largely with primary and post-primary education. Nevertheless, it did refer to university education and to the problems of the financing of university education. In particular, it pointed out the effect of the present system of block grants to university institutions on the availability of university education.</P>
    <P>In the report on <i>Investment in Education</i> which was published in December, 1965, we can read on page 311, paragraph 11.28, the verdict of the survey team on the existing methods of financing the universities. It is necessary for me to quote only a single sentence:</P>
    <P>It seems reasonable to conclude that the present system achieves neither economic nor social objectives.</P>
    <P>This, then, is the result of the examination by the expert survey team that the system by which we were financing our higher education achieved neither economic nor social objectives. However, as I said, this team were not concerned with the problems of higher education: these were then a matter of gestation by the Commission on Higher Education.</P>
    <P>Even before the Commission on Higher Education reported in its detailed and valuable report, the Fine Gael Party set up a special committee to develop an educational policy and this policy was published in November, 1966, being the second part of the developed policy for <i>A Just Society</i> published by the Fine Gael Party and, in this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In this document there are quite detailed proposals in regard to the financing of university education&mdash;proposals which are at variance with proposals produced by the Minister some 18 months later&mdash; which, in my opinion, still show a more appropriate direction on planning for education than those contained in the Minister's proposals enshrined in the present Bill. It is not my fault, nor is it the fault of the Fine Gael Party, that there has not been an opportunity before this to discuss these proposals for the financing of university education in this House. These proposals were set out in detail in Paragraphs 146 to 158 of that particular policy document and were part of a motion which was set down in this House for discussion at the end of 1966. This motion which was set down on behalf of the Fine Gael Party instanced nine points on which there appeared to be differences of policy, differences of approach, in regard to education between our Party and the Government, as evidenced by a comparison of our policy statement with that made about the same time by the Minister for Education in introducing his Estimate in the Dáil. Six of these nine points dealt with primary and post-primary education and were discussed in this House in February, 1967. A further point was discussed in January of this year in a debate in the House.</P>
      <P>We find ourselves now, in conjunction with this debate, discussing the remaining two points of this nine-point motion set down in December, 1966. We find ourselves in the position that only now have we the opportunity to put forward to the Minister for his consideration our point of view in regard to this matter&mdash;at a time when the Minister and the Government have made up their minds about what they intend to do and have enshrined it in the present legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the position that, in January, 1968, when the report of the Commission on Higher Education was being discussed, the late Minister for Education refused to discuss the other two parts of this motion on the grounds that this matter was then before the Government for decision. I <Col N="387" /> should like to put it to the Minister that it would be more profitable, I think, for all concerned if, in cases like this&mdash;the discussion of questions on which we are all agreed as to the objective to be achieved but differ as to the best means of achieving it&mdash; debates were held in this House in the atmosphere in which this House has shown itself capable of discussing such matters, before the Government have made up their minds in regard to details of legislation.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, we have for the past 18 months been willing and anxious to discuss these particular proposals and glancing at the Bill and listening to what the Minister has had to say, I feel, indeed, that something has been lost by the fact that it is only now that we, in conjunction with this debate, put forward for the consideration of the Seanad and for the consideration of the Minister these particular proposals. I should like to remind the Minister of them. He made a reference to out-of-date periodicals and I take it he has not recently read the document concerned. Therefore, I would remind him and the House of what is contained in it. In this document, which devoted a whole section to the financing of university education, was set out the clear objectives which are shared by us all. That is, that any proposals for university finance would be designed to ensure that Government aid for university education would be directed to those people most able to benefit from university education so that all those young people irrespective of their family commitments will have the opportunity of securing a standard of education appropriate to their abilities.</P>
    <P>This report went on to discuss the situation which had been revealed by the report on <i>Investment in Education.</i> In its next paragraph it rejected the idea of financing education by a loan system as a general procedure. It then went on to tackle the key problem which was revealed by the report on <i>Investment in Education</i>, the effect of block grants for university financing. It suggested here&mdash;and this is something to which the Minister should give <Col N="388" /> serious consideration&mdash;that an attempt should be made to get away from the present block grant system which, though good presumably from some points of view, in fact, obscures the real costs of university education.</P>
    <P>Nobody knows the real costs of different parts of university education and this is a serious handicap from the points of view of any planning in this sphere. Having reviewed this matter the document then went on to make specific proposals. It proposed in paragraph 150 of this report and I quote:</P>
    <P>Fine Gael, therefore, proposes to introduce a scheme of fee and maintenance grants for university students. We intend that these fee and maintenance grants should be available to all who require them and who qualify to enter a university in accordance with entrance standards laid down by the university authorities and acceptable to the Government.</P>
    <P>While we made it quite clear that it would only be possible to work out with the aid of the Civil Service the details of such a plan, nevertheless we gave certain indications of what our thinking was in this regard. We emphasised in paragraph 152 that there was a great deal to be said for replacing our present unreal scale of university fees by economic fees, by attempting to establish what were the economic fees in regard to various undergraduate courses and making these the fees.</P>
    <P>It is undoubtedly a difficult matter, in the complex economies of the present time which abound throughout the world, to determine real costs&mdash;even more difficult to determine real benefits&mdash;of any economic activity. Nevertheless, I sometimes think that we in Ireland have got a greater skill than any other country in confusing what are the real costs in a given situation. We have the position at the moment that the fees which are charged in the universities are something of the order of one-third of the real cost. There are two directions in which you can move if you want to do something in regard to making sure that these are not a barrier to people entering the university. You could increase your block <Col N="389" /> grants and abolish fees altogether, as is done in some continental countries, or you could reduce your block grants and bring your fees to something more closely approximating economic fees and then introduce a scheme of aiding the students.</P>
    <P>We feel it would be very much better if the real costs of undergraduate education were known to the Government, known to the universities, known to the parents and known to the students. We warned people at this particular time, the time when the summary Report of the Commission on Higher Education was not available, of the need to face this problem. We also proposed that maintenance grants should be instituted, recognising that even if fees were to be paid for by the State, if free grants were made available to the students, nevertheless, there still remains the real problem of maintenance grants. We distinguish, as all the later reports were to distinguish, between maintenance grants for those living close to university centres and those who would have to live in digs while attending the university. Our proposals, indeed, were that the grants or local maintenance grants, should probably be of the order of £150 and that these should be made available to all families eligible for social insurance and that this should be organised by a joint Civil Service/University Committee in each case. This proposal of ours, made in November, 1966, is similar to the proposal for local grants which the Minister now proposes. Indeed, his figure of £175 in this case is similar, though slightly above, the Fine Gael figure. I do not know whether this is based on the change in the cost of living or whether the proposal is meant to outbid the Fine Gael proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps if the Minister read the document he might not have forgotten about the fees. He also proposed in regard to those who need board maintenance, that these should have maintenance grants and that they should be of the order of £350. We recognise that institution of <Col N="390" /> this, or any scheme, calls into question the whole present scheme of local authority scholarships and raises the question as to what function local authority scholarships should play in a student support programme of the future. Our conclusion was that there would have to be a very serious modification of the local authority scheme, that some scholarships should be maintained as an incentive for brilliant scholars but that largely the scholarship scheme for the ordinary case should no longer be left to the local authority.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister considers the Report of the Commission on Higher Education as being an out-of-date document but I should like to refer to what the Commission have to say on the problem of which is the best method of financing scholarships in the university. The summary of their report was issued in March, 1967, and in it there are indications of the Commission's proposals, which amounts to a general scheme consisting of scholarships, loans and grants. Even in the summary it was made specifically clear that the scheme proposed by them for scholarship purposes was intended to supersede the local authority scheme. Their proposal was that there should be variable amounts of scholarships, varying from the payment of fees only to fees plus an allowance of £250, the total to be borne by the State.</P>
      <P>It was a year later, in March, 1968, before we got the full version of the proposals by the Commission on Higher Education. This was contained in volume 2 of the full Report of the Commission. In chapter 29 there is a very complete review of the situation in the past and of the Commission's proposals for the future in this respect. There, again, we find no difference in principle. Indeed, I wish to emphasise that the differences which exist between the Commission's proposals, those of the Minister and the proposals of Fine Gael do not imply differences in regard to principle. In chapter 29 the Commission affirms as a principle that no qualified student should be denied the opportunity of higher education because of lack of means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> This is the principle on which we are all agreed, but the proposal the Commission put forward has certain features in which it differs considerably from the proposals now put forward by the Minister. Therefore, it would be useful to us if the Minister were to indicate why he has not seen fit to accept the point of view of the Commission in these respects. The Commission, in the case of scholarships, for example, indicated that they proposed something in the order of 2,000 scholarships of the ordinary type, subject to a means test and 500 scholarships free of means tests, all being part of the one scheme. That means that the scholarship scheme proposed by the Commission indicates something like 20 per cent of the scholarships being maintained free of a means test. This, indeed, is continuing the practice under the present system.</P>
    <P>In chapter 29, which should be read by anyone interested in the Minister's proposals, there are proposals for differing grades&mdash;talented students, qualified students and needy students. The Commission also referred to the use of loans. The Commission admit that a comprehensive grant scheme is the ideal but they express the feeling that loans have to be introduced, largely as a temporary measure. They also make the interesting suggestion that if a loan is granted and the student shows promise, the loan could be converted to a grant. They also propose grants which would reduce the cost, the expenses and maintenance, to the student who was qualified but not talented enough to win a scholarship in open competition. They suggest that these scholarships, which would be of the order of £250 plus fees&mdash;something like £350&mdash;would be made available year by year to an increasing number of entrants.</P>
    <P>However, the Commission bring out another principle which I think is an important one on which the Minister has turned his back in the proposals in the Bill. It is the recommendation of the Commission that anybody who reaches scholarship standards should <Col N="392" /> at least get a free place, a remission of fees. This is something to which the Minister should give very careful consideration. It is the position in Britain. The reason 98 per cent of all students in British universities receive support is that, irrespective of means, any student who qualifies in the stringent conditions of entry to universities there receives £50. This principle appears to have worked there and the Commission on Higher Education here come up with the same idea.</P>
    <P>If the Minister appears unwilling to do this he should give us the reasons why he feels this is something he cannot do. If it is something he thinks he can do in the future, let him say so now. If he has brought forward this Bill as an interim plan to last during the next two years it looks very different from that in the sense in which he brought it forward as being the basis for all future support.</P>
    <P>Finally, having looked at what has been stated in <i>Investment in Education</i>, the Fine Gael policy document, and in the Report of the Commission on Higher Education, we had in May, 1968, the proposals of the Minister. Perhaps we can summarise the Minister's proposals as contained in this Bill. There are certain principles on which the Bill is founded. They are the principles which we should examine against the background of the views that are available in order to enable us to ask ourselves whether he has come up with the right solutions.</P>
    <P>The first principle is that the scholarship scheme or the grants scheme as the Minister prefers to call it&mdash;though anything that depends on four honours in the leaving certificate is still a scholarship in my vocabulary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the principles is that the Minister is to determine the complete details of the scheme. It will be for the Minister to determine the academic standards, the means test, the institutions at which the scholarships will be held, the age limits of the applicants and such other requirements as he may think fit. The <Col N="393" /> first principle is the laying out of the scheme. It is a Department scheme. I have no objection to this but I suggest the Minister should have pursued this logically if he had wished to go along this path: he should have made the whole scheme a State scheme whereas the second point of the principle in this Bill is that the Minister still retains the local authorities within the scheme. The second principle of the Bill is that the local authorities are to spend the same amounts as before in respect to this scheme, and the State is to provide the extra money that will be required.</P>
      <P>The third principle of the scheme is that it is virtually enabling legislation and the Minister has been good enough to outline, in the explanatory memorandum which accompanied the Bill, what is in his mind at the moment. However, the third principle is that here we have enabling legislation. I do not think this is an unfair summary of the principles of the Bill as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated what is in his mind&mdash;£175 for the local grant and £300 otherwise for income adjustment and children's allowances. The first difficulty that arises here is that if we look at the various other proposals that have been made there has been a distinction in these various proposals between a fee grant&mdash;or a remission of fee or something of this type&mdash;and a maintenance grant. It is rather hard to classify the Minister's particular proposal. When you look at it from one point of view it looks like a maintenance grant and when you look at it from another point of view it looks like a fee grant. It seems to me to have tried to do two jobs at once. I wonder if the Minister could indicate which he had in mind. We are, of course, quite aware of the difficulty that this is a start, that there is not an unlimited amount of money available and that it is necessary, faced with several desirable things that might be done, to choose among them. Again, I must emphasise that if we consider this as the basis of long-term planning, then it would be extremely helpful for us to know from the Minister whether he looks on the purpose of these particular grants as <Col N="394" /> being primarily in order to meet fees or whether he is considering these as maintenance grants to help the needy, leaving the question of fees for another day, bearing in mind the fact that the fees are already subsidised to the extent of possibly two-thirds by the system of block grants. If this Bill is to be the basis of long-term planning then I think we must be clear on these particular points. In the things which we say during this debate I think the Minister will find the House only too anxious to help him in regard to the way in which we can solve this particular problem. What we say may well help the Minister even if only in some small respect in regard to the next step in this.</P>
    <P>My reaction to the Bill is that it appears to me pragmatic, it appears to me <i>ad hoc</i>, it does not appear to reflect, and in this I may do it an injustice, the long-term planning which is necessary. To be more specific about my reactions to the principles of the Bill and to some of the details of the Minister's proposal, the first point I should like to take up in this regard is the position of the local authorities. The local authorities were central to the old system of university scholarships. Indeed, when I passed through the university I passed through as a county council scholar and later as a county councillor I was a member of the scholarship committee, so I have seen this system in operation from two sides. I think before we change this system we should just pause to remember the great contribution to the development of our community that was made by these schemes dating back to 1908. Indeed, our community is in many respects a far better community because of those members of the community who have received training they might not otherwise have received, as a result of the subventions of these local authorities.</P>
    <P>Having said that an enormous contribution was made by this particular scheme down through the years, I think we must realise that it has been out-paced by developments. We have had the situation in the past few years that some of our local authorities have been very interested in these <Col N="395" /> schemes, others have been indifferent. I feel we must really pause here and not just accept the fact that local authorities have been part of the scheme and should remain part of the scheme in the future. Perhaps, we should ask ourselves why the local authorities came into the scheme in the first place. Why was this a matter for local authorities rather than a matter for central government? Of course, these scholarships started in 1908 and at this time there was no central government in this country. At that time we had our county councils. They had been some ten years in existence and they had proved themselves a remarkably vital element in the community. They had shown themselves in many ways as reflecting the opinions of people throughout Ireland to an extent that the Parliamentary Member at Westminster was not able to do. The great success of the Irish county councils following their formation in 1898 and the great extent to which they reflected their own communities and the variations between regions in the country made them a most suitable medium for this legislation in 1908 but that does not necessarily make them a suitable medium for the administration today. Even if we say that, perhaps, now this representative function which in 1908 was exercised by the county councils and is today exercised by this Oireachtas would make us tend to look at this question anew, we might ask: &ldquo;But what about England?&rdquo; The position is that in England the local authorities are still the donors of the grants for university support but here we have a different reason. In England down through the years, education has been a local authority function, all forms of education and not merely vocational education as it has been with us. So, in fact, in England they have their own particular historical origin.</P>
    <P>I think at this stage that we have to make up our minds as to whether it is appropriate that the local authorities should still exercise a function in this regard. I feel that the Minister's proposal here is not one that is in the interests of the local authorities themselves. <Col N="396" /> The Minister has adopted the formula in this particular Bill that the local authorities should be asked to administer the scheme which will be laid down by the Minister, have been asked to contribute what they have contributed during the financial year which has just ended and that they should then carry out this scheme largely as agents for the Minister and the Department of Education. I do not think it is good for the local authorities of this country to be asked to act as mere agents for the central government. This is a position we have been running ourselves into in regard to health services, in regard to main road services, and I think this is one that really does no real service to the health and the vigour and the stability of local government in the country. We hope this scheme will grow and grow and very soon the contribution of the local authorities will be a small thing compared to the contribution by the Minister and I feel there is a great deal to be said for making a clean cut now. The local authorities will in future just act as local agencies for the Minister and I think it might be as well if the Minister would seriously consider at this stage whether it would not be more appropriate that this scheme should be a national scheme from the beginning. We have certain difficulties &mdash;no doubt, the Minister has heard representations that what he proposes will penalise those local authorities who have been progressive and have been interested in the past. This is a point, but this is not the main burden of my concern. My concern is that this local government system we have that is so overloaded nowadays has tended to become not a system of local self government at all but an agency of decentralised central government, and this is something about which I am very fearful. As one who served his political apprenticeship in local authority, I fear for the future of local government in this country if this particular trend is to continue.</P>
    <P>I think we should do other things. The Minister might be reluctant as it were to let the local authorities get away with their fourpence or sixpence or ninepence or whatever they have <Col N="397" /> been raising from the rates in this regard. Perhaps we might do something here which would not only make the scheme the Minister proposes a neater scheme, because I do not believe in arguing merely in favour of a neater scheme, but, at the same time, we could do something for our local authorities. I just throw out this suggestion to the Minister. If he were in this legislation, or the next legislation he brings in in this regard, to say that the local authorities will no longer have to contribute provided that in the future they contribute the poundage which they had been contributing&mdash;fourpence or sixpence or ninepence, I do not know if any have gone beyond ninepence and I think that this is the range which they are contributing at the moment&mdash;if the local authorities were relieved provided that they spent the money on some educational or cultural purposes.</P>
    <P>Here we would find that the progressive local authorities, those who have carried this scheme from 1908 onwards and got real value for it for the people of Ireland, would find special schemes, maybe in conjunction with the universities or special cultural schemes. We would be encouraging local authorities to spend the money for educational purposes in diverse ways, encouraging diversity of action, local initiative and imagination among our local authorities instead of making their expenditure on education be merely the administration of a scheme laid down in all detail by a central Department. I would urge the Minister to consider whether, in fact, we would not be better off moving in this direction in regard to this matter. With regard to expenditure of this type on education and on all types of cultural matters this is an area in which diversity is definitely desirable.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, unfortunately, had diversity in regard to scholarship schemes in the past, diversity in regard to the question of whether a person gets to a university or not. This is diversity which is not desirable and is intolerable in the present age. We who work in the universities know the tremendous differences in standards between scholarships from different <Col N="398" /> counties. We could arrange the counties in order due to different standards and the different numbers of scholarships. There is at present a tremendous disparity easily recognisable between county scholars coming from the different counties. The Minister proposes to end such diversity. We would appeal to him to alter the system under which money spent produces an undesirable diversity, and to produce a healthy diversity in future. So I would put forward here my first great reservation in regard to this particular Bill, and that is the continuance of the local authorities as a central part of it.</P>
    <P>This appears in the very Title. The Minister has brought forward a Bill not for higher education grants but for Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants), and if it is successful and if it really goes from strength to strength the local authorities, which is the main part of the title, will become less and less important in the real sense and, indeed, in practice will become lost altogether while the higher education grant which now appears in brackets will become all important.</P>
    <P>My second point of reservation is the question of the academic standard on which the Bill is based. The Minister is quite clear and positive in saying that these are grants. If these are maintenance grants then I think that any academic standard of four honours <i>simpliciter</i> is one open to severe criticism. We have here a real danger that we may get back to a system of cramming for scholarships which was beginning to disappear from our secondary system. This particular system may lead to that again. We are going to have real problems in regard to this. This is a simple way of solving a problem, but if this approach of purely academic standards is to be followed instead of maintenance grants in future it is not what is required.</P>
    <P>I know that there are difficulties in regard to this. Our university institutions and colleges, the National University in particular, have taken the point of view down through the years that selection is no part of their function, that selection of persons as qualified persons for entering is no part of their functions, and that university <Col N="399" /> institutions must take the line that anyone who matriculates must be accepted. We will have to work out some policy in this regard. If we look over the water to what is done in Britain we do not find that four honours are required there. The criterion for support of a student in a British university is two &ldquo;A&rdquo; levels plus acceptance by a university. It is, indeed, important to note that this may result in excessive specialisation by narrowing the choice to only two subjects to get as high marks as possible. On the other hand, these two &ldquo;A&rdquo; levels plus selection by a university institution will not make for cramming for examinations and marks such as the Minister's scheme may. University institutions that adopt a broader view look for something more than mere academic achievement at the end of secondary school, and these particular institutions by means of interview and by means of selection are able to get the type of person that they think is good university material.</P>

      <P>Still institutions vary in this. Perhaps the cue which Senator Sheehy Skeffington has dropped about the right school brings me to my next point. We may think that we are levelling all things if we say that we will determine our university scholarships on the basis of four honours. But this is not equality. It is easier for a boy to get four honours in the leaving certificate if he is a student at a large school run, for example, by the Irish Christian Brothers by whom I am proud to have been educated. He has a far better chance to get the Minister's scholarship than a boy from a secondary school in a remote part of the country. They are not competing under equal conditions here. We must tell the Minister this from our experience in universities. I can think of one particular case of a boy who came in from a small country school, not with very high honours in the leaving certificate. He got a pass in his first year examination, he got second honours in his second year examination, first class honours in his <Col N="400" /> third year examination, first class in his fourth year, and first place in Ireland in a scholarship examination. This was not a matter of late development except that it took him time in the university to overcome the disadvantage of the particular secondary school in which he had been educated. We have, too, students taking the opposite track. We have them coming in with four honours in the leaving certificate getting first class honours in the first year, second honours in second year, pass in the third year and a pass in the degree.</P>

      <P>Some of it is human nature but more of it is inhuman schoolmastering as well.

Sooner or later whether because of the difficulties of choosing in this regard or because of the fact that pressure of numbers will overcome the accommodation we will have to face the question of selection, and it cannot be shirked very much longer. I do not think that the Minister's four honours is going to be a very good solution to the problem.</P>
      <P>Here I may say that we would be glad to know from the Minister what exactly he has in mind regarding those four honours. It refers to four honours in university subjects. I take it that this means not four university subjects but four matriculation subjects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not follow the Minister, but, however, we will be able to tease it out on Committee Stage. We will have to be quite clear in regard to matriculation. It is not an easy matter by any means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I come to my next point in regard to my main reaction to this Bill. We talked about the local authorities and academic standards and the next point I want to advert to is the question of the means test. Of course, a means test is inevitable. Of course, any scheme which is produced would certainly at the initial stages have a means test of some type or otherwise it would be unfair. However, I feel that the cut-off in the Minister's scheme is perhaps unduly sharp. If a person earning £2,000 a year has four children, he will receive absolutely no support under the Minister's scheme. While such a person may not be the most deserving case, nevertheless, a person earning £2,000 a year with, perhaps, special expenses which we do not allow for in the scheme, would find it extremely difficult to put four or even two children through the university. There is a good deal to be said for giving something to everybody if at all possible. There is the United Kingdom system of giving £50 to all although the average grant is somewhere between £350 and £400. Nevertheless, in the scheme even though you have the average there is the £50 for everybody. This I think does do something. In the proposal which the Fine Gael Party made we suggested that fees be paid for all students. The fees charged at the moment are, perhaps, coming up close to the £100 but in some cases now <Col N="402" /> these, of course, are not the real fees at all. This, again, is a point, this sharp cut-off.</P>
    <P>We must remember the individual whom I mentioned before, the individual who thinks so highly of education that he will make great sacrifices to give higher education to his children if these children are talented, perhaps, not quite talented enough to win a scholarship but, nevertheless, above the minimum for university entrance. He is, indeed, doing something for the community as well as for his own children. He may have been neglected by the Minister with reluctance, being unable to do anything in this case.</P>
    <P>Again, a point which I should like to raise here which might be discussed a little on Committee Stage is that the Minister does not mention in his explanatory memorandum the question of renewals of scholarships after the first year. I do not know whether the scholarships will be renewed provided a student passes his examination or whether there is any particular standard. This has given rise to a number of difficulties in the past. The general practice at the moment is that students are supposed either to get honours or to be recommended as having performed meritoriously by the university authorities. In certain schemes, for example, if a student gets honours he receives the full scholarship for the following year; if he passes he gets a reduced scholarship for the following year and in many cases if he fails he gets no scholarship for the following year unless some special provision is made. The position, indeed, is a reflection of what I said earlier about the scholarship entrance standard not necessarily being kept up in universities, that many cases arise whereby special recommendations have to be made because those who come in emblazoned with leaving certificate honours fail university examinations for one reason or another.</P>
    <P>There was one case in regard to a certain county council where the college concerned reported on the students, reported on those who had got honours and, therefore, should get their full amount, also reported on those who <Col N="403" /> passed and should get reduced amounts, and also on those who failed and should get nothing. However, apparently the parent of one of those who failed carried more weight with the county council than did the recommendations of the university; as a result the county council scholarship committee decided that they would restore the scholarship to those who had failed and we had the interesting situation in the following year that those who had failed were getting full scholarships while those who had passed were getting reduced scholarships. I hope the Minister's scheme will not operate that way.</P>

      <P>In a summary of what I have been saying about the Bill, it cannot be emphasised too often that there is substantial agreement on objectives. This runs through all the documents which have dealt with this particular problem. I feel, as I have indicated, that the Minister's present proposal appears to be too much of a patchwork for my fancy, that it shows too little signs of planning and of an awareness of the long-term needs, that it is acceptable as a stop-gap, but that the Minister could well, and indeed should, have been able to do better. Perhaps, at this time of the year when those of us in academic life are in an examining mood we could say that in this particular test the Minister passed, that it is doubtful if he has got honours and that he certainly has not got a first. However, if he applies himself more thoroughly to fundamentals next year, perhaps, we could then award him honours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can proceed with the examination as conducted by Senator Dooge. In this we are all agreed on fundamentals, that is, that any qualifying student should not be denied higher education through lack of means. However, we have got to examine this very carefully. What is a qualifying student? He is a student who is able to profit by a university education and the only satisfactory way that that can be established is by his performance <Col N="404" /> at the university. It is the only reliable test and his leaving certificate results or his performance in secondary school are just a very rough indication. It is his subsequent performance under more uniform conditions that really tells the tale.</P>
      <P>Yet the present scheme is based entirely on the leaving certificate. When it comes then to deciding what is a qualified student and how do we select qualified students, I submit that the people to advise on that are the university people themselves. They have had practical experience down through the years. As Senator Dooge pointed out, they have seen students come in blazing with honours and go out again as damp squibs. They have seen students come in with very little to show on paper, students from small schools where opportunities were few, perhaps, and these have gone from strength to strength as the course progressed.</P>
      <P>The first major criticism I make of this scheme is that the people who really know how to select and advise on qualified students were never consulted. It is an atrocious approach to the laying down of fundamentals and a pattern for the future. It is the height of arrogance for a State Department to act as the Department of Education has acted in this scheme. They neither sought nor took advice. It is typical of the disregard shown for the public, a disregard which has resulted in a controversy about educational standards, courses and so on. It is high time we took a look across the Border to see how they carry on their work there. There there is recognition of a certain democratic mode of procedure. There there is recognition of the fact that a democracy functions not by the State arrogating to itself the right to decide everything but by those in authority knowing how to seek advice and, having got it, knowing how to act on it. That has not been done here. I shall return to this point again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has become rather fashionable in the present climate of opinion to disregard authority and to pretend that the real authority lies in those who know nothing about it. If we are to accept the press at its face value, <Col N="405" /> students apparently know a great deal more about education than the staff concerned with it. There are ways and means of testing out hypotheses. Every group has a contribution to make. Students have a contribution to make, a valuable and worthwhile contribution. They can make very useful criticisms of courses and any university professor or lecturer will go out of his way to seek these criticisms and he will consider them seriously and, if they merit action, he will act to them. As standards go, considering all the handicaps and disadvantages and the lack of finance with which our universities have had to contend, it is a source of amazement to visitors from outside the country that our universities are able to maintain such good standards. Consequently, I make no apology to anyone when I suggest that the universities through their faculties and academic councils could have drafted a much superior scheme to that which is before us, a scheme designed to foster real scholarship and real endeavour, ensuring at the same time the basic principle that no qualified student would be denied higher education because of lack of means. I think the claims made are rather extravagant&mdash;900 students covered by this scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>A thousand. At present 300 scholarships are available and it is my belief that up to this the remaining 700 have been finding their way in through the sacrifices of their parents. I have come across very few cases in which the really good students did not succeed in getting in. That is not saying now that everything is perfect. I agree that there should be this type of blanket provision, but I am not very happy when we come down to introducing a means test. A means test is very invidious, particularly in the sphere of education in which we want to encourage the best. On the other hand, I realise the bill could be a fairly substantial one, though half a million is not very much in the concept of modern budgets. I believe it would be comparatively easy to arrange that the parents of those outside the scope <Col N="406" /> of the present scheme because of the means test could contribute as a class at least as much as would find its way back to their children as scholarships. This could be done quite easily by having an increased income tax contribution at a higher rate. For instance, at the moment we have, say, 7/- up to a certain level. There could be another threepence in the £ added to take effect on incomes above the usual level, £1,200 or £1,500. An equalisation fund would enable us to dispense with the means test and it would also give students the satisfaction of competing one with the other on terms of financial equality, even though the parents above the means test level would be themselves providing the money. That is a simple illustration and what I suggest would actually stimulate scholarship. Again, if a student whose parents are paying income tax qualifies for a grant, then the parents would immediately cease to claim relief of income tax in respect of that student. At the lowest level it would probably be 5/- in the £, which would amount to £75; around the £2,000 level it would be 7/- in the £, which would be £100. In the surtax range it would be £150.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister going out of his way when he tries to suggest it would cost a great deal to do away with the means test when in point of fact a good deal of the money will in any case find its way back into the Exchequer? If there is a desire to put on a special increment in the income tax, why not? But let us have free competition, competition which will encourage our students to compete with one another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot think of a more unequal form of test than that suggested based, as it is, on the leaving certificate because the difference in schools is very great and will continue to be so, because the difference depends on the quality of the teachers. There are a very limited number of first-class mathematics teachers available. These are concentrated in a few big schools. They cannot be available at all the secondary school centres in the country. The same holds in any of the other subjects where there is such paucity of honours graduates available in teaching staffs. Again, big cities will encourage <Col N="407" /> special grinds and cramming for these.</P>
    <P>I know it is difficult to find, perhaps, a better way of starting and, perhaps, we will have to accept some measure out of the leaving certificate for initially providing the first year but after the first year the retention of the grant should directly depend on university performance and, likewise, students <Col N="408" /> who come into the university but do not have a grant coming in, if they make grant standard in their second or third year, are entitled in justice to get it.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
