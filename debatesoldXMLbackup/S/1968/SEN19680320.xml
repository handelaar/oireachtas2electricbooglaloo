      <P>I know that it would be the wish of the House that I should express our deep sorrow on the death of Mr. Donogh O'Malley, Minister for Education, which occurred since our last meeting.</P>
      <P>Donogh O'Malley was a young man of boundless energy and superb administrative capacity.  In his relatively short period in public life, he made legions of friends and no enemies.  His sincerity about any cause he expoused was unquestioned.  He detested sham in any shape or form and had no time for an apartheid attitude in either sport or education.  He liked people, was a gracious host and a staunch friend.  He was an unqualified success as Mayor of his native city, as Deputy for East Limerick, as Parliamentary Secretary in the Office of Public Works, as Minister for Health and later as Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>His memory will be specially cherished however because of his trailblazing work for education first in the Office of Public Works where his drive more than doubled the schools building output and subsequently as the Minister for Education who did so much to ensure that lack of means would no longer deprive any child of the fullest educational opportunities. He was affectionately known to the children as &ldquo;The School Man&rdquo; and this will be a more endurable monument than any other to the memory of a man the country could ill afford to lose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask you therefore, a Cathaoirleach, to convey to his widow and family the deepest sympathy of the Members of Seanad Éireann in their <Col N="1032" /> great loss, a loss which is Ireland's loss too.</P>
    <P>Síochán Dé dá anam uasal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I and my colleagues of the Fine Gael Party in the Seanad wish to be associated with the expression of sympathy which the Leader of the House has now voiced.</P>
      <P>We in Seanad Éireann remember the late Deputy O'Malley with particular gratitude because in his relatively brief periods as Minister for Health and as Minister for Education he attended the Seanad for three very long debates &mdash; on the Government White Paper on Health, on Investment in Education and on the Report of the Commission on Higher Education. We were all aware at the time that he attended those debates that he had made a special effort to do so and was, as far as his other duties permitted him, in attendance for the whole period of the debates because he was interested, as Senator Ó Maoláin has said, in people.  He wanted to hear at first hand what the Senators had to say.  We were at the time and always will be gratified that he showed such courtesy to the Seanad and we feel that his courtesy to the Seanad served the public interest and we dared to hope that those debates profited him as Minister in charge of his different Departments.</P>
      <P>A conspicuous characteristic I think of the late Deputy O'Malley as Minister was that he showed himself to be at all times the person in charge of his Department.  From what one could see externally he was the originator of ideas, the person who took decisions and the person who wielded the power in his Department that was given to him by the people when he became a Minister of Government.  Because of this he made the great headway that he did.  Through him the real needs of the time were, so to speak, canalised into the great machine that every Department of State is and because of that these Departments worked very effectively under his leadership for the betterment of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that he will long be remembered for the service which he has rendered to education in this <Col N="1033" /> country and he will be affectionately remembered by the people.  Death at all times is very sad but when it strikes a man such as the late Deputy O'Malley in the fullness of his powers it is a great tragedy.  I and my colleagues wish to be associated with the expression of sympathy to his bereaved wife, son and daughter and his other near relatives for the great tragedy that has come upon them.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my colleagues in the Labour Party and myself, I wish to be associated with this vote of condolence to the relatives of the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley, Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>Mr. O'Malley will be long remembered as the person who was responsible for a great leap forward in education in this country in the twentieth century.  We are sorry, indeed, that he was not spared to give of his work and enthusiasm to that important Department.  We hope the appreciation of the school children and succeeding generations of school children will be some consolation to his widow and family on the great personal loss they have sustained.</P>

    <Title>Death of Minister. - Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) (Amendment) Bill, 1967: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, pensions under the Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) Pensions Scheme can be paid to former Members only.  The purpose of this Bill is to enable the scheme to be amended so that pensions can also be paid to their widows and children.  In addition, it will allow the Minister for Finance to make such grants as he thinks proper from the Exchequer to the pension fund which is currently financed solely by the contributions of the Members.</P>
      <P>As soon as this Bill is enacted, it is intended to introduce a motion in both Houses, setting forth the conditions on which pensions may be granted to the widows and children of deceased Members and the amounts which will be payable.  It is also the intention to include in the motion provision for an improvement in the pensions payable to Members of the scheme themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity for the payment of grants to the fund is due to the fact that the costs of the scheme, including the proposed amendments, cannot be met by the Members' contributions and it is intended that these grants should make up the difference.  I should like to stress, however, as I did in the Dáil, that the power to pay grants is not to be taken as committing the Exchequer to making payments towards any further changes that may be made from time to time in the scheme.  Any further improvements in the scheme will have to be examined separately and the fact that financial assistance will be given to cover the <Col N="1036" /> changes now proposed is not a guarantee that State grants will be available to cover future changes.  It is not possible to say how much will be required by way of subsidy until the costs of the improvements have been actuarially investigated.  It is intended to have such an investigation carried out in due course: but in the meantime it is proposed to give the fund a grant of £12,000 in the coming year. This should be sufficient to keep the fund viable until the actuary's report has been received.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to have 1st April next as the commencement date for the payment of widows' and orphans' pensions under the scheme and of the improved pensions for Members.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House will have little difficulty in accepting this Bill.  There is need for some kind of protection for widows and orphans throughout the country, something which is, indeed, recognised by all of us, and not less indeed for widows and orphans of Members of the Oireachtas. I do not suppose that the pensions to be paid under this extended scheme will do more than alleviate hardship but such as it is this Bill is to be welcomed. Am I right in thinking that this particular Bill is providing for a once-for-all grant or is it a grant that will be repayable in time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an outright grant, not necessarily a once-for-all payment.  It is just to carry it through next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be happier if it was even thought it might involve higher contributions from the Members of the Oireachtas.  That is a view which might not be shared by other Members of the Oireachtas but until such time as we are in a position to introduce generally for people who are not at present covered for widows' and orphans' benefits&mdash;and there are vast areas where people are not&mdash;I for my part would prefer to see Members of the Oireachtas, if their widows and orphans are to participate, contribute <Col N="1037" /> entirely to the scheme themselves.  This is, as the Minister indicates, one grant for the moment and, in any event, whether it be so or not as we are all aware, in the light of recent events, it is a necessary measure and I am pleased that the Minister has been able to see his way to bring it in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. The Minister said&mdash;and it is no harm to repeat it&mdash;that up to now the pension scheme for Members of the Oireachtas has been wholly maintained by contributions from Members of the Oireachtas.  We have come to realise and appreciate that it is impossible from those resources to adequately provide for widows and orphans of deceased Members.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has taken the step to introduce this Bill and that he has given us an undertaking that he will put a scheme into operation. There is one small point which I should like to raise as to the date from which it operates.  The Minister says that it is hoped to have the 1st April next as the commencement date for the payment of widows' and orphans' pensions under the scheme of improved pensions for Members.  I would hope that the Minister would see his way to apply the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme to the widows and orphans of Deputies who were elected to this Dáil and that the benefits will operate from the date of the death of Deputies.  We recognise that something needs to be done and that hardship exists and I hope the Minister will see his way to operate the benefits from the date of the death of Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for the reception Senators have given this measure which I think is necessary and desirable.  We will have another opportunity of discussing the detailed provisions when the Motion for the actual amendment comes before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular measure just gives us statutory authority to amend the scheme and to make some small contribution from the Exchequer.  It was my intention that payment of the pensions for widows and orphans <Col N="1038" /> should commence on the 1st April next but, of course, it will cover all Deputies who themselves participated in the scheme.  Where a Deputy did not participate in the scheme then his widow and orphans will not be covered.  However, can we have further discussion on the commencement date when the motion itself comes before us.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
    <P>Bill considered in Committee, reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one small point which not alone intrigues me but is not understood by people who are more expert in this branch of law than I am.  In section 1, for instance, one finds:</P>
      <P>The following subsection is hereby substituted for section 156 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967,</P>
      <P>whereas if you look at section 2 you find:</P>
      <P>Section 181 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended. . .</P>
      <P>It is a question of why you do not repeal subsection (1) and substitute it with this one.  I cannot fully understand the reason.  It is obviously a technical point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In section 2 we are adding a subsection to an existing section which is not to be altered otherwise. In section 1 we are changing the format of the section.  As the Senator knows from previous occasions the draftsman's way is peculiarly his own in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not follow it and there are others who do not follow it either.  We are substituting this sub-section <Col N="1039" /> for subsection (1) of section 156.  Is that section repealed altogether then or is it allowed to stand in operation for taxable purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (1) is repealed.  We are substituting a new subsection for section 156 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  That is the one which made provision for the appointment of a Special Commissioner and the new one makes provision for Appeal Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) of section 156 is repealed by the whole of section 1.</P>
      <P>There is another point which arises on section 3.  It may create difficulties for the Minister.  It seems to me that what we are now doing is, in effect, abolishing the position of Special Commissioner and creating instead a new office of Appeal Commissioner.  I can see income tax assessments under appeal today before the Special Commissioner. If the Special Commissioners are abolished as from the passing of this Act what happens to the appeals which are before them?  Is there any transitional provision in this Bill which says that appeals before the Special Commissioners on the date of the passing of this Act shall be dealt with by the Special Appeals Commissioners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no transitional provision because there is no need for it.  When a case has been heard by the existing Special Commissioners that is the end of it.  If a case has not been heard by them it will fall to be heard by the new Appeal Commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am talking about.  There are two situations that can arise.  A case can have been heard by the Special Commissioners and judgment reserved.  Once this Bill becomes law it lops off that.  The case may have to be reheard because the man who heard it, the Special Commissioner, is no longer there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

Usually at the request of the taxpayer and perhaps occasionally at the request of the inspector of taxes, the hearing of the case might be adjourned.

      <P>In the new loose leaf statute which the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners have provided there are a number of statutory rules and orders which have been made.  I find in it the Interpretation Act of 1937.  We are amending a number of statutory rules and orders, among them being No. 48 of 29.  Can the Minister tell us is there in the loose leaf book all the statutory instruments, to use a general term, gathered together and is there any way by which one can find out at a given time which statutory rules and orders and regulations made by the Revenue Commissioners or the Minister for Finance are in operation?  Nobody except the civil servants who drafted them can at any stage tell anybody which statutory instruments are in operation. There is no way in which a lawyer or a solicitor can tell without checking first with the Department.  There is no index to help find them.  Where can we find them?</P>

Is it not clear that if these orders are included in the new version of the Income Tax Act in this new handy form it should be possible to trace them through the index?

      <P>This section intrigues me somewhat.  The section says that every person who is chargeable to income tax for any year of assessment and who, in relation to that year, has not been given a notice under section 169 or section 172 of the 1967 Act, shall give notice to the inspector of taxes that he is so chargeable. It may be all right to say that but there may be many people who would not know they were chargeable to tax.  What happens in a case, say, where people have broken employment or have been transferred to new employment or come into new employment having returned from England? If they do not give notice to the inspector of taxes that they are chargeable, which is a difficult job at any time, what happens?  Is such a person liable to penalties?</P>

      <P>Section 167 (1) of the Income Tax, 1967, provides:</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners shall in each year of assessment cause general notice to be given, requiring every person who, by this Act, is required to deliver any list, declaration or statement to make out and deliver such list, declaration or statement to the inspectors or to the said Revenue Commissioners within such time as shall be limited by such notice, not being less than twenty-one days from the giving thereof.</P>
      <P>That section arises from a very old provision which had to deal with the posting of notices on church doors but it could give rise to some conflict with the other sections under which persons are required to make specific returns on income, lists of employees, and so on.  Since the days of the old general notice, there are now all sorts of other people who have to give lists, to give specific lists, of dividends and interests accruing and lists of employees, and so on.  It is suggested that there would possibly be a conflict between the various statutory requirements.</P>

I do not know how widely that fact is known.  It is an innovation of recent standing.

      <P>Several efforts have been made to make the obligations and, indeed, the rights of the individual taxpayer more widely known.  Perhaps we should do more in that regard.  It is a subject which is under consideration by the Revenue authorities at the moment.  It does not suit the Revenue Commissioners to have the sort of situation arise which the Senator talked about, namely, that persons are unaware of their obligations and, therefore, find themselves in arrears difficulties.  It is just as much in the interests of the Revenue Commissioners as of the taxpayer that the people should know where they stand and, to the greatest extent possible, meet their commitments as they fall due.  Any possible action we might take in that regard will be favourably considered.</P>

      <P>Now that we have, indeed, got all the income tax laws between two covers and that so many people are paying income tax and so many people do not know the reliefs to which very often they are entitled, it might make the payment of income tax a good deal easier, and leave people with fewer grouses, if they got some rough idea that the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1046" /> were not grasping all the time.</P>
      <P>When I was in the Estate Duty Office some years ago I have a recollection that on numerous occasions we wrote out to people when we found, for instance, that property was sold for a lower amount than was thought to be the value by the Commissioner of Valuation, or when new debts came in, or when some circumstances arose which entitled the estate to a refund of income tax.  We regularly wrote out to tell the personal representatives involved that they were entitled to a refund of income tax and advised them to put in correct affidavits.  The Revenue Commissioners always knew the amount to which those people were entitled but the people had to ask for the refund.  We did not go to the extent of sending out cheques with a covering note to people saying: &ldquo;You overpaid to this extent&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We made a change in that regard.  Speaking from recollection, the existing position is that the inspector of taxes must inform the individual taxpayer of his allowance. The inspector will now draw the attention of the taxpayer to his rights, to his claims and allowances.  I might mention here also that on the customs side, we have recently produced a series of leaflets in an endeavour to take as much as possible of the terror out of the customs procedure in so far as the ordinary innocent citizen is concerned.  We have set out in these leaflets what a person is entitled to bring in or to take out.  We have tried to make matters more ordinary, more everyday, and to do precisely what the Senator is talking about, namely, to let people know whether they can take in, say, 200 cigarettes, a bottle of whiskey, or precisely what they can do.</P>

They said, in effect: &ldquo;We know we charged you excessive duty to the extent of £19,000.  We agree we charged too much&rdquo;.  They also said: &ldquo;We cannot pay it out to you&rdquo;.  It went to the Supreme Court with the result that the <Col N="1047" /> £19,000 was paid out.  The truth of the matter is&mdash;and the truth is very bitter, I suppose, in the case of the Revenue Commissioners, all of whom, I suppose, are very estimable gentlemen&mdash;that they have a bad public image.  Now there is biblical authority for disliking taxgatherers&mdash;there is a biblical justification, at any rate, for disliking them.</P>

      <P>Yes, but that is more a political act of obeisance than a handing over of the coin of the realm.  The truth is that the Revenue Commissioners should realise that they have a bad public image and that the public distrusts all customs men, excise men, and inspectors of taxes, but unwarrantedly and unjustifiably so.  The Estate Duty Office in my time never did down anybody, and, in fact, we did in that office what the Minister is saying is now being done on the income tax side.  But something more than that is necessary.  There should be an intensified and sustained effort on the part of the Revenue Commissioners to tell people at the relevant time, at Christmas and at holiday time, and always in relation to income tax, what they are entitled to get by way of reliefs and what they are entitled to do within the law.</P>

Then it was represented to us that there were other pensions which were free of income tax in their countries of origin and that these should also be exempt, and we agreed with that line of argument and amended the original section in the Dáil.  The Bill now, in fact, covers all pensions payable from abroad which are themselves exempt from income tax in their home countries of origin.

      <P>I do not know what class of person would be particularly interested in this section, but I do think that it is a bad principle of drafting particularly in a case like this where we are trying to bring the whole income tax law into as few statutes as possible, that we should say that &ldquo;the scheduled territories&rdquo; has the same meaning as it has in the Exchange Control Act of 1954.  I abhor this business of having to interpret one Act by looking up another.  If we are going to use a phrase like &ldquo;the scheduled territories&rdquo; we ought to put them into an appendix to the Bill.  Since that cannot be done here because this Bill becomes law at midnight the Minister might consider that, in the explanatory memorandum that will ultimately go out with this Bill when it is passed, he should state what these scheduled territories are so that anybody reading this Act, which it will be when it is passed, with the explanatory memorandum would see immediately the position without having to refer to the 1954 Act.</P>

However, I would plead in mitigation of the offence in drafting committed here that this is a pretty technical <Col N="1050" /> business and not many people would be interested in this particular provision except lawyers who, I think, would be fairly well aware of what they were doing and where to look for the information they need.</P>

For the purpose of trying to understand sections 16 and 17, indeed the whole Part IV, I had to look up some of the case law.  In the context I found a phrase which, of course, would be known to every lawyer from the judgement of Mr. Justice Kenny dealing with the construction of statutes, and I think it is very apposite to refer it to this particular section, because this section is the antithesis of what Mr. Justice Kenny had to say.  I am quoting from the case of Richard D. Swaine, Inspector of Taxes, v &ldquo;C&rdquo; as reported in the <i>Irish Reports</i> 1964.  Mr. Justice Kenny said: &ldquo;It is not necessary to cite authority for the proposition that liability for tax must be imposed by plain words and that the courts are not to construe revenue legislation in a manner which will impose tax liability in order to avoid anomalies.&rdquo; When you talk about imposing liability to tax by plain words certainly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It may be a relieving section, but the Minister must agree that this is a taxation statute and what I am saying now applies to some other sections of the Bill.  It is quite impossible&mdash;when I say &ldquo;quite impossible&mdash;whe <Col N="1051" /> possible&rdquo; I mean just that&mdash;even for the most erudite lawyers to say what some of the sections both in this Bill and in other Finance Acts mean.  There has been a great deal of debate and discussion on this particular measure by most eminent and erudite lawyers and they just do not know what it means.  What they will tell you is: &ldquo;We do not know until we see what the Revenue Commissioners have to say about it&rdquo; and then it is whatever the Revenue Commissioners say a particular section means that is going to be the interpretation that will be put on it.</P>

This is a concession which we are making in certain types of transaction and it would be a little rigorous to ask the person chargeable to tax to pay all the income tax at once because the nature of the transaction is such that he does not get all the cash at once.  So we have said in effect: &ldquo;You can pay the income tax over ten years.&rdquo;  All section 15 does is to apply the same concession to corporation profits tax.

Of course, there will be loopholes to be sealed off but still we could state in this section what is to be done and then if you want to <Col N="1052" /> make any qualification state that plainly but why it has to be wrapped up into one long complete sentence which I think should be taken as being read into the record so that people would know what it is about I cannot understand.  It is all one long complex sentence and the number of double negatives in it would baffle anybody. It is sad that it should be on a relieving section that my complaint is based but it applies equally to other sections of the Bill.</P>

      <P>On section 16, when we are dealing with development in relation to land, I suppose the Minister and his parliamentary draftsman had good reasons for not keeping the same definition in relation to &ldquo;development&rdquo; as is contained in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  It certainly is not the same definition as is contained in that Act and I do not know why that should be so.  It would seem to me that &ldquo;development&rdquo; as set out and defined in the Planning and Development Act was the kind of thing which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we would have run into difficulties there.  There are two completely different purposes involved here.  I would imagine that many of the things the Planning Act would wish to express as &ldquo;development&rdquo; we would specifically wish to exclude from tax.  We are trying here to get at people who make profits from building and developing as a business and if we were to adopt the other definition we would be bringing in all sorts of people whom we wish to keep out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am quite happy with that.  I can quite see now why that was not done.  It had occurred to me that &ldquo;development&rdquo; in the other context was a fairly wide net and I have every desire to protect taxpayers and to see that they are not required to pay more than they ought <Col N="1053" /> to pay.  There is no doubt that the liability which was sought to be imposed by the 1965 Act was agreed in principle but then it went too far in some ways.  I am quite happy now the Minister has given that explanation that, in fact, you would be catching people who were not engaged in the business of developing land.</P>
      <P>I have another point which might arise on this section.  We are dealing with profits or gains from dealing in or developing land.  One of the things that has occurred to me is that you now have a new situation under the Ground Rents Act where people are now getting the capitalised value of the ground rents which they created at a former time.  Is that capitalised value of ground rents in any sense liable to tax or is it liable under this section?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What a person would be really doing in that case is substituting one form of income for another and I do not see how any charge of income tax could arise on the transaction.  Perhaps if somebody went out and bought ground rents and succeeded in making a profit out of capitalising them he could be shown to be carrying on a business or trading in ground rents and could possibly be caught then.  But in the normal situation where a tenant bought out a ground rent and paid the capital sum it certainly would not come within the scope of these particular provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be so in the case of a ground rent the capital value of which is fixed by reference to the most recent Government loan but that only applies to ground rents of private dwellings.  If you are buying out a ground rent attached to a shop&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The buying out provisions apply to all ground rents. Originally the Commission's report suggested they should not apply to business premises but, in fact, the <Col N="1054" /> legislation does apply to all ground rents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no views on this.  It is merely a question of when this is being recast whether inadvertently or otherwise there can be a profit on it.  If you take the insurance companies that have bought up ground rents, in many cases they are now selling them albeit compulsorily.  In the case of the private residence that is fair enough because you are substituting one investment for another but they can get a good deal more in the case of business premises.  They are not confined merely to the latest loan.  That is not the standard.</P>

      <P>If you or I, for instance, buy stocks and shares and sell them for a profit, that is capital and we are not chargeable to income tax on the profit because it is not income, it is capital.  However, if I am engaged in the business of dealing in stocks and shares and I make any profit on the buying and selling of those stocks and shares that is a different matter.  The same applies to insurance companies and other financial institutions.  If they are in the business of buying ground rents and make profits, such profits in the normal way would be chargeable as income; but the individual who sells an isolated ground rent would be effecting a capital transaction.  That would not be income and it would not be chargeable.</P>

        <i>(Longford):</i> It still occurs to me that there is something irreconcilable in this.  Suppose a man buys his ground rent and finds it is a profitable thing to buy that ground rent.  Suppose it were possible for him to acquire the ground rent interest in the house he lived in and then having done that he acquired some adjoining ground rents in the same terrace or area and he invested that, this would hardly be regarded as a deal in the same way as a deal in stocks and shares. In the long run the people you are dealing with in stocks and shares are brokers who do this as a business.  On the other hand you could have some undertakings like insurance companies dealing in a big way and they would be regarded as big business in buying ground rent interest from builders.  The builders could then go out and go on to some other building operation.  It seems to me that you have the two activities.  The Minister is trying to suggest, and quite rightly, that the big operator who would be making profits should be liable to income tax.  On the other hand I could envisage a situation where a smaller person having bought one, two or three ground rents would regard that as a profit and he would buy further ground rents.  That would seem to me to be a capital gains.</P>

      <P>I do not want to purport to summarise the whole law of income tax applying to these circumstances. In general it is the isolated type of transaction which you hear about from time to time, such as a person buying a house to live in, leaving it in three or four years, selling it and making a profit.  That is a capital transaction. There is also the person who goes out and buys houses and sells them.  It is a matter of how many he has to buy and sell before it can be held that he is carrying on a trade. Generally speaking, if he does it three or four times the Revenue Commissioners regard him as carrying on a business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose this is the section the Bill is about to a large extent and there is very little presumably I can say on it now that has not been said already.  I think there is profound disquiet among lawyers and accountants and other persons about this particular section.  There is no doubt it sets out and it seems to rectify what one might call two bad decisions from the point of revenue in the 1936 and the 1964 Acts.  Indeed, one finds it difficult to understand how one of those decisions was reached.  It is a matter now of deciding in this particular section whether your lease or sublease is subject to full interest.  In addition, if I understand the purpose <Col N="1057" /> in this, it says that when a person acquires land it does not matter what intention you had when you acquired the land or if you had no intention of doing business or trying to deal in land you come within the provisions of this section.  There are, I suppose, financial reasons based on precedents and it is because of the way our income tax law and taxation statutes are interpreted that this is so.  However, there is criticism of the introduction of the phrase &ldquo;a business&rdquo; in this.  It seems difficult to understand why this is used because even if a man is carrying on the business of grocer, draper, auctioneer or anything else for the purpose of income tax law there is no reference to me carrying on a business. If I am carrying on a trade the profits of my trade as a grocer, a candlestick maker or whatever else they are are accessible under tax.  It would be better if the section had run: &ldquo;where apart from this section, all or some of the activities of dealing in or developing land would not be activities held to be in the course of a trade,&rdquo; and forget altogether about the business.  This word has never been used before and it seems to introduce confusion where confusion is not desirable and where it seems it would not be necessary.  In the context of section 17, I should like to call the Minister's attention to section 23 where the section is drafted with the same intention and with the same purpose but the reference is to:</P>
      <P>a person (hereafter in this section referred to as the vendor) carrying on a trade of dealing in or developing land (hereafter in this section referred to as the trade) disposes, in the course of the trade, of the full interest acquired by him . . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question then is asked&mdash;is there a difference between a person who under section 17 is carrying on the business of dealing in or developing land which is then to be regarded as activities carried on in the course of a trade, and a person who in the case of section 23 is a person carrying on a trade taking in or developing land? What is the distinction between the two?  Why is the offence of dealing in or developing land dealt with in section 17 (1)?  What the whole of <Col N="1058" /> this Act seems to be about is to bring into charge private profits from carrying on the trade of dealing in or developing land.  The Minister may be able to clarify that in the way he has thrown so much light on another matter earlier this afternoon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear what is the Senator's difficulty.  In section 17 we have given a great deal of thought to the manner in which this problem should be tackled.  It is a difficult problem and we have come up with the solution which the Senator sees set out in section 17 (1).  Really it gets down to the net issue that there must be two things involved.  First of all, the transaction must be of a kind which would have been regarded as a trade if the man had disposed of his full interest, but is not so regarded because he did not, in fact, dispose of his full interest.  The second is that he must have acquired the interest in the course of dealing in or developing land. These are the two requirements involved in section 17.  It is very difficult indeed to think of any other word which you could use there in place of the word &ldquo;business&rdquo;.  I have tried to think of an alternative expression but I found it impossible to improve on the present wording.</P>
      <P>Section 23 is concerned with a different matter.  It is concerned with the case of a person who deals in building, presumably an office block or something of that nature, disposes of it but reserves the right to lease back. The Revenue Commissioners would place a certain monetary value on that right to lease back.  The person in question would not be getting a cash payment out of that element of the transaction and we are saying that the tax attributable to that element of the transaction may be paid over ten years. Section 23 is not concerned with charging a person to tax.  It merely provides that where a person effects this sort of transaction then he can pay the tax over ten years.</P>

      <P>Again, on that point I should like to say, despite the long consideration that has been given by the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners to this particular section, it may conceivably turn out that it does not work out, or that it will bring in more than is intended.  I hope, and I am sure, the Minister will give the assurance that if it does bring in more than is intended when the Revenue Commissioners inspectors get to working it out and when it comes to applying the particular facts, if it brings in more than the type of person the Oireachtas wants to get at, the Minister will not hesitate to bring in legislation in the admirable way in which this legislation has been brought in to deal with difficulties and inequities that arose under the 1965 Act.</P>

      <P>There is a further point and I wonder would the Minister or the Parliamentary draftsman give it consideration?  Subsection (1) is one great complex of words and I am satisfied that it is within the competence of the Parliamentary draftsman to break the sentence up and make clear what we are trying to get at.  The Minister could again explain what this section intends to do, and then if he wants to make sure he is not letting out too much or taking in too much, make provisos.  As in section 15, to which I referred earlier, it may be difficult and I have no doubt it is difficult but I am not satisfied that it is impossible to make it clearer.  An effort should be made to make these things somewhat more intelligible than they are.  If the persons concerned make the effort I believe they will achieve a degree of clarity that will surprise themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would the Minister be good enough to give us a little homily on what this is about. There is one thing in particular I want to find out&mdash;I do not think it arises strictly on this.  As I understand the position, when a person leases property by way of sub-lease or otherwise and creates a rent if he is involved in the business, to use the language of section 17, of dealing in or developing land, he will pay income tax on the final and any other profits on that and he will also, if I understand the section, pay on the capitalised value of the ground rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>More or less, but subject to the qualification that the market value of the rent will be taken into account in determining the profit from the overall transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be aggregated. One can justify liability to tax on that basis but here is where I part company with the Minister if the law is still the same as the last time I had to look it up.  Having paid on the capital value of the ground rent&mdash;that having been thrown into the credit side of the account&mdash;he then has to pay income tax on the ground rent beginning the first year thereafter.  I have no sympathy with dealers or developers in land but as I said on the 1965 Act, I cannot understand why builders and developers will put up with a situation in which, having paid on the capitalised value of the ground rents which, worked out at 15 years on a ground rent of £20, means he has paid tax on £300, means that the first year thereafter, having already paid when he capitalised, is charged twice on the same income.  I have no doubt that is charging twice on the same income.  If you are to charge for the whole term of 450 years or 550 years as the case may be, and you are to get income out of that, that is an income liable to tax and should be liable to tax, but I cannot se the justification for capitalising the ground rent and paying income tax on that if the person has to pay in the course of aggregation of the profit on the transaction. I discussed this with a learned lawyer the other day and, immersed as he has <Col N="1061" /> been for years in income tax matters, he could not advance any justification for it.  I cannot see any justification for it and I do not think it is fair to the developer to charge him on the capitalised value and then, the first year thereafter, without any remission for any period of ten or fifteen years, to charge him on the ground rent year in, year out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator puts it, it is difficult.  On the other hand, it is logical.  Let us take a builder who creates ground rents.  Let us take ten rents at £50 each.  They represent an income of £500.  For purposes of the transaction, we capitalise that £500, add it into the profit and loss account and determine the profit of the transaction.  That is fair enough.  At that point of time, the builder has an option open to him.  If he sold the ground rents for cash, and got £4,000 for them and then invested that £4,000 in Government stocks he would have to pay income tax on the income from the investment.  He may, however, choose not to do that but to leave his investment in ground rents.</P>
      <P>A similar situation which worries many people is that as one goes through life earning income, one pays income tax on the income and with whatever one has left one buys investments and receives income from them and then one pays income tax on the income from such investments.  A person might think that because he paid income tax on the original income, he should not have to pay income tax on the income arising from the investment of his surplus.  That is not the law. The law provides that all income is taxable and it does not matter from what source one accummulated the capital to procure that income.  If it is accepted that when a builder sells his ground rents and puts money into some form of investment the income from that investment should be taxable, then similarly the ground rents should also be taxable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>That sounds logical enough to listen to but if the builder does not choose to sell his ground rent then, of course, he will not invest in other securities and, therefore, will <Col N="1062" /> not have any income which will be taxable. I can see the analogy the Minister posed that when people invest savings they are taxed on the income coming out of the savings.  That is the law.  It must be so, because income tax, to use the words of a learned judge, is a tax on income.  That is fair but if you are to accept that that is so here, the mistake made is not so much taxing the ground rent year in year out but in capitalising the ground rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is easy to explain.  The builder at that point of time has two options open to him. He can say: &ldquo;I am leasing-off this land for a rent of £20 for the next 100 years,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I will sell it outright for a capital sum of £500&rdquo;.  You must capitalise the ground rents.  The fact that the builder postponed taking the payment arising out of the transaction for 100 years is his business.  The value of the transaction is the same whether he postponed it or not.  One way or another you must take the capitalised value of the ground rents.</P>

      <P>Section 18 repeats the corresponding section in the 1965 Act. Again, it is a machinery section.  Section 17 determines whether a particular transaction should be chargeable to tax.  If it is so chargeable, section 18 comes into play and sets out the manner in which the profits from the transaction shall be measured.  Stripped of its legal terminology, what it means is that acquisition and disposal of interests in land will be treated as purchases and sales of trading stocks.  That is really what it purports to do.  In the same way as a grocer buys and sells his particular products, the builder and developer in land will be simply regarded as buying and selling his product which, in effect, is land and buildings.</P>

      <P>There can be such different concepts of what a nominal price would be.  Take for example, the auctioneer or the trader at a fair or on a Saturday afternoon saying that certain things are given for a nominal price, a nominal charge.  One knows what nominal damages in the court are &mdash;a farthing, a penny or a shilling: sometimes they might go up to £1.  The Minister says we ascertain what the current value would be and then something below that.  It seems a bit unsatisfactory to say &ldquo;at a nominal price&rdquo;. If one said &ldquo;one-fifth, one-twentieth,&rdquo; and so on &ldquo;of the current value,&rdquo; it might be more satisfactory.  It is desirable to get some guide as to what will be in the mind of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

The purpose of the provision is to bring it within section 19 which speaks of the price at which the interest is disposed of.  In order to bring a gift within that wording you have to create some price for it so that it shall be regarded as having been disposed of at a price even though it was a gift.</P>

      <P>This brings me back to what I was dealing with earlier in section 1.  The Minister says, and I have no reason to doubt him, that section 156 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is repealed.

You can say that all the subsections, and so on, set out in the Schedule to this Bill are <Col N="1066" /> hereby repealed or you can say &ldquo;this new subsection is now substituted for subsection so-and-so in section so-and-so of the former Act&rdquo;.  The latter procedure has been adopted in this Bill in relation to section 156 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  If you substitute one section for another, surely you do not have to repeal it as well?</P>

      <P>It may well be that may be the appropriate way in the case of a taxation statute because, even if you are amending, in a particular taxation year, for the future, people will still be liable under the old law to whatever was the liability for a particular income tax year.  What I am trying to get at is this&mdash;and it is a practical difficulty&mdash;if one wants to find out what sections of the 1967 Income Tax Act were amended, one can find out straight away from looking at the Schedule here.  One can see them.  Also, in relation to many other statutes, if we want to find out what sections of the principal and other Acts have been repealed, we can find that information in the Schedule, too, and can get along quickly enough.  Take the Index to the Statutes, prepared I think, by the Parliamentary draftsman's office.  On occasion I have found that a particular section had been amended by having a new section substituted but it had not been picked up in the index because it was not among the repeals in the particular enactment.  I called attention to that particular error in relation to the statute.  This is why I think even substituting a section prospectively&mdash;even if it be necessary to have the old section there in order to keep it in being for the purpose of liability to tax and to recover under it, though I do not think it is necessary under the Interpretation Act&mdash;it would be desirable from the point of view of clarity in legislation to have all the sections that are amended or repealed where a new section or subsection is substituted put in a Schedule at the back.  It could be very helpful.  The other way is fraught with certain dangers for the person trying to interpret the law at any particular time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there is some force in what the Senator is saying, but <Col N="1067" /> the substitution and amendment are really related to each other, whereas when you repeal something it is gone altogether.  If you want to leave it there in an altered form you can do it by amendment, by the insertion of some words, or you can do so by saying &ldquo;the following is substituted&rdquo; for what is already there.  Amendment and substitution are really different aspects of the same thing, and they are not appropriate to be included in a list of repeals in a Schedule to the Bill.  I agree that a list somewhere of substitutions and amendments would be useful, but I would hope that the new loose leaf system for the Income Tax Act will help to make the whole position a great deal more clear in future for practitioners and others.</P>

      <P>Bille simplí é agus molaim é don tSeanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to grant <Col N="1068" /> the county councils the necessary powers to carry out the schemes formerly administered as Bog Development, Minor Employment and Rural Improvement Schemes by the Special Employment Schemes Office, which recently became the Special Employment Schemes Section of my Department. The Government have decided that the grants for these schemes&mdash; farmers' roads, bog roads and minor drainage works&mdash;should in future be administered under a single scheme and that the county councils should be asked to administer the scheme, subject to the general control of my Department.  The county councils have been advised of the details of the new scheme and almost all have by now indicated their willingness to operate it.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is a relatively simple measure.  Section 2 confers the power on a county council to enter into an agreement with landholders for the construction or improvement of accommodation roads and bog roads and for the execution of minor drainage schemes to serve land or bogs.  Section 3 provides that the expense of the work will be shared between the State and the benefiting landholders.  Section 4 authorises the making of State grants to the county councils for the purpose of the new scheme.</P>
    <P>The new scheme will be known as the Local Improvements Scheme and will operate as a single contributory scheme.  This is a logical step as the three existing schemes all dealt with the same type of work.  The new arrangement will make it easier to administer the scheme and should help to reduce the costs of administration, thus ensuring that more of the available money is devoted to the works themselves.  It will also help to ensure that grants are allocated for the most necessary works.  To facilitate participation in the scheme by landholders in the congested western areas, reduced rates of local contribution will apply in cases where the average valuation of the landholders is low.  Thus, the maximum rate will be 2½ per cent in the case of valuations under £5, compared with 10 per cent under the Rural Improvements Scheme in the past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> A bulk allocation will be made each year to each county council.  Out of this, the council will make grants for individual schemes coming within the scope of the Bill, which, as I have indicated, means schemes such as the Special Employment Schemes Office carried out in the past.  The council will select the schemes to be done in the year, enter into agreements with the landholders, collect their contributions and then execute the schemes. Priority in the recruitment of workmen will be accorded to suitable unemployed men registered at the Employment Exchanges.  Councils have been requested to give priority on the new scheme to gangers and other supervisory officials formerly employed by the Special Employment Schemes Office.</P>
    <P>As in the past, the schemes will operate on a voluntary basis.  The councils will act only on the request of the beneficiaries and with the consent of the landholders whose interests may be affected.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the cost of the new scheme will be met by the State grant plus the landholders' contributions. In calculating the cost the county council will be entitled to include a percentage charge in respect of administrative expenses.  As I said, the lower this is, the more of the available money that will be devoted to the actual works.  Indeed, a prime consideration in transferring the schemes to county councils is the fact that the maintenance of a separate organisation engaged exclusively on carrying out so many scattered, small schemes involved high overhead costs. It is hoped that substantial economies will be effected under this head by using the existing county council organisation. We shall keep this aspect of costs specially under review.  The scheme will not involve any responsibility on the part of a county council for future maintenance.</P>
    <P>In addition to carrying out the Bog Development, Minor Employment and Rural Improvement Schemes, the Special Employment Schemes Office acted as agents for Roinn na Gaeltachta in respect of grants allocated by <Col N="1070" /> that Department for accommodation roads in the Gaeltacht, and for the Department of Transport and Power in respect of grants for certain bog-road and drainage works.  It is intended that the county councils will act in the future for these Departments, and the Bill has been drafted accordingly.  The Ministers concerned will make allocations to the county councils to enable them to do the necessary works.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, practically all the county councils have indicated their willingness to operate the Local Improvements Scheme and I am sure that the very few remaining will shortly agree.  I wish to repeat the tribute I paid in the Dáil to the good sense and public spirit shown by the councils in this matter.  The Local Improvements Scheme, like its predecessors, is designed to improve the conditions under which the farming community live and work.  These schemes have proved particularly valuable to the smallholders in the West; indeed, in the current year the great bulk of the allocations for the three schemes combined went to the West.</P>
    <P>I have confidence in commending the Bill to the Seanad.  I should add that, in order to avoid a break in continuity, it is necessary to have the Bill enacted by 1st April, when the county councils take over.</P>

      <P>I just want to make one small comment on this Bill.  The Bill supplements the Local Authorities Works Act, 1949, and is complementary to the Local Government Act, 1953, inasmuch as it enables works to be carried out on roads not already maintained by a road authority.  One of the qualifications set out in section 2 (c) is that the road, when constructed, &ldquo;will be used by the public&rdquo;&mdash;a much more liberal qualification than the phrase &ldquo;general public utility&rdquo; which is contained in the Act of 1953.  Would the Minister consider an amendment within this Bill for the purpose of amending the Act of 1953 by inserting the new words in order to harmonise the scope of both measures in their application to the spending of money on roads not formerly in charge of or not maintained by <Col N="1071" /> a road authority?  I have in mind the insertion of a new section, before section 6, which would read:</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Local Government Act, 1953 (No. 12 of 1953), shall have effect as if the words &ldquo;used by the public&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;general public utility&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was first introduced in the other House many Members, and, in fact, the public generally, regarded this Bill, particularly from its description as the Local Government (Roads and Drainage) Bill as a re-introduction of the Local Authorities (Works) Act under a new name.  It was described by a number of people as a rose by another name.  But as the discusssion on it went on and in view of the meagre nature of the grants allocated it would now appear that the thorns on the rose bushes outnumber the petals.</P>
      <P>This Bill sees the termination of the operations of the Rural Improvements Scheme as it was known in the past.  I should like at the outset to pay a tribute to the officials and the workers who operated the Rural Improvements Scheme down through the years.  Excellent work was performed under that measure particularly during the inter-Party Government's time when a provision was introduced relating contributions to individual valuations. This was done because of the large number of objections by contributors to the requirement that they would pay contributions equal to their neighbours with higher valuations.  I am glad to see that a system of graded valuations relevant to contributions is being maintained in this measure and I note that there is an improvement in the contributions towards relief of the cost for those in the very low valuations but, unfortunately, it is a hard fact that relative to some levels of valuation the amount of contribution required is higher under the scheme as presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much concern has been created among the local authorities and the Minister in his introductory statement referred to the fact that some councils have not yet seen their way to cooperate <Col N="1072" /> in this measure.  I would, without any particular knowledge of the reasons that actuated these councils to withhold their co-operation, claim that it is because of the arbitrary level of ten per cent permitted for administrative costs.  The county of Cork in size corresponds to one-eight the area of the Irish Republic and if we are to accept the ten per cent as being adequate the amount involved this year would be in the region of £1,750.  This would not pay the expenses of one solitary engineer let alone the administrative staff that will be engaged in carrying out the duties formerly carried out by the Special Employment Schemes Office.  It would be interesting to know what the relative administrative costs were.  I can appreciate any effort made by any Government Minister to introduce a more efficient and more economical method of administering any Act of Parliament but there is a feeling among the members of local authorities that there is a hidden effort here to transfer to the local authorities expenses formerly borne by the Central Exchequer relative to the cost of administering this scheme.  The members of the local authorities of all Parties have protested vigorously that the ten per cent margin permitted is inadequate.  It is particularly inadequate when the level of indicated grants for the coming years is considered.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset that the description of this measure as a roads and drainage Bill was a misnomer inasmuch as it implied that it would be feasible to carry out drainage operations under this Bill.  It is feasible if the moneys were made available for the purpose.  There is no doubt that there has been ever since 1957, since the stoppage of State contribution to the operations of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, a persistent demand from county councils, from the General Council of County Councils, even from the Árd-Fheis of the Government Party, for the re-introduction of grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  During all that period there was only one defence made by the Government and its representatives of their refusal to re-implement the grants <Col N="1073" /> under that Act, the absence of any provision for maintenance of drainage schemes under it.  There is no provision for maintenance under the Bill we are now discussing, none whatsoever. Consequently, one wonders at the belief of those who were critical of the previous Act.  If they were sincere in their criticism one would expect that they would introduce a provision for maintenance under this current measure but there is none.  Consequently, we can only infer that in the first case there was no need for it under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, that it would not have been a proper thing to have done or else that this Bill, if we are to pay any heed to the criticism so often voiced during those years, is remiss in not providing the moneys for the maintenance of the works performed under it relative to drainage.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that very much agricultural production in this country is inhibited by the need for adequate drainage.  I realise that arterial drainage must come first and that in that field there is inadequate work being provided to get the schemes under way.  I refer to those under the arterial drainage works.  There are many small tributaries which could be drained with reasonable drainage operations under schemes similar to those under the Local Authorities (Works) Acts which would make it possible for hundreds and hundreds of landowners to operate their land successfully. There is no doubt that very many drainage schemes could be embarked on without causing downstream flooding, which is alleged to be the reason why they have been deferred.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that if sufficient funds were made available to the county councils they could, under this Bill, provide considerable relief to hundreds and hundreds of landowners who are restricting their agricultural production at the moment because of periodic flooding.  It is also true that many of the operations of the Local Authorities (Works) Act and much of the funds which could be made available would relieve the work <Col N="1074" /> in relation to the maintenance of road works and in relation to the Department of Local Government in the need to repair those roads.</P>
    <P>This Bill is described as the Local Government (Roads and Drainage) Bill.  However the Bill may be described it is completely inadequate to meet the needs of the rural countryside in view of the money allocated in relation to participation in the scheme. I mentioned earlier that Cork County is practically one-eighth the area of the entire State.  In 1957 we received and spent in Cork County Council £40,732 on drainage under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  This was reduced, due to Government action, in the year following to £10,000 although in the last year of the full operation of the Local Authorities (Works) Act we obtained £40,732 in Cork County. This operated to the profit of landowners whose lands were flooded periodically.  This relieved the situation regarding the danger in relation to the condition of many of our public roads.</P>
    <P>Then we had the rural improvements schemes.  The councils have, to an increasing extent over the last decade, come to realise their obligations in regard to the take over and maintenance of roads which were improved under the rural improvements schemes.  This acted as a very definite incentive to the beneficiaries who contributed to get the roadways done.  They had experienced in earlier years of proposals, money being spent and allocated to various local authorities on the repair of roadways but those roadways deteriorated because there was no provision for taking them over.</P>
    <P>The councils realised that the standard of work efficiently performed by the Rural Improvements Schemes Office brought those roadways up to such a condition that they could in the vast majority of instances be immediately taken over on the recommendation of the engineering staff of the local authorities and maintained thereafter.  This acted as an incentive to very many contributors to avail of the Rural Improvements Scheme and to be able to bring some relief to the hundreds who had not access to their <Col N="1075" /> homes and farmyards down the years. Councils, particularly the council of which I happen to be a member, the Cork County Council, have been foremost in the takeover of such roads and the degree of co-operation which was forthcoming between the Rural Improvements Office and the county councils was certainly most gratifying. We have constantly at our monthly meetings the development of motions for the takeover of those roads.  We profited by this until a few years ago, when due to financial stringency we had practically a cessation of the operation of the rural improvements schemes. We had the situation in which applications were either refused or shelved for an indefinite period and the applicants informed that for a period of some two years finance would not be available for new schemes and the backlog which existed could only be dealt with.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, despite what we are informed of the vastly improved contributions, this backlog has vastly increased and many rural improvement schemes have not been done.  We find in the switch over from the rural improvements schemes to the operations under this Bill that in County Cork we are handed 80 applications that have not been dealt with by the Rural Improvements Schemes Office. No doubt those are applications which are awaiting attention for a considerable time.  This ignores any applications which were refused.  It ignores certain people here who were under the impression that because of the cutdown under the operations of the rural improvements schemes grant it would be futile for them to make application to have their roadways attended to.</P>
    <P>The fact now is that that backlog of unattended work over the last three or four years together with a number of fresh applicants who now feel that the council can more readily dispose of what to them was a longstanding problem, means that this particular year whatever about the years to come, there should be a very special effort made to give a more substantial grant than would be normally required so <Col N="1076" /> that councils would be in a position to clear off the backlog and meet at the same time the demand for new applicants who consider there is a better opportunity for them under the new scheme.</P>
    <P>What do we find?  We find that at best we are still working in a restricted capacity.  Last year in Cork County we received a sum in excess of £19,000 for rural improvement schemes.  We have now the 80 applications awaiting attention and we have been informed that the allocation for this year will only be £17,500.  This is a negligible amount to allocate to a county of the size of Cork if this work is to be performed.  The whole operation under this Bill falls completely unless there are adequate financial grants available to the councils to administer the work.  The members of county councils will now be obliged to carry out a screening process to decide on an order of priority.  In Cork County Council we have to decide on an order of priority among the 80 that have been awaiting attention and are now transferred to the offices in Cork.  I merely cite Cork as the area with which I am familiar.  There is no doubt that every other county in Ireland is involved to the same extent.  The situation this year looks extremely grim relative to the amount of work that may be performed.  I referred to an allocation of £40,700 in 1957.  Despite the vastly augumented increases in the interim, we now have a mere £17,500 to cover roads and drainage.</P>
    <P>In the other House there was some discussion relative to the take-over of roads that will be brought up to a suitable condition consequent on the Rural Improvements Schemes.  The question arose about laneways and we had it in detail also at local authority meetings. We know that considerable difficulty has been encountered from time to time where engineers decided that a laneway will be taken over as far as the second last house but the laneway was a matter of contention until it was ultimately clarified.  I should like to have the point cleared as to whether drainage of a laneway serving other residents will be included in the overall grant picture.</P>

      <Col N="1077" /> It would be interesting to know the percentage of administrative costs that would be involved in carrying out schemes which it is proposed to amalgamate under this scheme.  The Minister must satisfy local authorities that they can operate within the figure that will be allocated to them in relation to administrative costs.  This is an item of considerable concern to the local authorities at the moment and I feel if the Minister could react to the numerous representations that have been forwarded to his Department regarding the inadequacy of the proportion permitted for costs and compare that with what it cost previously, even if a saving is to be effected as he states, the council would be satisfied that it is not a question of transferring the burden from the Exchequer to the local rates.</P>
    <P>We have had expressions of concern from members of the Government at the high level of rates and their impact on ratepayers throughout the country. We must be sure in any Act that we do not exacerbate this situation and we must assure the ratepayers and the community to that effect.</P>
    <P>Maintenance in relation to drainage schemes is, as I said at the outset, a very important one.  It would be of considerable assistance in carrying out drainage operations if provision could be made for their maintenance.</P>
    <P>There is another point which I should like clarified.  I refer to the take-over of these roadways once they have been brought up to standard.  This Bill provides that work may be undertaken to provide this amenity for a number of landowners or occupiers on a particular roadway.  However, the interpretation by the county engineers has been restrictive regarding the subsequent take-over in relation to the number residing on the roadway.  It has been interpreted by many as requiring at least two residents, whereas under the terms of this Bill grants may be available irrespective of the number of residents, or so long as there is a number of landowners on the roadway. I should like to know that all roads which qualify under this Bill will also <Col N="1078" /> qualify for maintenance by the county council.</P>
    <P>Senator Miss Davidson referred to another point in which I had a particular interest.  I refer to the expression used in subsection (c) of section 2 regarding the definition &ldquo;used by the public&rdquo;.  This inclusion appears to be a more liberal interpretation of the qualification of the operations than that contained in the 1953 Local Government Act when we had reference to &ldquo;general public utility&rdquo;.  I should like to know from the Minister which definition will operate in relation to the take-over of roadways that have been brought up to standard.  Will the description in this Bill &ldquo;used by the public&rdquo; be sufficient to warrant the take-over by the local authorities of those roadways?</P>
    <P>We welcome this Bill but we are disappointed that despite the interpretation placed on it on its introduction, that in some way it meant a resumption of drainage, it would appear from statements made since, and from the more positive indication of the meagreness of the grants allocation to the county councils, that it will be a sheer impossibility for the councils to engage on drainage, seeing that the amount allocated is not sufficient even to meet the reduced expenditure on the rural improvement schemes last year.</P>
    <P>We do not oppose the Bill but we avail of this opportunity to make these criticisms and hope that there will be re-thinking on the Minister's part and his Department relative to the two main points I have made&mdash;the inadequacy of the margin allocated for the administration of the scheme, and, secondly, and no less important, the totally inadequate amount of grants to permit the county councils to carry out the number of schemes that will be necessary, consequent on the short-fall in recent years because of the rural improvement schemes grant, to meet the new situation with the new intake of applications consequent on the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, briefly, to welcome this measure.  I feel it is <Col N="1079" /> a wise and sensible decision to ask the local authorities or county councils to undertake this type of scheme.  A great deal of useful work has been done under the Rural Improvements Scheme, and tribute must be paid to the officials of the office concerned for the very valuable schemes that have been carried out all over the country.  The work can be done more efficiently and more satisfactorily at local level.  A great deal of useful work will be carried out under this measure.  As I have said, much useful work has been carried out under the Rural Improvements Scheme but we have the type of work such as accommodation roads that can be done by county councils as a rule.  That type of work must be done under these schemes.  There are quite a number of jobs remaining to be done in every county in Ireland.  I speak particularly with regard to works in my own county and on behalf of Wexford County Council.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Sullivan referred to the provision of money for those schemes. It is easier to talk about money than to provide it but I go the whole way with him on this question.  It is essential that more money be provided under this measure if the necessary work is to be carried out.  In Wexford we have been told we have been allocated only a small amount of money in the coming year and we have been handed down from Dublin a number of schemes which will use up far more money.  The Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, who is the boss in this case, should give sympathetic consideration to appeals to make much more money available for this useful type of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join in the appeal made by Senator O'Sullivan to divert the money from other projects to this most useful work.  It is the most useful type of work in which county councils could engage.  The work is almost as essential as the making and repairing of country and main roads.  In various counties there are accommodation roads serving four, five or six families.  Many are in a shocking condition and it is <Col N="1080" /> only under measures such as this that the work can be carried out.  Such work is as important to those families as are big repair jobs on main and country roads.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I join in the appeal to the Minister to provide more money under this measure.  Senator O'Sullivan also made a point about maintenance and I agree it is something which must be considered.  In many jobs carried out under the Local Authorities (Works) Act a great deal of money spent on drainage and other such schemes was wasted because no maintenance was carried out afterwards.  A lot of the time of county councils will be taken up on repairs to accommodation roads but many drainage jobs will be carried out, and it is necessary that provision be made for maintenance.  As I have said, the two main problems are the provision of sufficient money to carry out necessary schemes and provision for maintenance thereafter.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom, fosta, fáilte a chur roimh an mBille.  Sílim go bhfuil gá mór leis.  This type of consolidation of the three schemes administered by the Special Employment Office is something that was needed. Senators from rural areas know that very often under minor relief schemes certain areas were deprived of grants because there were not sufficient numbers of unemployed in them.  If two of the schemes had been put together, very useful grants would have been available to help people to carry out important schemes in their areas. Though the Bog Development Scheme may be still useful, there is not the same rush to the bogs as in the past, especially by families to go to cut their own turf.  There are areas in which it is still being done but in many places it has not the same appeal.  The Rural Improvement Scheme worked well during the years and became of tremendous importance to many rural communities. It depended on local contributions and in many areas great work was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking for my constituency, the greatest impetus this scheme had was when the county council decided to take over roads which had been done <Col N="1081" /> under the Rural Improvements Scheme. I have experience of places where local people had to make contributions on three successive occasions because the roads deteriorated quickly in modern traffic conditions.  That was discouraging.  I do not know what the position is throughout the country but in Cavan during the past couple of years we have decided to take over these roads.  We have something like 1,400 miles of culs-de-sac and through-lanes because of the great number of lakes and mountains in our territory.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senators who have said that that Scheme, now and in the past, has been responsible for an enormous amount of useful work being done.  As the standard of living improves and as people provide themselves with better houses and better out-houses, it becomes more important that they have better lanes leading to their premises. They would all like to have county roads adjacent to their homes. The fact that they are able to get grants under this scheme to enable them to provide lanes to their homes is valuable because a would-be purchaser would naturally take into consideration access to a farm.</P>
    <P>In my county we have been told we shall qualify for £14,000 this year and the Minister has said more or less that later he will be able to augment this when he discovers what the true position is.  These grants in the past were allocated having regard to the use each county had been making of the Scheme.  In some areas people were content to tell neighbours who might have liked to avail of the Scheme that they should defer a decision about local contributions because these contributions might not be called for at all later&mdash;that somebody would come along and do something without the need for local contributions.  It is only right to tell the people exactly what the position is, that the local contributions are based on valuations and that where valuations are low the contributions are also low.  People should be made aware that there is no hope of these things being done without local contributions.  In my area people are satisfied to contribute once they know <Col N="1082" /> that the local authority will take over the road afterwards and maintain it. I welcome that.</P>
    <P>Certainly, I would agree wholeheartedly with the previous speakers in an appeal for extra money.  In a Scheme such as this, which would confer such immense benefit on the rural community, there is certainly a case for asking for extra money.  We are all agreed that it is not possible to do all these lanes and culs-de-sac in one year.  There are 91 applications with the Department from my constituency alone and, since then, we have got in an extra 62 applications. In many of these cases, the local contribution was not forwarded to the office here but it was forwarded in some cases.</P>
    <P>In the first place, we are faced with the appointment of an engineer and a clerk to assist him with that Scheme. That will eat up part of the money. The Scheme will bring a road to the doors of certain rural people, thereby putting them on a par with people living along country and main roads. In view of recent post-primary education facilities, an increased number of children will travel these roads and there is the probability of buses and cars using them.  All of that demonstrates that there is a new spirit and a new outlook in the country.  In days gone by, some people were not very anxious to take electricity into their homes and were not very anxious about roads probably because they were living in a poor type of house. That has changed immensely now.  In present circumstances, it is only natural that they would expect better roads.  I join with other Deputies in asking the Minister if at all possible, to provide a little more.</P>
    <P>I shall not dwell unduly on the subject of drainage.  I agree with those who said that drainage without maintenance seems useless.  Useful work was done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act but it was of a temporary character because there was no maintenance.  It was a case of money going down the drain&mdash;that is, if the drain was able to take the money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The same argument applies now as applied then.  The drainage is frequently of a minor type and is not of much use and will not be of much use until arterial drainage is carried out in certain areas.  The local people, or somebody, should see to it that there is maintenance on whatever drainage is carried out as otherwise there is no use in doing the work.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a step in the right direction.  I am quite confident that the Minister will do his best to meet the demand that I know has been made from my constituency for some extra money to clear up part of the backlog in this connection.  There was a hold-up of these schemes last year due to a temporary recession as far as money was concerned.  I trust something extra will be given for the next year so as to bring us up to par from the point of view of what would otherwise have been achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly I may be able to give some information as to why the minor employment schemes were started.  I lived with them for many years, being in charge of the county which got possibly some of the highest grants in the State.  The schemes were started to give employment during the winter months on necessary and useful works which did not demand any particular planning in advance. The county councils had the staff, the quarries, the plant, the machinery and the organisation and therefore were the most suitable bodies to carry out these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember getting the list of minor employment schemes.  We got it in September or October.  Sometimes it reached a very high figure&mdash;maybe £100,000 in the county of Mayo.  We had to finish these schemes by 31st March.  The idea was to get as much useful work done as possible during that period and to provide maximum employment.  The percentage allowed for carrying out that work was 4-1/6th. In other words, you deducted £4 from each £100 and, therefore, it was <Col N="1084" /> 4-1/6th per cent on £96 that you could expend.  In my case, that money was divided amongst the staff of the county council dealing with the pay-sheets and pay orders, the county engineer and the county engineering staff.</P>
    <P>After a time, the Local Authorities (Works) Act was introduced.  I was in at the beginning of that scheme.  I was called to a conference in the Custom House when the late Deputy T.J. Murphy, the then Minister for Local Government, who was administering that scheme, outlined what he proposed to have enacted in the Oireachtas.  I happened to be spokesman for the county engineers on that occasion.  I made exactly the same representations at that meeting as Deputy O'Sullivan made here today.  I pointed out that, without some provision for maintenance, a lot of the money proposed to be expended under the Local Authorities (Works) Act would be wasted. That has been proved.  That Act never really worked in my county because we had no outfall drains and, after a few years we had to turn from drainage work to road work.  If there are Senators who will say that the Local Authorities (Works) Act was satisfactorily operated in their county, they may be speaking from experience but I have told the House what happened in my county.  We wanted to use the money to the very best advantage of the people in the county and, therefore, we turned to road works because there was no other suitable work we could do under that Act.</P>
    <P>Then the rural improvements schemes came along.  They brought their own problems.  It was very difficult to get all the people in any village or place to agree to make the local contribution.  Those living nearest to a main road felt they had an easy approach to it and that they should not have to make a contribution, whereas people living perhaps half a mile in from the main road were most anxious that the work should be done. In many cases, works admirably suited to be done under the Rural Improvements Scheme could not be done because we could not get the people to make the local contribution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> At present, ten per cent of the sum is allowed for administration.  I should like to take Senators back over this matter again.  In the beginning, we got 4-1/6th per cent, that is, four per cent on the £96.  Responsibility for carrying out the work rested entirely with the county engineer and the engineering staff.  We had to appoint the gangers, supervisors, and all that.  It was in the period of the first inter-Party Government.  People will not like to hear it, but this is history as far as I am concerned that I can prove by documents.  I was approached as county engineer with the demand that I should dismiss all the gangers I had and appoint gangers nominated by the inter-Party representatives.  Naturally enough, I would not do that with the men who had worked for me down through the years.  They had the knowledge of the work to be done and I was not going to throw them out. Finally, I was thrown out, and I was the first county engineer in Mayo from whom these schemes were taken.  An independent engineering staff was set up in the county of Mayo, which was the first county in Ireland.  That was all right as far as I was concerned.  The work was going on, people were getting employment, and I was very happy to see that they were getting employment, but eventually the moneys began to get scarcer and the overheads remained constant with the result that instead of the 4-1/6th per cent for administration it must have gone up to 20 or 25 per cent.  That is the position which, as far as I can see, is attempted to be corrected under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister particularly to see that the county engineering staff will be dealing with this and will be first satisfied.  I have heard&mdash;I do not know whether it is true or not&mdash;that the county engineers are not to share in any portion of the ten per cent for administration.  I think that that is wrong.  I think that the county engineering staff are the proper people to do this work.  They go out on their ordinary rounds, and the roads they cover from the time they leave their headquarters until they get on to the particular road under consideration for minor improvements, for Local <Col N="1086" /> Authorities (Works) Act or rural improvements schemes, are county council roads, roads in which they are interested and which it is their duty to supervise and examine in any case. Therefore, that part of their journeying is properly chargeable to the county council and is travel which is fully justified and gives a good return to the full advantage of the council. When they come on to the strange roads for consideration for grant or repair they are then going into strange territory but their expenses will be paid for that also.  The major portion of their journey will be of use to the council rather than where you have an independent engineer travelling possibly miles out to see one of these minor improvements schemes over county council roads over which he has no control or charge or responsibility. So it is much better that the work should be carried out by the engineers of the county council.  I would appeal to the Minister to see that the distribution of the percentage is made in such a way that the engineering staff will be satisfied, that is, starting with the county engineer who will have the main responsibility of coordination down to the junior engineer who will be carrying out the work on the spot.</P>
    <P>With regard to taking over those roads, I see that provided one of those roads accommodates two houses or land belonging to two individual people or accommodates two people for the purpose of getting turbary the scheme can be done.  I think that the taking over of the roads by the county council should still be governed by the 1953 Act, under which the county council can only take over a road which is of general public utility.  I think that is correct, because you can have a repeat grant if the money is sufficient, but if you continue to add on miles and miles of roads which serve two people for turbary or two people for stripes of land they got from the Land Commission you will add tremendously to your county council mileage for which you will be responsible.</P>
    <P>Generally, I am glad to see these <Col N="1087" /> schemes coming back again; I am very glad to see that they will be supervised and carried out in the most economical manner, and I am sure that that is the purpose of this Bill.  I should like that more money would be made available.  We would all agree with that, and the more that a county council in any county will get the more it will like it.  I should like the Minister to see that the county engineer and his staff in every county of Ireland would take over the responsibility for doing these works and would take it on in a good spirit and with a knowledge that they were doing useful work, co-operating with the work of the council and with the people, and for that reason that they would make the little sacrifice which I think is really implied in this for the general good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be very brief on this.  I am glad to see that the Local Authorities (Works) Act is being brought back under this Bill in addition to the other schemes that were suspended and stopped for some time back.  Unlike Senator Flanagan, I must say that the Local Authorities (Works) Act was very successful in Dublin County.  It is a very small county, of course, and we are fairly near the coast so far as the drainage of the various streams in the county is concerned.  I do think that the major weakness in the Bill now before us is the fact that there is no arrangement for maintenance of the works carried out.  One example would be where money is made available, for instance, under what was previously described as the Rural Improvements Scheme for the repair and construction of a laneway. You can have a situation where that laneway is liable to be flooded frequently and under water, and every engineer knows that it is drainage that is the most important thing so far as roads are concerned to ensure that they will last a reasonably long time.  If roads are not properly drained and if the water is not got off them quickly they deteriorate, and it is very important that where you have roads which may be subject to flooding there should be some arrangement regarding their <Col N="1088" /> maintenance to ensure that they are kept up to a certain standard.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of the construction of roads to certain specifications. Of course, when discussing this matter I am thinking mainly of County Dublin, to which a very small grant is being made under this scheme. County Dublin would like to see the money used under this scheme in a manner that would bring the roads up to a good specification which would enable them to be taken over by the county council.  We have a scheme in the county council for taking over a certain number of lanes each year by the county council.  Of course, the small amount of money available leaves it that it would be another 100 years before all the lanes would be taken over in the county.  This scheme should accelerate that.  Unfortunately, County Dublin is very badly treated, as the Minister knows, as far as grants from the Road Fund are concerned.  It is a small county, and owing to that fact the amount of money made available in the county is comparatively small compared with counties which cover very much more ground, and the amount of traffic carried by the County Dublin roads from all directions except the east is very heavy, the roads, of course, are damaged to a much greater extent than roads around the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I mention that point because I hope that the money spent under this scheme in County Dublin will enable the laneways and roadways which benefit from it to be constructed to a specification which will enable them to be taken over by the county council.  The same applies under the Rural Improvements Scheme.  A number of lanes in County Dublin needed to be repaired and could have been repaired under the Rural Improvements Scheme.  It will now be possible under this arrangement, if sufficient money is made available, to have those schemes carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1089" /> There is one thing in this Bill that I do not like.  It is the fact that it will impose a burden on the ratepayers. In the ordinary way there is an allocation available for the expenses of operating these schemes but when a scheme is completed and the roadway is constructed or the drainage done it will be necessary for the ratepayers to contribute towards the maintenance of these roadways and the work actually carried out under this scheme just because there is no maintenance clause in this Bill.  That is a major weakness. At this stage I do not know whether the Minister has power to do so, but I think he should take another look at it and see whether it is possible to ensure that maintenance will be done. It was a weakness in the Local Authorities (Works) Act and Senator Flanagan demonstrated that.</P>

      <P>A number of Senators referred to the Local Authorities <Col N="1090" /> (Works) Act and seemed to think that there was some similarity between that Act and this Bill.  In fact, there is not.  I cannot see where this similarity arises. I had the same thing in the Dáil.  It seems to me that there is something of a decision in the Opposition Parties to make it appear that this is, in fact, getting back to the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
      <P>This is, as I pointed out, an amalgamation of three different schemes which up to now have been carried on by the Special Employment Schemes Office which has become the Special Employment Schemes Section of my Department.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act dealt almost completely with drainage.  This scheme, which is an amalgamation of three former schemes, will deal mainly with laneways or byroads and a certain amount of very minor drainage indeed will be dealt with under the scheme.  There can be no comparison at all with the type of work under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  In fact, the Government have no intention whatever of getting back to the Local Authorities (Works) Act which had, I think, a number of faults.</P>
      <P>One of the faults was referred to here.  There was no maintenance provided for under that scheme.  The type of drainage which was done mainly under the Local Authorities (Works) Act was the type of drainage in which it is necessary to provide for maintenance unlike the type of drainage which will be done under this scheme.  As I say, only a small percentage of the work will be drainage. It will be merely dealing with small drains serving a few farms and it will be work of the type which will appropriately be the responsibility of the landowners who will be served. The carrying out of this type of maintenance will be well within their scope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that there is much point in going into detail with regard to the Local Authorities (Works) Act. One of the major faults we saw with it was that, generally speaking, the schemes which were carried out under it were based on completely inadequate <Col N="1091" /> surveys and they were the type of schemes in which the only really adequate survey would be that of the whole catchment area of the river concerned.  I suppose there was a certain amount of valuable work done in some areas but in other areas there was a certain amount of work done which would have been better left undone.  Some of the work done, because there was not an adequate survey, caused more serious problems further down the river.</P>
    <P>There are a number of schemes under which drainage work can be undertaken at present but I do not think it is really relevant for me to go into them now under this Bill.  I just want to point out that this is by no means comparable with the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  It is for a different purpose entirely and the type of drainage work which will be done under it is work which can quite appropriately be maintained by people who will benefit under it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the maintenance of roads and laneways, which will be dealt with under this scheme, Senator Flanagan dealt very well with that aspect.  He made it quite clear that if the local authorities were to undertake the maintenance of all those laneways it would place an intolerable burden on the ratepayers and the inevitable result would be that roads of much greater utility would suffer. Those roads and laneways generally will be ones on which traffic will be small and the rate of deterioration will be much lower.  As Senator Flanagan pointed out, they can qualify for another grant, if and when necessary.</P>
    <P>With regard to the taking over of the roadways, this is a matter for the county councils concerned.  They have to decide on the basis of the facts applying to a particular case: first of all, whether the road has a public right-of-way over it, and, secondly, whether it is of general public utility. This is really a matter for the road authority itself to decide.</P>
    <P>If we were to extend the definition of a public road it would merely add <Col N="1092" /> to the problem of dealing with existing public roads, which I think have in justice a priority over roads that are of lesser utility.  But, this Bill will make it possible for the county council to deal with all the roads, some of them as public roads and others under this scheme.  I do not think there is any general demand for the substitution of the words &ldquo;used by the public&rdquo; for &ldquo;general public utility&rdquo; and, in any case, it would be completely outside the scope of this Bill to make such an amendment.  Between this Bill and the Local Government Act all roads will now be covered and can be dealt with by the local authority.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan, as well as other Senators, referred to what he described as the meagreness of the grants that had been notified for the coming year. A number of Senators pressed for higher grants.  It was made absolutely clear to each local authority that the amounts notified were purely provisional and that, in fact, the amount of money that would be available for this purpose had not been decided at all yet.  These were amounts that generally related to the work done in the particular counties over the last five years, and they were based on the total figure that was available last year of £350,000: but the amount that will be available this year has not been decided at all yet.  That was made quite clear to each county council and it was made quite clear in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>These are only notional figures based on the assumption that the amount will be the same as last year.  That has not been decided and the figure that will be available will not be fixed until the Estimates are published.  There is no reason for anybody to assume that these amounts will be the actual amounts that will be notified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That remains to be seen.  My own guess is it will be very safe to assume that it will not be less. The question of the proposed ten per cent allowance for administrative costs <Col N="1093" /> was referred to by Senator O'Sullivan who suggested that this might be a hidden attempt to transfer the cost to the councils.  I do not think that is likely to eventuate at all.  I did point out in introducing the Bill that one of the main reasons for this was to arrange that the greatest possible amount of the total sum available would be used to carry out this very necessary work and that one of the big advantages in this proposal would be a reduction in administrative costs.</P>
      <P>As Senator Flanagan also remarked, the administrative costs at present are something of the order of 25 per cent and this, of course, is because a special organisation had to be set up to deal with this particular type of work all over the country.  Surely it is reasonable to expect that with the more rational type of administration we are proposing now it should be possible to achieve a considerable saving in overheads.  I think it is in the interests of everybody that the maximum possible saving should be achieved.</P>
      <P>I suppose it is not unnatural for local authorities to represent that ten per cent is likely to prove too low but it is only by experience that we can find out if that will, in fact, be the case. I think it should be feasible, indeed, to do this on the basis of ten per cent. As Senator Flanagan pointed out, when this type of work was done before the percentage taken off for administration was much lower.  In any case, I think every public representative, whether county councillor or Deputy or Senator, should make every effort to ensure that this will be given a fair trial and that every effort will be made to work it within this percentage for administration.  I do not think that anybody is doing a service to the people who would benefit from this by suggesting there should be a higher percentage of the limited amount of money available devoted to administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan asked whether it would be possible to deal with spur roads leading off laneways.  This will be possible.  The county council can make <Col N="1094" /> the scheme for the whole lane, including spurs.  There are grants available under the Department of Agriculture for roads serving only one holding and in the case of a laneway with a branch or a spur leading off to one holding or house the scheme can be made for the whole laneway and the fact that a road serving can only be dealt with under this scheme will not be relevant.</P>
    <P>The question of the fees to be paid to local authority engineers was raised. My Parliamentary Secretary received a deputation from the county engineers on this matter and the question is being examined.  I cannot make a final statement on it at this stage.  I do not think it is necessary to have a final decision for the purposes of the Bill because the power of local authorities to pay remuneration to their officials, including fees, is contained in the Local Government Act, 1931.  I am confident that we shall be able to work out an acceptable solution to the question of fees for county council engineers.</P>
    <P>The only other point I wish to refer to is the question of the scale of contributions.  Senator O'Sullivan mentioned that the new scale will be higher in the case of some valuations. That is correct but in order to present the true picture I should point out that it is only in cases where the average rateable valuation is more than £75 that this will be so&mdash;that the new scale will be higher than the old.  I do not think it is inappropriate that that should be so.  After all, the rate of contributions in the case of low valuations will be considerably lower than the old scale and it is only reasonable that where the average valuation is higher the scale should be somewhat higher.</P>
    <P>In actual fact, it is mainly lower valuation farms which will be involved. The position is that the old scale in the case of valuations of less than £5 was 10 per cent.  Under this scheme the rate will be 2½ per cent. In the case of valuations of between £5 and £7, the rate was 12½ per cent. It will now be 5 per cent.  On valuations between £7 and £10 it was 15 per cent and it will be 10 per cent; between £10 and £15, the old rate was 20 per <Col N="1095" /> cent and it will be 15 per cent; between £15 and £25 the rate was 25 per cent and the new rate will be 20 per cent; between £25 and £50, the old scale was 30 per cent and the new scale will also be 30 per cent; between £50 and £75, the old scale was 40 per cent and the new scale will be 40 per cent; between £75 and £100 the old scale was 40 per cent and it will be 50 per cent; and for valuations of more than £100, the old scale was 50 per cent and the new scale will be 60 per cent.  It is only in cases where the average valuation is more than £75 that the new scale will be higher than the old and I think there are comparatively few cases in which these schemes will be undertaken in such circumstances.  In those cases it is reasonable to require a substantial contribution.  In every case where the valuation is less than £25 the new scale will be lower than the old and in cases where the valuation is between £25 and £75 there will be no change.</P>

      <P>Two years ago the Government gave substantial benefits to social welfare classes and also provided substantially increased subsidies for the agricultural community.  In order to do that they had to make arrangements to collect the money from the only source from which it can be collected, the public in general. One of the methods to achieve that purpose was to increase road tax and <Col N="1098" /> that was a legitimate way to raise money.  It was money that was never in the Road Fund.  It was one of the ways in which the Government arranged to have diverted an increasing proportion of the increasing prosperity of the country for the benefit of the community as a whole.  It had nothing whatever to do with the Road Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his Second Reading reply the Minister stated that councils may now take it that the amount of money which has been indicated to them as the allocations for the year are only instalments.  What I am concerned about is the application of that to section 3 because councils will have to employ additional staff to cope with arrears of work which they have not been able to perform during the past three years.  We all know of the communications, the replies, that were sent to the promoters of schemes.  We all know that work was suspended for a two-year period, that applications would not be received.  Consequently, there was a fall-off, even on new applications.  However, the work was not undertaken in respect of those lodged, those that were accepted.  That backlog has to be met.  In our county, 80 of those lodged are in arrears.  Each would average £250.  That would be ignoring any additional applications for the current year.  This 10 per cent would leave £1,750 for the payment of staff.  The Minister is better equipped than anybody in this House &mdash;even before he entered politics&mdash;to assess how far £1,750 would go in payment of an engineer's salary to cover the county council work and in payment of clerical staff to cope with this new work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister wants the co-operation of the county councils, that co-operation will be forthcoming.  I want to know, before we have our next council meeting, if we are in a position <Col N="1099" /> to say to our manager: &ldquo;You may take it that the moneys are merely for the purpose of getting the scheme going and that we can proceed with the employment of the staff to carry out the backlog of the work which is 80 schemes in arrears.&rdquo;  It is necessary to get down to that backlog first.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, as soon as the Estimates are published, the total amount that will be available will be known.  The provisional sums notified are based on a total allocation of £350,000.  Each council will be notified as early as possible of the actual grant which will be available to them for 1968/69.  I think they cannot really decide until then how they will organise themselves to utilise this money and whether they will require to employ additional staff for that purpose.  I shall let them know as soon as I possibly can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would impress on the Minister the necessity of supplying that information to every county council with the utmost despatch. The scheme will start from 1st April, 1968, which is now almost upon us.  The people vitally interested will expect to go into action immediately 1st April arrives to clear off the backlog and to commence work on fresh applications.  It is of the utmost importance that the county councils be advised as soon as possible so that they may recruit the staff to implement the scheme.</P>
