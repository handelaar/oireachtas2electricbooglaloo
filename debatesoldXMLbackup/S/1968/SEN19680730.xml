    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is concerned with broadcasts which are intended for general reception and are transmitted from unauthorised stations installed or maintained on board ships, aircraft, or any other objects or structures. It has been introduced in furtherance of a Council of Europe Agreement for the prevention of such broadcasts. That Agreement was signed on behalf of Ireland and eleven other countries. Six of these countries, Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Norway and Sweden, have already passed legislation to implement the Agreement and Finland, though not a member of the Council of Europe, has passed legislation towards the same end.</P>
      <P>The Preamble to the Agreement reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The member States of the Council of Europe signatory hereto,</P>
      <P>Considering that the aim of the Council of Europe is to achieve a greater unity between its members;</P>
      <P>Considering that the Radio Regulations annexed to the International Telecommunication Convention prohibit the establishment and use of broadcasting stations on board ships, aircraft or any other floating or airborne objects outside national territories;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considering also the desirability of providing for the possibility of <Col N="2574" /> preventing the establishment and use of broadcasting stations on objects affixed to or supported by the bed of the sea outside national territories;</P>
    <P>Considering the desirability of European collaboration in this matter;</P>
    <P>Have agreed as follows:</P>
    <P>The Agreement then sets out what each Contracting Party undertakes to do, that is to say, to make punishable as offences, in accordance with its domestic law, the establishment or operation of pirate broadcasting stations, as well as acts of collaboration knowingly performed. These acts are defined as including among other things the provision of any equipment, supplies or services to facilitate pirate broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Senators will no doubt be familiar, in a general way at least, with the background to this European Agreement. Broadcasting as we know it would quickly become chaotic and impossible in the absence of orderly allocation and use of the wavelengths available. Since transmissions in one country can cause serious interference with reception in another, the allocation and use of wavelengths is governed by international agreements and regulations. The competent international body in this field is the International Telecommunication Union, which is a specialised agency of the United Nations, comprising over 130 member-states. The Radio Regulations annexed to the International Telecommunication Convention prescribe the procedures which member-countries are required to follow before they use frequencies in those bands of the spectrum used for long distance communication and for broadcasting. These procedures are intended to avoid or at least minimise harmful interference between the radio services of sovereign States. For this purpose it is essential that all radio transmitting stations&mdash;whether on land, on a ship or in an aircraft&mdash;be either operated or licensed by a Government. They are then subject to Government control and if any of them causes serious interference to services in another country, the matter can be taken up through official channels.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2575" /> I should like to make it clear at this stage that the radio services and the procedures to which I refer cover much more than the broadcasting services. Radio frequencies are used for point-to-point radio communication, for maritime and air navigation, for life saving services, various mobile services, <i>et cetera</i>, as well as broadcasting to the general public.</P>
    <P>So far as the broadcasting services are concerned, there is, as everyone knows, interference in the long and medium wavebands. This is unfortunately unavoidable at this stage owing to historical and other causes which it is not necessary to go into here. But it is important to realise, first, that additional stations cannot improve the general position and, secondly, that additional stations operating on whatever powers and frequencies private owners may choose themselves to use for commercial gain, are a menace, not only to broadcasting services generally but to other radio services, particularly those connected with safety of life.</P>
    <P>The operation of broadcasting stations on ships or from aircraft is expressly prohibited by the International Radio Regulations. Broadcasting in this context means the transmission of programmes directly to the general public&mdash;not the operation of ordinary ship radio required for communication with other ships and with shore stations, for navigation purposes <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>The irregular broadcasting with which we are now concerned started a few years ago with the appearance of pirate broadcasting stations on ships off the coasts of a number of northern European countries. These stations ignored the international agreements and regulations and appropriated to themselves any wavelengths which suited their purposes. A matter of the gravest concern was the fact that their irregular transmissions affected the distress frequencies used by ships, lighthouses and coast stations. We had some experience of this in our own territory when pirate broadcasting ships were operating off the British coast.</P>
    <P>Pirates operating outside territorial <Col N="2576" /> waters are not subject to the laws, obligations and restraints applicable to legitimate businesses. I have in mind such provisions as the laws of libel and sedition, performing rights, conditions of employment and contracts. I understand that in their operations pirates tend to regard the property of creative artists and copyright property are theirs for the taking. It is not irrelevant in our particular circumstances that we are anxious to complete the building up of a healthy broadcasting organisation of our own from licence and advertising receipts and we would not welcome unfair and illegal competition for any part of that revenue. Neither do we wish to suffer interference which might seriously impair reception of the Irish programmes.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the Seanad will enable the Government to deal effectively with any pirate broadcasting station within our territorial limits or from our waters. Sections 2 and 3 make all such broadcasting unlawful and also broadcasting from Irish registered ships or aircraft operating anywhere. The owner and master of a ship or aircraft and everyone operating or participating in the working of the station can be found guilty of offences. These sections are also aimed at agents or companies on shore that assist or procure such broadcasts.</P>
    <P>Power is being taken in section 4 of the Bill to deal with Irish nationals if they operate broadcasting apparatus from any foreign ship or aircraft on or over the high seas or from marine structures or other objects on those seas. It will be an offence for anyone in the State, whatever his nationality, to arrange for any such broadcast.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 list &ldquo;acts of collaboration&rdquo; which become offences under the Bill. It will be an offence to aid in any way the setting-up or operation of pirate stations by provisioning them, transporting goods or persons to or from them, or participating in any way in their broadcasting activities. Section 7 deals with the question of penalties. The phrase &ldquo;knowing or having reasonable cause to believe&rdquo; is liberally scattered through these sections in relation to these acts and is <Col N="2577" /> very relevant. Section 8 is a saver to cover the situations that can arise in which succour and aid become necessary owing to distress, shipwreck or illness, and section 9 is another saving clause for what may be expressly authorised by licence.</P>
    <P>As Senators will observe, the provisions of the Bill are so drafted as to be complementary to similar legislation by other countries, without avoidable overlapping. Thus they are aimed at acts including acts of collaboration committed by anyone, irrespective of nationality, within the jurisdiction, that is to say, in our waters or in our ships or aircraft wherever they may be; and also acts committed by Irish citizens on or over the high seas. They are not aimed at acts by anyone, Irish or foreign, that are committed in the jurisdiction of another country.</P>
    <P>The pirate stations appear to have attracted a certain amount of misplaced sympathy in certain quarters but it must not be forgotten that the companies and persons responsible for them are motivated by nothing more or less than commercial gain, and that their activities are a serious threat to a number of institutions and rights which are clearly entitled to our protection. These activities appear to be suspended at present and the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that they will not be resumed. There is little doubt that, if we did not ratify the European Agreement, ships carrying pirate stations would soon operate off our shores. It is probable that our announcement of our intention to promote this legislation and the subsequent introduction of this Bill have discouraged any attempt to take advantage of the existing legal position.</P>
    <P>The Bill is required to honour our obligations under the Council of Europe Agreement, to safeguard the effectiveness of our distress and rescue organisations and emergency communications, to protect the rights of artists, performers, <i>et cetera</i>, and the revenue of our own broadcasting service.  It is aimed, not at &ldquo;pop&rdquo; or any other kind of programmes, but simply at unregulated broadcasting by people responsible to nobody but themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2578" /> I therefore recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Title of the Bill is a trifle puzzling and, indeed, there are many people who would have thought from it that the Bill is aimed at dealing with offences which our own broadcasting services frequently commit.  It turns out that it is not aimed at them but at persons operating in our territorial waters or outside them, and it is quite clear that if there is to be any law or order in relation to wavelengths and the operation of radio stations, a Bill of this kind is necessary. For that reason the Minister is quite right in recommending the Bill to the House and I do not think he will have any difficulty in having it passed through the House, perhaps even all Stages, today&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>We should hope so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if we are asked for them. I want to make a comment on the appearance of the Bill at this time. This is precisely the kind of Bill which is not very controversial&mdash; indeed, not controversial at all&mdash;which the Government could well have introduced in this House in the first place. It could well have been disposed of here instead of cluttering up the Order Paper of the House with it at this time of the year. I hope the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will convey that message to the Government&mdash;that more Bills of this kind, especially those of a non-controversial character but which may require fairly lengthy examination in Committee&mdash;might be introduced here and thus avoid cluttering up the Order Paper at the end of each session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, it seems to me, will be perfectly effective for the purpose for which it is intended&mdash;to prevent pirate broadcasts from ships on the main outside our territorial waters, but the thing that surprises me&mdash;perhaps there is good reason for it&mdash;is that there is no provision in the Bill which attacks the source of revenue of these pirate broadcasting stations. I would have thought it advisable in some way to prevent or to make it an offence to give advertisements to these pirate broadcasting stations because it is on advertising <Col N="2579" /> revenue that they depend for their existence. I would have thought it should be possible in some way to cut off the source of supply, the source of finance, of these stations.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, it seems to me that it is correct to introduce this Bill at this time because there is still a proportion of the country's population who listen to radio programmes rather than television programmes, especially blind people and others of that kind, and it is highly desirable that the official broadcasting stations, whether English or Irish, should not be jammed by these pirate stations. In addition, these pirate stations contribute nothing, as the Minister has said, to broadcasting but at the same time they take advantage of the performances, the works and records, of people who may never get any royalties or revenue from them because they happen to be out of touch with the people whose rights are infringed. Apart from these observations on the Bill, which will implement the Council of Europe Agreement, as far as my Party are concerned we will, if necessary, give the Minister all Stages today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I also wish to welcome the measure. I do not think any fair-minded person could quarrel with the action this Bill proposes to take. Like Senator O'Quigley, the only comment I have to make is by way of an expression of surprise that this type of Bill was not before this House long before now because it would have been far better for the business of the House as a whole if it had been. We could deal with many measures of this kind and I see no reason why the Order Paper should be cluttered up with them at this time of the season. I endorse Senator: O'Quigley's appeal to the Minister to bring that to the notice of the Government. Apart from that, I do not think there is any note of controversy in the provisions of the Bill. It is obviously designed to try to remedy a glaring injustice which could be perpetrated on many people, many of whom we do not know anything about. The measure, therefore, deserves the commendation and support of all <Col N="2580" /> sides and I have no doubt it can be passed in all its Stages today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill. Because we are a party to the Council of Europe, we should bear our responsibilities in matters of this kind. Frankly, though, I am disappointed with the provisions in section 7. To my mind the fines are altogether inadequate, bearing in mind that I recall seeing a television character some weeks ago about whom it was stated that he had something like £50,000 a year as a disc-jockey. Not so long ago, when the Minister's colleague was introducing the Marts Act, the fines imposed for contravention were greatly in excess of the paltry £100 I see here. We should have a little consistency in these matters. If the Minister wishes to make section 7 a deterrent he should treat these people as harshly as his colleague proposed to treat the Irish farmers a few months ago. I should like to avail of this opportunity, if I may, to ask the Minister why his Department have not yet accepted the idea of piped television in the blocks of flats we see going up on all sides of the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was afraid of that but at the same time I did not have an opportunity of mentioning it on the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill. Reading through this Bill, I found that everything is covered but I am at a loss to know whether an island off the coast is provided for. There are some small uninhabited islands far out which I do not think could be described either as structures on the sea bed or as vessels. For that reason perhaps the Minister would tell the House whether in fact islands or small rocks on which these things could be constructed rightly come under this Bill. In sections 4 and 5, there are lengthy lists of craft, vessels and objects but the Minister has not mentioned islands, and I wonder if it would be permissible for Radio Caroline to set up on some remote small island and continue on as before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in a definition, if it is possible at this stage to get such from this Minister, of what &ldquo;national territories&rdquo; may be in the context of this Bill. In his statement the Minister used the words &ldquo;outside national territories&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill itself I gather is to restrict pirates in the area from unloading their message, whatever that might be, on to the innocent Irish public. To me it is an extraordinary situation that all types of pirates&mdash;business pirates, banking pirates, property exploiters&mdash;are allowed to exploit the Irish community on land but we have a holy a horror of any attempt to beam a message to the Irish people from offshore. I think there is something illogical about the stand of this Minister in this regard and of course the threats contained in the Bill are not within the bounds or within the scope of the Minister's power. He is a rather Walter Mitty character in so far as he hopes to be in a position to prevent, we will say, the utilisation of strategic points offshore or in the air for the purpose of broadcasting to this country. In fact the Minister has no more power in practice and no more opportunity to implement portion of this Bill than he has to fly to the moon.</P>
      <P>The argument put forward by the Minister is that we are anxious to abide by the aims of the Council of Europe. This country is more than anxious and I quote the Minister's words: &ldquo;to achieve a greater unity between its members&rdquo;, that is, the members of the Council of Europe. That brings me to this point: we have six counties which for all practical purpose would appear to be offshore as far as this Minister is concerned. In those six counties, we have a number of broadcasting-stations. We have Independent, UTV and the BBC broadcasting from this offshore territory of the 26 counties. I wonder would the Minister consider those stations to be illegal as far as he is concerned. It is a fact that 50 per cent of the population, at a minimum, of the 26 counties prefer to listen to what is beamed from UTV or BBC, or both, than to listen to what is beamed from our own station here.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would direct <Col N="2582" /> the attention of the Senator to the contents of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I opened by asking the Minister to define for me what is an illegal broadcasting station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill indicates that it deals with ships, aircraft and such like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it could refer to offshore. The question was already asked by Senator McDonald as to whether it could refer to a structure offshore. I am asking the Minister to define for me what is &ldquo;offshore&rdquo;, as far as the 26 counties are concerned. I support Senator McDonald on this and I suggest that the Minister, if he is anxious to put into operation the wishes of the Council of Europe, that is, to have a greater unity, should start to allow in here to the Irish public transmissions from the BBC and UTV and have those properly recognised here and channelled here either through a piped method or any other technical means that is suitable.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated that the question which disturbs his mind and the minds of many people involved is the danger to rescue services. I think we all agree that the utmost efforts should be made in that regard to ensure that no signals transmitted by any other broadcasting service, legal or illegal, would intervene or interfere with rescue services and services of that kind. However, the Minister referred in his opening statement to the fact that there is at the moment grave interference in this country with the actual broadcasting service itself but he is very careful not to go into detail as to what the problems are in this regard.</P>
      <P>At page 4 of his speech, the Minister says:</P>
      <P>It is not irrelevant in our particular circumstances that we are anxious to complete the building up of a healthy broadcasting organisation of our own from licence and advertising receipts and we would not welcome unfair and illegal competition for any part of that revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of that, I want again to <Col N="2583" /> ask the Minister will he define for me what &ldquo;unfair and illegal competition&rdquo; is?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me quote again from the Minister's opening statement. I presume the Chair is anxious to have this matter properly clarified and not to impose further restrictions here in this House in addition to the one in the Bill. I quote the Minister's statement:</P>
      <P>It is not irrelevant in our particular circumstances that we are anxious to complete the building up of a healthy broadcasting organisation of our own from licence and advertising receipts and we would not welcome unfair and illegal competition for any part of that revenue. Neither do we wish to suffer interference which might seriously impair reception of the Irish programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we have interference with Irish programmes. I dealt with this matter on a number of occasions before and I am quite satisfied also that as far as the Minister is concerned, deliberate attempts are being made on his part to prevent the Irish public from tuning in to services, particularly to television transmissions from other areas. Excellent services were available to this part of the country up to about five years ago. It is extraordinary the amount of <Col N="2584" /> interference that now takes place. Can the Minister explain that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect an answer to that particular query I have put to the Minister. I also expect a definition of what &ldquo;unfair competition&rdquo; is. The Chair has suggested that I should not pursue this but I am asking the Minister does he consider transmissions from outside, from offshore, from outside the Twenty-Six Counties, unfair competition?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister a question. We have 32 counties, 26 of which are within the jurisdiction of this House and in the other six, we have broadcasting services to which 50 per cent of the Irish people prefer to listen. I am asking the Minister does he consider that type of competition to be the unfair competition to which he has referred in his opening statement? I do not expect there is much point in pursuing the matter at this stage, seeing that the Chair has taken that attitude. I would imagine, Sir, reading the impressive Preamble to the Bill itself and the Minister's statement and also the quotation he has from the Preamble to the <Col N="2585" /> Agreement which was made by a number of countries which are members of the Council of Europe that he would have given us in greater detail the information to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>I hope he will at least clear the air with regard to, firstly, what the definition is here of &ldquo;unfair competition&rdquo;; secondly, whether he considers that 50 per cent of the Irish people up to now have been more anxious to listen or tune in to services which are given from outside the State; and, thirdly, whether it is his intention to cause further interference as far as these people are concerned rather than widen the scope, as Senator McDonald has suggested&mdash;I do not know whether he intended to widen it as far as I do &mdash;by providing better reception from outside the State to 50 per cent of the people who up to now have not been able to get any reception, bar that from Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann.</P>

      <P>I thank the Seanad for the favourable reception they have given to this Bill and I take note of Senator O'Quigley's proposal that this Bill may be an example of one that might be initiated in the Seanad. In reply to Senator O'Quigley, in section 6 (3) (e) the Bill covers the prohibition of the giving of advertisements to pirate ships operating in our territorial waters. I do not think I need say very much about what Senator McQuillan referred to because the broadcasting that goes on in the Six Counties or in Great Britain or in Scotland has nothing to do with this Bill at all. I do not propose to interfere with transmissions based on wavelengths which have been approved of by the International Telecommunications Union. The territorial waters as in this Bill defined are specified in the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, <Col N="2586" /> 1959, as being, for the purposes of that Act within the outer limit of the territorial seas. Quite clearly, the outer limit is stated to be a line three miles from the coast except in certain cases where straight baselines are drawn extending from one peninsula tip to another. A map has been published and everybody knows what our territorial waters constitute. There is no doubt about that.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to prevent pirate ships operating on wavelengths which have not been approved by the International Telecommunications Organisation, whose activities have been condemned by the Council of Europe and who are engaging in unfair competition because they do not have to pay anybody for anything for the purposes of their broadcasting. They pay no business fees and they frequently fall down in the payment of performers' rights and that is what we mean by &ldquo;unfair competition&rdquo;. I think the Bill is perfectly clear in its explanation.</P>
      <P>A question was raised as to whether fines are sufficient. I have been advised that penalties proposed in the Bill are the fines or imprisonment sentences appropriate to the alternative methods of prosecution provided for, that is, prosecution summarily or on indictment.  That more or less covers the position.</P>

      <P>The Minister is quite right in saying that the act of advertising by means of a broadcast from a prohibited station is covered under section 6 (3) (e) but I am not so sure that the matter as dealt with in the section is very effective. Supposing somebody were to establish that for the <Col N="2587" /> purpose of pretending that they had a big listening audience for the advertising of products and they are advertising with the consent and the request of the advertisers. That clearly is not an offence. That is the type of defence that may be put up. What I am concerned about is the actual payment. It is clear that unless you stop payment to these pirate stations, you are not effectively getting at the whole operation.  You can have people advertising a variety of products for the purposes of pretending they are doing a business and they can continue a business for some time on that basis. I would like to see us getting nearer to getting people to pay for advertising on this pirate business. The Minister thinks it is covered on that basis. I am not at all sure that it is.</P>

      <P>There is a difficulty in regard to this because it is very difficult to prove that an Irish-sponsored firm broadcasting from a pirate station had actually done so because a written record might not be readily available. The position is different if the onus is put on the firm to show they have not arranged or paid for the broadcast. I think that is what the Bill covers. They have to show and prove they have not arranged or paid for the broadcast. In other words, in the case of the makers of some well-known commodity, where it was quite clearly advertised in the pirate station they would have to prove that they had arranged for and paid for it. In the ordinary way in this country, it would be impossible for people to get away with the position if we make them show that they have arranged for the broadcast or payment thereof.</P>

I should have thought if one wanted to put teeth into the section one would do it in the way it is done in the Transport Acts and other legislation of that kind. It is not done in <Col N="2588" /> subsection (4) of section 6. As far as I can see, the onus is not put on the person charged.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the question where broadcast advertising is deemed to take place at the point where it is received as well as where it is made. Advertising by means of a broadcast is an offence under paragraph (e) of this section if it is done in any of the places set out in subsection (1). If somebody advertises by means of a broadcast where does he advertise? Advertising means bringing something to public notice. If a manufacturer places an advertisement with one of the pirate stations offshore, he intends that the merits of his products shall be advertised in Ireland. The effect of the subsection is that the manufacturer shall not be able to escape conviction for advertising by pleading that he is a citizen of a foreign country and that he did the advertising on the high seas. He is advertising in this country and he is caught by the Bill.</P>

      <P>If I were drafting a summons against a proprietor of a pirate station and were looking at section 7, I would wonder, if this were <Col N="2589" /> a summary charge I was bringing, to what district court area I should bring it. I presume the offence would refer to a district court area. There is nothing in this which says that the offence will be deemed to be committed anywhere and the summary charge may be brought in any district court area within the State. Normally the proceedings are taken where the offence is committed in that district court area or in the district court where the defendant resides unless the offence is regarded as being everywhere in the country. The Minister is really put into some difficulty unless the offence is deemed to be committed within the jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>That may be so, but at the same time the district court derives jurisdiction from the fact that a person is either arrested in the district court area where the offence was committed or he resides in the jurisdiction where the offence has been committed.  Unless some provision provides that an offence is committed all over the country, once the broadcast is received in any part of the country, it will be very difficult to get a conviction in the district court. The same applies in larger areas to the circuit court. This is something which should be clear in the Bill. We will find it very difficult, having caught the criminal, to get any court where we can convict him.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 38, before &ldquo;of&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;of proportional representation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The holding of a referendum is a very serious matter. It is of the utmost importance that the question at issue should be put in the clearest possible manner to the voters, that they should be given every assistance so that, in voting, they know precisely the issues that are at stake. I have endeavoured in the amendments in my name to clarify this issue with regard to the Fourth Amendment because as at present set out, the phraseology is likely to be confusing and misleading. I suggest that the minimum we can get is that the words &ldquo;proportional representation&rdquo; should be included, in other words, that the wording on the green ballot paper should be:</P>
      <P>To substitute for the present system of proportional representation of voting at Dáil elections the &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo; system as operated in Great Britain and Northern Ireland...</P>
      <P>I want the two choices to be made clear by quoting examples, in other words, to show that the present system is the system of proportional representation and that the system that is proposed, &ldquo;the straight vote&rdquo; as so called, is the system as operated in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I cannot see that there can be any objection by the Minister to including these clarifying phrases. Even when amended in this way the proposals for the presentation fall far short of the presentation in the previous Referendum (Amendment) Act, 1959 where it was spelled out in detail, and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2591" /> The following summary of the principal proposals in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958, is circulated for the information of voters.</P>
    <P>This is how it was set down:</P>
    <P>At present members of Dáil Éireann are elected on a system of proportional representation for constituencies returning at least three members, each voter having a single transferable vote.</P>
    <P>That is a clear description of the &ldquo;present system&rdquo;, whereas all that is offered to the voters in the forthcoming referendum is simply the &ldquo;present system&rdquo; without any explanation. The 1959 Referendum Act goes on to say:</P>
    <P>It is proposed in the Bill to abolish the system of proportional representation and to adopt instead a system of single-member constituencies, each voter having a single non-transferable vote.</P>
    <P>Again, that sets down clearly what is proposed, in other words, to abolish the present system of proportional representation and to adopt the system of single-member constituencies, each voter having a single non-transferable vote.</P>
    <P>These are two quite effective and useful summaries and are much preferable to and much clearer than what is given in the present proposal. In fact, the name &ldquo;proportional representation&rdquo; is not mentioned in the present proposal. This is especially important when there are two proposals before the electorate&mdash;the Third Amendment and the Fourth Amendment. Therefore, the voter who wishes to retain proportional representation might be confused as to which one of those proposals relates to proportional representation.  If he asks the question of the returning officer, the returning officer cannot answer but can merely, according to the Bill, read the summaries as attached.</P>
    <P>I do not think it necessary to make any long case for this. It is in the interests of clarity and in the interests of putting the issue fairly to the electorate so that there can be no question of confusion. Indeed, we have the headline <Col N="2592" /> which was set in 1959 and which was drafted at that stage by President de Valera and has all the hallmarks of a fair summary, as we would have expected from President de Valera. I appeal to the House and to the Minister to show even at this late stage a recognition of the necessity to be impartial in what is put to the electorate.  I suggest that the amendment in my name will achieve that. However, if the Minister prefers, I would gladly withdraw my amendment in favour of the description as given in the 1959 referendum. Beyond that I cannot go to accommodate the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the amendments on the grounds that in each case they make the issue clearer. The purpose of this Bill is to show clearly, both in the cards circulated to the voters and the displays shown in the polling place and its precincts, the issue involved. There is no doubt that the present proposal to refer merely to &ldquo;the present system&rdquo; is correct in so far as it goes. Our objection to it is that it does not go far enough. It is valid to say that, even after the debate here and the debate throughout the country, we will still find people coming to the polling place and not being quite sure. There is a danger that voters who must have this read over to them, such as blind voters and so on, may have genuine confusion. In their minds, they may consider themselves as either being for or against proportional representation. Many people will view this great debate as being a debate about proportional representation. This may be the key word they would look for in making their choice. There is no doubt we have no option but to frame the ballot paper in the general way proposed in this Bill, but we must make every effort to assist the people. It is not enough to say that everyone knows what the present system is. I think we should put the label on it. I believe amendment No. 1 is a reasonable amendment and that we should say &ldquo;the present system of proportional representation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the second alternative, which calls this &ldquo;the straight vote&rdquo;, <Col N="2593" /> I argued against this on Second Stage as not being an accurate description. But if this description is to be there, then I think it is made clearer and more meaningful if instead merely of the words &ldquo;the straight vote&rdquo;, there are added the words &ldquo;as operated at present in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.&rdquo; It is quite clear that people are reasonably familiar with the differences between what happens here and in Britain. Therefore, I think the second amendment also makes the issue clearer.</P>
    <P>There are other ways in which this could be amended. The form of words used in the Referendum Act and in the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 1959, were both superior and in particular, what was in the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 1959 was a good description. Even if the Minister is not willing to accept the amendments Senator Quinlan has down, I would ask him to consider if it would not be proper to add a few words to his description here by explaining what is meant by:</P>
    <P>the &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo; system.</P>
    <P>This could be made plainer by adding the following so that the second one would read:</P>
    <P>To substitute for the present system of voting at Dáil elections the &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo; system in single-member constituencies in which the candidate in the constituency who receives the largest number of votes is declared elected.</P>
    <P>This clear statement was made in the 1959 Bill and I think the present Bill would be improved by an amendment of this type. This is a case where there should be clarity above all. I realise it is possibly late in the day to be talking about these things. Circumstances are such that this has come to us at a time when perhaps discussion is merely a waste of time and of breath. Nevertheless, I would urge again that our opinion is that the descriptions contained in this Appendix are inadequate and that they could be improved by the amendment which Senator Quinlan has suggested and could also be improved by the amendments on the lines I have suggested myself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2594" /> It is our firm opinion that, quite apart from the main debate as to the merits of these proposals, there should have been an honest attempt to get together and produce a statement on the issue, a clear declaration of what was at issue between the two parties in this debate. This could then have been used in this Appendix and become the description that would go forth as a summary to the people who would have to vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator Quinlan read for us the terms of the similar Appendix in the 1959 Act. It impels me to congratulate the present Minister for Local Government on the remarkable improvement he has brought about in the phraseology on this occasion. It is quite clear that the phraseology in the 1959 Act was calculated to bedazzle and bemuse the ordinary man in the street. All this stuff about the non-transferable vote means nothing to the ordinary person who does not take a fanatical interest in politics. When Senator Crowley was speaking last week, I called across to him in a perhaps disorderly fashion and asked him: &ldquo;Does anybody understand the meaning of the words &lsquo;non-transferable vote&rsquo;?&rdquo; He replied: &ldquo;Everybody knows that is what we have had for the last 40 years.&rdquo; I accept he may not have heard me correctly, but I think this illustrates that words such as &ldquo;non-transferable vote&rdquo; means nothing to the ordinary person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was saying on the earlier Stages of these Bills that the proportional representation system was a difficult one and that many people were unable to understand it. Senators on the other side got up and said that the Irish voter was an intelligent voter, that it was wrong of me to reflect upon his intelligence, that he was perfectly able to understand it, and so on. Yet now we have Senators saying quite solemnly today that the words &ldquo;the present system&rdquo; are difficult and that the ordinary man in the street will be unable to understand what is meant. I should have thought that no clearer, more simple or more straightforward description of the issue could possibly have been found than &ldquo;the present system of <Col N="2595" /> election&rdquo;. Surely no one could fail to understand what that means? I cannot see the difficulty.</P>
    <P>The suggestion of Senator Quinlan to insert after these words &ldquo;as operated at present in Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo; has, I suspect, some ulterior motive. I think the words &ldquo;Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo; are inserted for a purpose. However, I consider that there may be a point in this geographical clarity. It may, in Senator Quinlan's view, be of benefit to voters to know the other countries in which it is used but if so I should have thought he would have inserted other words, such as the USA, Canada, New Zealand and so on, in order to get the maximum amounts of accurate information available to the voter.</P>
    <P>A more serious fault in this geographical amendment, I think, is that he has not made the rather necessary consequential amendment in his other proposition. In inserting the words &ldquo;of proportional representation&rdquo;, if Senator Quinlan is interested in geographical accuracy, I should have thought he would have worded this rather differently by inserting nine other words which, if he would like to propose a verbal amendment, the Seanad might be willing to discuss. I would suggest his other amendment should then read, to insert &ldquo;of proportional representation as operated at present by no other country in the world&rdquo;. If he wishes to provide this geographical information for the Irish voter, I think he should go the whole hog and should consider accepting that verbal amendment.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Yeats has said most of what I was going to say about this. It is quite clear that these two amendments, when considered together, are based on conflicting hypotheses. Amendment No. 1 which seeks to define and describe the present system of voting in Dáil elections, must obviously be based on the assumption that the people of Ireland do not know what the present system of voting at Dáil elections is. On the other hand, amendment No. 2 proposes <Col N="2596" /> to clarify the proposed system by describing it as the system that operates in other places&mdash;but not mentioning all the other places in which it operates, only two selected such places.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinlan's assumption then is that the people of Ireland do not know what the present system of voting at Dáil elections is but that they are fully aware of how the voting system in Britain and Northern Ireland operates. I do not see how anybody could accept such an illogical proposition.  Apart from the defective reasoning on which the amendments are based, I might mention that the summary that would result from the acceptance of the amendment would not&mdash;I think nobody could say it would &mdash;be easy to read or understand for the average voter who would not take much time to consider and read the voter's card.</P>
      <P>This is how the summary would read if the amendments were accepted:</P>
      <P>To substitute for the present system of proportional representation of voting at Dáil elections the &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo; system, as operated in Great Britain and Northern Ireland in single-member constituencies.</P>
      <P>If that makes it clearer to Senator Quinlan, I do not think it makes it clearer to anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only obvious deduction to make from this whole operation, this whole idea of Senator Quinlan's, is that he is not concerned with clarifying the issue but that his concern is to confuse. As Senator Yeats pointed out, if he were to be consistent, he would propose to insert in amendment No. 1 &ldquo;as operated in no other Parliament in the world&rdquo;. If he were to be realistic in regard to his second amendment, he would surely specify places other than Great Britain and Northern Ireland and give a list of such places, such as the USA and Canada and so on, in which it is operated. But obviously, the intention is somehow or other to try to prejudice the issue by the implication that this operates nowhere but in Great Britain and Northern Ireland and then, of course, that nothing good can operate in those <Col N="2597" /> places, obviously, an attempt to have the voter's card in some way substantiate the propaganda that the Opposition propose to utilise to the effect that this is a British system of election.</P>
    <P>As Senator Quinlan knows, both of the systems involved are British systems, one being the system that they have been wise enough to retain for themselves and the other a system that was invented specially in order to frustrate countries such as this by imposing upon them a system of election and representation which would eventually make Government, if not impossible, at least inefficient. It is agreed that that is the intention of the system. It was devised for the purpose of providing representation for every class of a minority. Therefore, it is designed to foster the formation of political Parties on the basis of appealing to minority interests and therefore it must, if it has the effect it is designed to produce, eventually produce the situation of a number of small Parties being returned at election time and making the formation of a Government difficult, if not impossible, as has happened in other countries.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan need not expect the Government to co-operate with him in his attempt to utilise the official summary to be issued by the local returning officers for the purpose of helping to further this dishonest form of propaganda that the Opposition propose to use. Unlike Senator Quinlan, I believe that the people do know what the words &ldquo;the present system of voting at Dáil elections&rdquo; mean. I do not mean to imply that they know and understand all the complicated processes of dealing with the votes after they have been cast but they do know what is implied by &ldquo;the present system of voting at Dáil elections&rdquo;. It is obvious that to attempt to describe this system will only complicate the summary.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan says the 1959 Act set out the position very clearly but in fact there were complaints both before and after the 1959 referendum that this was far too complicated and that the people were confused. If they were confused, they could only have been confused <Col N="2598" /> because two systems of election were described in the summary. The first system described in the 1959 summary was the present system which was described&mdash;not very briefly&mdash;in the following terms:</P>
    <P>At present members of Dáil Éireann are elected on a system of proportional representation for constituencies returning at least three members, each voter having a single transferable vote.</P>
    <P>This being printed on a small voter's card, the normal voter who was not particularly interested, would do no more than glance at it and seeing this at the outset of the description of the proposed Bill, would be very likely to form the impression that he was being asked to vote for or against this system of proportional representation for constituencies returning at least three members, each voter having a single transferable vote. If there was any confusion caused the last time, it could only have been caused in this way, and to clarify that, the present summary was kept as short as possible. I think it is clear from this summary that the proposal now is to substitute for the present system the system of the straight vote and single-member constituencies. To put anything more into it could only result in confusing the issue.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that this is not a genuine amendment, that the complaint is being made merely for the sake of making the complaint, and that the effort is merely an effort to delay the submission of the proposal to the people and to confuse the people. The present system is understood by the people. To further describe it would only complicate the matter by cluttering up the small voter's card with unnecessary words, making it less likely to be read thoroughly and making it more likely for people to be confused.</P>

      <P>The approach of the Minister on this is quite typical. Nobody is in good faith in anything but the Minister, not even President de Valera in his proposals in 1959. According to Senator Yeats, the 1959 proposals were calculated to bedazzle and bemuse. I stand on the proposals <Col N="2599" /> as drafted, but I made an offer to the Minister that if he did not like these amendments I have made, I was quite prepared to withdraw them and to accept the statement as drafted by President de Valera in 1959. Yet he accuses me of trying to bedazzle the voters by not putting the words clearly, and so on, thus implying that the former Taoiseach was also bedazzling the voters. Here it is a crime to mention PR in the summary. It was mentioned fairly and squarely in 1959. Here the slang term is used, showing the great advance in leaving certificate English that is being brought about now; slang is now to take over when literature goes out the window. The slang term &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo; system is used, whereas in the whole of the Fourth Amendment Bill not once was a slang term used. It is rather strange that in drafting the Bill, it is assumed that the public, in reading it, would not understand the slang term &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Of course, the Minister will do everything possible to concede this slavish and crawling compliance with England and everything English. Everything that England stands for must be best. Because the straight vote system is there, it must be best. It is best in the North, certainly, because it keeps the Unionist Party in power. Fianna Fáil want to keep themselves in power here, and the predictions are quite good. The best professors of political science we have got, acting in the most objective way possible, acting in a way that would stand up before any international gathering of political scientists, have predicted that Fianna Fáil will get 90 to 95 seats out of this, despite having the support of less than a majority of the voters. This is the reason the Minister is anxious to confuse the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In referring to the USA, he ignores the fact that in the primaries in the USA, the ordinary voters in the party get their chance of going into the booth and exercising their preference for a particular candidate, the very same preference as is exercised today by Irish voters. If an Irish voter wants to vote for Fianna Fáil in any constituency, he has at least three candidates <Col N="2600" /> from whom to select. He does not have to select the No. 1 candidate put forward by the Party but can make his choice. The Irish voter will exercise his choice in the same way in voting for Fine Gael candidates, having three candidates to select from in any of the constituencies. The Labour Party are also offering two or three candidates to be selected from in every constituency.  That is democracy in action, and it is what the Irish voter wants.</P>

I am showing the essential difference between the two, where the ordinary people make the choice and the Party bosses are kept somewhat in check. It seems to us that the ordinary Irish voters will get little help from the ballot paper as drafted and will therefore have to rely on the slogan which I hope every voter will take to heart, that is, oppose the dictatorship of the Party bosses and vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I have seldom listened to anything in this House more confusing than the speech to which we have just listened. We have had read out to us how the system was described in 1959, and we have before us how it is described today, that we substitute for the present system of voting the straight vote. We are led to understand that the ordinary voter does not know what is meant by &ldquo;the present system of voting&rdquo; but that he will know what is meant by a system of voting that is as being practised referred to elsewhere. It completely amazes me. The whole purpose of the irrelevancies in the last speech is to colour this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>By this means the Senator has indicated the motive behind this amendment. It is not a <i>bona fide</i> amendment designed to make things simpler and clearer. It is an amendment to give an opportunity for further remarks without sense or substance. Sometimes I wonder what really is the purpose of university education when I hear speeches like this. We are told that young men and young women go to the university to learn the truth and to follow the truth, come what may. They are instructed that before a person follows logic through to a conclusion, he should start from a correct premise. He should at least endeavour to find out what is the correct premise. Yet we have just been told a few moments ago that the straight vote has kept the Unionists in power in Northern Ireland. It would not have required very much research to disprove that. Proportional representation existed in Northern Ireland for nine years. Then it was changed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>A professor of political science in Cork University published a book &ldquo;Elections and Representation&rdquo;. He was the late Professor Hogan, a brother of the late Mr. Paddy Hogan, who was the first Minister for Agriculture in a Free State Government. One would imagine that a professor from Cork, speaking on a matter of this nature, before making such a statement, would at least take the trouble to check a book published by a professor of political science in his own college. I want to quote now from page 252 of that book:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, both systems have <Col N="2602" /> in turn been tried in Northern Ireland. The results make it clear that in fact the change-over from the proportional to the majority system in 1929 has not appreciably weakened the parliamentary position of the Nationalist minority. If as a result of the 1938 election the Nationalists were at a loss of three seats, these seats were rather given away than lost to the Unionists. Their loss was due to the differences between republicans and constitutionalists which in the constituencies of Mourne, South Armagh, and South Down led the Nationalists to boycott the elections, although they could certainly have gained these three seats as they did in 1933.</P>
    <P>Let us once and for all dispose of this fiction that the straight vote was introduced in Northern Ireland for the purpose of keeping anyone in power. Let us consider&mdash;and this should be the sole purpose of this discussion&mdash; whether the words now being used are clear and unambiguous to every voter. Nothing is added to their clarity, and they are not improved by adding in &ldquo;the present system of voting by PR as against the straight system of voting as used in Northern Ireland and Britain&rdquo;. There will not be more than five voters, if five, in the whole country who will ever have voted in Northern Ireland or England.</P>
    <P>The people understand the system under which they voted here for many years, and they understand what is meant by the straight vote. If Senator Quinlan does not think the term &ldquo;the straight vote&rdquo; is clear, it is rather strange that in the course of a very long speech here on Second Stage when we were discussing this matter, not on one occasion only, not on five occasions only, not on ten occasions only, but on at least 12 occasions which I picked out on a summary glance through his speech, he used the words &ldquo;the straight vote&rdquo;. He did this knowing full well that everyone present would fully appreciate what he meant, and knowing full well that if his words were published in the newspapers everyone would know what he meant. He did not say, &ldquo;the straight vote as used in Northern Ireland and Britain&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>First of all, I want to make it clear that contrary to what Senator Quinlan has been saying, it was not the Taoiseach who dealt with the Referendum Bill on the last occasion.  It was the Minister for Local Government. Of course, in any Fianna Fáil Government a Minister speaks for the Government as a whole. It is untrue, and Senator Quinlan knows it is untrue, to say that the Referendum Bill was dealt with in the Seanad by the Taoiseach.</P>

So far as Fianna Fáil Governments are concerned, there is no distinction between the Taoiseach and the Government. On a point of accuracy the Referendum Bill was dealt with by the Minister for Local Government.</P>

      <P>The summary put forward this time is an improvement on what was there the last time, not possibly an improvement as an accurate and detailed description of each of the two systems of election and representation which are involved, but an improvement from the point of view of clarity. It is put forward as a result of the experience at the last referendum and in deference to comments made before and after that referendum. There were complaints, and many complaints, before and after the last referendum. I <Col N="2604" /> want to quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 23rd June, 1959, some days after the referendum. It says:</P>
      <P>Even the educated had to study the ballot-paper very carefully in order to know he or she was making the correct entry as desired.</P>
      <P>It goes on:</P>
      <P>Had the ballot paper read: &ldquo;Do you favour the retention of the PR system?&rdquo; to which &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; would be the obvious answer, that would cover the whole matter, instead of making it an involved paper by introducing a second matter as to the &ldquo;straight vote system.&rdquo;  Had the question on the ballot paper even been, &ldquo;Do you favour the straight vote system,&rdquo; the same &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; would meet the matter. It must be conceded that the educated had to ponder over the ballot paper before they could see through its proper implication.</P>
      <P>Further on it says:</P>
      <P>It is a fact that persons voting were so confused by the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; as it had to be used that they were at sea even in the polling booths as to what to put down, and many questioned the presiding officers to explain the matter again. Explanations were made in the papers, but that was of little help to the thousands who either did not see the papers or did not sufficiently study its implication until they found themselves in the booth.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that to describe two separate systems of voting can result only in confusion and that the voter who does not devote much time to studying-the matter and, glancing at the voting paper and seeing a description of the type of proportional representation we have here, would, if he is that type of careless person, be inclined to think he was being asked to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; with regard to proportional representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator Quinlan's allegation that this is a slavish and crawling compliance with England and everything English, I think nobody has any doubts but that nobody in England asked us to make this change. On the <Col N="2605" /> other hand, it is a demonstrable fact that the whole Opposition campaign is directed by a British society. It is directed by what was described by the old Cumann na nGaedhael Party and the Fine Gael Party, in its earlier days, as a highly-subsidised British society. Every argument used by the Opposition has been promulgated in the newspapers by this British society which has already entered into by-election campaigns here on behalf of the Opposition Parties.</P>
    <P>The Opposition are now trying desperately to hang on to this British-imposed system of election in this country. Even they who so slavishly and crawlingly&mdash;to use Senator Quinlan's words&mdash;accepted the slavish and crawling dominion status imposed here by the 1922 Treaty objected, right up to 1959, as far as we know, to this system that was imposed here, as they said, on the principle of &ldquo;trying it out on the dog&rdquo;.</P>

The only Member of the British Government, at the time it was being imposed, whom I quoted was the Attorney General: I quoted him earlier on. This system which was imposed by the British on this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;was the only part of the imposition that was opposed by those who accepted the imposition &mdash;and, as far as we know, it was opposed by them right up to 1959. Certainly, it was opposed by the old <Col N="2606" /> Cumann na nGaedhael Party. Opposition to it was adopted as part of the programme of the new Fine Gael Party. They still maintained that attitude of opposition to this system in 1937 and they are on record as being still opposed to it in 1947. The first indication that they had changed their mind was in 1959 when Fianna Fáil proposed to do what Fine Gael had been advocating over the years. It is quite clear that they only decided to accept this part of the British imposition on this country in 1959 when Fianna Fáil came around eventually to their previous point of view.</P>
      <P>As I say, it is quite clear that the only effect of Senator Quinlan's amendments would be to confuse the issue, apart from the fact that they would delay. The necessity to go back to the Dáil with it would delay the putting of the proposition before the people and the only possible reason for that would be to confuse and delay. I am quite sure that that, in fact, is the intention behind it.</P>

I will put &ldquo;fair&rdquo; in inverted commas and pass on. Again, I appeal to the Minister to consider what we have said. I shall withdraw the amendments I have here if the Minister will, on Report Stage, bring in the agreed version of 1959 which we all claim to be immeasurably superior and to show more concern for the electorate, more concern for presenting the issues clearly and more concern for the English language than the present one.

      <P>Senator Quinlan says that the easiest way to describe a system is to say where it is operated. He makes no attempt, in his amendments, to indicate that the system that operates here operates nowhere else in the world. As Deputy Dillon said, no other National Parliament has been foolish enough to adopt it. Indeed, as Senator Quinlan knows, we did not adopt it. It was imposed from outside originally in 1919 by the British Parliament, and it was the one thing that was imposed in 1922 to which his colleagues objected. They consistently objected to it until such time as Fianna Fáil decided to comply with their wishes in 1959 and gave the people a chance of getting rid of this system which was bound to do the people harm eventually.  With regard to the question that this was referred to in glowing terms in 1937, I presume that since Senator Quinlan repeated the statement, I am at liberty to deal with it.</P>

      <P>At the same time, I am sure that it did not escape the Chair's notice that Senator Quinlan insisted on drawing this matter into this debate on these bogus amendments. In regard to the suggestion that the system we propose operates in Northern Ireland, it is a fact that the system we have here did operate in Northern Ireland and it is a fact that in the first election under the present system there the Nationalists' position was actually slightly improved as compared with the last election held under the system we have here at present. The position of the Nationalist section of the community in Northern Ireland as a permanent minority stems from different causes.

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that Senator Quinlan's only intention is to create as much confusion as possible. It must be quite clear that to describe the two systems in this short summary in the way they were described the last time could only result in confusion. I agree that the summary the last time was a more accurate description of the two systems if that was the purpose of the operation, but not every voter would go to the trouble of reading a summary of that length and digesting it and memorising it to the point that when he would go into the polling booth, he would know exactly what the question meant. The fact that at first glance the first thing to be seen is a description of the present system would indicate to the careless voter&mdash;and the majority of people do not study these things deeply&mdash;that it was a question of for or against proportional representation, <Col N="2612" /> for or against the present system. Therefore any confusion that could be caused would be to make people think they were being asked to vote for or against PR and the only substance in complaints made the last time could have been to that effect.</P>
      <P>The fact that Senator Quinlan wants people to be confused in that direction must be an indication that he as well as the rest of his colleagues in Fine Gael appreciate that the view of the Leader of the Fine Gael, and of those other members who see some prospect of instilling a bit of backbone into the Party at some time in the future, is beginning to gain ground and even within the Fine Gael Party, Senator Quinlan appreciates that the majority view is coming around to favour the proposal we are making. The only hope he sees then, is first, to delay the proposal coming before the people and secondly, to create as much confusion as possible in the ordinary voters' minds. The whole purpose of these amendments is clearly to try to confuse people. One more simple and clearer summary on this occasion is to ensure that the people will be as &ldquo;unconfused&rdquo; as possible.</P>

      <P>The Minister refers to bogus amendments but I have shown my good faith by offering to withdraw the amendments, if he will substitute the 1959 statement which he now goes on record as saying was a more accurate description of the two systems. Therefore the advances which have been made in education since 1959 apparently mean that the people are less able to read now than they were in 1959. What passed as an accurate description in 1959 is now held by the Minister to be too complicated.  Speaking as an Independent and <Col N="2613" /> as one who is happy to count as many friends in Fianna Fáil as in Fine Gael or Labour, I can assure the Minister that between now and when the referendum is held, I will do everything possible to see that the people are not confused and to see that the Minister's ruse of cutting down this summary to a despicable 1½ lines does not succeed. I think we can rest assured it will not succeed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The only amendments I see are to section 1; first, &lsquo;in page 3, line 38 before &ldquo;of&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;of proportional representation&rdquo;&rsquo; and secondly, &lsquo;in page 3, line 38, before &ldquo;in&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, as operated at present in Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo;.&rsquo; As far as I can understand, Senator Quinlan is now pretending that he has a proposed amendment to substitute the summary prescribed in the 1959 Bill; but, if that is so, I certainly have not seen it and I do not think any such amendment is, in fact, before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said the 1959 summary was a more accurate description of the two systems of voting and representation involved. Of course, it is; it is a more detailed description, but our proposition is put forward on this occasion in order to make it clearer to the average voter what it is he is being asked to do on the ballot paper; in other words, what &ldquo;yes&rdquo; means and what &ldquo;no&rdquo; means. The average voter will not go to the trouble of reading a long description, digesting it and memorising it between the time he reads it first and the time he goes to cast his vote. The complaints made in 1959 were not on behalf of voters who went to the trouble of studying the matter; they were made on behalf of what was alleged to be the average voter, who did not go to the trouble of studying the matter, who went in to the polling station with only a rough idea that he was going to vote in regard to the electoral system and who did not know, when he got the ballot paper, whether &ldquo;yes&rdquo; meant that he was for the present system or for the proposed system. The summary we propose now makes it as clear as possible that the question asked is whether the voter is in favour of substituting for the present system the straight vote system in single-seat constituencies. <Col N="2614" />  It could not be put any more clearly and, very obviously, Senator Quinlan is trying to make it as unclear and as confused as possible for the average voter who will not take the trouble to study the question deeply.</P>

      <P>The Minister is quite right; there are only two amendments, but surely the Minister knows enough at this stage about parliamentary procedure to appreciate that my offer to withdraw this at this stage was made, provided the Minister would accept the 1959 form on Report Stage, which is the parliamentary way in which such substitutions are made. I propose now to withdraw my amendments and to table on Report Stage, in deference to the Minister and in the hope of getting agreement on it, the 1959 format.</P>

    <P>3. 1º A Constituency Commission shall be established from time to time, but not less frequently than once in every twelve years.</P>
    <P>2º A Constituency Commission shall consist of seven members appointed by Dáil Éireann, of whom one (who shall be the Chairman of the Commission) shall be appointed from the judges of the Supreme <Col N="2624" /> Court and High Court on the nomination of the Chief Justice, three shall be appointed from the members of Dáil Éireann on the nomination of the Taoiseach and three shall be appointed, from such members of Dáil Éireann as are determined in accordance with law to be in opposition, on nomination provided for by law by members so determined.</P>
    <P>3º Any member of a Constituency Commission may resign from office by placing his resignation in the hands of the Chairman of Dáil Éireann.</P>

    <P>7. Subject to the provisions of this Article, any matter whatsoever relating to Constituency Commissions or constituencies may be provided for by law.</P>
    <P>8. Until the date of the dissolution of Dáil Éireann occurring next after the 15th day of April, 1970, or occurring next after such earlier date as may be determined by a resolution passed by Dáil Éireann. Dáil Éireann shall be composed of members who represent the constituencies determined by the law in force on the 1st day of January, 1968, and all elections for membership of Dáil Éireann, including the filling of casual vacancies, shall take place in accordance with that law.</P>
    <P>9. The foregoing provisions of this Article from sub-article 3 to this sub-article inclusive shall be omitted from every official text of the Constitution if a Bill entitled &ldquo;An Act to Amend the Constitution&rdquo; and referred to as the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968 is passed by the people.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to <Col N="2626" /> put into the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968, which is the Bill which permits deviation from the national average of population when considering constituencies, provisions to enable a Constituency Commission to be established in the event that the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968, is not passed.</P>
    <P>In this amendment we are providing that a Constituency Commission shall be established from time to time, but not less frequently than once in every 12-year period, comprised of a judge of the Supreme Court to be nominated by the Chief Justice, three Members of the Dáil to be nominated by the Taoiseach and three Members of the Dáil to be nominated by law. It makes further provision as to the manner in which the Commission will go about their functions, the compilation of their report, the eventual laying of it before Dáil Éireann and the giving of power to Dáil Éireann to amend the report within a stated period.</P>
    <P>In the latter part, in Article 9, it is stated that the foregoing provisions of the Article, from sub-Article 3, shall be omitted from every official text of the Constitution, if the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968 is passed. The Minister has been talking about being fair to the public and being clear. While we may forecast what the will of the population is, we want to anticipate a decision now by deciding that we will have a Commission in another Bill, but that we will not put the provision in another Bill if the population should choose to pass one Bill and not the other.</P>
    <P>If it is right and proper to have a Commission, and if the Government believe it is right and proper to have a Commission to draw constituency boundaries if both Bills are passed, it is equally correct and indeed necessary, or not less necessary, to have a Commission if the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, the PR Bill, is rejected and the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill is passed. It is worthy of note that the Committee which reported on the Constitution, an all-Party Committee, held the view that there should be a Commission <Col N="2627" /> appointed to delimit constituency boundaries; and though the Minister may make great play of the fact that the idea of a Commission was opposed on the last occasion, it is correct to say that every line and provision of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1959, was opposed and that every line and provision of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968, and of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1968, are also being opposed.</P>
    <P>However, in view of the large discretion now being provided in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, and the wide variation, which the Minister chooses to call tolerance, being provided for, it is highly necessary that the work of drawing up constituency boundaries, with this new mechanism and this greater degree of flexibility and greater power for gerrymandering of constituencies, should be done by a Commission which will consist of a judge of the Supreme Court nominated by the Chief Justice, and six Members of Parliament, with the ultimate power resting in Dáil Éireann to determine finally what the constituency boundaries shall be.</P>
    <P>The amendment now before the House is substantially the same as the provisions in the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill in relation to the Commission. Because one does not want to clutter up the Constitution with unnecessary material, the device adopted in section 52 of the transitory provisions of the 1937 Constitution is being incorporated here so that in the event of the Fourth Amendment being passed there will not be two Commissions doing exactly the same work and reproduced twice in the official texts of the Constitution afterwards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. K. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, on the statement of Senator O'Quigley that we are proposing in this Bill that there should be a large amount of discretion available to the Oireachtas which would devise constituencies if a Commission were not provided for and if the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution Bill is not passed, I wish to point out, as I <Col N="2628" /> have done already, that the proposal we have as to the maximum divergence that should be permitted is very restrictive by comparison with any other democracy we know of. I do not know of any place in which there is a requirement such as exists in our Constitution, as it has been interpreted by the High Court, to try to have exact mathematical parity of population per Deputy in every constituency.</P>
      <P>The proposal we have here is for a small amount of divergence from the national average, to be exercised in very clearly defined circumstances. It is much smaller than in any democracy of which we know. It is not a large divergence but a particularly small and restricted one.</P>
      <P>On the suggestion that the proposal gives excessive power for gerrymandering to the Minister, I must once again ask the Opposition in which conditions is there more scope for an evil-minded Minister to introduce gerrymandering &mdash;if the basic knowledge were available&mdash;in the matter of revising constituencies&mdash;: in circumstances in which it is laid down that this divergence can only be utilised in order to try to respect county boundaries or in circumstances in which these are held to be irrelevant which is the position that exists at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clearly laid down in the judgment of the High Court that matters such as administrative boundaries are irrelevant and that the only question to be taken into account in deciding what is practicable is, in fact, the detail in which information with regard to the distribution of population is available in the census report. It is these circumstances that require the detachment from some counties of a part of the population and their addition to other counties&mdash;it is there that scope for gerrymandering, if the knowledge is available, arises because it is there that a selection can be made as to the areas to be detached from one county and attached to another. In circumstances where you are required by the Constitution to adhere, as far as possible, to county boundaries, then obviously the scope for gerrymandering must be much less and a revision of constituencies <Col N="2629" /> that does not comply with the Constitutional requirements could, of course, be challenged in the courts.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that under what is proposed in this Bill the scope for gerrymandering will in fact be less but in suggesting that there will be that scope available to the Minister, the Senator is, of course, assuming that one of these proposals is going to be passed and one is going to be rejected, which of course is a completely unlikely thing to happen since the Opposition are campaigning against both of the proposals and we are campaigning for both. It seems likely then that either both will be passed or both will be rejected.</P>
    <P>I pointed out before that when it was decided, in order to please the Opposition, to separate our proposal for electoral reform into two separate propositions, it became necessary to make a decision as to which of these proposals would contain the provision for a Constituency Commission because it was not possible to put it into both. In making a decision as to which Bill to put the provision for the Constituency Commission into, I think we made the proper decision because what we propose in the Third Amendment Bill is no more than a return to the conditions that existed up to 1959 or the conditions that were believed to exist up to 1959. It is obvious that in a revision of constituencies carried out if that Bill is passed and the other not passed, there will only be minor adjustments necessary in constituencies, whereas if the Fourth Amendment Bill is passed, then there must be a complete recasting of the whole system of Dáil representation. You must start from scratch and establish 144 completely new constituencies. If this knowledge of the voting pattern of the people in different parts of the country, both at past elections and at future elections is available, it is in circumstances where you can start from scratch and divide up the whole country into 144 constituencies that the scope for the exercise of gerrymandering occurs. Therefore I think if the Commission is a safeguard against that type of operation, then it is of more value in the Fourth Amendment Bill <Col N="2630" /> than in the Third Amendment but in actual fact it is likely that either both Bills will be passed or neither will be passed.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes to insert in the Schedule to the Third Amendment Bill the provisions of the Fourth Amendment Bill relating to the Constituency Commission, except section 8.2º, and with the addition of a new section 9, providing for the omission of the provisions from every official text of the Constitution if the Fourth Amendment is passed by the people.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out last week, I have been legally advised that there is no way in which the proposals for a Constituency Commission can be inserted into both Bills. It is quite clear that it would not be possible simply to duplicate these provisions in the Third Bill and then submit both Bills simultaneously to the people, because if, as seems likely, both Bills were either approved or rejected&mdash;and I think it is likely that both of them will be approved&mdash;consequently, if they are approved by the people, they must be promulgated by the President as law, and then there would be two sets of provisions dealing with a Constituency Commission.</P>
    <P>Duplication in any circumstances is bad in law. It is especially so where the provisions involved relate to the establishment of a body such as this. Only one Commission can be established for a particular purpose such as determining the constituencies and duplication of the provisions relating to it would, at the very least, cause uncertainty and ambiguity. As a form of drafting, duplication would not only be wrong; it would also be inelegant and most inappropriate in the fundamental law of the State.</P>
    <P>This amendment purports to get over the difficulties by providing that the Constituency Commission provisions of the Third Amendment Bill should be omitted from every official text of the Constitution if the Fourth Amendment Bill is passed. If the purpose and effect of the amendment is to secure that the set of provisions proposed to be inserted in the Third Amendment Bill would, on the enactment of the two <Col N="2631" /> Bills, not be included in the revised official text of the Constitution then, I am advised, the resulting position would still be that two duplicate sets of provisions relating to Constituency Commissions would be in force. This situation could not, of course, be permitted to arise. Of course the two sets of provisions would not be exact duplicates either because the proposed new set provides for a two-thirds majority in the Dáil to amend a Commission's report and this would only cause even more confusion and uncertainty because the provision in the Fourth Amendment is for a simple majority of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>On the other hand if the purpose and effect of the amendment is to secure that, if both Bills are approved, only one of the duplicate sets of provisions will come into force, I am legally advised that the procedure proposed would not be in accordance with Article 47 of the Constitution. Article 47 speaks of the votes at a referendum being cast in favour of the enactment into law of a proposal to amend the Constitution while Article 46 requires the President upon his being satisfied that such a proposal has been approved by the people, to promulgate it into law. It is clear, therefore, that any proposal for the amendment of the Constitution which is submitted to the people at a referendum must be a definite one and one which is unqualified in its terms; it must not be a hypothetical or alternative one. Furthermore, any approval given by the people to such a proposal must be a definite and not a conditional one. If the proposal is approved, it becomes part of the Constitution and must come into force as such. The legal advice which is available to me is, accordingly, to the effect that it would not be possible, within the terms of Articles 46 and 47 to submit to the people a proposal to amend the Constitution which would not, in certain circumstances, come into force. It must be a definite proposal which must become part of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The amendment now proposed is apparently based on Article 52.2 of the Constitution which provided for the omission from the official text of the <Col N="2632" /> Constitution of certain Transitory Provisions&mdash;Articles 52 to 63 inclusive. The provisions of these Articles, however, continue to have the force of law and their omission is merely an attempt to tidy-up modern copies of the Constitution by not including provisions which were concerned solely with the transition from the pre-1937 institutions to those established by the Constitution. It would, of course, be an entirely different matter to provide that provisions enacted into law by the votes of the people, and fully relevant in the present day should be omitted from a revised official text.</P>
    <P>I think I have shown that whatever the approach, there is no legal way in which the objective of the farmers of the present amendment could be met. That, at any rate, is the import of the legal advice available to me and as I do not profess to be a Constitutional lawyer, I intend to abide by the advice I have got in this matter. Apart from that there are a number of defects in the amendment. It does not, for example, provide for the re-numbering of the existing sections 3 to 7 of Article 16 as is done in section 1 (g) of the Fourth Amendment Bill. Again, it provides, incorrectly, I am advised, for the inclusion in the Third Amendment Bill of a similar provision to section 8.10 of the Schedule to the Fourth Amendment Bill. Furthermore, if the Fourth Amendment is not passed the proposed section 9 of the Third Amendment Bill would become part of the Constitution and would of course appear silly in view of the fact that the Fourth Amendment had not been passed.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley says that the Committee on the Constitution wanted a Commission to be established and as I made clear, we proposed to establish a Commission. We intended originally to have only one proposal and to include a Constituency Commission. It was not our decision to separate this into two proposals. That was done to suit the Opposition. When the decision was made to have two propositions, as I said, we had to decide into which Bill we should put this proposal for a Constituency Commission. A Commission is being provided for in the only <Col N="2633" /> way in which it is possible to do it. When a selection had to be made we chose the Bill which makes the more fundamental change and gives the more scope for gerrymandering if this detailed information on voting habits is in fact available. I maintain it is not. Apart from that, as I pointed out before, we had no reason to believe that this Constituency Commission would be considered of such importance by the Opposition on this occasion.  In 1959 the Opposition did not want a Constituency Commission at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There was opposition to a Constituency Commission and quite apart from the general opposition to the whole proposal. In fact, at the time, Fine Gael deliberately put down an amendment to delete the Constituency Commission from the Bill and argued in both Houses of the Oireachtas that a Constituency Commission was not necessary or desirable but that the desirable thing was that the Minister for Local Government at the time the revision was being made should take responsibility in both Houses of the Oireachtas, with the press looking on, for the revision and defend it in both Houses of the Oireachtas. That was the attitude taken and we had no reason to believe that in the short space of nine years the Opposition's mind would have so changed that they would now want not only one Constituency Commission but two. After all, before this Bill was introduced we were already told it was unreasonable to believe that it was possible that the people, or a small fraction of the people&mdash;only 1½ per cent of the voters &mdash;would have changed their minds and now we find that the two political Parties opposite who were opposed to the whole idea of a Constituency Commission changed their minds on this matter in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly on the last occasion when the provision in the Bill was that it would take a two-thirds majority to establish a Constituency Commission, that was also objected to. They wanted a simple majority and this time we <Col N="2634" /> proposed a simple majority and they are not in favour of that either.</P>
    <P>This whole debate seems to me to be purely academic. The Opposition are opposing both proposals. We are sponsoring both proposals so it seems that either both will be passed or both rejected. If the Opposition have their way we will not have a Constituency Commission provided in the Constitution.  If we have our way we will.</P>

      <P>It may be only a form of words, a kind of phrase, the Minister has got into the habit of using or it may be something more serious that is amiss but the Minister for Local Government ought not to use the phrase &ldquo;to please the Opposition&rdquo; that they do so-and-so, or &ldquo;to suit the Opposition&rdquo; that they do so-and-so because the Minister for Local Government would not turn his hand to suit or please the Opposition if there was as little as that involved. If he really believed that it was to suit the Opposition, he is suffering from some sort of delusion. If he is out to do good to the Opposition, he is suffering from a delusion that not alone would he be the great saver of the Fianna Fáil Party but he would also have credit for installing a Fine Gael Party in office. This is the kind of schizophrenic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I find it difficult to refrain from making some comment on the Minister's phrase that he has done various things &ldquo;to please the Opposition&rdquo;.  This is perhaps a manner of speaking but we all know the last thing the Minister wishes is to please the Opposition. What I object to is the Minister talking like a lawyer instead of talking like a legislator. I objected <Col N="2635" /> before to adopting a legalistic approach to matters of this kind. The plain truth of the matter is that the people of this country can do anything they like on any amendment of the Constitution. Whatever they do becomes the law. They are the final arbiters on what is in the Constitution or what is not there. If they decide to have three Constituency Commissions in one Bill, that becomes law, whether purists like it or not. If they want to do it, they can and, therefore, if they want to put in two Constituency Commissions into the Constitution and they want one contingent on one being passed, they can do that. There is nothing to prevent a sovereign people from doing that and all this talk about ending up with two Commissions instead of one is all nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister wants to insist on putting a proper Bill to the people, we could have this Bill prepared in such a way that there would be no difficulty about it and there would be nothing to which even a theorist in legal matters would object. The position is that the Minister now says&mdash;and again I cannot see how he can bring himself to say something that he knows is not so &mdash;that what we want is two Commissions.  We want one if the two Bills will be passed: we want one Commission. The amendment I introduced on Report Stage is to provide that the Commission I am proposing will drop in the event of the Fourth Amendment being passed. This is for the purpose of providing for only one Commission when the full text of the Constitution is written, for the purpose of keeping the Constitution up to date. The Minister chooses to say we want two Commissions.  We do not. The fact that the second Commission will drop out if both Bills are not passed means that we will not have two Commissions, but one only. We are not as stupid and silly as that. We do not want to clutter up the Constitution with unnecessary verbiage. Of course, it is correct to say that every device was adopted in 1959 to prevent the 1959 Amendment to the Constitution being passed. The fact that we are now proposing this amendment does not for a moment mean we <Col N="2636" /> want the Third Amendment to the Constitution to be passed. I do not believe either Bill will be passed. The Minister thinks both will be passed but that is a matter to be resolved in the future. The Minister uses the argument that no other democracy he knows of has provisions as restrictive in relation to deviation from the national average in the matter of population to constituencies as are contained in this Bill. As far as I am concerned, I do not care a fiddle-de-dee what any democracy has in its Constitution.  That is their business. I do not care what licensing laws they have and I do not care what their road traffic laws are. That is for them and not a matter for us.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the well-being of this country and the well-being of the Irish people and I am concerned to ensure that Fianna Fáil proposals will not be adopted and that Fianna Fáil will not get their way to gerrymander the constituencies in the way that will ensure that they will get most use out of their declining vote. The Minister comes in here on the basis that the Fianna Fáil Party would never think of self-interest. Senator Nash and other Senators are annoyed when you suggest that Fianna Fáil are all the time out for their own ends and that they want this Third Amendment to the Constitution for the purpose of giving themselves the greatest possible room for manoeuvre in the event of their losing on the straight vote without any Constituency Commission hindering them if the Third Amendment to the Constitution Bill is passed. One would imagine they spent all their time thinking about what is absolutely right and proper and that there is never any self-interest or self-gain for Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The Minister should drop that mask and give up that pretence which certainly is not amusing at this stage. It certainly is not fact and every Fianna Fáil Senator knows that in any matter relating to those Bills they are certainly for the well-being of the Fianna Fáil Party and they justify their conscience by saying: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil interests are the interests of the nation&rdquo;. This is the way they justify their conscience but <Col N="2637" /> we have only to look at the record to see how untrue that idea is and how self-delusory is that view of Fianna Fáil. I am asking in this particular amendment that we take account of the fact that the people are able to choose. They might very well accept the Third Amendment Bill and reject the Fourth Amendment Bill. That is a possibility but it is a possibility the Minister does not see.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment standing in my name and that of Senator McHugh:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;To&rdquo; in line 37, down to and including &ldquo;constituencies&rdquo; in line 39, and substitute:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To abolish the system of proportional representation and to adopt, instead, a system of single-member constituencies, each voter having a single non-transferable vote.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am making one last effort on Report Stage to get the Minister to accept the formula agreed on by all Parties on the occasion of the last referendum. I quote from the debate in Seanad Éireann, which took less than one hour. In introducing the Bill, the then Minister for Local Government stated, at column 1352:</P>
      <P>It was found possible to secure the agreement of all Parties in the Dáil to a statement containing a summary of the principal proposals in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958, and it is proposed in section 5 to incorporate this statement in the polling cards to be issued by local returning officers to voters, including postal voters, at a referendum in relation to that Bill.</P>
      <P>That was by agreement. At column 1358, the then Minister for Local Government, Mr. Blaney, went on to say:</P>
      <P>We were not forced into it, and while I pay tribute to the Opposition in the Dáil for their ready agreement and co-operation in this matter, it should not go on the record of this House that we on the Government side were brought to that position by the Opposition.</P>
      <P>Senator McGuire interrupted to say:</P>
      <P>There was good co-operation?</P>
      <P>Mr. Blaney said:</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2641" /> That was the situation the last time. It is sad to think that things have deteriorated so much since then that the Parties could not be got to combine on a formula that would present the substance of the referendum to the voters in a fair and objective manner. The present Minister for Local Government turns his back on what had been done by his predecessor. In fact, the formula worked out on the last occasion has been derided, especially by Senator Yeats, who said it was to &ldquo;bemuse and bedazzle&rdquo;. That was a formula worked out by all Parties. I was attacked in a rather personal manner across the House this afternoon for daring to try to bring the Parties back to that situation and for daring to point out the unfairness in the situation where the name &ldquo;proportional representation&rdquo; is very carefully concealed from the public and where &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo; in inverted commas is introduced for the first time. The last Bill did not have this.</P>
    <P>Now I am proposing that we should delete subsection (1) and replace it by what was agreed on to represent the change proposed in 1959. The agreement is to abolish the system of proportional representation&mdash;&ldquo;abolish&rdquo; is a much more expressive word than what is here &ldquo;to substitute for&rdquo;; we should call a spade a spade and what you are doing is abolishing&mdash;and adopt instead a system of single-member constituencies, each voter having a single, non-transferable vote. In other words, it says what the system is. It gives the two essential features of what is proposed, the single-seat constituency and the single, non-transferable vote. Why can we not behave as ordinary, educated politicians and put into this what was agreed in 1959, what explains precisely what is in the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution in the same terminology as was used at that time and get back to the agreement that prevailed in 1959? It is essential that in presenting a matter to the electorate by way of a referendum there should be an impartial approach. I suggest that the present summary does not have that; I suggest the 1959 one did. Therefore, I call on the House to support me in appealing to the Minister not to turn his back on what was <Col N="2642" /> agreed in 1959, to meet us in this way and ensure that the voters will be consulted fairly and objectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment does not mention whether the proposal is in connection with Dáil, Seanad or Presidential elections. Apart from that, it is quite clear that it would have no real effect except to delay submitting the proposition to the people and possibly to confuse them. This, in fact, is all that is intended. I must ask Senator Quinlan, do the people in fact know what the present system is or do they not? If they know the present system, then it is unnecessary to clutter up the voter's card with words to describe the present electoral system. I can see no reason for this except to confuse the people.</P>
      <P>It was alleged that on the last occasion the people were confused, that the two different systems of voting and representation were described in the summary and that some people were confused as a result and did not know whether to vote for or against PR or for or against single-member constituencies.  I think the proposed summary on this occasion is much clearer to the person who is not prepared to read and study a more involved statement. The only change suggested in regard to the description of the proposed system is, of course, intended to disguise it from the people who would be presented with a description of the proposed system which they have not heard up to this.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinlan says that this is the formula that was agreed on in the last Bill. Of course it does not even remotely approach the formula that was in the 1959 Bill which was:</P>
      <P>At present, Members of Dáil Éireann are elected on a system of proportional representation for constituencies returning at least three members, each voter having a single transferable vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed in the Bill to abolish the system of proportional representation and to adopt, instead, a system of single-member constituencies, <Col N="2643" /> each voter having a single non-transferable vote.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed in the Bill to set up a commission for the determination and revision of the constituencies, instead of having this done by the Oireachtas, as at present.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan says that this is the same as &ldquo;to abolish the system of proportional representation and to adopt instead a system of single-member constituencies, each voter having a single non-transferable vote&rdquo; without even referring to the fact of whether it is for Dáil elections. There is no real similarity between what Senator Quinlan proposes and what was there in 1959. At this late stage in the discussion of this matter, Senator Quinlan seriously, apparently, asks me to believe that because this was agreed on in 1959, it would be reasonable to assume that it would be agreed on now in 1968. He asks me apparently to believe that this is one thing the Opposition would have agreed on if it had been put forward in this Referendum Bill, although on every other detail on which we tried to interpret the minds of the Opposition and comply with their desires, we found that their opinions had changed to the diametrically opposite point of view.</P>
    <P>For instance, the proposal in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill was clearly in response to the demands of Opposition Deputies and Senators. We find on this occasion that they have completely changed their minds. Similarly, in regard to the provisions for the Constituency Commission, the provisions in 1959 were opposed by way of amendment designed to remove all reference to a Constituency Commission from the Bill. We found that their attitude was that if there was to be provision for a Constituency Commission, its report should be amended by a simple majority rather than a two-thirds majority. On this occasion we find so far from not wanting a Constituency Commission, they want two&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this Referendum Bill was introduced in the Dáil, I had already discovered that the Opposition had changed their minds on practically every detail since 1959 and it was quite clear that their attitude on this occasion was to oppose everything proposed by Fianna Fáil, and if we had proposed that this should be the summary, we knew in advance what the Opposition arguments would be against it because they were made on the last occasion&mdash;that it confused the voters and that the normal voter who does not pay very detailed attention to political discussions would not know when he went to vote whether he was to vote for or against proportional representation or for or against the proposed system. These arguments were made on the last occasion and it appeared to us likely that they would be made on this occasion also. There is no doubt whatever that if we had proposed that the summary should be the same on this occasion, these arguments would have been made against it. The only mistake we made is that we tried to please the Opposition while we should have known that is not possible. In fact, they do not want to be pleased.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that the only objective in this operation of Senator Quinlan's is to try to get an amendment of some kind accepted here, an amendment of no importance, which he knows is no improvement, the only idea behind it being to delay bringing this matter before the people in the hope that something will happen to change the present trend of opinion, in the Fine Gael Party in particular, which is towards the opinion of the Leader of that Party.</P>

      <P>I might have realised that it was futile to try to bring back the Minister to even the <Col N="2645" /> small measure of agreement that was obtained in 1959. It is a poor tribute to the Minister that he is incapable of beginning to achieve even the agreement Deputy Blaney was able to get. It is a pity that the practice on the last occasion of having an agreed summary was departed from. It throws a very sinister light on the Government's attitude on consulting the people. It shows the people are not being consulted in a reasonable way. This is just an effort to get rid of PR and hoodwink our people into doing that.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt whatever what the vote of the people will be and that they will overwhelmingly reject this effort to instal Party dictatorship.  I would not be a party to delaying this question going to the people. There is no substance in the Minister's claim that we are trying to delay the issue, any more than there is substance in his claim that I believed he was going to agree to any of our amendments. But we had to show the reason of our amendments. We shall leave it for students of political science reading those debates in the future to judge the reasonableness of our amendments and their motives. We will commit our motives and reasons to history and I face the verdict on what I said in these debates with far more confidence than the Minister can face the verdict on some of the rather puerile objections he has raised against our efforts to behave as members of a democratic assembly, discharging our duties as democrats in this matter, and discharging our duties as democrats in Seanad Éireann. I have no option but to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I just wish to reply to Senator Quinlan's allegation that there was no attempt made to meet the Opposition's viewpoint. I accepted a number of amendments in the Dáil on this Bill and on the other Bills as well. I think it is quite clear that throughout this whole operation there has been every effort made to meet the wishes of the Opposition, but as I have shown it just is not possible to discover what their wishes are. In fact they do not know themselves; in order to decide their attitude to the whole proposal they had to have an all-night session which finished up, as we know, in a very closely contested vote of confidence in the Leader of the main Opposition Party. The fact is clear that the whole purpose of this operation was an attempt to meet the wishes that were expressed here by the Opposition Parties in regard to what resulted from the interpretation by the High Court of a provision of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I want to make it entirely clear on behalf of the Fine <Col N="2647" /> Gael Party that our view is irrevocably and unmistakably that these Bills should not pass now and we hope they will not be passed by the people. That certainly would be our recommendation to the people when these Bills are put before them in the referendum.</P>
      <P>There are certain matters which one would like to deal with in this debate on the Final Stage of these Bills, but I have no intention of tracking down every charge that has been made and dealing with it at great length in the manner the Minister has adopted for his own reasons in the debate on these Bills. However, I want to make it clear that if the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Government wanted at any time to know what the Opposition's view was upon any matter, there is a simple means of communication which has been known for a long time&mdash;a letter; in modern times, there is the telephone; and in the more sophisticated parliamentary system we have, there is such a thing as the Whips. That is the way in which parliamentary Parties communicate with one another and in which agreement on various matters is achieved. When the Minister talks about wanting to please the Fine Gael Party and to meet their views and so on, he is endeavouring to be funny, but he is in fact only being very boring. I do wish he would stop it, but I do not think he is capable of preventing himself because being a bore seems to be a congenital condition.</P>

      <P>I am talking about what he said on the Second Stage and <i>ad nauseam</i> since then. The reason I suggest to the House we ought not to give the final reading to these Bills is that there has never been any demand from anybody for them. There has been no demand since 1959 from any public bodies; there has been no demand from TDs. I have never read, from 1959 down to the time this report was published, any criticism of the Constitution in relation to the limiting of boundaries or any criticism of proportional representation. The reason is <Col N="2648" /> simple and obvious: the Fianna Fáil Party do not like talking about or reminding themselves of the defeat which they suffered in 1959 or reminding the people they suffered that defeat. There is, of course, one demand, the organised spontaneous demand at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis. That is the same kind of thing you get at the Supreme Soviet when it assembles. There are certain things put down and everybody knows in advance they are going to be accepted. That is what happens at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis.</P>

      <P>The second point is that if the Government were concerned with amending the fundamental law of this country and if they wanted to get the maximum support behind reasonable proposals, they would have had consultations in advance. They would have published a White Paper; they would have put forward their proposals and invited discussion on them. If they wanted to get majority opinion in favour of a change in our fundamental law, they would have come to the other Parties in the Dáil and consulted with them. They did not do that, and they did not do it because they knew their proposals would not meet with a favourable response. They knew also that the reason they were embarking upon these proposals was not for the purpose of improving the Constitution or improving our organisation of public affairs but solely for the purpose of Party advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the benefit of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Minister will continue to propagate the untruth that this Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill is a necessary consequence of the High <Col N="2649" /> Court action which was taken by Senator O'Donovan in 1959 or 1960. He will continue to say that, and he will be wrong in that, as he is in saying that that action was brought by the Fine Gael Party. I want to repeat once again it was not brought by the Fine Gael Party, or financed by them in any way. Moreover, the Minister referred to the fact that there was a Fine Gael solicitor, as there was, a Fine Gael senior counsel, as there was, and a Fine Gael barrister, but he omitted to refer to the fact that there were two other counsel who were not of the Fine Gael Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and Mr. T.J. Conolly, senior counsel, who is not a member of the Fine Gael Party. The Minister wants to justify his own argument.  He is wrong and he knows he is wrong, but he will continue to repeat that mis-statement notwithstanding correction.  He will continue to say things he knows to be untrue. I am telling him that this action was not taken by the Fine Gael Party and that the consent of the Party was not sought for it. It was taken by the then Senator John O'Donovan, now Professor O'Donovan, on his own initiative, and financed by himself. It was taken at his own considerable risk of being penalised on costs as we saw subsequently when another citizen of the State brought an action and the Attorney General of the day sought costs against that individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has a fetish about crossing borders and breaching county boundaries. He has a neurotic approach which I am quite certain is not the approach of those people who found themselves in constituencies outside <Col N="2650" /> their own counties as a result of the revision of the constituencies in 1961 or 1962. The geography of this country is such that there are towns and villages and hamlets which straddle the county boundaries. I have never heard any complaints that people have suffered a grave injustice, to use the Minister's mis-description, because they found themselves in this position.</P>
    <P>On the contrary, I think that where constituencies straddle two counties, or where towns straddle two constituencies, the people have the best of both worlds because when the inhabitants of those towns want anything done they can call upon the Deputies in both constituencies to help them. I cannot see to what difficulties that gives rise. It may have some temporary effect upon the local sentiment of people who want to remain in their own county, but I have never heard any large volume of complaints from people because they find themselves in constituencies different from their ordinary administrative counties.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the Fianna Fáil Government without any compulsion or any High Court action, broke into county after county in 1935 and attached parts of some counties to other constituencies. There was no High Court action and there was no British Government. There was nothing but the Fianna Fáil Government who were trying to redeem the promise they made to reduce the number of seats from 153 to 100. This brought about the dismemberment of many counties. Like other promises they made they did not fulfil their promise and ended not with 100 seats but with 136. In those days the Fianna Fáil Party saw nothing wrong with that. They did not think they were creating the alleged injustice about which the Minister spoke so eloquently and in such an impassioned manner in this debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister also tried to assert that the administrative counties could not be taken into consideration according to the High Court in framing the constituencies.  He said that knowing very well that the Supreme Court in their judgment and decision upon the Electoral Act subsequent to the Act <Col N="2651" /> which was set aside in the O'Donovan action said that such matters as boundaries, rivers, lakes and physical features could be taken into consideration.  The Supreme Court held that, even thought under the last revision of the constituencies there was not exact parity between all the constituencies, nevertheless, a deviation from the national average was permissible. They did not say&mdash;because it was not their function and because they were not asked&mdash;what the deviation should be. They made it quite clear in their decision&mdash;I will not quote it because I have already given it&mdash;that the county boundaries could be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>It is dangerous to foster the notion that the physical convenience of Deputies is of paramount importance, or of such a degree of importance as to warrant a change in the Constitution.  I regard the paramount function of Deputies of Dáil Éireann not as attending to the trivia of public affairs but as being engaged in the solid work of dealing with the economic and social condition of the people and devoting their time and energies to appraising plans prepared by the Government, formulating their own plans, bringing to the notice of the Government various matters which, in their opinion, require to be taken into consideration in framing schemes and formulating legislation.</P>
    <P>Those are the things that matter, not writing letters to the Department of Local Government or the Department of Social Welfare knowing well, as happens probably in the majority of cases, that the letter will have no effect whatever upon the ultimate decision of the Minister or the local authority concerned. They send out a copy of the letter they receive from the Minister to indicate that they are working on behalf of their constituents. It was admitted by some Senators here that that work is utterly useless. That is not the real function of Deputies and it is not the real function of Senators either. Their function is to appraise Government measures, to stimulate the Government into action, and to help the Government and their colleagues in <Col N="2652" /> the Dáil to bring into effect the kind of measures which will make this a better country in which to live.</P>
    <P>That is the primary purpose for which people elect Deuties&mdash;not to act as a kind of political crutch to get them jobs, grants or a whole lot of things which the people themselves and the Deputies themselves very frequently know their supplicants are not entitled to. That is the kind of pretence that may delude people into thinking that a particular Deputy is a great Deputy and that he will never let you down. We all know that goes on. But that kind of work or activity does not improve the economic or social conditions of this country in the slightest degree. It does help&mdash;and it is the mainspring of that activity&mdash;to have such a Deputy returned with a high poll at election time.</P>
    <P>Another reason it is dangerous to permit this kind of notion to get abroad&mdash;that Deputies are there to attend to these trivia of public life&mdash;is that that will encourage the continuance of inefficiency in administration at both central and local level. There are numerous cases in which, because of inefficiency and lack of communication on the part of central government officials, local government officials, officials in Bord Fáilte, officials in the ESB and other public servants, people do not get their rights. I believe it to be the duty of the Government and of Deputies to rectify that situation. God knows, we employ and pay enough public servants&mdash;and pay them sufficiently well&mdash;to ensure that the public, whom they are intended to serve, are properly served. However, there is no indication at all on the part of the Minister or of his Government of any intention to improve efficiency in the public service. They have established a commission to inquire into the civil service. By the time that commission reports, and by the time the report has been considered by the Department of Finance and has been examined by all the other Government Departments, the report will have been out of date for five or ten years. We know what happens to all of these commissions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2653" /> The only basis on which the Minister says he requires these smaller constituencies&mdash;and why there must be greater representation, if you please, for the people of the western counties &mdash;is that it is necessary for people to keep in touch with their Deputies&mdash;to have the Deputies continue to pretend that they are doing the kinds of things which are productive of nothing. That is the Minister's proposal. In my view, it is a most pernicious proposal and idea that that state of affairs should be encouraged to continue over the coming years.</P>
    <P>In relation to this Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, while the Minister, with one hand, says he is for the principle of one man, one vote, and that his Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill is designed to achieve that end, he says the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill is not designed for that purpose. The record is against him on that because, on the Second Reading in this House, he expressed the hope that the alterations and changes proposed in the Bill would bring about an endorsement by the Seanad&mdash;and, of course, by the people&mdash;of the principle of one man, one vote, and that this was one of the effects of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.</P>
    <P>We say that the principle which must be guarded and safeguarded is the principle of one man, one vote. You are not having one man, one vote if 16,000 of a population in one area is as good as 23,000 in another area. That is what the proposal is intended to achieve&mdash; to say that 16,000 of a population in one area can elect a Deputy as against 23,000 in another area. The important point in all this debate is that there is no guarantee whatever that this deviation from the national average&mdash;which is intended, or alleged to be intended, to benefit the western or the poorer counties&mdash;must be used to benefit them. It can be used to benefit some of them but it need not necessarily be used to benefit all of them in any particular revision of constituencies. It does not have to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This is a pretence that the Minister gets on with &mdash;that this is designed to help the poorer counties with falling populations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but, in one county, one of the poorer relations we may have in the west of Ireland, we may find a Deputy representing 20,000 and we may find, in another constituency in the same county, if the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill goes through one Deputy representing 16,000. We may find the figure up to 23,000 in one part of the county and as low as 16,000 in another part of the county. Of the whole lot, in that kind of situation, one could say that this provision of the Constitution had been operated so as, on the overall, to provide the maximum number of Deputies permitted under the Constitution.  That can be done. There is nothing to prevent its being done.</P>
      <P>Take County Mayo with, say, six Deputies with the new population: six Deputies even with the existing population.  One can have the situation where, in one part of the county, the number per Deputy is 23,000 while, in the next constituency in the same county, it can be down as low as 16,000 per Deputy. How that is intended to benefit the whole of that county, I do not quite follow. At any rate, as between the people in that county, in that kind of situation, it is perfectly clear that the principle of one man, one vote, will not be observed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister and if the Fianna Fáil Party were really interested in maintaining the principle of one man, one vote, and if they were interested in providing a system whereby the West, with its declining population, would get at least as good a representation, on the basis of electors, as other parts of the country, the Government would not have introduced this Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill in the manner in which they have introduced it. I think the House&mdash;and, in time, I <Col N="2655" /> think the country&mdash;will be very grateful to Senator Garret FitzGerald for his masterly handling of the figures relating to the number of electors. Senator Garret FitzGerald has shown the variety of ways in which it is possible to achieve almost the same value for every vote cast in a general election by relating the constituencies not to population, as is suggested in this Bill, but to the number of electors on the electoral register&mdash;and that has not been gainsaid by the Minister. By doing that, he ends up with a situation in which there is a slight bias in favour of rural Ireland. That being the case, we say: &ldquo;All right&rdquo; to that: we quite agree with that. But the Minister then says: &ldquo;Well, we could not do that&rdquo;&mdash;for what reason? They could not do that because the method of compiling the electoral register is not as efficient as the method of compiling the quinquennial census of population. Of course it is not as efficient and of course it is one of the aspects of inefficiency of local administration to which I have just referred. That is the kind of inefficiency that is permitted to continue.</P>
    <P>I recollect, when we had a Joint Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas on electoral reform, that a considerable proportion of the time of the Committee was devoted to endeavouring to ensure that the electoral register would be compiled more efficiently than it has been up to the present time. I have seen no evidence that it has been compiled more efficiently. Nothing effective has been done by the local authorities in any of the places in which I canvassed at by-elections to improve the electoral register. One finds the most glaring examples of people having been omitted from the register, people having been knocked off the register and people who died many years ago being left on the register and yet the Minister says we could do nothing about it. Of course we can. There are ways and means of doing something if the Minister wants to do it. If the Minister wants to have equality for the rural vote and for the urban vote, then we have to achieve that and uphold the <Col N="2656" /> principle of one man one vote by relating the number of Dáil Deputies to the total electorate on the register of electors and by dividing up the constituencies on the basis of the number of electors.</P>
    <P>Again, it is an absurd argument, and it shows how badly off the Minister is, to say that the electoral register is compiled every year and you would have to have a new electoral law, a new drawing up of constituencies every year if there was a change in the electoral register. That argument is almost too puerile to deal with but I must deal with it. Of course, it would not be necessary. You can provide in the Constitution if you are drafting the Third Amendment Bill on the basis of the electorate that it shall not be necessary to amend the electoral law more frequently than once every ten or 12 years. I suggest that ten would be in order in the case of the electoral register because ten years is designed to take account of the quinquennial census of population. That can be easily provided and if the Minister wanted to have one man one vote and if he is genuinely concerned to equate the rural vote with the urban vote, he would go for the number on the electoral register as the basis on which to determine the number of Deputies and the number of constituencies and to delimit the constituencies in accordance with the electoral register.</P>
    <P>Another fundamental objection which I and the Fine Gael Party have to this Third Amendment Bill is that the single-seat constituency will deprive the population in that constituency of a choice. The richness in life is when you have a choice; you are rich when you have a choice and you are poor when you have no choice. The poor people have to go to the county home because they have no choice. That is the hallmark of poverty. We try to enrich ourselves by having a choice of clothes, by having a choice of schools, by having a choice of hotels. The present proposal is to compel every citizen in the new small constituency to go to the one Deputy. That deprives people of a choice which they have at present because they can go to one of at least three Deputies. Now <Col N="2657" /> we say: &ldquo;You will have only one choice&rdquo; and this occurs at a time when we are dissatisfied with the dispensary system foisted on us by the Board of Guardians a long time ago. It was set up and was financed by the Poor Law rate and even years after its establishment, with no British Government to bully us and with no High Court action hanging over us, our people still operate with this lack of choice if they happen to be poor. The Fine Gael Party have long since advocated the abolition of this hallmark of poverty where you have no choice. The Fianna Fáil Party latterly in their White Paper on the health services&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They are saying this while at the same time they are saying: &ldquo;You will not have a choice of Deputy, whether he is Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or anything else.&rdquo; When one sees the contempt Fianna Fáil have for Fine Gael and Labour Deputies it is shocking to think that they are condemning their minority in the constituencies to the demeaning position of having to wait on a Fine Gael or Labour Deputy when they want something raised in Parliament.  That is if they really believe what they say about the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party. Getting away from that altogether, the truth is that under the present system in the three seat constituencies, and there cannot be anything less than three seat constituencies under the Constitution, you have a choice of two Fine Gael, two Fianna Fáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am saying that if they want to go, they have a choice and if a committee, whether it is a committee of a residents' association, a Fianna Fáil cumann, a Fine Gael branch or a trade union council want to consult a Deputy they do not have to go to one Deputy; they have a <Col N="2658" /> choice. The Fianna Fáil proposal is designed to rob people of that choice. I believe our system of giving a choice is a better one and is a better system than the British Government's system. Mark you, when you come to look at the British Constitution the political commentators will say there is no rational basis for many of the institutions and conventions which are to be found in the British Constitution. I cannot recall the name of one political commentator but I do recall that my professor of politics in the university used quote him as saying that the only explanation for the British Constitution was &ldquo;it growed like Topsy&rdquo;. There is no rational explanation for it and there is no rational explanation for a minority in any country having the power because of the electoral system that operates to elect and determine the government of the country. That is what happened in Britain and I do not like it and I do not think it should happen here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should try to get nearer to having the majority elect a government under proportional representation. So far as the Third Amendment Bill is designed to bolster up the declining fortunes of the Fianna Fáil Party in the west of Ireland and in so far as the Government try to buttress up the decaying counties of the West by saying &ldquo;We want to give you more representation&rdquo;, I want to issue a strong warning to the people in the West, to which I referred in my speech on Second Stage, that this Bill is designed either to meet a temporary situation of a declining population, in which event there is no need for it because it is only a temporary situation, or it is designed to meet a permanent feature of life in the western counties, that is a continuing decline in population.  If it is for a temporary situation there is no need for the Bill because the population will increase in the course of nature but the Government evidently have written off the west of Ireland and they say that in their judgment the western counties are condemned to a declining population, that there is no possibility of that decline being reversed and, in order to meet that situation and continue to give these people, at the same time, the <Col N="2659" /> same representation as they have at present, it is necessary to introduce this Bill.</P>
    <P>I say to the people of the West to reject this proposal because, by accepting it, they will be giving approval to the Government's view that they are inevitably doomed to extinction. Because of that, even though the pretence is that it is designed to help the West, this is a clear case of the Trojan horse. If this Bill becomes law and if this change is made, it will be said in future years: &ldquo;Sure, did not the whole of Ireland, and not just the Government alone, accept this in 1968? Did they not accept there would be a declining population and was that not the reason they introduced the amendment to the Constitution?&rdquo; This will be the plaint. That will be the explanation given by the economists and the socialists. It will also be the explanation given by the politicians in the Fianna Fáil Party to the West in the years to come.</P>
    <P>So much for the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill. I would now like to say something about the Fourth Amendment which, to use the words of Senator Quinlan, is intended to abolish proportional representation. That is the primary purpose of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry for the incorrect attribution. In discussing the question of proportional representation, there are many approaches that one could adopt. Had a different system been introduced in 1922, not the transferable vote which we have operated since 1923, I suppose there would be the same opposition to changing that system in 1959 and 1968 as there is now to changing proportional representation. We have grown up with a particular form of proportional representation. It suits our circumstances and no speaker so far has demonstrated that proportional representation has retarded our economic and social progress in the slightest degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well to recall that, in 1959, the Taoiseach said that proportional representation <Col N="2660" /> up to that time had not impeded economic progress. Since then we have had the First and Second Programmes for Economic Expansion. I do not know of any way in which proportional representation prevented either the drafting or the implementation of those programmes, in so far as either of them has been implemented.  I do not know of any way in which the Free Trade Area Agreement negotiated with Britain was in any way hindered by the existence of proportional representation. Neither has proportional representation hindered the country in its application for membership of the Common Market. I have yet to hear that the Commission in Brussels, in discussions with the Taoiseach, or President de Gaulle in discussions with the Taoiseach, has attributed Ireland's unpreparedness for participation in the Common Market to the existence in our Constitution here of proportional representation. Proportional representation has nothing to do with any of these.</P>
    <P>We have had Governments here with all the electoral support and all the Dáil representation they needed to put through economic or social programmes.  Proportional representation has had nothing whatever to do with any failure on the part of the Government to achieve the measure of economic and social progress to which the country is entitled and which the country wants. It is well to bear in mind that there was no constraint upon President de Valera in 1937 to put proportional representation into the Constitution. But he did put it in and he had close on four years in which to change his mind. He could have had all the second thoughts he wanted about proportional representation up to some time in 1941. Of course, in 1938, proportional representation gave him 76 seats out of 137 and, when proportional representation gave him that kind of representation in Dáil Éireann, there was nothing wrong with it. When, however, Fianna Fáil's fortunes began to decline in 1943 and he got only 66 seats out of 137, then it was a case of a bad workman quarrelling with his tools. It was not the Fianna Fáil record, or absence of it, that had reduced <Col N="2661" /> the number of seats from 76 to 66; it was proportional representation. From then on he saw nothing but evil in this system which he himself had written in in more rigid form&mdash;that was the mentality of President de Valera; he was never a man of flexible views&mdash; and with the precision of a mathematical formula into the Constitution of 1937. He made several changes in the Constitution <i>vis-á-vis</i> the then existing Constitution, but he retained proportional representation, the system of election the British are supposed to have imposed upon us.</P>
    <P>There was nothing to prevent this change being made in the 1937 Constitution.  Apart altogether from the fact that this system has been approved by the people, we have all of us grown up with it. It is part of the history of the political institutions of the new State established in 1922. Proportional representation has given this country stability, the stability President de Valera spoke about in 1937 when he was introducing his Constitution. It bears repetition:</P>
    <P>The system we have we know. The people know it. On the whole it has worked out pretty well. I think that we have a good deal to be thankful for in this country. We have to be very grateful for the system of proportional representation because it gives a great amount of stability...</P>
    <P>We started off this State, this political institution, in somewhat disastrous circumstances.  Senator Ó Maoláin took me to task, and so did the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As far as I am concerned, I do not intend to go into a debate on that time. I have my views, <Col N="2662" /> and so has every other person, as to who was to blame. The truth is that we were born, and this State was established, in those circumstances and because of the religious minority, and the political minority as they were in 1922, PR was the system which turned out to give us the stability about which President de Valera was able to speak so eloquently in 1937, and it has continued to give us that political stability. Senator Stanford is now able to say on behalf of the religious minority that they have nothing to fear, that they do not want any special representation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely said that he spoke on their behalf. Whether he has that right is a matter to take up with him. The reason they have not any fears at the present time is precisely because of the composition of the first Seanad, subsequently abolished by Act of Parliament by Deputy de Valera, and because of the system of PR which ensured to the religious minority in this country that if they ran in the large five or seven seat constituencies they could always get representation in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of that, we have had stability, we have had no grouses or even a shadow of a complaint from the religious minorities as far as political representation is concerned. But do not forget there always is the problem of the Border with us and as long as we have the problem of Partition we shall have people in this country who believe there is a particular means by which to end Partition. The appropriate means for these people is the lawful and constitutional way&mdash;they realise it now&mdash; through parliamentary representation; and as long as PR is here we can always say to that dormant minority, which is always less dormant than one would suspect: &ldquo;Go and get yourselves represented in Dáil Éireann and achieve a majority in Dáil Éireann if <Col N="2663" /> you think you can get a majority of the people to accept your views.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They have done that. They are out of Parliament and we have peace and tranquillity in this country, no small blessing when you look at the strife-torn cities in America and throughout the world. Domestic peace and tranquillity are the first essentials for any progress, and indeed according to the political theorists they are the first purpose of the existence of the State. There are different ways in which different peoples achieve law and tranquillity.  Communism is one system. The Americans have another system, we have another, and of all three, our system is preferable and I attribute that to the continued existence of PR.</P>
    <P>I am not at all sure that if the people of this country were to get rid of PR, as they will be entitled to do, we could look forward with the same assurance to the same degree of tranquillity and peace we have known in this country for many years.</P>
    <P>I have not wasted time in reading the history to be found in the volumes of the Dáil and Seanad debates on PR in 1959 and I am not in the happy position of the Minister of having fleets of civil servants to do the reading for me and to draw my attention to various passages, but if one reads the principal speeches of the principal speakers &mdash;the then Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera and the then Minister for Education, now Taoiseach&mdash;on the demerits of PR one will learn all about giving three votes or multiple votes to one man. The whole complaint of that period against PR rested on the tendency of PR to cause a splintering of Parties, leading to instability and to this abhorred form of Government which Deputy Lynch referred to as inter-Party but which many Fianna Fáil speakers prefer to refer to as Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>That was the whole case against PR &mdash;that it led to Coalition Governments and that this was an unmitigated disaster from which the Irish people should be spared. I emphasise this because, as I have said, all the facts are against that case made by the Government against PR. From 1959 to <Col N="2664" /> 1968, so far from PR tending to lead to a multiplicity of Parties, to a splintering of Parties and to the election of crackpots as Independents, we find in 1968 that we have three main political Parties and no fringe Parties&mdash; Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour, numerically in that order&mdash;and that the whole case made against PR in 1959 has fallen flat because the statistics speak out strongly and eloquently against that case.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the merits or demerits of inter-Party or Coalition Governments because the Taoiseach in 1959 realised the work that had been done by them. The system as we have operated it in this country has, as Deputy de Valera said in 1937, given stability and I see no great merit in extreme changes. I do not think anybody looking at our neighbour across the water in contemporary times can say there was any great merit in wholesale nationalisation by one Government and attempts to defeat it by the next. That does not pay dividends and nobody can point to the benefits that have been conferred on the stability or the strength of the £ or on the stability of the British economy by the fact that they have had these violent fluctuations in policies from one extreme to the other.</P>
    <P>What PR does is to prevent any Party, even the Party with the largest following, from becoming too strong. We all know that when any Government become too strong, they abuse the power which is given to them. That is a lesson which history teaches us and it is summarised in various ways such as &ldquo;Power tends to corrupt&rdquo; and &ldquo;Absolute power tends to corrupt absolutely&rdquo;. You will find 50 other quotations and numerous other instances in the pages of history which indicate what happens when people have too much power and get too far removed from the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Proportional representation keeps a Government on a tight rein and does not allow them to break loose and if a Government keep in touch with public opinion and have good and acceptable policies for the people, they need never have any fear that they will be prevented from putting these policies into operation. I would like to know of any valuable piece of legislation that any Government in this country have been unable to have implemented in recent times because of lack of voting power in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>When we talk about PR producing great stability, if we want to look across the water at the system which is so much admired by the Minister for Local Government and the Fianna Fáil Party who have got a national inferiority complex about the British, we find that in 1964 Mr. Wilson with his Government had a majority of five, I think, in the House of Commons out of 630, so that the straight vote system does not give the kind of stability we are told it gives. Of course in the following election, he did get a bigger majority, but as I have said, I see no great merit or virtue in having large majorities such as the present Government in England have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I point out at this stage that when people talk about the electoral system in America, one of the things they completely ignore is that they have an election for President every four years and they have an election for a change of one-third of the Senate every two years and the Congress every two years, which is a different kind of <Col N="2666" /> system altogether from the system we have here or in Britain. There is a constant keeping in touch with public opinion in America through this Presidential election every four years and the election to the other Houses in the method they have worked out, every two years. Therefore, there is no comparison whatever between the two systems because of the different time periods on which they operate.</P>
    <P>Getting away from the merits or demerits of the system as a system, but at the same time realising that it is a system that has operated not unsatisfactorily, and in fact I would say satisfactorily, here over the past 46 years&mdash; it is well to remember that it was only 37 years old in 1959 but now it is 46 years with us&mdash;getting away from that, we must have a practical look as politicians at what these amendments are intended to achieve. I said here earlier today that it would be puerile to ignore the fact that these amendments are put down by a political Party in Government and a dominant aim of the political Party, when it did not seek to consult any other political Party, is that these amendments are designed to assist the declining fortunes of the Fianna Fáil Party and if Party is to be before country, then for that reason alone, one has to approach these proposals suspiciously. We know of course that in 1959 the Amendment of the Constitution was proposed because a certain change in personnel was about to occur. In modern times these proposals are being put forward because another change in personnel has occurred and the popularity of the present Government is a declining commodity.</P>
    <P>These proposals must be resisted because of the fact that Fianna Fáil have been in office almost continuously since 1932, with the exception of two breaks, and have been continuously in office for the past 11 years. Because of these circumstances and because of the way in which they have operated the business of government, all the indications are, and certainly the hope of the Fianna Fáil Party is, that in the next election they would get 95 seats and upwards of 144. That is what these proposals are designed to do and I for <Col N="2667" /> my part am not prepared to commit the government of this country to the Fianna Fáil Party with as many as 95 Deputies in Dáil Éireann. I am not prepared to say to people in 95 single-seat constituencies: &ldquo;The only Deputy you can go to is a Fianna Fáil Deputy&rdquo;. I am not prepared to do that because we know that the Fianna Fáil Deputies continually create the impression, where people are entitled to grants, to pensions, to licences, to welfare allowances of any kind, that it is because they have approached the Fianna Fáil Deputy and because a Fianna Fáil Government are in power that a person is getting a grant, allowance, licence, job or anything else.</P>

      <P>I will leave it. If we had this new system with 95 Fianna Fáil Deputies and 50 other Opposition Deputies, it would be impossible for an Opposition to continue to carry on effective Opposition and as surely as there is no effective Opposition, Government will become corrupt and <Col N="2668" /> instead of Opposition to the Government in Parliament in a lawful way, what one will find is the extra-parliamentary representation one saw in the streets of Paris last May and which one will see again next October when the students come back. One sees all around the world where there are ineffective Governments.</P>
      <P>That is the kind of situation that a 95 Fianna Fáil TD Government would bring about in this country. That is the kind of situation to which the people want to be alerted. We will have marches; we will have strikes; we will have unrest if the people have not an effective Opposition to deal with an arrogant Government. What I have said before I repeat and every Fianna Fáil Deputy, Senator, Minister and county councillor knows that what I say is true, that they get on constantly with intimidation of the unfortunate poor and underprivileged of this country by telling them: &ldquo;If you do not vote for Fianna Fáil you will lose your job; you will not get your pension; you will lose everything.&rdquo; That is the kind of mental intimidation that is pursued throughout the length and breadth of this country.</P>
      <P>When I tell that to the Fianna Fáil Party, they will say that it is outrageous and that they do not believe it. When they see it in its grosser forms they will say it is Boland and Blaney. We did have a strong Government in this country from 1938 when there were 76 Fianna Fáil Deputies out of a total of 137. The first repressive measure that was introduced was the Wages Standstill Order in 1940 against the working population, and that was followed in 1941 by the Trade Union Act which was designed to prevent people from choosing the union to which they wanted to belong. Deputy Lemass brought in the Trade Union Act in 1941 to marshal the people into the trade union his appointed people would establish. That was the right of freedom that was guaranteed under the Constitution. It was limited by the Fianna Fáil Government at a time when a war was raging outside our shores. Our Fianna Fáil Government took the right to form whatever trade unions they wanted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2669" /> Again, and the Minister will say, I suppose, it was a Fine Gael team who did it under section 3 of the Trade Union Act, not alone did we see these repressive measures, the Wages Standstill Order, 1940, the Trade Union Act of 1941 but we saw the teachers on the streets of Dublin in 1946 and we saw Mr. MacEntee as Minister for Finance refusing to honour the award of an arbitration board for the civil servants. We had the civil servants marching in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and all around the country until they got justice.</P>
    <P>That is Fianna Fáil at their worst. That is Fianna Fáil power and that is how they would exercise their power, in the same way as they exercise their power over the farmers. We know the consultation that would go on. The people would be told: &ldquo;Take it or leave it; we know, we are in Government.&rdquo;  That is the attitude that will be adopted with the formalisation of the new proposal for universities.</P>

I hope in 1968 the Irish people will, as in 1959, very decisively defeat these two Bills.</P>

      <P>So much of the time of the House has been taken up by Senator O'Quigley that I do not propose to delay the House very long. When the Senator did speak for so long, it is too bad he did not avail of the time to depart from his normal procedure.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2671" /> I should like to speak on the two Bills. The Third Amendment Bill deals with the question of tolerance. I have listened to remarks made by Opposition Senators in opposing this Bill and I am still unable to find out the purpose or the reason for their opposition.  I should have thought that it was abundantly obvious that a tolerance of this kind was clearly essential, that it was impossible to devise satisfactory constituencies without some sort of tolerance. Without some sort of tolerance, to try to achieve exact mathematical accuracy is simply not practical. Many other well-established and highly-regarded democracies have tolerances which go far beyond what we will now have in this country.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer Senator Quinlan to his favourite country, Denmark, which of course has provision for tolerance in which account is taken of the number of electors, the density of population and so on. Norway and Sweden also have a provision of this kind. Great Britain has a tolerance which goes far beyond anything proposed in this Bill. Australia has approximately a 20 per cent tolerance.  Canada has just enacted a provision whereby they have a tolerance of up to 25 per cent. New Zealand has a similar provision. It is correct to say that any democratic country from which one can get information has not merely a provision for tolerance in regard to constituencies but one which goes considerably beyond what is in this Bill. My only objection to this Bill is that this one-sixth tolerance provided is possibly not sufficiently wide enough to deal with the problems that will arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all sure that it goes far enough. However, it is clear that some tolerance is desirable. As I say, the tolerance in this Bill goes nothing like so far as it is in those other highly-respected democracies. Some of the Opposition come in here and say that this is breaching the one man, one vote principle and tending <Col N="2672" /> towards dictatorship. That is rather childish and has no basis in fact. We had a good deal from Senator O'Quigley, including the question of the choice of candidates. He said there would be no longer a choice of candidate. Under the straight vote, to my mind&mdash;I think a number of people will agree with this&mdash;far more important than the ability to choose a candidate is the ability to choose a Government.</P>
      <P>Surely that is the basic reason we have elections in this and other democratic countries? We have elections to choose what Party will form a Government and govern the country for the next five years. An election system in a democratic country is only effective, is only efficient and is only satisfactory in so far as it achieves that basic end. This is far more important than the relatively minor one, at local level, of choosing candidates and of deciding who will be returned to Parliament.  The basic point which interests people and affects them in their whole way of life is: &ldquo;what type of government will be there for the next five years?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley asked what evidence there was, or who suggested that the policies carried out in this country for the economic administration of the country were ever affected in the slightest degree by the system of election. I should have thought that was obvious. I should have thought it was quite clear during the greater part of the 1950s that progress in this country was practically non-existent. This was caused mainly by the instability of government. In the ten years up to 1958 the average rise in income was one per cent per year. In other words, it was just stagnation. Progress, in so far as it existed at all, was almost non-existent.  It is not only we on this side of the House who say that economic progress and social progress in those years were effected by the Coalition Governments.</P>

      <P>I remember reading the <i>Irish Times</i> articles week after week by Garret FitzGerald, who then was <Col N="2673" /> not a Senator. I was very interested reading those articles because they were well written, very interesting and not biased as he had not then embarked on his political career. Week after week he made this perfectly correct point that economic progress had been hamstrung by this situation which existed in this country of Coalition Governments and general instability. For example, he wrote on 28 May, 1964 in the <i>Irish Times:</i></P>
      <P>The papering over of wide political differences between Fine Gael and its left-wing partners led to weak Governments susceptible to pressures from too many different angles.</P>
      <P>I would have thought that was a fairly obvious remark. We know that the situation in the 1950s was that no Government were in a position to carry out any long-term coherent political programme. It is that kind of thing we want to avoid in the future.</P>
      <P>In the next election, if it is to be held under proportional representation, I would ask Opposition Senators to consider for a moment what alternative there is to Fianna Fáil? Supposing Fianna Fáil were returned with, say, 65 seats, and Labour and Fine Gael combined were in a position to form a Government. Does anybody want that? Do Fine Gael want it? Do Labour want it? Do the people want it? I think it is quite obvious they do not. Two Coalition Governments were so disastrous from every point of view that nobody in the country would get up on a platform and say: &ldquo;Vote for me for I am in favour of a Coalition Government&rdquo;. Nobody wants that type of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Labour supporters would like to see a Labour Government. Fine Gael supporters would like to see a Fine Gael Government. Fianna Fáil supporters would like to see a Fianna Fáil Government.  Nobody wants a Coalition. Yet, it is obvious, as things stand under proportional representation, that the only alternative to Fianna Fáil is a Coalition Government. Senator O'Quigley said that no country should allow a minority to choose a Government.  However, it usually happens that <Col N="2674" /> under 50 per cent is sufficient to form a Government. It has only happened once that Fianna Fáil got 52 per cent of the votes. Every other Government since 1922 got less than that. The Cumann na nGaedheal Party got as little as 27.4 per cent of the total vote at one time, yet they formed a one-Party Government. No practical person in this country would suggest that Fianna Fáil are going to get an overall majority of the votes. They got 46 per cent, 47 per cent or 48 per cent, on the occasions when they formed a Government.</P>
    <P>The one thing about the straight vote is that it enables the bulk of the people to choose a Government. Proportional representation deliberately, by its very nature, encourages governments by minority. Why should a Party that gets perhaps 10 per cent, 15 per cent or 20 per cent of the votes be in a position to tell the Government what policy it is to carry out? That, to my mind, is hardly democratic.  The only democratic way of forming a Government is to ensure that the greater part of the population wish to elect that particular Government. That is the very state of affairs which proportional representation is deliberately designed not to create. It is deliberately designed to create the position where Governments are formed by minorities.</P>
    <P>We had the old hare raised by Senator O'Quigley about religious minorities and the problem of the Border. It has been said here over and over again, and one can say it again, although Senators like Senator O'Quigley and Senator Quinlan will still not believe it, that proportional representation has nothing to do with the situation in Northern Ireland. I am prepared to concede that the Northern Ireland Government in abolishing proportional representation did so for the worst of reasons. That may be so and I am prepared to concede that it may well be so but the point is&mdash;and it is not just my point; it is commonsense to anyone who studies the position well and writers such as Professor Hogan of Cork have made the same point, as quoted by Senator Nash&mdash;that because of the situation in the North, people of one religion tend to live in one area <Col N="2675" /> and people of the other religion tend to live together in another area and the situation there is such that the existence of proportional representation would make no practical difference to the Nationalist minority. That is the plain factual statement and no amount of talk from Senator Quinlan or others can make any difference to that.</P>

      <P>I should like to make one remark, to give my own personal viewpoint, which does not stem from anyone else or any other group. Senator O'Quigley said how the religious minority in the early days of the Free State were able to rely on proportional representation, and so on. My view on that would be that this was a typical case where proportional representation, where it had any effect, had a divisive effect. What was needed after 1922 was that any members of the religious minority who might not approve of the new State here, the new authority that had been set up, would immediately decide to take part in public life in the Parties to which the masses of the people belonged and a situation which actually encouraged them to stand on a minority basis was, to my mind, divisive and entirely undesirable. Fortunately, it was used only to a very small extent and, as Senator Stanford rightly said, is now no longer relevant at all to this issue.</P>
      <P>Now, we have people saying over and over again that the straight vote would bring about dictatorship, a Fianna Fáil dictatorship, that Fianna Fáil would be in office forever. This is simply ridiculous. It seems to me that it is nothing but impudent nonsense to describe such great democracies as Great Britain, the United States of America, Canada and New Zealand as dictatorships. They are not dictatorships.  They are amongst the best regarded of all the world's domocracies. In none of these countries, in no country that has the straight vote, has it occurred that one Party has stayed in office forever.</P>

      <P>I will finish quite rapidly if I were allowed to. In all straight vote countries, there is a regular change from one Government to another under this system of election. It seems to me there are arguments on both sides. Clearly, you can put up an argument in favour of proportional representation.  We on this side of the House believe that for this country the straight vote is the most satisfactory system of election. It will not lead to dictatorship.  It will lead, for the first time, to there being a real alternative to Fianna Fáil. It will mean that either Fine Gael or Labour can become an alternative Government in a way that they have never been able to before. For this reason, Deputy Cosgrave, Leader of the Fine Gael Party, who wants some day to be Taoiseach of a Fine Gael Government, agrees with us that the straight vote is the most satisfactory form of election for Ireland. It will, as I say, for the first time, establish a real alternative to Fianna Fáil. Since no one in any Party wants anything but one-Party Government, a Government composed of members of a particular Party, so that they can carry out their own policy without being pushed from behind by some small minority, I have no doubt, really, that the combined efforts of those people <Col N="2677" /> in the various Parties in this country who want to see their own Party's policy carried out will be sufficient to ensure that there will be a majority for this proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now engaged in the final stages of the debate in the Oireachtas before the issue goes before the people for decision. We have been engaged in a needless exercise. Months of parliamentary time has been taken up in dealing with legislation for which this Government had no mandate. The Fianna Fáil Party did not go before the people in the last general election and ask for a mandate to promote legislation to abolish PR. There was not a mention of PR and the desire of a Fianna Fáil Government to abolish PR during the last general election. This exercise, this waste of parliamentary time, has not put one more worker to work. It has not prevented the emigration of even one individual.  Nobody is any better off as a result of this waste of parliamentary time. In fact, the unemployment figure which we get weekly shows a steady, persistent rise every week compared to the corresponding week in the previous year. No mention has been made of that. No effort is, apparently, being made by the Government to deal with that problem. They show no concern for the problem of the unemployed workers. All they are concerned with is this plot to try to abolish proportional representation. All that will be accomplished by this effort&mdash;unsuccessful I trust&mdash;will be the creation of suspicion and disunity amongst the whole community at a time when we as a nation more than ever before need to be united to face the challenge, whether there is a Common Market or not, which we will have to face, the improvement of the efficiency of industry and agriculture. Now we are dividing the country, dividing our people, on a vain and needless issue when every effort should be made by the Government who have been entrusted with the leadership and the power, at the last general election, to promote the efficiency of agriculture and industry and to bind the people together in order to face the challenge of the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2678" /> All this has been for the purpose of trying to change the rules, trying to change the system of election, in order to keep Fianna Fáil in office at a time when they find, or they think, that the tide is turning against them. It is an effort to abolish proportional representation, an effort to abolish a system which we know, which we understand and which has worked effectively in this country.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot during these hours of parliamentary debate about the merits and demerits of proportional representation compared with the supposed merits and demerits of the British system of election as it will operate in Ireland. I say &ldquo;supposed&rdquo; because this is a venture in the dark. It is not good enough to say that simply because this is how it operates in another country in a completely different situation this is how it will operate here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have, as I have said, heard all these arguments. What is vain about it and what is foolish about it is the fact that we are not in the position of setting up a new State. In that case it might be appropriate to debate which system might be better than the other, which system might be more effective. What we are doing is proposing to change a system which has operated successfully, which has enabled this country to develop a parliamentary democracy and which has maintained that parliamentary democracy, in spite of tremendous pressures since 1922.</P>
    <P>We may cast a glance perhaps at other countries that have won their freedom since we did, see how they have operated, compare our experience and be thankful that we have been able to maintain and develop a parliamentary democracy in what was a newly-emergent nation in 1922. After centuries of domination by Britain, we got a measure of freedom then. We have expanded that since and built up a parliamentary democracy we can rightly be proud of. Many other countries which have won their freedom since then have not been able to maintain parliamentary democracy and have slipped, one after the other, into forms of dictatorship.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2679" /> Now we are being asked to abandon the system that has served our interests so well, to take a leap in the dark and say: &ldquo;If we adopt the British system, this might be the result.&rdquo; Senator Yeats has tried to persuade us that this is in the interests of the Fine Gael Party, that it would bring Fine Gael on as an alternative Government to Fianna Fáil, that there are always swings under this system, and that one would be in and the other out. I suppose the regret amongst the Fianna Fáil Party is that Fine Gael have not joined with them in this conspiracy to wipe out the Labour Party, because that is what it is. It is a conspiracy to deprive minorities of representation in our Parliament. If it succeeds, it will make Parliament less representative of minorities than it has been in the past. It will inevitably mean that these sizeable minorities will look for expression outside Parliament, which will be bad for democracy here.</P>
    <P>It is a step back from democracy. We all know this. There is no point exaggerating the argument and saying it is dictatorship. It is not dictatorship if we change the system, but it is a step back from the more perfect form of democracy we have in this country. I am confident that the Irish people, with their love of freedom and regard for justice and fair play, will give the answer to this Government and will retain the system of election which they know and understand and which has worked well and will continue to work in the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the time remaining I can do very little except take one or two high points. It is obvious the Government are out to fight the next general election on the referendum. Why not wait until the general election, until the people face a general election when it comes and they will make their decision? I have every confidence that the electorate will see it in that light and will see that a general election is to be fought when a general election comes around and that this present effort to rig the <Col N="2680" /> electoral system is nothing short of a power grab.</P>
      <P>The figures that have emerged here confirm the estimate given by the distinguished professors of political science who created such concern on Telefís Éireann when they showed that the result of their conclusions was that, for a vote less than they got the last time, the Fianna Fáil Party under the straight vote system would get from 90 to 95 seats, whereas under PR they might get from 60 to 65. That indeed is a nice bonus and deserves to be called a power grab. If you want to prove it, look across the Border and you see 38 out of 52 seats, 75 per cent of the seats, held by the Unionist Party. If we were to take a consensus of Seanad Éireann as to what percentage of the population in the North of Ireland the Unionist Party represent, we will be charitable and say 55 per cent. Is that not reasonable? But they get 75 per cent of the seats. That is in line with what has been estimated here.</P>
      <P>The most pernicious feature of all in this change is that we are introducing a system that would exploit and magnify class differences and prejudices. At the moment the country is changing. The rural part is declining, the number on the land is declining and in a few years time the rural vote will be less than 25 per cent of the total vote. At that stage any Party unscrupulous enough and ruthless enough to exploit the city vote, the 75 per cent outside the rural community, with an average of 40 per cent of the vote and preserving the three-Party system we have, with the split vote that already exists, any Party capable of getting 40 per cent could get at least two-thirds of the seats and therefore emerge with an overall majority. To get that they could antagonise the rural vote and use the rural people as a whipping boy, although they might have scarcely got a vote from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a 30 per cent vote you could have a group take over in Dáil Éireann. If such a group took over, they might get in by the straight vote but you would not get them out by the straight vote. Any group seizing power in those circumstances will hold on to it. I have every confidence that the people will hold fast to the freedom they have, to <Col N="2681" /> their right to decide both between people and between Parties when it comes to an election. If they want to vote Fianna Fáil, they want a choice between the three candidates they have got at present. If they want to vote Labour, they want the choice the Labour Party have promised them in future elections.</P>
    <P>The mark of an educated nation is not the mark of servitude to Party bosses. Our people will see to it that that does not come about. Our increasing standard of education means our people are more politically aware of the issues and will be able to make the proper decision at elections. There is no need to put them into the straitjacket of the straight vote and try to ensure that a 30 per cent or 35 per cent minority, if properly exploited, would have an opportunity of fastening themselves on the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Our hope is that the people will hold on to what they have got. They have an ingrained sense of fair play. They accept the value and effectiveness of ensuring that all reasonably large groups are adequately represented in the national Parliament, where they can combine as intelligent representatives to provide a Government for the Irish people from Irish people democratically elected a majority in Dáil Éireann. We have to remember that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. It has been said so many times here. The present stage, after they have been in power for 12 years, is not the proper time for the nation to entrust the extravagant power to Fianna Fáil that would be got by the straight vote. Consequently, I am opposing both Bills and will do what I can to alert the people to the dangers in them. I have every confidence in their judgment which I believe will be a resounding defeat for this power grab.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Murphy, if I understood him aright, appeared to ascribe the delay since these Bills were introduced into the Dáil on 21st February, 1968, to the Fianna Fáil Party. Just why the Government should decide to introduce proposals for a referendum and then delay them <Col N="2682" /> he did not explain. Neither did he advert to the fact that as soon as these Bills were announced, the Leader of the Labour Party announced their intention to fight them &ldquo;line by line and comma by comma&rdquo;. Neither did he advert to the fact that on the Second Stage of the two Bills, which were taken together in the Dáil, 15 of the 19 Labour Deputies were constrained to contribute, and that their contributions amounted to a repetition of the arguments that had been used at the outset. Nor did he advert to the fact that on the Second Stage of the two Bills in the Dáil 21 Members of the Fine Gael Party contributed also. As he knows, 21 is very close to the actual number it was possible to muster in order to defeat the Leader of the Fine Gael Party in the famous all-night session when he advocated support for the proposals we are putting before the people.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy attacked the Government because, as he said, they had no mandate to enact legislation to abolish PR. The Senator knows quite well that the Government cannot enact legislation to abolish PR and therefore the question of having a mandate does not arise. The Constitution provides that this cannot be done and there can be nothing dictatorial in regard to these two Bills. Apparently, Senator Murphy is suggesting that there should be new procedure laid down for amending the Constitution. It is at present provided that the Constitution can only be amended by a referendum of the whole people. Apparently, Senator Murphy now wants us first to go to the people and ask them for a mandate to ask them to amend the Constitution. First, we go to them for a mandate, then come back to the Dáil and Seanad and pass the two Bills, then go back to the people and ask them for a mandate to enact the necessary legislation to amend the Constitution. I think I never heard such nonsense proposed before. I cannot see how the question of a mandate prior to a referendum arises since the Constitution cannot be amended without a specific mandate, a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that since it has proved impossible for the combined Opposition <Col N="2683" /> Parties to defeat Fianna Fáil under PR they would like to have had the issue confused by this question which can only be decided by the people as a separate issue. In any case, part of the reason for making these proposals was what resulted after the last election when the long recounts showed up the disadvantages and defects in the present system and showed how the element of chance decides the issue in a close result.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan wants to know why we could not wait for this to be decided until the general election. The Senator knows we cannot do that. He knows that Deputies in Dáil Éireann can see that their constituencies are out of line with the constitutional requirements as interpreted by the High Court at the instance of Fine Gael. He knows these Deputies have already raised the question of revision of constituencies. He knows that at this time the constituencies do not comply with the Constitution and that it is possible to enforce a revision of constituencies on the present terms. He appreciates that if the Government did that before the next general election there would be this widespread breaching of county boundaries, this widespread inflicting of injustice on a large section of the people in many parts of the country and that consequently there would be a feeling of frustration and resentment towards the Government and it is because he appreciates that that Senator Quinlan wants that to be done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out, we did not do it in 1961 because it was too close to the date of the general election and there was not time. We did not do it after <Col N="2684" /> 1961 because this situation, unjust as it was, had been established, because the people had voted in these constituencies into which they never wanted to go for certain Deputies. Deputies had been elected to represent them and the position had been established. Political party organisations, for instance, had adjusted themselves as much as possible to the new situation and for that reason we did not move to have the amendment at that stage. Another general election was held on the basis of these unfair, unjust and unrealistic constituencies.  When the 1966 census of population was published it became immediately apparent that what had happened in 1961 would be as nothing to what would happen now.</P>

We had the crowning example of that in the disgraceful and cowardly attack by Senator O'Quigley on a Senator of this House in his professional capacity, in that Senator's absence.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley tells us that the Fine Gael view is that these Bills should not pass now or that they should not be passed by the people. I wonder is there a Fine Gael view at all. Is it not a fact that the Leader of the Fine Gael Party favours our proposal? Is it not a fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is a known fact that, while Senator O'Quigley says the Fine Gael view is that the Bills should not pass, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party's view is that the Bills should pass. Is it not a fact that, in April, 1965, when Fine Gael decided to get rid of their then Leader and when Deputy Cosgrave was elected as Fine Gael Leader, at his first press conference the people interviewing him considered it a relevant question to ask him had his views changed in regard to this matter, and that he indicated to them that far from his views having changed, he now hoped, with his new stature as Leader, to bring his Party to appreciate the merits of this proposal?</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that the view of the Fine Gael Party&mdash;I am not referring to the Party in the Oireachtas but the Fine Gael Party as a whole&mdash;is gradually coming around to accepting the Leader's view, that the real Fine Gael true blues appreciate that Deputy Cosgrave is in the true Fine Gael tradition and the Cumann na nGaedheal tradition in his attitude to this proposal, and that it is he who has not changed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley claimed that the Supreme Court set aside the High Court's judgment in regard to it not being permissible to take account of administrative boundaries. The Supreme Court did no such thing. The Supreme Court endorsed the revision of constituencies that was based on the High Court decision. It is quite true they did say that it was a matter for the Oireachtas, in the first instance, what account they should take of administrative boundaries and the other considerations we have specified in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill. That is so, but they did say that such revision of constituencies was properly referable to the courts for decision; and such a revision of constituencies had been referred to the courts, and there was no indication given that the Supreme Court disagreed in any way with the decision of the High Court in this matter. Even if it is a fact that the Oireachtas can make a revision of constituencies in the first instance, the Supreme Court also made <Col N="2688" /> it clear that this could be adjudicated on by the courts.</P>
    <P>No doubt people like Senator O'Quigley who specialise in this type of constitutional wrangling would see nothing objectionable in the Oireachtas, first of all, making a revision of constituencies, this being referred to the courts and coming back to the Oireachtas, and eventually a revision being decided upon after a long and expensive process of trial and error. As far as we are concerned, we think it is essential, since the job of revising the constituencies is a practical one, that we should know in advance exactly what the position is. In any case, if the position is as Senator O'Quigley has now been maintaining it is, that the Oireachtas is already entitled to take these factors into account, then what we are proposing in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill is to do no more than clarify the position and make it definite; in other words, if what he says is true, we are doing no more than making it unnecessary to go to the courts after a revision of constituencies has been made.</P>
    <P>There is no question of the physical convenience of Deputies being involved in this proposal, as Senator O'Quigley alleged. What is involved in the proposal for single-seat constituencies is not the convenience of Deputies but the effective representation of the people. The people are not getting a fair deal in the matter of representation from their representatives at present. There is duplication and triplication. There is this built-in factor in the present system of unnecessary representations being made, and this results in the neglect or inadequate presentation of important constituency matters. While I agree with Senator O'Quigley that the vast majority of representation work done by Deputies and by public representatives generally at present is completely unnecessary, and that it is bad for the public morale in that it tends to engender in the public the belief that these things can be got in accordance with the efficacy of the representations made by the public representative, at the same time it is a fact that there are many things that do require the public representative's <Col N="2689" /> attention, many constituency matters which may appear small to people like Senator O'Quigley but which are quite important in so far as they affect the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley says that there was no demand for this since 1959. I quoted for him the demands which were made by members of the Opposition Parties in both Houses of the Oireachtas in 1961, the demands that were made to amend the Constitution in order to get rid of the requirement to perpetrate injustices on the people by what was described by the Opposition Deputies as the butchering of the established administrative areas such as counties. There was a definite demand for this in 1961 and, in fact Senator O'Quigley himself is on record &mdash;and I have quoted him in that regard&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

      <P>So, there was a definite demand for the proposal in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, I gave quotations to show that after the 1965 election there was at least a general assumption in the papers that something would be done to get rid of the system of election which produces long and unedifying recounts&mdash;not long counts but long and unedifying recounts&mdash;which discloses the importance of the element of chance, which discloses in a close situation that it would <Col N="2690" /> be just as realistic to toss a coin in order to decide who should be elected.</P>

      <P>So prevalent was this view that when these people were interviewing Deputy Cosgrave when he was elected as Leader of Fine Gael, the first question they thought it appropriate in the circumstances to ask him was had his attitude changed, because there was this assumption that something was going to be done.</P>
      <P>Then we had the long deliberations of the informal committee which was set up to study the Constitution and whose proceedings were supposed to be confidential. I do not think they started off from the word go to disclose information as to their proceedings, but I know that various members have purported now to disclose what happened after undertaking not to do so. I know that. I do not think they did it from the start, but from the beginning every political commentator assumed that they would spend a lot of their time discussing the electoral system because the defects in the electoral system had become so apparent to everyone that any intelligent observer would assume it was one of the first aspects which would come under discussion. In fact, the report they produced did seem to substantiate the assumption that considerable time was spent on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As well as that, there was the fact that a number of <Col N="2691" /> units of our organisation at the Ard Fheis from different parts of the country, possibly influenced by all the comment there was in the papers, put down a resolution demanding exactly what we are proposing with regard to the electoral system. There was substantial demand, I do not say a unanimous demand because there is no way of finding out if there was unanimous demand or majority demand except by what we are proposing, that is, a referendum.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, Senator O'Quigley based his case on the assumption that this was a question of Dublin versus the West of Ireland. It is not. It is a question of complying with the demand from all sides of the two Houses that what Deputy J. A. Costello described as this constitutional infirmity should be remedied. It is a fact that it is the counties in the western area generally, but not only in the western area, which would be most seriously affected, and would have their representation most unjustifiably reduced if this amendment were not carried.</P>
      <P>The objective is as stated in the Bill to avoid breaching the county boundaries and to take reasonable account of such factors as the extent and accessibility of the constituencies. The allegation now is that this is an attempt to secure for the West of Ireland in particular, and for the rural areas in general, representation to which they are not entitled at the expense of Dublin&mdash;a deliberate, cynical and totally unnecessary attempt to divide this country on the basis of the urban population versus the rural population. It is a false and dishonest argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that we take the Dublin area as the city and county of Dublin and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, and the West as Donegal, Clare and the province of Connacht. I suggest this area because whatever about the county boundaries I think most people who have any appreciation of practical politics would agree that it would be undesirable in adjusting the counties with one another to cross the physical <Col N="2692" /> boundary of the Shannon river. I agree with Deputy FitzGerald that County Kerry is also in the West but no one, except someone like Senator FitzGerald, would consider adjusting County Kerry with a county like Clare on the other side of the Shannon Estuary. He looks on this as purely a question of figures and I suppose that the Shannon Estuary between Kerry and Clare is something of no importance to Senator FitzGerald, that there is nothing much involved in it, but I think most reasonable people think that whatever about adjusting county with county it is not realistic to make an inter-county adjustment across the river Shannon.</P>
    <P>It has been alleged today by Senator O'Quigley that what is proposed will be unjust to Dublin and will confer undue representation on the West. If we compare the two areas we find that the area of this western area is 6,212,045 acres. The area of Dublin is 227,754 acres, so the West is 2,730 per cent of the area of Dublin. The population of the western area is 589,389 and the population of Dublin is 795,047. In other words the population of the western area is 74.1 cent of the electorate in the Dublin The number of voters on the basis of the 1967-68 register is 365,740 in the western area, and the number of voters in Dublin is 446,781, that is, 81.8 per cent of the electorate in the Dublin area. The number of Dáil seats in the western area is 33 and the number in Dublin is 34, the percentage being 97.</P>
    <P>This the Opposition say is a monstrous injustice on the people of Dublin. It is an affront to the sacred principles of democracy, the remedying of which cannot wait even until the normal date for revision of the constituencies in 1973, in five years time. It cries to high heaven for immediate rectification. I have been badgered in the Dáil by Deputies from both Parties to rectify this monstrous injustice immediately.  The Dáil seats must be reapportioned on the basis of the only relevant consideration being the total population. The relative areas of Dublin and the West are unimportant.  The area of the West is 2,730 per cent of the Dublin area but has <Col N="2693" /> not Deputy Ryan described the trials and tribulations of the intrepid Deputy who has to travel across the vast expanse between Kimmage and Rathmines to cover his constituency, and contrasted this with the ease and comfort of his colleague Deputy Lindsay who, in covering the area from Belmullet to Foxford, can take time to study the flora and fauna and the habits of frogs in their natural environment?</P>
    <P>The population of the West is 74.1 per cent of the population of Dublin and in the interests of democracy Dublin must get at the expense of the West the representation to which it is entitled by virtue of this population, assessed as it is by counting people who are resident in the area on one particular night such as children in institutions, wherever their normal place of residence, mothers and their new-born babies in maternity hospitals and nursing homes, wherever their normal place of residence is; students at universities and colleges, wherever their normal place of residence is; patients in hospitals, wherever their normal place of residence is; overnight guests in hotels and sailors on ships in Dublin Bay whether they are even aliens or nationals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the census figures of population complied in this way, and assuming the Fine Gael-procured High Court decision allows a divergence of five per cent, Dublin must get an increase of at least four seats and the West must get a decrease of at least three seats. This assumes, limiting the decrease to three seats, the complete ignoring of county boundaries as any attempt to respect them would mean an even greater reduction.  In other words, the Opposition maintain democracy demands that the representation must be at the very least 30 for the West and 38 in Dublin as against the present 33 in the West and 34 in Dublin. But, on the basis of the electorate, and assuming the same divergence of five per cent would be permitted and assuming, again, the <Col N="2694" /> maximum ignoring of county boundaries, the representation would be 32 for the West and 36 for Dublin. Surely, then, this is the most that is called for, bearing in mind the disparity in the areas of the two regions concerned? Under the proposals in this Bill, since it is a requirement that the maximum divergence can be utilised only for the purposes laid down in the Bill, the principal one of which is the taking account of county boundaries, it is just conceivable that it might be possible to retain the present 33 seats in the West but it is more likely to be 32 seats, that is, the actual number that would be justified by the number of voters.</P>
      <P>In the Dublin area, the absolute minimum that could be allocated is 35. It is practically certain that there will have to be at least 36 because of practical difficulties in regard to the accuracy with which the population figures are available and because the maximum divergence could be operated over the whole of the Dublin area only by having a fairly uniform and fairly high divergence in the opposite direction over the rest of the country and this would not be possible because of the requirement in regard to county boundaries which it is proposed to insert into the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Therefore, this Bill will not do more than produce a result closely approximating, in so far as these two areas are concerned, to the principle that was put forward here of one man, one vote, and as it was interpreted here. In other words, it will do no more than equate for the country as a whole a rural vote with an urban vote&mdash;and this, irrespective of any account of the area and the terrain&mdash;whereas the present position clearly confers differential voting power on the Dublin area and also differential voting power that the people have not asked for and do not want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think most people would see anything grossly wrong in a distribution of seats of 32 to the western area and 36 to Dublin or 32: 35 or even the retention of the present representation of 33 and 34 even though the electorate in the West of Ireland is only 82 per cent of the Dublin electorate, <Col N="2695" /> in view of the fact that, as I said, the area is 2,730 per cent of the Dublin area. So, despite the cynical and irresponsible and malicious efforts of the two Opposition Parties to induce Dublin antagonism to the West&mdash; merely because it happens to be their own pet aversion&mdash;I do not think they will succeed. I do not think that Dublin people covet any more than their due representation. In fact, I would say that, if there were a proposition that involved a slight weighting of representation because of the comparative remoteness and the vastness of the area, they would not demur.</P>
    <P>The overall effect of this proposal is clearly to do no more than to relate in a general way representation to the number of the electorate. The comparative table is as follows: Dublin, 446,781 electorate; 227,754 acres; 34 Deputies at present. Under the proposed Bill, there would be either 36 or 35 Deputies as against 38 if a revision is carried out, as has been demanded by the Opposition under present circumstances.  In the West, 365,740 electorate; 6,212,045 acres; 32 Deputies or possibly 33 under this proposed Bill&mdash; there are 33 at present&mdash;and a maximum of 30 if the demanded revision is carried out as at present.</P>
    <P>As I said, of course, this is not simply a question of Dublin versus the West. This is a gimmick the Opposition tried to utilise just because, as I said, the West is their own pet aversion. In fact, as far as we are concerned, we have a majority of only one in the Province of Connaught and a majority of two in the Dublin area. There is no reason whatever to allege that it is there that we have our strength. It is not a question of that. It is purely and simply a question of a fair deal for the people in the country as a whole, a fair deal for the public representatives so that they will have reasonable areas to represent and reasonably stable constituencies which will not be changed every five years, and also a fair deal for Party organisations that are composed of people doing voluntary and valuable work.</P>
    <P>I think it is admitted generally that <Col N="2696" /> this system that was enforced by the Fine Gael manoeuvre in the High Court in 1961 of the detachment of portions of counties and their transfer into other counties is undesirable. I admit that places like Rooskey and Lanesboro' exist and that people have been accustomed to the fact that these places straddle two counties and the River Shannon. But it is not just small areas like Rooskey and Lanesboro' that are involved, as Senator O'Quigley tried to pretend. Substantial areas were involved in 1961 and even worse on this occasion. What about the substantial area in County Louth which had to be transferred to County Monaghan? It involved the town of Ardee, which does not straddle the border of Louth and Monaghan. The area in Waterford which had to be transferred to Tipperary was substantial. The area of Carrick-on-Suir, which Senator Garret FitzGerald advocated should be transferred to Waterford, is also substantial.</P>
    <P>What happened in 1961 was bad enough but this continuous shuffling of people from constituency to constituency, in and out of constituencies, as successive elections is something that will prove frustrating to them, to their representatives and to Party organisations.  We would have a position, for instance, that people who voted in one constituency in 1965 would have to be changed in 1967. Half-way between one election and another, they will find themselves in another constituency. The elected representatives will find themselves representing a different area and they will have to vote in different constituencies in 1970. Then, presumably, another change will be required after the 1971 census. Of course, this is only a minor exercise in figures to people like Senator Garret FitzGerald but we believe&mdash;and we agree with the views expressed by the Opposition in 1961&mdash;that the people are entitled to know where they are; that Deputies are entitled to know their constituency for a reasonable length of time without chopping and changing and handing over territory to one another with the adequate representation of the area suffering in consequence. We believe that political organisations are entitled to some stability in this regard also. <Col N="2697" /> The question then is merely one of justice to the people and in the words of Deputy J.A. Costello the remedying of a constitutional infirmity.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that all Deputies and Senators know this but because Fianna Fáil proposed it they decided to oppose it in the full knowledge that for mean Party purposes they are seeking to perpetuate what is an injustice. They know that the requirement of the Constitution to butcher the boundaries of County Donegal, to transfer a substantial portion of Donegal to the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim or the transfer of a substantial part of Sligo-Leitrim to Donegal is not required by any democratic principle because Donegal has sufficient voters to justify the retention of its present representation.  They know also that in Clare there is more than the national average of voters per Deputy at present; they know that Kerry has sufficient voters to justify its present representation and that Cavan has sufficient voters to justify its present representation, but in order to gain mean Party advantage they want the present position maintained.</P>
    <P>They know that if this Bill is not passed so far as Dáil representation is concerned County Leitrim must disappear as a separate entity. Whereas now, as a result of the 1961 decision, it is divided into two, it must be divided into at least three, and possibly into four if this amendment is not passed. The people of Leitrim believe that they are entitled to representation as a county and we are suggesting that the people should amend the Constitution as was demanded before. I do not think I need go any further into the question of the Constituency Commission being proposed only in the one Bill. I explained that at sufficient length already today.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley is opposed to adopting what he calls this legalistic approach. He objects, in other words, to the Minister for Local Government taking competent legal advice as to what is permissible. Apparently he would like the Government to draft a Bill without reference to its legality and let people like Senator O'Quigley argue it out at so much per day in the courts, <Col N="2698" /> then come back to the Oireachtas and then give the lawyers another field day in the courts until eventually we would arrive at a solution. The figures I quoted showed that a wholesale shifting of population from county to county will be required if this amendment is not passed. This has been described as butchering and dismemberment by members of the Opposition and it is true that I also used these words in the Seanad but if I had been writing them instead of speaking them I would have put them in quotation marks because they were quotations from Opposition speakers. It is a fact that some of those who were moved in 1961 would probably go back to their own counties for a temporary period but in most cases this would have to be compensated for by a movement of population from some other part of the county.</P>
    <P>The figures show, while the present system confers differential voting power on the people in substantial areas as opposed to others, that, in fact, the result of what we propose would not be very far from what the Opposition interpret as one man, one vote, and would do no more than roughly equate the value of the rural vote with the urban vote. It is true that in 1935 a Fianna Fáil Government, in revising constituencies, did this without having been compelled to do it by the courts, but it is also true they never did it since because it was in 1935 that the people's frustration and resentment at this kind of treatment became apparent. No Government attempted to do it since, nor did anybody advocate it until such time as the Fine Gael Party got the courts to rule on the matter and insist that it must be done.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Opposition to the Third Amendment Bill is unnecessarily to try to divide the people on the basis of the urban versus the rural population. It is quite clear what their decision is in regard to one section of the community, that they intend to court it in order to get their votes. Deputy J.A. Costello made it perfectly clear when he contemptuously referred to the rural vote as &ldquo;the cow vote&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Fourth Amendment Bill, I think it was Senator FitzGerald who said that before making <Col N="2699" /> a proposal such as this we should get the agreement of all political Parties for a change. As far as I could see this was his only real objection to our proposal.  In all this it is clear that under no circumstances will Fine Gael agree with Fianna Fáil on anything. He admitted that in the Committee on the Constitution every effort was made to reach agreement on the single seat with the transferable vote. Is it not the position that we have, in fact, got the agreement of the Leader of the Fine Gael Party on what we propose and also of a number of prominent members of the Party, I do not know how many, I took it that there was a majority of one against it? However, we have the agreement of those members of Fine Gael who have confidence in the future of the Party, but the less confident members whose sole interest is in their own seats and who have not got the backbone to stand on their own feet, and are content to scrape in either on a distribution of surpluses or on votes gathered here and there over a large constituency, outvoted the Leader of the Party at this famous all-night session. If Deputy Cosgrave cannot get his Party to agree with him how can Senator FitzGerald expect us to get his Party to agree with us?</P>
    <P>With regard to the Labour Party, Senator Murphy has indicated on more than one occasion that they are reconciled to their permanent role as a minority Party. Nobody could expect a Party which has not got the will to win to agree to a change from a position which as far as possible safeguards their position as a permanent minority with their highest ambition either to achieve a balance of power position of a Coalition with whatever Party is prepared to go along with them. Surely Senator Murphy made an admission that they can never hope to make their policy acceptable to the people. This is a remarkable attitude particularly now when according to the newspapers the latest of many new policies is in the process of gestation. It is apparently realised in advance that, whatever hope there is of getting this new policy accepted by a majority of the delegates to the Labour Party <Col N="2700" /> conference, there is no hope of getting the public to accept it. I must say I wonder was it in case the delegates to the meeting dealing with the new Party might be influenced by it that the admonition to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; was removed from the skyscraper building here in the city.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear, I think, that the position we are asking the people to establish is one in which the people will be able to choose between alternative governments. Fianna Fáil will obviously still be on the one side and, on the other, will be Fine Gael or Labour, or a Coalition, or whatever new Party, or Parties, may emerge to fill the gap left by the ineptness of the present Opposition Parties. As far as we are concerned, we have no fear of conditions in which the people can see the choice clearly before them. To say there is any intention of Fianna Fáil performing a rescue operation on either of the Opposition Parties is quite ridiculous and nobody on the Fianna Fáil side ever made any such statement.  No one can help them except themselves and, judging by the craven Fine Gael response to their leader's efforts to revive them, their future does not appear to be too bright.</P>
    <P>I want to say quite clearly now that, when Senator Garret FitzGerald alleged I promised them success in the second next election if this legislation is passed, he was saying something that he must have known to be untrue, because I never said any such thing. I do not think the Irish people are prepared to accept Fine Gael at the next election, or the second next election, in their present state. All I said was that, if the Irish people ever wanted to get rid of Fianna Fáil, this proposed system would give them a very effective way of doing that. I certainly never said anything approaching what Senator Garret FitzGerald alleged I said and I challenge him to produce any such statement by me.</P>
    <P>I did imply that this system would provide a possibility of Fine Gael success at some time in the future, but this would, of course, depend on some very far-fetched assumptions. First of all, it would depend on the unlikely event of Deputy Cosgrave succeeding <Col N="2701" /> in overcoming the inferiority complex of his Party and instilling some backbone into it. Secondly, it would depend on the unlikely event of Fine Gael succeeding in their continuous search for a policy acceptable to the people, a search which shows no more signs of being successful now that it's directed apparently, from University College, Dublin, instead of from the Law Library, as heretofore. As far as I am concerned, nobody can assure Fine Gael of success either now, or at any time in the future, and I certainly did not purport to give any such assurance and I do not think anybody else in Fianna Fáil did so either.</P>
    <P>Maybe somebody did try to assure the Fine Gael Party that they would be successful in the second next general election and maybe Senator Garret FitzGerald is thinking of Deputy Cosgrave. Maybe Deputy Cosgrave tried to assure the Party of this all right, but so far from my assuring Fine Gael of success, the reverse is the case. Time and time again I have claimed that to attempt to forecast what will happen under the circumstances we are proposing would be an idle exercise indeed. I even disclaimed having sufficient knowledge of how the people would vote on which to base a gerrymander, as it was alleged I intended to do. The furthest I have gone is to say that the seven by-elections we have had during the term of this Dáil, in which the issues were somewhat similar to those in a general election, though not exactly identical, indicated as clearly as it is possible to indicate that, in the next general election, we are as certain as it is possible to be of being returned as the Government under proportional representation, but, as to what would happen under the changed circumstances we propose now, nobody can say what the result may be because the constituencies are not yet known and neither are the candidates in the different constituencies. We have had, however, the clearest possible indication from the seven by-elections, six of which we won against the combined efforts of the Opposition and a diversity of tactics, that we are as near as possible, under the present system, to certainty of being returned as the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2702" /> I do not think I need go into any further detail in regard to these by-elections and the clear indication they gave because the indication is, I know, just as clear to Fine Gael as it is to us. What may happen after the next general election is completely unknown, as far as I am concerned, and I would not waste my time trying to forecast the future, certainly not beyond the next general election. It depends on too many things. It depends on our performance as a Government. It depends on there being more realism in Opposition policies. In depends to a large extent on the success or failure of Deputy Cosgrave's efforts to instill some confidence into his own Party. My own opinion is that it is a waste of time to indulge in long-range forecasting.  It was not I who said that this proposed system, or any other system, will perpetuate Fianna Fáil. It was not Fianna Fáil who said it was inconceivable that at any time in the future either Fine Gael or Labour will find it possible to convince more people than we can in a majority of these 144 single-seat constituencies. It was not Fianna Fáil who said that in no circumstances is there any possibility of an alternative Government to Fianna Fáil except a Coalition. It was the Opposition who said all these things.</P>
    <P>Senator Garret FitzGerald spent a considerable time trying to justify this famous forecast of his with regard to what would happen under the straight vote. It will be quite obvious to anyone who examines what he said that he lost himself in explaining the intricacies of his method of working. He was at pains to justify them although nobody was calling them into question. It is the basis on which he founds his whole process that is important and his basis was completely unjustifiable and, therefore, quite irrelevant. What is much more important than all Senator FitzGerald's percentages is the question of who will oppose whom in individual constituencies and how will those constituencies be delineated. It will obviously affect the result if the Taoiseach and Deputy Barrett oppose one another in the same constituency in Cork. In Laois-Offaly I suppose the Fianna Fáil candidate opposing Deputy Oliver Flanagan would not be held to <Col N="2703" /> have as good a chance as the Fianna Fáil candidate opposing Deputy O'Higgins. Senator Rooney's prospects of being elected in County Dublin would hardly be as good if he were opposed by Deputy P.J. Burke as they might be if he went forward in a constituency in which Deputy P.J. Burke would not be a candidate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would rather oppose the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>He might have a better chance if he were opposing me. But these are all relevant considerations and they are considerations unknown to Senator FitzGerald, or anybody else, who indulges in this time-wasting effort of making long-range forecasts. The Commission has not yet been set up to draw up the constituencies and the candidates have not been picked for the different constituencies.</P>
      <P>I had been dealing with the position in Laois-Offaly. This may very well explain why Deputy Oliver Flanagan is so much in favour of this proposal and why Deputy O'Higgins is not. Deputy O'Higgins would, I think, be reasonably inclined to retain the present system under which he can be elected on the surplus of his more popular colleague and under which he can see prospects of a Coalition Government of which he would be likely to become a member: in circumstances of a Coalition, he can obviously hope to be a Minister as long as he has his colleague, Deputy Flanagan, to bring him into the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obviously a very relevant question, on which no information was available to the forecasters, as to who will oppose whom, but to base the projection on constituencies that can have no possible relationship to the constituencies that will be established under the Bill is, of course, nonsense. Instead of dealing with local electoral areas where the population varies from 3,603 to 51,792, it is essential to have information about the actual constituencies as well as about the candidates. As well, the issues at local elections are completely different. In that case, there is no danger of a change in Government and it is safe to think only of <Col N="2704" /> local questions and of personal preferences for individuals. The candidates at local elections are completely different as well, and the issues are not national ones. It is a completely different thing in a general election.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, the advantages of single-seat constituencies were not seriously disputed. It was more or less agreed that the Deputies elected would be better able to represent the constituencies, better able to keep in close contact with their constituents. In addition there is the fact that they would have less organisational work to do with smaller areas to cover and this, of course, would leave them with more time to perform their fundamental functions as Members of the Oireachtas, as legislators.</P>
    <P>Instead, the Opposition based their arguments on the contention that the present system was designed to provide representation for minorities, on the basis that the only alternative to Fianna Fáil Government is a Coalition and that the present system is one that makes more feasible a situation likely to result in a Coalition Government, that these proposals in the Bill would operate against such conditions and, thirdly, that this was a proposition of Fianna Fáil&mdash;that Fianna Fáil were inherently evil and that therefore this is wrong, despite the fact that this was official Fine Gael policy up to 1959.</P>
    <P>Obviously of course if the electoral system is designed to ensure representation for minorities, it must also promote the formation of Parties on the basis of minority interests. It therefore must inevitably, unless it fails in its design, result in a similar type of situation here to what other PR systems have produced in other countries. It has not done it yet, but everybody knows why not. There is the fact that the political divisions here were in the first instance formed on the lines of Free Staters <i>versus</i> Republicans&mdash;of those who sold out in 1922 and those who&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It persisted for a considerable time and, damaging as it <Col N="2705" /> was at the start, it did at least save us from having our political system on the same out-of-date lines as they have in Britain and, temporarily, from the worst splintering effects this system is designed to produce. As well, we had the solidarity of Fianna Fáil and the fact that Fianna Fáil succeeded in retaining the confidence of the majority of the people. That was due, of course, to the broad basis of our Party and the realism and comprehensiveness of our policies. Another reason was, of course, the remarkable capacity of Fine Gael for consuming small Parties. However, as I said, it is inevitable that this system will develop here in the future as it has done in other countries.</P>
      <P>There are, then, the advantages of the single-seat constituencies, and I have made it clear that so far as I am concerned the main purpose of this proposal is to obtain these advantages and to get rid of the disadvantages, the evils and the danger of multi-member constituencies. I do not propose to go into these reasons again because I have already put them on record here and in the Dáil. I do not consider it necessary for me to go into them again, but one thing I am called on to do, in view of the fact that this alleged argument has been repeated here so often, is to deal with the non-removal of the system of PR at the time of the enactment of the 1937 Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1937 Constitution was the culminating stage in the first period of Fianna Fáil Government. It was the natural conclusion to a whole series of steps taken by Fianna Fáil to erode the status of the Irish Free State which was established by the Treaty of 1922 in the manner we all know so well. I think most Senators know of the determined last-ditch effort that was made by the Opposition Parties to hang on at least to this last vestige of foreign control in this country. Every possible argument was made to try to ensure that the people would not enact for themselves this new Constitution. Every effort was made to arouse opposition to each individual Article in the Constitution: and the mere fact that the Fine Gael Party of that time happened to be campaigning against PR <Col N="2706" /> would not, of course, have been sufficient to counter the effect that a proposal to remove it would have had on those who wanted to retain it. The fact that a proposal to remove PR in the 1937 Constitution would have been in compliance with part of the Fine Gael policy did not, of course, go any part of the way to overcome their inherent opposition to the enactment of a Republican Constitution here but it would have given one more argument against at least one Article of the Constitution, and the Articles were not voted on separately. The Constitution had to be dealt with in the same way as this, by one question, either for or against.</P>

      <P>Therefore, Fianna Fáil would have been foolish in the extreme to have given that extra argument to the Opposition which might conceivably have resulted in the retention of the Irish Free State Constitution which might have defeated the culminating stage in Fianna Fáil's first period as a Government.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Senator Rooney is now referring to the latest way in which the Fine Gael Party proved their complete unreliability on any national issue. In 1925, first of all, they ratified the Boundary Agreement. They had it registered as an international agreement.  They passed that infamous Agreement by a majority of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Then when they got back again they made it more difficult to do anything about remedying their act of treachery in 1925. So far as we are concerned the 1937 <Col N="2707" /> Constitution achieved its fundamental objective of getting rid, for all time, of any vestige of British domination in this part of the country that was not given away by our predecessors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and by those who are opposing us on these proposals here.</P>
      <P>The only other aspect of this Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill I want to refer to is to point out once again that in addition to getting rid of the disadvantages of multi-member constituencies and gaining the advantages of single-seat constituencies this Bill also does something else important and that is that it proposes to establish for the first time here the principle of one man, one vote, the principle of treating every voter in exactly the same way. Although I have made it clear that this is also one of the effects of the proposals here nobody has attempted to contradict that argument because, of course, I made it absolutely clear that the present system which is cynically described as the single transferable vote is, in fact, a system that confers multiple votes on some unidentified members of the community but which decrees that the majority of the voters will have one vote only. That is another important thing that this proposal does &mdash;it gets rid of this undemocratic discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can see the position now is that this long filibuster, this long attempt to keep this proposal from the people which has persisted from 21st February until the end of July has now come to an end, that the Opposition have not been able even by the deployment of all their forces, including rugged Independents, to delay it any longer and now the people will have to decide. I am quite convinced that the only effect of all this delay has been to produce a change in the attitude of the Fine Gael Party. I am perfectly convinced that even if there was only fractionally less than 50 per cent of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party in favour of the attitude of the leader of <Col N="2708" /> the Party by now a substantial majority of Fine Gael supporters throughout the country have come around to the viewpoint of their leader; they appreciate that in the unlikely eventuality of it being possible to instill some backbone into the Party at some time in the future that this is a system which will give them an opportunity of eventually forming a government of their own.</P>

      <P>That does not mean for one moment that I am suggesting that at any time the people will be, in the words of Deputy Dillon, so daft as ever to elect a Fine Gael government, but in the unlikely event of their continuous search for a policy eventually producing something that a reasonable percentage of the people can be induced to accept and in the unlikely event of their present leader succeeding in instilling some backbone into them, then this system will make it possible for them to become a government.</P>

      <P>It is being admitted that under present circumstances it is not conceivable that the Fianna Fáil Government could ever be replaced by a Fine Gael Government or by any other single Party Government. The whole approach certainly in the Dáil and partly here also was an appeal, a pathetic appeal, for a continuation of an electoral system that makes the formation of coalition governments a feasible proposition, behind the backs of the people. Of course the system we propose will not in any way prevent the people from choosing a Coalition Government if they want it but it will make it more difficult for a confidence trick to be played on the people. It will make it more compulsive for the Opposition to put that proposal to the people and then if the people want a coalition government they can choose it at elections under the clear-cut condition that we propose. I agree there is no reason why they should not have a coalition government if they want it but I do think it is necessary, in order <Col N="2709" /> to conform with the principles of democracy, that they should be told that in advance of the elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever that the people will make those two electoral reforms and that the Dáil and Seanad will be much more effective bodies as a result and the people will have the <Col N="2710" /> satisfaction of knowing at election time that they can perform their fundamental democratic function of choosing their own government. We believe that is the purpose of elections.</P>
