      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Exported Live Stock (Insurance) Bill is a Bill to amend the original Acts which were passed in 1940 and 1943. These Acts together with the present Bill, if it is passed, constitute the framework of a mutual insurance system operated by the live stock exporters in this country to indemnify themselves against the ordinary hazards of that trade by way of injury to the live stock in transit and by way of compensation for carcases or parts of carcases which are condemend at slaughter as a result of some defect which is revealed subsequent to slaughter and which has not been perceptible until the carcase is dressed.  In view of the character of this legislation I thought it proper, and I am sure the Seanad will agree with me, to consult constantly and exhaustively with the Live Stock Exporters' Organisation and as a result of protracted discussions in which every conceivable contingency was carefully envisaged a draft was arrived at for submission to the Government in respect of which the National Executive of the Irish Live-stock Trade addressed the following letter to me on the 9th February:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In reference to your letter of the 7th inst. in regard to the revised <Col N="930" /> draft of the Exported Live Stock (Insurance) Bill, 1950, I am to inform you that at a special meeting of the National Executive held on the 8th February the Bill has been approved and I have been asked to impress upon you that this Bill should be passed with all possible speed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Seanad will naturally wonder why the last paragraph appeared in the letter, but I think will readily understand the difficulty when they realise that the infirmities from which the previous Acts suffered made it impossible to compensate cattle exporters for certain losses for which quite manifestly it was intended that they should be covered but which had not been foreseen at the time of the drafting of the original legislation.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, since the original legislation was passed a new liability has arisen of which I wish to tell the Seanad.  At the time of the Trade Agreement in 1948 a new price scale for fact cattle was agreed between ourselves and the British Government. In connection with that agreement a new basis of delivery was at the same time arranged.  Prior to 1948 in respect of fat cattle delivered for slaughter at Birkenhead the consignor was liable for defects of any kind only up to the point where the beast was finally examined on the hoof by an inspector on behalf of the Ministry of Food in Birkenhead.  That was an arrangement arrived at during the war. Under the new agreement it was provided that any defect which became manifest in the carcase after it had been dressed was the liability of the consignor and therefore a beast which appeared on the hoof to be perfectly all right but which on being dressed revealed a bruise of serious dimensions or disease would suffer condemnation in proportion to the defect and the price payable for the carcase would be abated by that amount.  That was a new liability on the consignor.</P>
    <P>I am glad to tell the Seanad that over a period of six months, from June to December, 1949, out of exports of fat cattle to the value of £4,513,265 the total liability for all forms of loss through disease, bruising or otherwise <Col N="931" /> has amounted to no more than .62 of 1 per cent.  Nevertheless .62 of 1 per cent. appeared to me to be a matter for consideration and I therefore stipulated with the British Government that in consideration of the Irish consignor undertaking that liability there should be a corresponding concession from them.  Heretofore&mdash;and I apologise to the Seanad for inflicting on them such technicalities of the dead meat trade&mdash; the kidneys of a beast were deemed to be offal and therefore were not paid for by the consignee.  Subsequent to this agreement it was determined that these kidneys should be weighed with the carcase with their attendant fat and paid for at the price of the carcase.  The average receipt on a beast works out in the order of 5/- and the average liability undertaken works out at something in our judgment&mdash; although this is a figure about which we cannot be precise&mdash;between 5/- and 5/9.  But in that figure of 5/9 there is provision for a new hazard which did not exist prior to the agreement of 1948 but for which it is thought expedient to make provision now.</P>
    <P>Inasmuch as this new liability with corresponding measures to meet it arises out of the agreement of 1948 it is perhaps appropriate to give the Seanad a short sketch of the other relevant consequences of that agreement on the trade.  Prior to the agreement there were three grades of cattle: A, B and what was called &ldquo;manufactured&rdquo;. Subsequent to the agreement there were four grades: &ldquo;special&rdquo;, A, B, and &ldquo;manufactured.&rdquo;  In the six months to which I have already referred, from June to December, 1949, of all the steers and heifers, fat, going to Great Britain for immediate slaughter, 99.1 were graded &ldquo;special&rdquo;, or A; .8 of 1 per cent. were graded B and .1 per cent. were graded &ldquo;manufactured.&rdquo; This, on the whole, I think the Seanad will agree, indicates an informed appreciation by the British Ministry of Food of the quality of Irish cattle.  The price for A grade cattle prior to the agreement was 1/1½d., falling to 1/- according to the season.  The price of special quality to-day is 1/8¾d. and of A quality 1s. 8¼d. per lb., falling to 1s. 5¾d. and <Col N="932" /> 1s. 5¼d. respectively according to the season.  The number of fat cattle exported in 1947 was 110,000; in 1948, 66,000; and in 1949, 134,000.  The rates of levy made under this insurance code began in 1940 at 2 per cent., declined to ½ per cent. on 19th October, 1942, and have remained at that level since then.</P>
    <P>There are certain minor matters to which I should like to draw the attention of the Seanad and which are provided for in this Bill.  Section 6 enables travelling expenses to be paid to authorised officers of the insurance board who, for the purposes and business of the fund, are directed by the executive to undertake travelling in Ireland or Great Britain.  Section 7 allows a differentiation between the rate of levy for different types of cattle, but that, of course, would only be operated after careful consideration and where it was deemed by the trade and by the Minister to be a proper and prudent course to pursue.</P>
    <P>Section 8 removes an anomaly. Under the existing law, if the board wanted to reinvestigate one item in a large claim, they had no power to do so but were constrained to reopen a reinvestigation of the whole claim. Now if an award calls for re-examination, or if an investigation calls for reexamination, and the two parties to the claim are agreed as to 95 per cent. of it, the board can confine its attention to the remaining 5 per cent., without reopening the merits of the rest.</P>
    <P>I think that covers the substance and purpose of the Bill.  Before I conclude, I ask a favour of the Seanad. Senators will remember that the last paragraph of the letter I read spoke of the urgency which the live stock trade attach to the passing of this Bill.  The reason for that is that a number of men in a modest way of business have what are, for them, substantial claims against the fund which cannot be paid unless and until this amending Bill is passed into law.  They, therefore, naturally hope that it can be passed into law at the earliest possible date, so that their claims may be passed upon and, if found justified, liquidated. If, on reflection, the Seanad feels free to facilitate me in that, I shall be much obliged.  I am at the service of the <Col N="933" /> Seanad to give Senators any further information they may require and which I may have overlooked providing at this stage.</P>

      <P>Is dócha go dteastaíonn ón Senadóir Ó Cuanacháin a anáil a thairringt.  Bhí mé a cheapadh gurb é a thosódh an díospóireacht ar an mBille, dá mbeadh díospóireacht ar bith le bheith ann.  Támuid buíoch don Aire as ucht an méid cuntais a thug sé dúinn ar an scéal seo ach tá tuille eolais ba mhaith liom a cuirfí ar fáil, más féidir.  Mar shampla, ba mhaith liom go gcuirfí in iúl don tSeanad, ionas go mbeadh sé ar tuairiscí an Tí, céard é stair an scéil seo ar fad.  Cén chaoi ar tháining an chéad Acht isteach?  Céard iad na deacrachtaí a bhí ann do na ceannaithe ins an am a tugadh an Acht isteach?  An bhfuarthas amach go raibh sé lochtach ann féin; is é sin le rá, chomh fada agus is eol dom, ceapadh an tAcht sin tar éis comhairle a glacadh le ionmhuirithe stoic go Sasana.  Deir an tAire go raibh lochta ar an Acht sin.  Ar tharla na lochta sin san Acht de bhrí go rabhthas míchúramach nuair a bhí an tAcht á cheapadh nó ar tháinig na lochta ar aghaidh de bharr an tsocruithe a rinneadh le Sasana sa bhliain 1948? Sílim nach mbeadh ann ach cothrom na féinne a chur in iúl dúinn an mar gheall ar, mar dúurt mé, an tAcht buan a bheith lochtach ann féin nó an mar gheall air an &ldquo;new liability&rdquo; seo ar thagair an tAire dhó a tháinig ar aghaidh de bharr socruithe 1948.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom freisin beagán eolais a fháil, más féidir é chur ar fáil, ar cé mhéad airgid a bailíod le haghaidh an chiste árachais.  Deir an tAire gur bailíodh a dó faoin gcéad no 2 per cent. Céard a chiallaíos an dó faoin gcéad&mdash; dó faoin gcéad de luach na mbeithíoch a cuireadh thar sáile amach?  D'fhéidfimis an t-eolas a fháil ach bhreathnú siar ar an &ldquo;Abstract,&rdquo; ach ba mhaith dá n-innseodh an tAire dúinn, má tá na figiúirí aige, cé mhéad a bailíodh ó bhliain go blian agus ansin cé mhéad a caitheadh as an gciste ó bhlian go blian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is maith liom go ndúirt an tAire gur comhartha an réiteach a rinneadh i 1948 ar an meas atá ag na Sasanaigh ar <Col N="934" /> stoc na hÉireann.  Tugann sé sin pleisiúr dom mar gheall ar díospóireacht a bhí againn sa Seanad cupla bliain ó shoin nuair a cuireadh i leith stoic na hÉireann go raibh sé lofa le eitinn.  San am, níor chreideamar é. San am, dúramar gur chaint é sin a rinneadh le misc d'aonturas le dochar a dhéanamh do thrádáil stoic na tíre seo le Sasana.  Is maith liom gur cruthú an socrú sin nach raibh mórán brí sa gcaint sin agus gur cruthú é go raibh muinín ag na Sasanaigh as stoc na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>Thairis sin, tá na hargointí céanna ann inniu i bhfábhar an Bille seo agus a bhí ann an chéad lá a tugadh an Bille buan isteach.  Argóintí láidre a bhí ann agus ar an ábhar sin, ní fheicim go mbeadh aon locht againn ar an mBille a thabhairt don Aire agus é a thabhairt dó chomh luath agus is féidir dúinn é.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is not a Government Bill and it is not the Minister's Bill.  It is solely and entirely a cattle trade Bill, for the protection of the cattle trade and&mdash;a feature with which the Government will be pleased&mdash; we are asking for no money or contribution from anybody to protect ourselves. The Minister has very lucidly explained the object of the Bill, which is to legalise the payment by the Exported Livestock Insurance Company to exporters of fat cattle to the Ministry of Food in respect of any losses they may have sustained.  As the Minister said, under previous agreements, the system was that cattle were graded on the hoof and some were subsequently graded as manufactured, which grade commanded a very small price.  Since the new agreement which came into operation in 1948, we have exported 111,814 fat cattle to the Ministry of Food for slaughter up to 31st December, 1949, a period of approximately one and a half years.  Under the previous agreement, the consignor was liable for any losses, but as against that, the kidneys were cut out of the carcase and the cutting out of the kidney, a little over three lbs., involved taking another lb. off the carcase with it, which meant four lbs. extra weight for the cattle exported. Taking that weight at 1/6½d. a lb., it amounted to 6/2d., and, in respect of <Col N="935" /> the entire 111,814 fat cattle exported, the total loss through condemnation, down-grading and bruising, was £38,413-5-0, which meant a loss to the exporter of 6/10d., so that the total loss to the exporter on the basis of what he gained from the cutting and what he lost through down-grading was 8d. for every beast exported.  Putting that loss against what the exporter got, it is certainly a very small amount.</P>
      <P>The 1948 agreement increased the price for top-grade cattle by 1½d. per lb., and for lowest grade cattle by 3/4d. per lb.  To put it another way, it increased the price which the exporter got for the first quality bullock by over £4 and for lowest grade animals by £2. Under that trade agreement, the producer is protected.  A very big number of the producers are exporting to the Ministry of Food themselves and are not going through any middlemen. When the exporter has no protection and suffers any serious loss, it will come back eventually on the producer.</P>
      <P>I intended to put in some amendments to ensure that that provision will be carried out.  The Minister thinks it would hold up the Bill if the amendments were put in.  In that case, it would be better to put the Bill through, even if we have to bring in an amending Bill, if this one does not work satisfactorily, so I will not force the amendments to-day, as it is important to get all stages of the Bill carried through.</P>
      <P>Every Senator knows that members of the cattle trade have been attacked by all sections.  We are not paying the people the compensation they are entitled to receive, as we cannot do it, we are advised, until this Bill is passed. I could discuss the form of amendment on the Committee Stage, if we got it to-day.  If I get an assurance from the Minister that what he has stated to the national executive of the live stock trade is correct, that we could make an Order, we would be quite satisfied to let the Bill go through all stages and pay the people the money which is due to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of a Bill of this nature.  It is <Col N="936" /> in keeping with the idea of establishing a vocational Seanad here that we should from time to time introduce Bills to deal with a particular vocation. I regret very much that the Minister was not as helpful as he might have been in his opening speech.  I regret much more that Senator Counihan was not as outspoken and as fair to the House as he should have been on this Bill.  When the original Bill was before the House, it was welcomed from all sides.  It was acclaimed as a very good idea that the cattle trade should carry their own insurance, that where there are losses in the export of cattle or other live stock from time to time the consignors of such animals should not be at a loss.</P>
      <P>Neither the Minister not Senator Counihan have given us information as to the urgency of this Bill or what brought about its introduction.  Is it as a result of a flaw in the original Bill or does it arise from the Articles of Agreement made with the Ministry of Food of another country in 1948? We are not quite clear on that.  Was the original Bill faulty, making it impossible to give compensation to those who should get it, or since the Articles of Agreement were entered into has the whole face been changed?  If so, we should have a clear exposition of what brought about the change.</P>
      <P>Senator Counihan let the cat out of the bag in his opening statement when he said this Bill was necessary as a result of the 1948 agreement.  The last thing I would like to do is misquote him.  I assume he agrees with me that he did make that statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a good idea, a Chathaoirligh, even at this late stage, if the Minister and Senator Counihan have any disagreement, that they should settle it outside and try to come in with an agreed measure. Senator Counihan agrees that he made the statement that the present Bill is <Col N="937" /> necessary and arises out of an agreement entered into by an Irish Minister in 1948 with a British Minister.  If the Minister is not in agreement with that and can give us sufficient proof that that is not so, I suppose the House will accept his explanation.</P>
      <P>Senator Counihan, as a nominee of the Live Stock Breeders' Association in this House, has thought it fit to think out certain amendments to this Bill.  They have been circulated, not to every member but to those whom the association thought would be interested in their welfare.  I entirely disagree with Senator Counihan's approach to this Bill.  I cannot understand that he, as their elected representative here, should put before the members of the Agricultural Panel certain proposals which he and they as an organisation think would be very beneficial to have incorporated in this Bill and then, because the Minister is not prepared to accept the principles enshrined in these amendments, Senator Counihan immediately retires.</P>

      <P>I listened with great interest to this debate, which has had a useful side as well as a deplorable side. Many thousands of pounds are due to several individuals.  That is the root cause of the Bill.  The Bill, as it stands, removes that grievance.  Any additions relate only to difficulties that may arise in future.  Therefore, I would implore Senator Hawkins to let the Bill go through.  We can always put it right in future.  This Bill does remove a grievance that affects the past.  It is vital in the interests of many hardworking exporters of live stock.  It is essential to get them paid the money which is held up pending the passing of this Bill.  The amendments will not help that.  They will possibly help events in future.  That is all.  I would implore the Opposition to let the Bill go through all stages so that we could get it passed before Monday next and put these unhappy people in a position of solvency.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my voice to Senator McGee's in asking Senator Hawkins to allow this Bill to go through.  I am interested in some very small men in the exporting trade who have been for a considerable time waiting for compensation for their stock and who have been awaiting the introduction of this Bill.  This Bill meets all the difficulties that confronted them. I do not think any of us would be in order in discussing amendments which were never moved and which most of us know nothing about.  What does concern us is that this Bill removes the difficulties of most of the men that we know in the exporting trade.  I, for one, thank the Minister for bringing it forward and for his anxiety to get it through as quickly as possible so that these men may be paid.  I would appeal to the Opposition to let the Bill go through.</P>

There is no opposition to this Bill as far as I know, except the Minister himself.  The Minister tries to wield the big stick, which he has often done before, and tries to tell us that if this Bill does not go through to-day it will not go through until the Lord knows when.</P>

      <P>As a member of the Cattle Traders' Association and as one who has been a cattle trader in the past, I know what their needs are and I am quite prepared to make practically any sacrifice on their behalf. Neither do I yield to any man in my interest in the plain, ordinary, honest-to-God farmers of this country.  It is because I realise that anything we do for the cattle traders in this Bill is incidentally an act in favour of the working farmers of this country that I am so much interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that this is the only Minister who tells us that a particular Bill that he is piloting through the House must be passed before a certain date.  Governments may come and Governments may go but every Minister who comes to the House has some reason why a Bill must be passed next week, or the week after, as if the end of the world was coming.  My attitude on that is that if amendments <Col N="941" /> have been suggested by the people directly interested, by the people who are in a position to know, those amendments should at least be discussed by this House before they are turned down peremptorily by this or any other Minister.  I suggest that the end of the world will not come next week.  It may.  Some people say it will.  Others say it will come the week after.  Others say it will be thousands of years before it comes.  I believe there is no such rush.  I know that cattle dealers have been held up for their money and I sympathise with those people.  They have been held up, not alone for the last week or two weeks but for the past two years.  I would say that another fortnight will not destroy the Cattle Traders' Association or the cattle traders concerned.  What we should do is postpone the remaining stages, discuss the amendments and, if they have not the support of the House, then they do not go into the Bill.  I do not think that is unreasonable.  To suggest that the so-called Opposition in this House &mdash;if there are any political Parties in this House&mdash;are against this measure is complete misrepresentation of facts. We just will not stand for it.  That is all.</P>

If they do not get it until this day month and it is held up by this House let it be clear that it is Senator Quirke, Senator Hawkins and his colleagues who are doing this.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>What is of concern to the House is the principle embodied in the Bill and whether the House will accept that principle or not.  The principle is a very simple one.  It is a debt that is overdue to be paid.  There is no authority to pay that debt to a number of people until this Bill is passed.  The live stock trade are the people principally interested but it is the Minister who has to provide the machinery that enables this compensation <Col N="943" /> to be paid to these people.  I felt that on all sides of the House the Minister would be acclaimed for his readiness to facilitate the live stock industry in paying these people what is their just due.  If there are some people who have a different point of view, one cannot help it.  I take it the position is that we are all in agreement that this Bill should get a Second Reading.  I think perhaps this question of amendments was something that need not have been brought across the discussion of the principle of the Bill.  Perhaps one should leave it at that.  I hope that the Opposition are prepared to give a Second Reading to the Bill and then let us discuss what we will do next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very gladly.  I withdraw. Here are the words which Senator Quirke described as threatening the Seanad and as holding the big stick over their heads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Before I conclude, I ask a favour of the Seanad.  Senators will remember <Col N="945" /> that the last paragraph of the letter I read spoke of the urgency which the live stock trade attach to the passing of this Bill.  The reason for that is that a number of men in a modest way of business have what are for them substantial claims against the fund which cannot be paid unless and until this amending Bill is passed into law.  They, therefore, naturally, hope that it can be passed into law at the earliest possible date so that their claims may be based and, if found justified, liquidated.  If, on reflection, the Seanad feels free to facilitate me in that, I shall be profoundly obliged.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If any reasonable member of this House can discern in any word or paragraph of what I have read out a suspicion of any sentiment but one of respectful courtesy to Seanad Éireann, I would be glad to have that paragraph indicated to me.  Senators are solicitous that they should be treated with respect.  Anyone who is a Senator of this country is entitled to be treated with respect, but so have Ministers a similar right, deriving from the same source, and not to their own persons, but to the office bestowed upon them.  I think those words, characterised by every standard, are words of propriety and respect.  They have been described by Senator Quirke as threatening, dictatorial and highly offensive.  If my words merit any such adjective, then, in my submission, Sir, it becomes impossible for any rational man to approach the Seanad at all.  I know of no form of words at my command which can in more suitable language make known to Seanad Éireann a facility which I have a perfect right to ask for, if contemporaneously I make it clear that I fully recognise the absolute discretion of the Seanad to grant or withhold the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Buachalla inquired whether the cattle exporters were consulted as to the terms of the 1948 negotiations.  To the best of my recollection, they were not consulted by me prior to those negotiations.  I cannot vouch for whether there was any discussion between the association and <Col N="946" /> officers of my Department.  Senator Ó Buachalla and Senator Hawkins wish to know if this Bill was necessary as a result of some infirmity in the earlier Acts or as a result of an ailment in the 1948 Trade Agreement. Fortunately, I caused my observations in opening to be taken in shorthand. Accordingly, I am able to remind the Seanad that within the last half an hour I spoke as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Seanad would naturally wonder why the last paragraph appeared in the letter but I think will readily understand the difficulty when they realise that the infirmities from which the previous Acts suffered made it impossible to compensate cattle exporters for certain losses for which quite manifestly it was intended that they should be covered but which were not foreseen at the time of the drafting of the original legislation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I here should interpolate that not one Act but two Acts are now amended:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In addition to that since the original legislation was passed a new liability has arisen of which I wish to tell the Seanad.  At the time of the Trade agreement of 1948 a new price scale for fat cattle was agreed between ourselves and the British Government.  In connection with that agreement a new basis of delivery was at the same time arranged.  Prior to 1948 in respect of fat cattle delivered for slaughter at Birkenhead the consignor was liable for the defects of any kind only up to the point where the beast was finally examined on the hoof by an inspector on behalf of the Ministry of Food in Birkenhead.  That was an arrangement arrived at during the war.  Under the new agreement it was provided that any defect which became manifest in the carcase after it had been dressed was the liability of the consignor and therefore a beast which appeared on the hoof to be perfectly all right but which on being dressed revealed a bruise of serious dimensions or disease would suffer condemnation in proportion to the defect and the price paid for the <Col N="947" /> carcase would be abated by that amount.  That was a new liability on the consignor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then I proceeded to give the Seanad certain statistical material for which I must apologise for having to inflict on them technicalities of the dead meat trade:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the kidneys of the beast were deemed to be offal, and therefore were not paid for by the consignee. Subsequent to this agreement it was determined that these kidneys should be weighed with the carcase with their attendant fat and paid for at the price of the carcase. The average receipt on a beast works out in the order of 5/- and the average liability undertaken works out at something in our judgement&mdash;although this is a figure about which we cannot be precise&mdash;between 5/- and 5/9.  But in that figure of 5/9 there is provision for a new hazard which did not exist prior to the Agreement of 1948 but for which it is thought expedient to make provision now. Inasmuch as this new liability with corresponding measures to meet it arises out of the Agreement of 1948, it is perhaps appropriate to give the Seanad a short sketch of the other relevant consequences of that agreement on the trade.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What I have just read out has been described by two prominent Senators of the Oppostion Party as rank failure to furnish the Seanad with adequate information as to the size of the liabilities to be provided for and as to the nature of the contingencies envisaged in the preparation of this Bill.  I told the Seanad that my application to them for a favour arose out of my, I think, understandable solicitude for the smaller cattle men who ship a few beasts and who depend for their living on their ability to go to the fair or market and pay for the beasts they ship with the cash they carry and I asked a favour.  To have one's request received with the victorian <i>politesse</i> which the Opposition has shown me on this occasion is a most inspiring experience.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan may rest assured <Col N="948" /> that the two points which interested him had been carefully examined and. I am advised by the Attornery General, are amply provided for under the two Acts read in conjunction with this Bill if and when this Bill becomes law.  I do not give a fiddle-de-dee what the Seanad does with this Bill; I do not give a fiddle-de-dee how long they choose to delay it.  If I were ever imprudent enough to ask a favour of the Seanad, I apologise for that folly. I shall not fall into the same mistake again.</P>

      <P>I have a note of that. The total amounts levied and the total amounts disbursed are not immediately to hand from the accounts of the fund, but they will be procured and furnished to the Senator.  I am in a position to tell him, however, that the total disbursements since 1940 were in the order of £1,000,000 sterling and that at the present rate of disbursement, the levies, plus the incomes from certain investments which the fund hold, have about equalled their outgoings.  It is anticipated, however, that as the number of cattle shipped grows it may well be that the present percentage of levies will prove equal to any claim made upon the fund but if that should not transpire, there is power under legislation in consultation with the Minister, to make such adjustments as may be necessary to make the fund solvent from time to time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment of the Seanad last Wednesday, I was dealing with some of the reasons advanced by the Minister for the introduction of the Bill.  I found fault with these reasons and I was trying to indicate why I was dissatisfied. As to how much exactly I have already said I am not quite sure at the moment.  I got the report only when I came in to-day just before lunch and I had not time to go through it as I should have.  However, I hope I will be able to avoid repeating anything I have already said.  I think that the last matter I was dealing with was the closing of the branch lines.  The Minister said, both in the Dáil and in the Seanad, that that was a very drastic recommendation, one that he could not accept, one of the reasons why he thought he should have sent the ex-chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann away, one of the reasons he advanced why he should get rid of the board as soon as possible and replace it by a new one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two points&mdash;the reduction in <Col N="951" /> staff and the closing of branch lines&mdash; seem to me to hang pretty well together. The Minister indicated that he resented this suggestion of sending men away&mdash;3,500, a big number.  He repeated it for my benefit&mdash;3,500&mdash;and said that it was a very big number.  It was so drastic that he could not accept it, so drastic a suggestion that he thought the board that would make it an incompetent one and the chairman who would be responsible for submitting the proposal an incompetent chairman. I find it very hard to believe that the Minister is so worried about the disemployment of men.  I find it very hard to believe that he is so worried about the closing of branch lines and the consequential results on employment.</P>
    <P>People in Dublin with all their associations in Dublin may not feel as I feel about it, but I cannot understand this paternal interest of the Minister in disemployment, especially when I remember the thousands of men and women who have been driven out of employment by this Minister and when I remember the fact that this Minister was responsible for snatching the very crust out of the mouths of men, women and children in Donegal, Mayo, Galway, Clare, Limerick and Kerry. If the Minister is going to advance disemployment on the railways as an excuse for the introduction of this Bill, as an excuse for his stricture on the ex-chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann and of the board, he will have to try again.  I certainly do not accept it.</P>
    <P>The next point the Minister put before us was this matter of the increase in fares that was suggested by the ex-chairman and board of Córas Iompair Éireann.  This was included in the drastic set of proposals that came from these people to the Minister.  He could not see his way to accept them.  He felt that they were of such a nature and that it was such an irresponsible suggestion that he could no longer trust the chairman or the board.  The board merely suggested that it ought to be allowed to increase charges sufficiently to enable the company to pay its way.  Is there anything wrong in that? Sir James Milne has something to say <Col N="952" /> about it at paragraph 243, on page 44:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The wages and conditions of employment applicable to all railway staff must be fair and reasonable in relation to those obtaining in other industries, and public transport undertakings, like other industries, should be allowed to increase their charges as necessary to cover additional costs arising from circumstances outside their control such as the rise which has taken place during recent years in the general level of wages and the prices of materials.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to apologise to the House for quoting to the extent to which I am quoting, but I ask the House to appreciate this, that in all the circumstances of this report, in all the circumstances surrounding the Bill and its introduction, any attempt on my part to paraphrase would not be welcomed.  I would be accused of putting my own interpretation on what the report says.  I would be accused of putting my own interpretation on what the Minister says just to suit my own purposes.  I think it just as well to mention that and to ask the Seanad to bear with me if I do occupy some of its time in making these quotations.</P>
    <P>Again in paragraph 263, we read:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding the large increase in omnibus business since 1945, and the additional capital expended on its development, profits have declined from £840,661 to an estimated figure of £487,000 for the current year.  It was not considered necessary to make any detailed investigation of the working as it was clear from the information furnished by the company that the decrease in profits was due to a general rise in the level of wages and the prices of materials and not to any lack of efficiency on the part of the company. In these circumstances it is considered that an increases in fares to enable the company to earn an annual profit of about £1,000,000 would be fully justified.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I might round off the matter by quoting paragraph 264, which reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is estimated that the additional revenue to be derived from these <Col N="953" /> adjustments of fares would be in the region of £500,000 to £600,000 per annum.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it not strange that Sir James Milne, having made proposals very much on the lines of those made by the ex-chairman and board of Córas Iompair Éireann, should be thanked but the ex-chairman and board of Córas Iompair Éireann should be pilloried?</P>
    <P>The last of that set of proposals made by the Córas Iompair Éireann management and the ex-chairman related to the restriction of privately operated road transport.  I think that Sir James Milne in paragraph 496 clearly indicated that there was need for this.  He refers at that paragraph to the measures which the company considered should be taken to remedy its financial situation, which proposals were communicated to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in March, 1948, and says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Reviewing these proposals:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a) and (b) it is agreed that some rehabilitation of railway permanent way is necessary but it has been well maintained under difficult conditions and is in sufficiently good condition to enable trains to run at pre-war speeds.  The replacement of much of the present railway rolling stock is urgently necessary if traffic by rail is to be retained and expanded....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At sub-paragraph (d) he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is considered&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Would it not be better in the intereses of order if I were allowed to deal with the question of Diesel-electrics as a separate point? However, if it meets with the wishes of Senator Baxter, I will continue.  The paragraph concludes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...but it is considered that the requirements in Ireland do not warrant the introduction of Diesel-electric locomotives.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> What I am concerned with is this question of restriction of private transport. Sir James Milne has something to say about it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is considered that both licensed road hauliers and traders and others providing their own vehicles have a useful function to perform in a coordinated transport system, but they should not be allowed to operate under conditions which enable them to compete unfairly with the transport undertaking.  Proposals for ensuring fair conditions of competition are contained in Parts III and VIII of this report.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to discuss the question of Diesels because it is not relevant at the moment.  What I am concerned with is the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce about the suggestion on the part of the management of Córas Iompair Éireann that this matter of private hauliers required attention; that that suggestion was unthinkable, that he would not hear of it, that it was so grave, and showed such a lack of responsibility on the part of the management that the management should be sent away.  Yet, Sir James Milne, who has been held up to us as a great authority, seems to agree pretty well with the suggestions of the board of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <P>There is a section in Part VIII of this report where Sir James Milne examines this question of competition on the part of private hauliers.  Not alone does he examine it, but he makes suggestions with a view to its restriction. It is a long section, and I do not intend to read it&mdash;but I think I am not unfair to Sir James Milne in saying that he recommends increasing the licence duty payable for all commercial vehicles, and that he recommends further restrictions covering the use to be made of these vehicles.  He also makes recommendations concerning the obligations that should be imposed on private hauliers regarding the road-worthiness of their vehicles.  Each of these suggestions implies a burden to be imposed on road hauliers, and does imply a restriction of the activities of private hauliers.  I think it is not unreasonable to say, Sir, that in view of these views and recommendations expressed <Col N="955" /> by Sir James Milne, the board of Córas Iompair Éireann was not unreasonable in its suggestions nor did they make unsound proposals to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I referred the last day to Sir James Milne and those associated with him in this investigation.  I gathered from some interjections from the other side that I might have been rather severe with him.  I wonder?  I referred to the fact that they were former servants of British transport.  I referred to the fact that British transport, while they were connected with it, did not prove a tremendous success.  I suggested they might have been able to do something for their own service, especially in view of the special advantages enjoyed by the transport industry in Great Britain as compared with the transport industry in this country; the two great advantages being, density of passenger traffic and density of freight. Notwithstanding that, notwithstanding that the British railways, although the advice of these men was available, did not become the success which we would like them to become, the Minister considered these men of sufficient standing and expert enough to come and investigate the Irish railways.</P>
    <P>I have no quarrel to find with that, but I think, whatever was the Minister's attitude to these men, that he might have taken a more reasonable attitude to the railway and transport authorities in this country, that, at least, if charges were to be made against them by either Sir James Milne or by the Minister they should have been given a reasonable opportunity of answering the charges and of defending themselves.  I said the last day that I hoped if Sir James Milne is to carry out an investigation, again, that he will realise the necessity for meeting the people whose affairs he is investigating and of hearing them.  I do not think that if Sir James Milne had known that such a use was going to be made of his report he would ever have taken on this work or that he would have attempted to do it in the way he did and in the time in which he did it.  I mentioned earlier a statement by the Minister in regard to the report <Col N="956" /> by Sir James Milne.  The words he used in regard to it were:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was a masterpiece of understatement. When one reads the detailed examination of the huge, unnecessary capital commitments entered into by the board, in the absence in nearly every case of reports and advice from the various technical officers of the company, one cannot but be struck by the restraint which has tempered the objectivity of Sir John Milne and his colleagues.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There were no reports or no advice from technical officers?  I do not know whether there were or not.  A good deal, I suppose, would depend on what was meant by the word &ldquo;report.&rdquo; Would a report be a very very long document?  May a report be made verbally?  Would a summary of the proceedings at a committee meeting, as recorded in the minutes, be accepted as a report?  Did the officers of the company consult with the chairman and with the board?  Did they ever attend board meetings and, if so, for what purpose?</P>
    <P>The Minister has a communication from the ex-chairman, from which we know that he was a full-time officer of Córas Iompair Éireann in day-to-day attendance.  He was a trained accountant, a man of very considerable experience and success in transport.  He had coming before him, I am sure&mdash;because by statute it should have been done&mdash; statistics relating to the progress of the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Senator knowledge of that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>By law, the company had to keep certain accounts and produce them.  It also had to provide certain very elaborate statistics.  When the Transport Bill was before us here, there was considerable discussion as to whether the board should be compelled to go on collecting these elaborate statistics and, furthermore, to continue printing, publishing and circulating them.  It was agreed the board should go on collecting them, but that we would release them form the necessity of circulating them to the shareholders. I take it that all these statistics were <Col N="957" /> provided.  Because of the chairman's knowledge of transport and of accounting principles and practice, and because of his interest in the company of which he was a servant, I take it that he saw these statistics and from them was able to deduce the best course to take in the interests of the company. Mr. Reynolds has dealt with that matter in the memorandum which he submitted to the Minister.  He says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In criticising the procedure of board meetings of the company, Sir James Milne seems to have overlooked the fact that the chairman of the company devotes all his time to its affairs and is in attendance all day and every day at the offices of the company.  No expenditure of any kind is allowed without the sanction of the board and it is quite wrong to state that &lsquo;no formal reports are made even when major schemes involving large expenditure are brought forward for approval.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is quite wrong to say that&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the majority of purchases are made to meet the requirements of the Department without reference to any specific board authority.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sir James Milne has criticised capital expenditure authorised by the board. Mr. Reynolds comments:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Had he taken the trouble to consult me or the other members of the board, he might have reconsidered the allegation he makes....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should refer to that allegation again.</P>
      <P>Let me deal with another assertion contained in this Milne Report, which has been relied on to a large extent to try to damage Mr. Reynolds and the men composing the board that worked with him.  Sir James Milne makes a statement involving a very distinguished citizen of this city.  On page 9 of the report, paragraph 50, he deals with the civil engineering department, and says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Schemes for new works have been prepared and are being carried out by outside engineers and architects without consultation with the chief engineer, who is likely to be responsible for future maintenance of the works.  The duties of the chief <Col N="958" /> engineer should include general collaboration in the preparation and carrying out of all schemes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Clearly there are grave grounds for Mr. Reynolds's assertion which I have just quoted.  This allegation has to do particularly with Professor Pierce Purcell. He is a very eminent engineer.</P>

      <P>&lsquo;Report on Transport in Ireland, 1948.&rsquo; Paras. 50 (p. 9); 153/157 (p. 34); 311 (p. 52).</P>
      <P>Dear Sir,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My attention has been called to certain references in the paragraphs <Col N="959" /> set out above in the &lsquo;Report on Transport in Ireland, 1948,&rsquo; to my work as consulting engineer in connection with new north wharf at Waterford.  I would like to put on record that some of the points made in these paragraphs (especially No. 50, page 9, and No. 311, page 52) are completely at variance with the facts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be enough to leave it at that but, in view of all that has been said, in view of the possibility that this question of Córas Iompair Éireann may be discussed lá is fuide anonn ná an lá atá indiu ann, it would be no harm if Professor Purcell's reply were recorded in full in the proceedings of the House.  I quote:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When I was asked to undertake the construction of the Waterford north wharf on 7th December, 1945, the then chied engineer, Mr. Murphy, had been on the sick list for some time, but as soon as possible I contacted Mr. Arthur Plumer, assistant to the chief engineer.  I visited Waterford on 21st December, 1945, and met Mr. T.R. Leonard, district engineer, who had charge of the north wharf.  I also met Mr. Friel, harbour engineer to the Waterford Commissioners.  Soon after work commenced on the preliminary design of the wharf, Mr. T.R. Leonard became chief engineer and transferred to Dublin and, from that on, as he can verify, there was the most complete collaboration and co-operation at all stages of the project.</P>
    <P>The general aspects of the design and the final arrangements were gone into in detail until the finished drawings were ready.  The specification and the lay-out of the bill of quantities, with my draft of general conditions of contract were submitted to him, fully discussed and modified in consultation, before being finally settled with the transport company's legal adviser.  The whole of the arrangement for procuring tenders and the final recommendation on the successful tender were dealt with in consultation with the chief engineer, Mr. Leonard.</P>
    <P>There were other lengthy negotiations <Col N="960" /> with the engineer to the Harbour Commissioners, who had to be satisfied on a number of aspects of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to Mr. Leonard's illness, I visited him at intervals keeping him in touch with the progress of the work.  I also visited the work with Mr. A. Plumer and, at a later stage, met Mr. Somervillie-Large, acting-chief engineer, on the site. All questions as to operation of electric cranes and cables, etc., were discussed with Mr. Guthrie, the Transport Company's electrical engineer.</P>
    <P>I set out above statement of fact not in any way to pass on responsibility for the design and construction of the wharf at Waterford, which must rest on me as consulting engineer, but merely to emphasise that in a long engineering experience I have not known a scheme where the consultation was more close and the collaboration more harmonious.  The statements, paragraph 50, page 9 and 311, page 52 are completely without foundation.  The question of making special arrangements for loading cattle from the wharf (see paragraph, 153-157) was not raised until Mr. Somerville-Large mentioned it at Waterford during our visit in October, 1948, when the Milne inspection was nearing its conclusion.  However, it should be noted that cattle have been loaded over a long period from normal quay level in Dublin, without any special arrangements, where the relation of quay level and tidal range differs little from that ruling at Waterford.  This being so, one might ask what are the reasons which require special arrangements at Waterford compared with those at the port of Dublin which enjoys a large cattle export trade.</P>

The Minister commended Sir James Milne on his speed in presenting it.  I wonder was the speed at which the investigation was carried out and the speed at which the report was compiled the cause of its weakness. There was a word of thanks for Sir James Milne and his associated but no word of apology to Mr. A.P. Reynolds or no word of apology to Pierce F. Purcell.</P>

Senator Ó Buachalla tells us that Professor Purcell is defending himself.  He <Col N="963" /> is doing no such thing.  I could say that a statement made by Senator Ó Buachalla was contrary to the facts but that would not prove that I was attacking him or defending myself.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;I set out above statement of fact not in any way to pass on responsibility for the design and construction of the wharf at Waterford, which must rest on me as consulting engineer, but merely to emphasise that in a long engineering experience I have not known a scheme where the consultation was more close and the collaboration more harmonious.

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Our business is to discuss why this Bill has been introduced, the reasons for its introduction and the principles involved in the Bill. If the Minister, when he was bringing in the Bill, had been a little more frank in the reasons he advanced, much of this discussion would have been out of order.  The next thing to which I would like to devote a few minutes is one that will not keep Senator <Col N="965" /> Hayes very much longer.  I want to put this question, which relates to the capital scheme suggested by the chairman of the board&mdash;whether it was necessary or not.  Who said that this capital scheme was unnecessary?  Here is what Sir James Milne says in regard to this capital expenditure authorised, but not yet incurred, by the board:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the present unhappy state of the company's finances it is suggested that all authorised schemes on which heavy capital expenditure has still to be incurred should again be reviewed by the board in the light of the probable effect on net revenue, and for the purposes of this review the general manager should be asked to sumbit formal and comprehensive reports embodying estimates of capital cost and the additional revenue or saving anticipated therefrom. These should be prepared by the technical adviser concerned in consultation with the accountant, who should be made responsible for satisfying the general manager of the board that the estimates have been properly prepared and the schemes proposed can be justified with due regard to financial prudence.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first comment I want to make on that is this.  Why did not Sir James Milne and his team of experts themselves think it worth while to have a consultation with the chairman of the board and with the members of the board?  Does it not seem an extraordinary thing that Sir James Milne should denounce the chairman and board for failing to hold consultations when he himself was quilty of that very same thing?  We know on the testimony of Mr. Reynolds and from the letter I have just read from Professor Purcell that consultations have been held and that advice was sought and given, but here are statements made about the members of the board and the chairman without once referring to them for their views as to whether the matters mentioned in that paragraph were discussed or not before they launched their policy of capital expenditure.  Might I quote Mr. Reynolds again?  In a memorandum submitted by Mr. Reynolds to <Col N="966" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce, he states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sir James criticises capital expenditure authorised by the board.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we have the reference from the Senator?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on page 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Had he taken the trouble to consult me or the other members of the board, he might have reconsidered the allegation he makes, &lsquo;that no information was furnished to the board in regard to the probable effect of carrying out the schemes on the company's net revenue or to show the extent to which schemes undertaken in national interest were also essential to an efficient and economical transport system&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What is the position?  Sir James Milne doubted the advisability of venturing on these schemes in view of the company's financial condition.  He thought that some of these things should not be undertaken on the proposed scale.  He expressed the opinion &mdash;it was merely a matter of opinion then&mdash;whether this programme was essential or not.  Certainly Sir James Milne has not advanced for us in the report arguments as to why he considered these things unnecessary or why he considered they were on too grand a scale.  Sir James Milne did not approve of Diesels; the Minister, I think, did not approve of them either; I do not think he waited for Sir James Milne's opinion on this question of Diesels to decide whether it was a wise proposition or otherwise.  Sir James Milne had something to say about Diesels and I suppose I had better refer to it, especially for the benefit of Senator Baxter.  I quote paragraph 106, page 30, where he makes this comment:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Although the company contemplates proceeding with the adoption of Diesel-electric traction on a large scale, the matter is still in the experimental stage and it would be unwise to assume from the information at present available that this form of traction will prove to be most suitable for the traffic requirements in Ireland, or that the use of <Col N="967" /> Diesel-electric engines will prove to be economically justified.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The matter is still in the experimental stage,&rdquo; he says.  May I say that I know one railway engineer, a very responsible engineer.  He drew my attention to that paragrapha and he thought it one of the funniest things he had read in a long time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps; it would be much easier to pull Senator Baxter's leg than to pull mine.</P>
      <P>Senator Hawkins drew my attention to an article in a journal called <i>Irish Industry</i> dealing with Diesels when we were here last week.  The funny thing is that I had already seen the article concerned when it appeared originally in <i>The Economist</i> and I made some notes.  If Diesel-electrics are in the experimental stage I do not know of any machine ever made that is not in the experimental stage all its life.</P>

      <P>I do not object to that either.  In economics we know that the world is changing and we have to try to keep pace with these changes.  We try to experiment even with the human beings because after all a good deal of our legislation which is concerned with economic and social matters is very much of an experimental kind.  The Minister may not be as clever as he thinks he is.</P>

      <P>What about the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the report on which the Bill is based?  This matter of Diesel-electrics is being investigated and there is a mass of literature on the subject over the last 20 or more years.  Have they reached perfection?  I do not know.  Has the steam engine which is in use now for 250 years, one may say, reached perfection? It is a long time since the first experiments were carried out with tins and drums to try and develop the steam engine.  The experiments have gone on continuously since and the experiments are still going on. <Col N="968" /> but the fact that they are still going on and the fact even that we find that steam traction is not as ideal and as perfect as we would like does not mean that we should not consider the use of steam traction.  The article to which I referred appears in <i>The Economist</i> for December 3rd, 1949, on page 1238:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The increase in the use of Diesels all over the country&mdash;referring to America&mdash;has, to a large extent, been a war-time and post-war phenomenon.  In 1939 the I.C.C. reported that 639 Diesel locomotive units were in service; by 1945 there were 4,301, and to-day more than 8,000 Diesels work the marshalling yards and run the main-line tracks. In 1948, the Class I roads (that is, those which have 1,000,000 dollars or more of operating revenue each year) bought 1,481 locomotives, and of these 1,397 were Diesel-electric units.  Half the passenger traffic and almost three-quarters of the freight are to-day drawn by Diesels.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly we would, I think, be against converting our transport system completely to Diesels.  That would be a very risky thing to do in view of the type of fuel required.  How much riskier that is than concentrating on coal in view of our experience in the last few years I will leave the Seanad to judge.  But surely, in view of the known facts regarding Diesels and their efficiency, it would not be unreasonable to introduce half a dozen or a dozen of these engines and use them in Irish transport.</P>

      <P>Let the Minister not accuse me of being of the slippery type.  Usually when I have something I want to say I will say it, and I will take the consequences.  He will not find me slipping, sliding or shifting my position.  I am dealing here not only with the recommendation but with the actual decision of Córas Iompair Éireann to introduce a certain number of Diesel engines into Irish railway services.  I am pointing out that Sir James Milne has said in his report that this is not wise because Diesels are in the experimental stage and I am showing to the House that there is very little substance in that statement. They have long passed that experimental stage where men would be in doubt as to their feasibility or otherwise.</P>
      <P>I am not saying, because I do not know, that we should go over to Diesels, but I am saying that, in view of that report and the weaknesses I have shown in connection with it and in view of the work and achievements of the ex-chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann, I would take the word of the ex-chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann. He had a word or two to say to the Minister with regard to Sir James Milne's strictures on the position.  Mr. Reynolds has said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is incorrect to say that Diesel-electric locomotives have a performance which is untried and that their design is in the process of development. These locomotives have been in use in America and on the Continent for the past 20 years and they are now regarded in America, particularly for principal passenger trains, as the most efficient and economic form of motor power.  In fact, it is only in these islands that there has been no development of this type of locomotive.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Perhaps there is very good reason for that.  British conditions are vastly different from conditions in America and vastly different from the conditions obtaining in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the fact that they have not been <Col N="970" /> used in Britain means that British engineers do not know their business. Mr. Reynolds makes this further comment referring to certain figures used by Sir James Milne in the report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The estimated operating cost given in paragraph 112 of the report is inaccurate and out of date.  It is based on a rough draft prepared for the general manager of the company for his own information and was not presented to the board on any occasion when consideration was being given to the acquisition of this type of locomotive.  Up-to-date and accurate figures indicate quite clearly that considerable economy would accrue after providing for interest on the increased capital cost by operating these instead of equivalent capacity steam locomotives.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At least, there are two sides to the story.</P>

      <P>May I refer to another matter raised and discussed to a considerable extent in connection with this programme of capital expenditure&mdash;Store Street?  Sir James Milne is doubtful as to the advisability of that scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not. Paragraph 17, on page 7, contains one of the references to it.  Referring to Store Street, Dublin, omnibus station and central offices, Sir James Milne summarises the matter in these words:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" />&ldquo;It is considered doubtful whether the provision at Dublin, Store Street of a terminus for long-distance omnibuses or the centralisation of headquarters offices there can be regarded as sufficiently important to have justified the company in embarking upon such an ambitious project, when capital resources are limited and large expenditure is required for the rehabilitation and improvement of railway facilities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sir James Milne is not very comprehensive, is not very complete.  He says that the project is doubtful.  He is in doubt whether we should go on with it or not, but he is in doubt about it &ldquo;when capital resources are limited and large expenditure is required for the rehabilitation and improvement of railway facilities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first thing we have to ask is whether there is any doubt about the advisability of such a capital expenditure. There may be a dispute now as to its location&mdash;that is another matter; but is it not true that a terminus is required and has been demanded for years for long-distance bus services? Is it not true that, for years, we have been arguing in favour of the co-ordination of transport services, and is it not true that one of the essential steps in co-ordination is to bring the people engaged in the headquarters of transport together?  We know from experience, not alone in this country but everywhere, that one of the most advantageous steps that can be taken in securing economy and in securing efficiency and co-ordination is the bringing together of the various sections of whatever business is in question. There would be economies there. I note that the Minister has made inquiries and thinks that the savings in rates and so on would be about £4,000 or £4,500.  That is not the whole story. The whole question is one of efficiency, of co-ordination, and the saving in rates would be a mere bagatelle as compared with the saving and efficiency that should flow from the establishment of a headquarters for the transport industry on the lines suggested by the Milne Report.</P>
    <P>The minister, when criticising that <Col N="972" /> proposal of Córas Iompair Éireann, quoted Sir James Milne as being against it, and I could imagine the Minister then smacking his lips and making this statement which appears at column 51, Vol. 118 (1) of the Official Debates:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;So much for this illustration of the cold, unimpassioned reasoning which characterises this report.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Where is the reasoning, cold or otherwise, in that statement of Sir James Milne?  The least the Minister will have to concede is that there may be two views about it and a good deal to be said for the two views; but to characterise that statement as an illustration of cold, unimpassioned reasoning is going too far altogether.  One point more, Sir, and I will conclude.</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter suggests that I am imposing too much on the time of the House.  Whatever length of time it may have taken me to put my views before the House, I hope, Sir, I have not repeated myself and I hope, Sir, that I have not shown, as Senator Baxter has shown so often, that I have only one speech, even when twirling my thumbs as part of it, like Senator Baxter.  Sir James Milne saw fit to make a case against the proposals to develop certain branches of heavy industry in this country.  That, Sir, I think is a pity.  I am sorry that Sir James Milne, on many matters, did not see his way to consult with those responsible for the management of Córas Iompair Éireann, but I am sorry, particularly in this case, that he did not see fit to have discussions with the Chairman and with the Board of Córas Iompair Éireann in this country.  We have no heavy industry in the country, and I make this confession, that I saw in the proposals of the Chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann an effort to establish a heavy industry in this country.  I do not know how many places there are in the country where <Col N="973" /> special heavy precision engineering work can be done.  I am aware that during the war, many industries had great difficulty in getting their machinery serviced, and in getting parts for their machinery.  The Great Northern Railway Works, I think, came to the aid of industry and did some work. There may be other engineering shops in the country capable of doing a certain amount of work, but one thing is clear, that we have not got a heavy industry in the country.  The question arises: should we have one or is it possible to carry one?  During the war we had the experience that we were hampered and crippled, because of the lack of such an industry.  In view of that experience, should we neglect taking steps to provide against such a difficulty arising again?  Could we carry such an industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Córas Iompair Éireann is a very far-flung engineering organisation.  It requires a tremendous amount of all kinds of metal machinery for the purpose of its business.  No other industrial organisation in the country can come anywhere near Córas Iompair Éireann in its demand for the service of a heavy industry.  Could Córas Iompair Éireann of itself be able to carry this industry? It might or it might not, but at least, we ought to come to this conclusion, that in the interest of Irish transport and in the interest of national security we ought to have a heavy industry as envisaged in the proposals of the management of Córas Iompair Éireann. Not alone that, but we should enable the company, if needs be, to engage in work for outside people, for outside industries, in order that by doing other work for outsiders it would be possible for it to keep its plant and gear going full time, and to keep it going efficiently.  We know there is a high and long engineering tradition at Inchicore, the Broadstone, at Limerick, and at Cork and, obviously, these are the centres where such an industry might be established.  To say, Sir, that because of the financial position obtaining in Córas Iompair Éireann we should not engage in these things is hardly reasonable in either Dáil Éireann or in this Assembly.  I imagine that when the Taoiseach, Mr. Costello, and the Minister for External Affairs, Mr. <Col N="974" /> MacBride, read of these references to lack of capital here and read of the Minister's strictures on the Board of Córas Iompair Éireann with regard to their policy of large-scale expenditure they must have rubbed their eyes and scratched their heads.  It is a debateable point whether Córas Iompair Éireann will ever pay or not.  I think it ought to be possible for it to pay.  I think that if Córas Iompair Éireann under its old management, discounting the difficulties of 1947, had been given a fair opportunity, and had been given the assistance which it was entitled to get from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, we might be well on the way, now, to that organisation that would have given us a greater measure of success than we did achieve in 1947.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter has asked me to say what I think about the Bill.  I will be very brief on the Bill.  The main purpose of the Bill is to get rid of the Board of Córas Iompair Éireann.  That may be all right.  I suppose, there is no man would be more ready to agree that a better man might be found than himself, than Mr. A.P. Reynolds.  I would say that, among the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann, I know only one, a neighbour of my own, a man in all the years I know him whom I have met very often, and with whom I do not think I would have spent, and that would have been on only one occasion, five minutes discussing transport problems; but, I would say this, that I would be surprised that these men would not be among the first to say: &ldquo;Well you can get better men than we are, and if you do, we wish them every luck.&rdquo;  I will also say this for the old board, that while you may get a better chairman, and you may get a better board, you certainly never will get men who have given as loyal and unselfish service to Irish transport than these men have given.  I am sorry that the old board did not get a longer term.  I was very pleased when the proposition came before us in the form of a Bill whereby public interest and private interest would be reconciled.</P>
    <P>I do not like nationalisation if it can be avoided, but I felt that here was an experiment that was well worth a trial. I am sorry that that trial was not given for a longer period.  The difficulties of <Col N="975" /> 1947 should not be allowed to obscure the work of that board and blind us to the possibilities inherent in composing the board in the way in which it was composed under that Act.  The powers of the board are all right as they are in the Bill, except for that particular sub-section of Section 15 which debars the company from taking in work, from carrying out work for outsiders.  I agree that it can be argued from the wording of the Bill that the board may do many things in the way of manufacturing, establishing new or auxiliary industries, and so on, but it is a retrograde step that we should debar them from engaging in work for persons or industries outside.</P>
    <P>Another fault I have to find with the Bill is the extent to which the Minister has shed his responsibility.  Under the old system, the Minister was responsible to Parliament.  Under this Bill, we hand transport over to a new board and leave them free, to all intents and purposes, to do as they like.</P>
    <P>The Bill increases the State's liability in the financing of the company. That may be unavoidable.  I do not think there was any necessity for it. On these grounds, I think the Bill defective. That is all I wish to say at this stage.  I regret I have had to say hard things regarding the report.  I only wish that Sir James Milne had discovered in time that it would have been the proper thing to have had consultations with all the people intimately concerned.  It is no excuse to tell Dail Éireann or Seanad Éireann that if he met the chairman and the board, he would have had to meet the trade unions concerned.  Transport is vital and it was his bounden duty to have had those consultations.  If he had done that, we probably would not have got this Bill, or at least we would have got from the Minister the real reasons why the Bill was introduced and not the flimsy ones that I have been dealing with for the past few hours.</P>

      <P>Senator Ó Buachalla has spoken for nearly three hours and has succeeded in not telling us what he thinks about this Bill.  The Second Stage is a debate upon the principle of a Bill and normally can be wide, as <Col N="976" /> Senators can explain what they would like to put into the Bill as distinct from what is in it.  He has not told us one single thing he would like to put in and has not given us any idea as to whether he thinks this Bill is or is not a good scheme for the management of our transport as we find it to-day. The speech was a long one&mdash;he said it was his own speech but it was mainly quotations of all kinds&mdash;full of lamentations, accusations, white-washing of Fianna Fáil and white-washing of people who, incidentally, were not attacked at all.  He is full of complaint about the Minister.  He even complains that he did not get the Official Report in time.  He forgets that last Friday was the national holiday and that the printers do not work on a Saturday.</P>

      <P>I am only putting on record that the national holiday was there and had escaped Senator Ó Buachalla's notice.  He did not tell us clearly whether he is in favour of this Bill or not.  He said he was against nationalisation, but then he added that he was sorry the Minister was shedding his responsibility. Surely these two opinions cannot exist in the same mind, if that mind has any lucidity at all.  You cannot be against nationalisation and at the same time in favour of a Minister assuming more immediate responsibility for the running of a public undertaking.  I agree with him in his first opinion.  I am not in favour of nationalisation either as a principle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>If it can be avoided. In this particular case, the Senator, while being against nationalisation, wants it.  In this Bill, the Minister is not working on the principle of nationalisation.  He found Córas Iompair Éireann as a failing concern&mdash; do not mind why or how that was so&mdash; and his problem was how to revive it, how to give it money while avoiding complete control through nationalisation, or giving its day-to-day work parliamentary or Civil Service supervision. <Col N="977" /> The question Senator Ó Buachalla did not answer at all is whether the scheme is or is not a good scheme.  There are certain differences between this scheme and the previous one.  In this Bill, the Minister is taking in&mdash;and we are invited to agree &mdash;the Grand Canal Company.  He is creating a board, as distinct from the previous scheme, which was that one all-powerful governmentally-appointed chairman existed side by side with the directors who, in effect, under the legislation, had no powers at all.  That was an arrangement which obviously did not work.  This is a better arrangement.</P>
      <P>It follows the idea, an old one in this country, of the Electricity Supply Board.  The Bill gives the board power to fix rates and charges, as distinct from the previous arrangement where they had to go to the Railway Tribunal. It creates a tribunal to deal with the closing of branch lines, so as to avoid the discussion of that matter by people who are responsible to constituents and naturally, therefore, are unable to take a clear and impartial view.  In other words, the endeavour is made to have the advantages of private enterprise, of immediate direction as distinct from Civil Service direction, and at the same time to put in public money.  It tries to combine the advantages of a State undertaking with the advantages to be gained from private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also provides against unemployment. Senator Ó Buachalla did not tell us whether he was in favour of that or not.  He devoted nearly all his time to talking about the criticism of individuals.  I agree that it is undesirable that individuals should be attacked, but the Minister did not attack any individual here or in the other House and there was no necessity for Senator Ó Buachalla to have taken upon himself the defence of people who were not attacked at all.  He was the first person who mentioned names in this House.  Without mentioning any names or criticising individuals, surely neither we not ordinary citizens outside can be precluded from asking questions about the way in which work has been done.  There was a question <Col N="978" /> about the bus station.  Córas Iompair Éireann needed a bus station, that is agreed, whether at Store Street or somewhere else.  Perhaps Store Street would be a good place; perhaps it would not.  That was typical of the Senator's speech&mdash;he told us this might work and that might work or that it might not.  In the case of the bus station at Store Street, however, not only did Córas Iompair Éireann, while losing money, decide to have the bus station but they also decided to have a huge palatial suite of offices six storeys high.  Surely Senator Ó Buachalla is not going to weep and wail and complain that we are being unjust to anybody if we say, as ordinary citizens: &ldquo;Was that necessary?&rdquo; That is what the Minister said. He did not think it necessary.  Does anybody think it necessary?  The same applies to the £1,000,000 hotel in Glengarriff.  I have been in Glengarriff. So, I suppose, has Senator Ó Buachalla.  We know what the climate in this country is like and we are entitled to think that a £1,000,000 hotel in Glengarriff could not possibly pay.  Why it should be undertaken by a concern which already was not paying, I do not understand.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Buachalla talked about unfair criticism but, characteristically, he himself made all kinds of personal attacks.  While he was wrapping the white mantle round himself, he was at the same time, in a half-hearted and peculiarly objectionable way, making accusations himself.  He said, for example, that one of the props on which this Bill rested was the Minister's dislike of the Board of Córas Iompair Éireann and of the previous chairman. Surely that is a very dirty accusation against the Minister, except, indeed, that it is so absurd that nobody could possibly believe it.  Does anyone think that any member of a Government, because he dislikes somebody, would go to the trouble of getting a Bill of this size drafted, would get it accepted by his colleagues in the Government, would go to the trouble of getting it through the other House, and would listen to Senator Ó Buachalla talking about it for three hours in this House? He would have to have an awful dislike to go to all that trouble.  That is a very <Col N="979" /> mean, low accusation and quite unworthy of the Senator and particularly unworthy when, at the same time, he is preaching to us, in his best pharisaical manner, about how careful we ought to be lest we accuse anyone.  We ought apparently to accuse nobody except Ministers when we do not agree with them.  It is surely absurd to suggest that the Minister bases himself on dislike for the previous chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann or the directors.</P>
    <P>I am supporting this Bill and I have no dislike of any of them but, certainly, I think you do need a better scheme than the scheme which gave you a number of directors who had no power and one director who was all-powerful.</P>
    <P>It is absurd to think that any Minister or any Government would bring in a Bill basing himself on prejudice or bias or a whim, although I did hear a Minister, whom Senator Ó Buachalla supported, say from the chair where the Minister now sits that he had suppressed a newspaper report of a proceeding in Seanad Éireann to teach a particular Senator a lesson.  I heard that said in this House myself and Senator Ó Buachalla did not protest.</P>
    <P>He also told us that the Minister is not sincere, does not believe in his work.  Surely that is a very low accusation too.  Senator Ó Buachalla made it in his own best manner.  As a matter of face, it would be a contemptible accusation but for this, that a well-taught child in the kindergarten would not pursue the line of reasoning, if you can call it reasoning, that Senator Ó Buachalla pursued about this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has to have the courage to frame these particular proposals.  He has to defend them.  He has to find people to go on the board.  His whole political existence will be judged to a great extent by this Bill.  The notion that he is doing it to satisfy some whim is, as I say, quite childish.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a great improvement on the previous arrangement.  I think it is a desirable compromise.  I admit, quite frankly, it is a compromise between nationalisation and private enter-price. It is quite clear that private enterprise could not keep the railways going if something of this kind were <Col N="980" /> not done.  While canal transport and road transport might continue to pay, railways would have to be shut down, and it is because railways are necessary to us in the public interest that this Bill is introduced.</P>
    <P>What we do invite people to say is whether they think it is a good scheme to appoint seven people or not.  You have to pick them in the public view. You have to appoint them publicly and say: &ldquo;We will let these people run the system.  We will give them power to fix rates and we will remove discussion of the system to the greatest possible extent from the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  We will endeavour by another tribunal to settle the question of the closing down of lines but we will reserve the question of employment and, if people are redundant, they will not be put out of employment or will be compensated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the proposals in the Bill. One would imagine by Senator Ó Buachalla that there was something else in the Bill, something hidden in the Bill.  In a speech which lasted nearly three hours he devoted a very small amount of time to the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>I would like to protest against this idea that the Minister attacked somebody. He attacked nobody.  It is very undesirable for us to rehash the debates in the other House.  We in this House should take our own line about this Bill and every other Bill, and should discuss it after our own fashion.  If we were all to take every single scrap of the Milne Report and debate it and parse it and quote it as Senator Ó Buachalla did, we would still be left absolutely in the air, absolutely ignorant as to what was in this Bill and as to whether the proposals in this Bill are good or bad. I suggest that, in spite of the very long and very lamenting speech&mdash; somebody said to me while it was going on that it was a combination of filibuster and fog, and so it was&mdash;we are left in ignorance of Senator Ó Buachalla's opinion of the Bill.  The main question we have to decide is whether we are in favour of this Bill, whether we will give it a Second Reading, and then discuss all the sections in order, when we can make any point of detail we please.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> I think, from every point of view, the Bill is a sincere and a competent effort to solve a problem of very great complexity and very great difficulty.  I do not think that anybody can guarantee that this particular Bill will solve the problem but, at any rate, it is an honest effort and, I would like to stress, in spite of what Senator Ó Buachalla has said, an impersonal effort, to solve this very difficult problem for the good of the whole country.</P>
    <P>Surely Senator Ó Buachalla's memory must be very short when he says that Mr. Reynolds was the target of one of the filthiest campaigns that have ever been waged by Christians against another man.  That is in the report of his speech last Wednesday, column 916. Senator Ó Buachalla must not have been listening to the Dáil.  He must never have heard of his colleague, Deputy MacEntee.  Surely Senator Ó Buachalla is very very forgetful if he thinks that anything that was said about Mr. Reynolds, right or wrong, could compare with the kind of thing that some of us have got so used to that we do not hear it at all now when it is said.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Buachalla has made his own contribution, not in a very robust fashion, but in the fashion of what someone called &ldquo;insinuendo&rdquo;, against his political opponents.  He is always willing to wound and yet afraid to strike.  A great part of his speech consisted in low innuendo against the Minister and his colleagues.  That is not going to work.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a good Bill.  I think we ought to pass it, but it is difficult to do any business in this House if the principal spokesman for the Opposition can speak for three hours on a Bill and not tell us whether he is or is not in favour of it.  I do not know, and I listened to most of what he said and I read the rest of it.</P>

      <P>Like the other members of the Seanad who have spoken already, I am not enamoured of nationalisation for its own sake, but I am prepared to regard this nationalisation measure as necessary in the <Col N="982" /> interests of the transport of the country.  Whatever we may think of it, we have to agree that it is better than the hybrid system it is replacing. The system it is replacing had a facade of private enterprise and public ownership without the reality of private enterprise&mdash;a large private company under a dictator appointed by the Government, and, in the end, something which was neither one thing nor the other.  It had neither the freedom of private enterprise nor the responsibility of a State operated concern. Therefore, I do not propose to say anything in general against the present Bill.  There are, however, one or two provisions in the Bill which I think it relevant to criticise at this stage.  I think that the Minister might give the Seanad some information which is not included in the Bill regarding the type of person to be appointed on the board of the new concern.  The powers in the Bill are extremely wide, and there is no definition whatever for the benefit of the Oireachtas and the public as to the type of person to be appointed to operate this gigantic national undertaking. There are many questions to be answered about the new Board. Will it be composed of technical experts? Will it be a board drawn from the heads of the various branches in the railway system?  Will they be people with general business experience? Will labour be represented? Will it be a vocational board?  Will it represent the various layers of labour and management engaged in the industry? These are matters upon which the Seanad would like to have some guidance from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to hear a development of the theme touched upon this evening by Senator Buckley&mdash;the relations between the board and the Oireachtas.  That question, I think, we may have to postpone.  It has been the subject-matter of a debate, indeed only the other day, but it should be further elucidated, so that we shall know the relations between a company which will operate with public money and Parliament which will provide the public money.  It is part of the big question which is so much discussed at the moment and which is under consideration by the Government.  On that account, I do not propose to do more <Col N="983" /> than refer to the fact that this will be a very big example of that particular kind of concern.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter in relation to the directors to which I would like to draw attention.  I am not satisfied that the Bill does not embody a principle which may be undesirable and it does not seem to be a principle which we should allow to pass without hearing some reasons advanced in justification of it.  I refer to the provision in the Bill excluding from this board all the members of either House of the Oireachtas.  It seems to me that with the great growth of boards of this kind operating public utilities, it is a pity that those who are running them should be excluded from participating in the parliamentary life of the country.  I feel in agreement with those who have expressed opinions that the very type of man who would be successful on this board is a man who might be eminently suitable for parliamentary work.  It seems to me that the exclusion of members of the Oireachtas tends to penalise ambition and talent.  Some people may have peculiar qualifications which would make them suitable to operate as members of the Oireachtas and as members of the board.  Why the two should be divorced is not self-evident. I think that it might in some cases deprive the boards or the Oireachtas, one or the other, of some very valuable member.</P>
    <P>Looking back on the history of the 19th century and what one can read about the House of Commons, one of the things which have always enriched, I understand from reading parliamentary history, English parliamentary life is the link which existed between the city and the House of Commons.  In England there was not this class of professional politician. The people who took part in parliamentary debates in the great days of the 19th century were members of the professions, bankers, directors of great city companies, etc., and these people could bring a wealth of knowledge to parliamentary debates which is extremely valuable.  It seems to me that some justification should be <Col N="984" /> offered for the extension of this principle. We have had it already with regard to the Central Bank, and I cannot help feeling that membership of the Board of the Central Bank would be an extremely valuable addition to members of the House in discussing financial affairs.  Unless there is some very cogent reason for this proposal I think that there is a great deal to be said for reconsidering it.  It prevents careers being open to talent, and it deprives the Oireachtas of a particular type of specialised ability which might be very useful. Instead of the two occupations, parliamentary life and membership of utility boards, being competitive, I think that they might be complementary and experience in one might make a person more useful in the other.</P>
    <P>The next point with which I want to deal is a matter which has been widely canvassed, and there is reference to it in the evening newspapers this evening, that is, the basis of compensation of the common stockholders of Córas Iompair Éireann.  The basic valuation, as was stated by the Minister in his speech, was the average stock exchange valuations in Dublin Stock Exchange during the period 1945 to 1947.  I am quite prepared to admit that it is very difficult to find an entirely just, satisfactory and equitable basis for the repayment of capital on this scale, but at the same time there is a great deal to be said against taking the current stock exchange valuations as really representing the value of the capital of the company as a whole.  What happens on the stock exchange is that small parcels of shares are sold from time to time showing very small margins of change.  The market is insensitive and the prices which are quoted are very largely a matter of individual computation.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there is not any reason why, because a particular parcel of shares even over a period of years is worth so much, that the total value of the company, as a totality as it were, is correctly represented by multiplying those shares to represent the value of the capital as a whole.  It seems to me that that is a <i>non sequitur,</i><Col N="985" /> that there is a missing link there and that the capitalisation of a company and the value of the capital of the company as a whole is something more than the total, the multiplied total, of individual transactions even over a period of years.</P>
    <P>That, I think, is true generally, but I think that in the case of this particular company which we are discussing it results in a particular form of injustice because the period during which the shares were quoted and which is being taken for the stock exchange valuations was a period during which the value of the shares was depressed by a number of extraneous circumstances over which the shareholders had no control and for which they were not responsible. In the first place, as I said at the beginning of my observations, the company was really a hybrid affair.  On paper it was a private company with private shareholders and private directors; in fact, it was hampered and restricted in every way.  If it had been purely a private company operating with private capital it would have been free to do a great many things which would have enhanced its earning capacity and consequently increased the value of its shares.  It would have been free to raise its rates and charges; it would have been free to close down branch lines which were running at a loss; it would have been free to get rid of redundant labour although labour trouble and unemployment might have resulted.  These, from the point of view of a private profit-earning corporation, were obvious ways to reduce costs and raise profits, to raise the tone of the market and the value of the shares.</P>
    <P>I am not saying for one moment that it would have been desirable from the national point of view that railway freights should be raised; I am not saying that it would be desirable that branch lines should be closed down or that labour should be laid off as redundant.  I am not begging any of those difficult and controversial questions, but if this company was allowed to masquerade as a private concern I think that it is unfair that the shareholders of the company should be <Col N="986" /> deprived of the ordinary, normal, commercial methods of increasing prosperity and increasing the value of the shares.  What is suggested is that the valuation of 1945-47 should be taken, a valuation resulting from a particular state of affairs which had the effect of reducing the value of the company's shares to an artificial level consequent upon the hybrid make-up of the company, not being one thing or another, a private company which was not allowed to do things in its own interests and which had to operate the railways and conduct all its affairs under the whim of a dictator and which, in the real or alleged public interests, had to keep fares down, branch lines open and employment up. From a reasonable business outlook that is not a fair valuation of the company's capital.</P>
    <P>It is very reminiscent of what is taking place in a big way under the Labour Government in Great Britain. Companies are put under a threat of nationalisation after a period of severe physical controls and every sort of abnormality.  Shares are depressed to an artificial level, investors are afraid to buy and people are selling out in order to get out.  They are told that the company is going to be nationalised and the valuation is that of stock exchange values during a certain time.  That I think is very unfair.  That may be fair from the point of view of the socialist Government, which has not got very much regard for private enterprise, but from the point of view of the Government of this country, which would repudiate the description of socialistic and which always preaches the virtues of private enterprise, it seems to me that it is an example which is not to be copied.</P>
    <P>I know that one may be asked if the value which is defined in the Bill is not a fair value, what would be a fair value, and I am quite prepared to agree that it is extremely difficult to find a fair value.  It is very difficult indeed to state what a fair value would be, but I suggest that almost any alternative reasonable system that could be suggested would result in a value higher than the value actually given, and I think that is as far as an individual <Col N="987" /> member of the Seanad can go. What would a possible basis of valuation be?  I do not think that any of them is perfect, but I suggest these as possible lines of approach.  From the point of view of the cost of construction of the railway, the value now being given to the ordinary shareholders is very inadequate indeed, but I admit that the value of the railway is not equal to the cost of construction.  At the same time, however, I am trying to suggest to the Minister other possible bases on which to start his calculation, and I suggest that any other possible basis would give a higher valuation than is in fact given.</P>
    <P>I will admit that the cost of the original construction has largely become irrelevant in the circumstances, but what about the cost of replacement? If there was any effort at present to replace the physical assets of this concern, to build them up again at present-day prices, the cost of reconstructing the assets of Córas Iompair Éireann would be very much greater than the value of the compensation awarded to the debenture holders and the ordinary shareholders under this scheme.  Another possible basis would be a breaking up, a realisation of the physical assets.  If the entire assets of Córas Iompair Éireann were auctioned off&mdash;land, buildings, rails, locomotives, hotels and contents &mdash;I cannot help feeling that the probable price realised would give the ordinary shareholders a higher basis of valuation than what is suggested by the Minister.  All I am arguing is that of all the bases of valuation the one has been selected which seems to be most unfair to the ordinary shareholder.</P>
    <P>To come back to what I said a moment ago about the socialist Government, if ours were a professedly socialist Government, that might be a very good thing to do&mdash;to put property owners in their proper place and to teach them a lesson&mdash;but ours is a Government which is always boasting about its reliance on private enterprise and its encouragement of the private investor.  If you are trying to <Col N="988" /> encourage the private investor to develop the resources of your country, nothing can be more paralysing or more discouraging than the example of the nationalisation of a great industry of this kind under which the common shareholders are paid too low a price for their stock.  I can see nothing more calculated to frighten people away from investing in Irish industry than the fear that at some future date the industry may be nationalised and that they will be compensated on the basis of a stock exchange valuation which is the result of abnormal conditions, very largely brought about by the fear of nationalisation itself.  That is one of the performances of our socialist neighbours which I for one am not anxious to emulate.</P>
    <P>Even assuming that the value fixed, in fact, is fair, or, rather, was fair at the time it was fixed, the time it was fixed was May, 1949, nearly a year ago, and everybody is aware that there has been a fall in gilt-edged securities in the past ten months and, therefore, what is proposed is that the shareholders in this company should be paid in a stock the market value of which has depreciated.  In other words, if the price originally was fair, which I have been disputing, in May, 1949, it has become unfair to-day owing to the fact that it is being paid in a stock which has gone down, a stock the market value of which would not be more than 94 or 95 to-day.  It must be remembered that this is a long-dated stock, a 1975-85 stock.  It does not mature for nearly 30 years, and stock of that kind, as the Minister is aware, is very subject to capital variations owing to changes in the rate of interest.</P>
    <P>Already it has been seriously depreciated. A further rise in the rate of interest would depreciate it still more, and it seems to me that, from the point of view of equity and justice between man and man, between the State and the individual, there is an inescapable dilemma here.  If the price was fair last May, it has become unfair to-day; if it is fair to-day, it was too high last May.  If there comes about a change in the value of the stock between the time the valuation is <Col N="989" /> made and the time the payment is made, the owners are being paid in a depreciated medium.  I say nothing about the change that has taken place in the value of the £ since.  I admit that it is irrelevant, but the change in the rate of interest has quite definitely cut down the value in pounds of railway stock to-day and here again the Irish Government are&mdash;I do not say imitating, because I do not believe they are&mdash;perhaps unconsciously following the bad example of the Socialist Government in relation to gas stocks. Nothing has caused more indignation amongst property holders in England and more unrest in stock exchange and city circles than the fact that the gas companies' shareholders are being compensated now in a gas stock which has depreciated on the stock exchange from the time the valuations were made.</P>
    <P>In other words, the share capital is first written down 20 per cent., only 80 per cent. of the original nominal amount is redeemed at all, and then it is redeemed in a stock which has depreciated by another 5 or 6 per cent. I suggest to the Minister that that is a serious injustice, and, if it is not too late to right it, either the rate of interest on the stock should be raised to 3? per cent. or the nominal amount should be slightly raised in order to compensate for the fall in the capital values owing to the rise in the rate of interest.</P>
    <P>These are all financial aspects of this measure, but there is another aspect to which I should like to refer.  It gives me an opportunity of referring to a matter which is, I think, of some public interest, that is, the much debated and much discussed Store Street bus terminus.  Many technical questions are involved, but I should have thought, from the point of view of the man in the street, that the site for this particular bus station was just foolish.  I should have thought that, if all your traffic is going north-west, south and south-west, to site your bus station to the east of the main traffic centres of the city was not a particularly intelligent thing to do; but as I say I do not pretend to have any particular knowledge from the technical point of view.  Apparently that is a <Col N="990" /> view taken now by the Government because it is now being abandoned. It is unsuitable for its purpose as a bus terminus and unnecessary for its purpose as offices, and, so far as we can make out, it is being transferred to some Government Department. From the point of view of the railway company, apart from what they may get from selling it, it is an entirely useless object, a great white elephant which has dissipated a large volume of resources which might have been very much more productively employed. That is all quite true, and, I hope, relevant.</P>
    <P>There is just one other aspect to which I should like to refer, speaking as a citizen of Dublin who has a pride in his city, and that is the disfigurement of the Custom House and the neighbourhood caused by this new construction. I have been brought up in this city, of which I am very proud to be a citizen, and as long as I can remember anything I was always told that the greatest and most gruesome piece of engineering in Dublin was the loopline bridge, that if it had not been for that bridge we could see the Custom House.  Very well.  We can now go down the river below the bridge to see the Custom House.  What will we see?&mdash;the bus station&mdash;a much more formidable disfigurement of the skyline than the loopline bridge ever was.  It may be truly said of the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann <i>si monumentum requiris circumspice</i>&mdash;indeed, the difficulty is not to see, but to avoid seeing the monument with which they have disfigured the Dublin skyline.</P>
    <P>One other final reflection, which I do not think is entirely irrelevant.  One cannot help feeling that there has been a great degradation in public taste over the last 200 years, principally amongst those entrusted with the expenditure of public money.  In the 18th century, whatever their merits were, or demerits in other respects, at least they did adorn their city and put up buildings of which we are all proud.  To me, Dublin is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, of which, architecturally, we are all very proud.  Even the much-maligned business men of the 19th century who built <Col N="991" /> the railways did not do too badly.  The Broadstone, Kingsbridge and Harcourt Street are all much admired by architects of the best taste who have been greatly impressed by the beauty of the Dublin termini.  I am sorry to say that the industrial leaders of Dublin in the 20th century have not left such good marks behind them.  I am afraid that the loopline bridge, the gasometer and the Store Street bus station are rather sad monuments to the taste of our industrial leaders in 20th-century Dublin.</P>
    <P>Now, to go back to something constructive, the members of the board. Is it too much to hope that amongst the members of the new board somebody will be included with some sense of taste, some feeling that a public service of this kind has great power to increase or decrease the amenities of the city and the country?  We hear a great deal about planning.  I never pick up a paper that I do not read about planning or about Dublin's big plans.  I am sorry to say, however, that Dublin has been more planned against than planning.  That is the final note on which I would appeal to the Minister.  If he cannot find any more compensation for the stockholders, even if he cannot make up for the decline in the compensation stock, at least he can prevent citizens of Dublin from being faced with more eyesores in the future, such as they have been forced to endure in the recent past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I have spent most of my life on road transport my difficulty in rising to speak on this Bill is its very simplicity.  It would be very easy to take up another hour or two if I were to dissect the Milne Report.  I have not the slightest intention of doing that.  I think we will all agree that we do need improvement in our transport service.  What we should decide is the point as to whether in our opinion this Bill is going to give us that.  Frankly, I doubt it.  That is why I am afraid of the Bill.  At this stage, I do want to thank and congratulate the Minister on his action in sending round invitations to various bodies, the Chamber of Commerce, the <Col N="992" /> Federation of Irish Manufacturers, and the Society of Motor Traders, asking their views before he included these things in the Bill.  That ought to go on record.  It was a sensible thing to do and it did enable sensible criticism to be submitted to the Minister and his advisers in time for them to see whether it would fit the final phraseology of the Bill.  In that connection, one of the questions the Chamber of Commerce brought up was the question of the duties and powers of the board.  I am glad to say that an assurance was received from the Minister's Department that no powers are being conferred by the Bill which would interfere with the interests of private traders over distribution of their goods or of public hauliers operating public services.  That is a very categorical statement and one that did much to assure people who were highly alarmed by the phrasing of Section 15 of the Bill itself.  Various other matters were brought to the attention of the Minister, and, I am glad to say that satisfactory assurances were given concerning unfair rates, and consideration is to be given to suggestions made as to the members of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suggestions were made that in a board that was going to be vested with all the powers this board was going to be, that the best men should be sought and got.  It would be hard to make a case for the elimination of anyone because of any other activity that person might have.  This Bill is very simple. Its simplicity is disarming.  We ought to remember that this is merely the first of the Bills that will be necessary to harmonise the transport system in this country.  The Bill, even the clauses dealing with the powers, states that the responsibility of providing efficient transport services of various kinds is to be put on to this board.  Speaking as a realist myself, with some knowledge of these transport matters, if I were a member of that board, and came up against difficulties in the operation of the company, I would at once go to the Minister to seek the extra powers which it is clearly indicated they will have the power to seek. One big safeguard we have is this, that no new powers can or will be conferred on the Board without the consent <Col N="993" /> of both Houses of the Oireachtas. To that degree this marks a definite step forward.  I am glad we are now making an effort to get rid of the transport chaos which has existed far too long.  One suggestion would be that a transport conference be convened attended by the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann and the many experienced road transport operators we have in this country, and that such a conference be responsible for investigating the whole of the system and the needs of this country.  I want to say here and now that nationalisation of transport in England has proved itself to be nothing but a failure.  Its losses are colossal and the public is not getting the service it formerly was getting.  God forbid that we should see the day when we would have an inflexible timetable system in this country.</P>
    <P>This country needs a transport system in which the flexibility of the private operator would play a very big part, which it will not get from an octopus concern without flexibility. Our system of fairs, and scattered hamlets throughout the country calls for services which only the independent operators can give.  I may suggest, in all friendliness, to the Minister that there is no need, I believe, for all the powers now being vested in this new board.  You have to remember that in the era of rising costs, and lowering value of money, the members of the old board were deprived of the power they needed to make them a successful board, the power to adjust their costs to meet the new situation.  That power is being given in unrestricted fashion to the new board.  Granted, you do get a board possessed of ordinary intelligence, if they have the power to adjust rates that will make them profit-making; inevitably, there will not be thanks due to them if they do not make the concern pay.  I am not here to defend the old board or to make any political capital out of the situation at all, but at least it is fair to say of the old directors that had they been given the power to be conferred on the new board they would be able to present a very different picture from the one we are faced with to-day.  Unfortunately, we have evidence already of the danger <Col N="994" /> the country will have to face if nationalisation, to a greater degree than we have now, is fastened on the country.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to introduce a controversial note, but I think it is pertinent for me to say now that, even now, had we got less monopolistic transport in the City of Dublin than we have, 60,000 people would not be deprived of the opportunity to go to their work, and the kiddies could go to their schools.  The elimination of the private transport enterprise in Dublin was something we are entitled to speak about to-day.  Dublin had a grand internal transport system of its own.  It was making money, and making it under private management and private ownership, but it was absorbed because its profit-making facilities were needed to bolster up the losses on transport in other sections of the country.  I submit the House will agree that it is a shocking thing that, because of the form of transport that Dublin now has, an entire community&mdash;for 60,000 are a very big community&mdash;is deprived of transport. I say that, as the Government is subsidising Córas Iompair Éireann, to that degree it has a responsibility for its operation, and it is its first duty to see that a Government-sponsored or Government-backed undertaking will not, under any circumstances, deprive the people of the transport it is supposed to put before them.</P>
    <P>Wide powers have been conferred on the new board.  Those licensed road hauliers in the country to-day, who are working under a limitation of mileage which could have been justified at one time, should now be freed from that limitation.  If this new board is to be given such arbitrary powers to do this, that and the other, backed as they will be by the nation's purse, then those poor devils of ratepayers operating private enterprise with their own finance should be given a fair crack of the whip too, and should be allowed to roam about the whole national territory in their search for business that will be harder to get if Córas Iompair Éireann under the new system is more sensibly managed than has been the case hitherto.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> Reference has been made to the need for a heavy engineering industry. The nation has need of that, but why saddle Córas Iompair Éireann or any other firm with that baby?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Private enterprise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer that right away.  Self-sufficiency goes so far, but the national economy of a little country like this does not provide the opportunity for the heavy capital investment that would be needed in such an industry.  I have a fair knowledge of what I am talking about, as I spent many years of my life in engineering shops as a worker. The inevitable result of setting up a heavy engineering industry in this State will mean that the State will have to subsidise it.  It will be money well spent to have that particular industry here, to meet the situation like that we had in the crisis years of the war, but let it be a distinct industry. Do not fasten it on to Córas Iompair Éireann.  One might as well suggest giving it to the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
      <P>Another of the things referred to in the Bill and which would have been an activity in the engineering shops was the manufacture of bus chassis. There is one portion of Sir James Milne's Report which indicates that, to make that bus chassis factory economical, it would need to have a production rate twice as great as the absorption rate of Córas Iompair Éireann.  In other words, a factory that would be set up and its revenue guaranteed by the State would have to enter into competition with private traders of the State, because it would need to get rid of the surplus 50 per cent. of its output in competition with those who had to guarantee its revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without going into the Milne Report, there is not much in this particular Bill.  I feel that the additional powers envisaged in the Bill make it merely an enabling Bill, to enable the Government to get rid of the old board and put in a new one with considerable powers.  I believe that after it has been in operation for a relatively short space of time we will be in a better <Col N="996" /> position to judge the result of the efforts.</P>
    <P>Let us be honest.  We want it to be a success.  We want to see this new transport undertaking in its new guise nothing other than a success.  All I am pleading for is that, coincident with its establishment, we will get rid of any idea that its need is due to the failure of private enterprise as such. The need is not due to any failure of private enterprise, but due to private enterprise being in a straitjacket in which it could not operate. Let us have the fullest co-operation between the two forms of ground transport, since both road and rail will have to face ever increasing competition from the air.  Above all, let us have in the country sufficient national spirit from men with their own businesses to give the best of their brains and ability, if called upon, to co-operate with Córas Iompair Éireann and make it what we hope it will be, a distinct national asset and one that will give the country an efficient national transport service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. J.T. O'Farrell Mr. J.T. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister and the Government on having faced this very complex problem in a realistic manner. Their action is all the more commendable because the nationalisation of a semi-bankrupt concern can be anything but a popular measure.  The pity of it is that some previous Government did not take similar action.  All previous so-called solutions merely had the effect of postponing the evil day which seems to be with us now.  The only alternative to this Bill was the disintegration of our principal public transport system in bankruptcy and chaos.  This Bill has been rendered necessary not because of any desire to nationalise but it if we were to maintain a public transport system at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Brien talks about the inadequate compensation to the common shareholders, but surely the alternative was nothing at all.  I quite sympathise with their plight, but as matters stood they were getting no dividend and had no prospect of getting any but rather of losing their capital altogether.  It was amazing to find the principal speaker for the Opposition, <Col N="997" /> Senator Ó Buachalla, devoting almost the whole of his speech to a most elaborate apologia for the ex-chairman. Why he should find it necessary to develop such an elaborate defence is not too obvious, unless he felt that his Party, through the Minister, was responsible for appointing this gentleman, whose period of despotic rule was the most disastrous that public transport has had here in all its long history.  One felt with Shakespeare: &ldquo;Methinks he doth protest too much&rdquo;.  If the gentleman in question was all that he said he was, surely his own record would have been his best defence, but during the unfortunate period in which he reigned supreme, Córas Iompair Éireann became a by-word with the general public.  Whatever the cause, someone interpreted the letters Córas Iompair Éireann to mean &ldquo;Can Ireland Endure&rdquo;.  I should have imagined that it would have been better for Senator Ó Buachalla to have treated this episode with the charity of his silence, as I certainly would were it not for the fact that, in defending one man, he proceeded to level charges against others.  Personally, I do agree that Mr. Reynolds was the victim of circumstances.  People in high office, no doubt for purposes of their own, pronounced him a man of destiny in the field of transport and, tragically for transport, Mr. Reynolds believed it.</P>
    <P>As chairman of Great Southern Railways, and afterwards of Córas Iompair Éireann, he seemed to me to prove that, whatever his abilities in other directions, he was temperamentally incapable of running a complex, difficult organisation such as a comprehensive transport system.  His alleged success in Dublin United Tramways Company was largely a legend without foundation. When he came to Dublin United Tramways Company it was a success.  It had purchased compulsorily the whole of the competition with which it had been faced, his own small company being the very last to be bought over.  It had no competition whatever and, unless one went out of his way to make it a failure, it would have to succeed.  Running street cars, where <Col N="998" /> tickets are sold from 1d. to 6d., where you have no competition, where there is a dense and growing population, is quite a different matter from running a complex organisation like a national transport system of rail and road communications, with its hundreds of passenger fares, both local and through, thousands of freight and live-stock rates, local and through, excursion fares, week-end fares, special rates, and all the other complications that go to make up a modern transport system.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Buachalla thought Mr. Reynolds was invited to join Great Southern Railways.  Invited by whom? He was not invited.  He was appointed and imposed upon that company in February, 1942, by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I do not want to do him any injustice but any good that he did during his seven years there would surely have been done in similar circumstances by any person of even moderate experience.  It was not true that he was brought in there because the trains were ceasing to run or were taking days where they should have taken hours.  It was during Mr. Reynolds's period of office that trains took a couple of days to go to Cork and that eventually we had only two trains each way per week.</P>

      <P>I am not blaming anybody at all, but the suggestion was that we had these conditions obtaining until Mr. Reynolds was appointed chairman and that after that they ceased to exist.  The position is quite the reverse.  Having no experience of rail transport, the first business of a person appointed to such a post, one would imagine, would be to seek the co-operation of the staff, particularly the men in the key positions. Not so with Mr. Reynolds.  I think I was the first trade union representative <Col N="999" /> who had an interview with him, at his own request, a matter of days after his appointment.  I went there prepared to offer him the wholehearted co-operation of the administrative, clerical and supervisory grades, upon whose co-operation his success or failure might depend, and to wish him good-luck in the task before him.  After a rather ungracious reception, I had hardly time to sit down when he told me he had sent for me to tell me he had a very poor opinion of my members. I respectfully suggested that as he had only been there a few days he could have very little experience of them and that when he knew them better he would find he had done them an injustice.  He admitted he had very little experience, but his opinion was that they were a poor lot and he thought it was as well for me to know it.  I thanked him, but again I said I believed he had been doing them an injustice.  A few days later I was dismayed to find that he had sent for two representatives from every office in Dublin to tell them precisely what he had told me.</P>
      <P>That was an exceedingly bad start, and was not the type of conduct that would win the co-operation of a staff that was new to him.  I introduced afterwards a deputation on superannuation, composed of five senior members of his salaried staff, and he kept us standing for several minutes, pretending not to see us, while he was speaking to a person beside him.  He then merely indicated to me to proceed. I said: &ldquo;I think I had better introduce the members of the deputation. They are all senior members of your own staff.&rdquo;  I named them one by one, and their departments, and he never deigned even to look across at them.  That was an exceedingly chilling manner of entrance into a service such as Great Southern Railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, during his period of office, whether he or the board as a whole was responsible, I do not know, there were broken up all the little pension, hospital and benefit funds that the men had been maintaining out of their own contributions for many years, some for generations.  They <Col N="1000" /> helped them in time of stress.  They were forced to wind them up.  He wanted to concentrate everything under his own power, and to leave the staff no voice in the management. A new and heartless attitude towards tuberculosis victims was adopted. Immediately six months were up they were dismissed, not to be reinstated. They were refused leave without pay, even where the medical advice was to the effect that they would recover if given the necessary time.  One of these cases came before the Dáil last year, and the new chairman, on the case being brought to his notice, reinstated the official concerned, and he is now working as usual.</P>
    <P>Another policy adopted by Great Southern Railways, and subsequently by Córas Iompair Éireann, under his chairmanship was absolute isolation from the rest of the railway companies. An iron curtain was drawn down.  All through-booking of passengers, freight and live stock was discontinued, involving an enormous amount of additional labour, delays, expense and irritation.  When Córas Iompair Éireann came into operation, railway-men were made feel that they were only fit for the dustbin and the small staff from Dublin United Transport Company were placed on a pedestal.  In effect, in the matter of appointments and general patronage, it was a case of Jonah swallowing the whale.  Railwaymen of long experience and of ability were jettisoned.  The general manager, traffic manager, stores superintendent, chief mechanical engineer and chief permanent way engineer were all retired.  An accountant was appointed as general manager.  An accountant was appointed as traffic manager.  A man was brought in from a chocolate factory and was put in charge of the immensely complicated stores department and the two engineering posts were left vacant&mdash;permanently vacant.  The law department, in operation from the beginning of the railway, was abolished, with dire consequences from a legal point of view, and the work given to an outside firm of solicitors with the result that every single compensation case which came <Col N="1001" /> before the arbitrator under the Act of 1944 was won by the applicant because of the ineffective manner in which the legal aspect of the case was worked by the company.</P>
    <P>They got rid of the architect's department and one result was that they paid more in architects' fees in one year than would have maintained this particular department for over 20 years.  The result of the new architectural development was the erection of this architectural monstrosity referred to by Senator O'Brien.  Then the Act of 1944 made no provision for a deputy-chairman.  There was the chairman who was omnipotent and none of the other directors could hold a meeting without him.  No decision could be taken at a meeting except the chairman was there and no decision could operate unless he approved of it.  When this suggestion of appointing a deputy-chairman was approved, a deputy-chairman was appointed and paid £1,500 a year as against the £900 a year he would have received as an ordinary director.  Through a certain amount of crassness on the part of the board about the superannuation fund, thousands of pounds were wasted and a special Bill had to be put through the Dáil.  One result of the enactment of that measure is that you will have two superannuation funds for the salaried staff with two separate sets of contributions and two different types of benefit &mdash;a source of perpetual trouble in the future.</P>
    <P>These are only some of the things which have happened and which have destroyed the main structure of railway administration built up on the tradition and experience of over one hundred years.  The ex-chairman proceeded to erect this crazy edifice, and in erecting it, he refused to accept any advice whatever from experts except from a body of sycophants and profit seekers of whom there was a very considerable following.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a new stores superintendent was indicated by the recklessness with which stores were bought, until, eventually, in 1948, the value of stores in hand amounted to about £1,400,000 or three times what <Col N="1002" /> the stores were in 1945, and in the Milne Report, page 4, paragraph (18), it is shown how this control has been exercised.  Stores were accumulated at such a rate that the whole of the stores accommodation was exhausted and the stores were piled up in packing cases outside and left to rot under the sun and rain and in all weathers.  These were very valuable stores, but they had to be left exposed because there was no accommodation for them inside and no possible means of utilising them for a considerable time to come.</P>
    <P>There was a very definite bias given to road transport during the whole period.  In fact, the whole bias was in favour of road transport.  In the Milne Report, attention is drawn to the fact that a lot of the stout&mdash;one of the undertaking's main commodities consigned by rail&mdash;is conveyed by rail from Guinness's brewery to Kingsbridge and retained there for a considerable time before it is sent out in lorries from 30 to 75 miles away to places served by rail.  Now, could anybody imagine a more fantastic arrangement than that, but the report quite definitely gives that as one example of what was going on?</P>
    <P>Then, there is the question of the manner in which the board as a whole dealt with the chairman's salary.  The chairman's salary, I think, was very considerable.  They paid him £2,500 free of income-tax, but they fixed an expense allowance for him of £4,000 a year which, of course, is free of income-tax. Now, where the expense could be incurred is not clear.  The chairman, for example, had a railway motor car provided by the company and a driver, with free first-class travel by train, free meals and free entertainment at the company's hotels so that he could have had very little personal expenses to meet out of his allowance of £4,000. This sum which was put down as expenses was obviously intended as salary paid on an expense account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not an expense account; it was a special additional salary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.T. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>So that he was getting £6,500 a year with £2,500 free of income-tax.  My information is that his basic salary was paid free of income-tax.  I have only mentioned these things as the things that astonished people&mdash;those of us who are accustomed to transport administration in practice for a lifetime.  This method of carrying on created vast scandals and eventually the whole thing became a by-word and a joke, although everybody felt it was rather a tragic joke. Little incidents occurred, but did not pass unnoticed by people working on the railway system at the time.  The very best coal available used to be utilised for the engine hauling special race excursion trains to the Curragh. This train was never advertised, and you had to be among the racing fraternity to know that it was travelling, but certain very important personages travelled on the train and knew it was running, and here you had drivers and firemen seeing the best coal being used privately for that particular purpose at a time when the general community were left almost without transport at all.  That is only one aspect of the management of the company and it was not particularly brilliant.  I think a great opportunity was missed during those years, because it was in May, 1942, that all petrol for private purposes was withdrawn, and from that onwards the company had an absolute monopoly in transport and traffic that was developing in the year the war started.  The result was that the volume of traffic increased at the same time the competition disappeared and, from the financial point of view, these were the easiest years that public transport have ever known, as far as Córas Iompair Éireann, certainly, are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said that because I feel bound to say it on account of the remarks of Senator Ó Buachalla and the peculiar line he took in his speech. I feel that there is a big traffic problem to be solved, an extraordinarily difficult problem which affects <Col N="1004" /> everyone.  The main trouble is that there is far more transport available than traffic.  Even in monopoly days, the all-over average dividend was less than 4 per cent., so that there is no money to be got in public transport. Conditions are not favourable to public transport.  For one thing, nearly all the big cities and towns are on the coast, and to that extent Córas Iompair Éireann is handicapped by competition from the sea, and the traffic offered to them is useless from the point of view of haul.  There is some inland transport of which Córas Iompair Éireann gets a proportion, but most of it goes to local carting concerns.  Another feature of Irish transport is that a great deal of it is seasonal, and it means that you have to keep an abnormal quantum of equipment and personnel throughout the whole year, although it is only fully employed for part of the year. Then we have a very low population density&mdash;only 113 to the square mile as against 737 in England and Wales. As a result we maintain 81 miles of rail for every 100,000 of the population as against 38 in Great Britain, and we maintain 14 miles of canal as against their five.  Of course admittedly public transport is a difficult affair whether it is nationalised or otherwise.  American railways are in trouble and they are not nationalised, and here it was inevitable that railways should get into trouble after the introduction of the unfettered competition of road transport.  The railways work under regulations which were framed when they had a monopoly, and these have not been altered to an appreciable extent, notwithstanding the tremendous onset of a virile form of competition, absolutely uncontrolled, in the form of road transport.</P>
    <P>At the same time we cannot do without public transport.  No modern State can leave transport in the hands of hucksters who will run it when it suits them and take only the traffic that suits them.  Even manufacturers and traders who claim that they convey their own products do not do anything of the kind; they only convey such of them as prove profitable.  A manufacturer in Dublin may send goods by <Col N="1005" /> the main roads to Kildare or even to Limerick, but he will not send them to West Cork, Kerry or Donegal. These small broken consignments are handed over to the public transport and they, being public carriers, must take them.  Also the raw materials which he requires must and do come by public transport.  According to the Milne Report on paragraph 543:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The provision of adequate public services is of paramount importance to the economic life of the country, and the services provided by the independent haulier and merchant user should supplement and not supplant the public service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The low population density and the low traffic density demand the utmost economy in the working of transport and under present conditions we have nothing but absolute waste.  Too much capital is invested in transport with the result of wasted labour and effort too.  A co-ordinated system of road, rail and water transport can and should pay its way and give an economic service, but uneconomic competition between all three can only mean eventual bankruptcy for all.  The country will have the choice in the future of standing for this free for all competition on the roads and paying for it as taxpayers or giving very serious consideration to certain recommendations in the Milne Report which involve certain restrictions on road competition and suggest a quasi-monopoly for public transport.  The Bill will certainly make the community more transport-conscious than they have been and for that reason if for no other it is a very valuable piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board is the outstanding example of the good effect of a monopoly in certain circumstances. We took over all the small concerns and some big ones and gave a monopoly to this board.  As a result we have cheaper current and a very much more reliable supply than we would have had probably under old conditions. With regard to the cost of road compared to rail it is a pity that the Central Highways Authority's proposals in the Milne Report could not <Col N="1006" /> be implemented.  If they were then for the first time everybody would know what the relative costs of road and rail transport are and would be able to approach the problem much more intelligently and with greater vision than we probably can to-day.</P>
    <P>One result of the entry of unrestricted road competition was to destroy what was known as the <i>ad valorem</i> principle of charging.  That means that high grade valuable traffic is made to pay for bulky low grade traffic.  A ton of groceries is not more difficult to convey than a ton of coal but you could not charge the same rate for coal as for groceries.  Wines or spirits or cutlery are just as easily, or more easily, carried than a ton of milling stuffs but you could not charge for milling stuffs at the same rate.  Under the old system of railway charges low grade traffic bear more than its share of the burden and in that way they were able to strike a balance.  When the road transport came in they skimmed the traffic, they ignored the bulky traffic and consequently they were able to underquote the railways for the high grade traffic.  They were taking the cream and leaving the skimmed milk to the railways.  The railways cannot run on low grade bulky traffic alone, although some people think they should be kept in being for that sort of traffic. The railways, being common carriers, must take all sorts of traffic and run regular scheduled services while their competitors take what they like and run when it suits them.</P>
    <P>The transport problem is becoming keener day by day.  Between 1939 and 1949 road vehicles of all sorts increased from 73,813 to 122,526, or by 60 per cent. But public service or commercial vehicles increased from 15,831 to 31,885 or by 101 per cent.  This means 100 per cent. more competition on the roads than 10 years ago for no more traffic than existed then.  This is a crazy development and shows the seriousness of the problem, because nothing but insolvency faces all concerned. Already the roads are a very heavy burden, but the Milne Report suggests large-scale diversion of rail <Col N="1007" /> traffic to the roads, increasing the cost to about £30,000,000 a year.  In that connection also we have an expensive system.  We maintain 1,633 miles of public roads to every 1000,000 of the population as against 360 in England and Wales and 520 in Scotland.  The Minister for Local Government said in the Dáil recently that the cost of surfacing a road was £250 in 1939 and in 1949 £550, showing an increase of 120 per cent.  That gives some indication of the bill that as ratepayers and taxpayers we shall have to meet if we develop too much on the roads instead of the railways.  The Milne Report points out that of 13,900 commercial vehicles of over one ton Córas Iompair Éireann had 573, or 4 per cent., and that of these 573, 27 per cent. were permanently idle through repairs and also because of the seasonal nature of the traffic, so that to suggest that Córas Iompair Éireann has any real road freight traffic is not correct,</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the Bill does not give dictatorial powers to the chairman, as happened in the case of the 1944 Act.  It is very difficult to meet an all-wise dictator and that is really what the 1944 Act meant.  A person in that position generally becomes vain and arrogant and, like a military dictator, generally takes a step too far in the wrong direction and nothing but disaster attends his efforts.  I certainly approve giving the board control over rates, fares and classifications.  Otherwise, we will be giving them responsibilities without power.  Whether that matter is referred to a transport tribunal or to the Minister, it always involves enormous clerical labour, expense and most irritating delays and, very often, because the people delivering the decision are not transport trained, the decision can be positively stupid in some cases and the people responsible for running the system have to answer for the shortcomings. No such powers could be given to a privately owned company, I quite admit.</P>
    <P>The question of branch lines is to be left to a transport tribunal and I think that is a good idea because this matter of branch lines is generally dealt with <Col N="1008" /> from a sentimental rather than from a commercial or business point of view. I heard a certain Deputy arguing most eloquently for the retention of all the existing branch lines and the reopening of those which had been closed, at the same time as he pressed strongly for the issue of licences to hundreds of lorries which, he said, were idle at present.  He was arguing in favour of two conflicting policies without realising it.  The transport tribunal, however, will be able to decide that issue and if, for sentimental reasons or for employment reasons, we keep open lines which, from a national point of view, should be closed, we can pay for them, either through higher rates or through higher taxation, but the cost will have to be met one way or another.</P>
    <P>Assuming that the borrowing powers of the board to the extent of £7,000,000 are fully realised and that the rate is 3 per cent., it means that the new enterprise will want to have net receipts of £687,000 a year, without making any provisions for sinking fund.  Seeing that it made a loss of £1,200,000 last year and a loss of £1,400,000 the previous year, one can easily see the enormous leeway it has to make up and the task with which the new board will be faced.  It is quite true that the Bill does not enable it in a definite way to earn any higher revenue, but the conditions which it will create should eventually result in a higher revenue.  For instance, the £7,000,000 for re-equipment is in itself the very best way of earning revenue. I should like the Minister to say what is to happen in the case of the redemption of the debenture stock under the 1944 Act.  Section 17 of that Act says it must be redeemed by 1960.  Does that mean that that will have to be done and that new stock will be issued for the purpose of redeeming the 1944 stock?</P>
    <P>There is rather a touch of the humorous in Section 57.  I do not know whether it is intended seriously.  The section says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All permanent public notices and signs, including the names of stations maintained by the board, shall be in the Irish language, but may be in <Col N="1009" /> both the Irish and English languages.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If some puckish-minded board decided that they would avail of their rights and issue all their public notices in the Irish language only, I wonder how the general public who do not know Irish would take it.  To pretend that everybody can read Irish is, of course, a humbug, and I think it is rather playing with things to say that they may issue them in both languages.  I say they should be required to issue them in both languages.  Admittedly, the Minister copied the 1944 Act, but I think it was rather a bad policy to follow.</P>
    <P>The compensation provisions for the employees are about the best that have been provided in any Act of this kind, but I hope there will not be any redundancy. Reductions in staff can be given effect to by means of ordinary wastage &mdash;retirements, deaths and people leaving the service generally.</P>
    <P>I think it is safe to assume that this Bill in itself will not solve the problem which is terribly serious at present.  I do not think the Minister, unlike some of his predecessors, has claimed that it is the final solution of the problem; but it certainly builds a basis for a final solution.  Notwithstanding the great stride which the Bill makes, however, in the direction of a solution, I feel that we shall have to have further legislation when we see how the new conditions operate.  Otherwise, it is a courageous step, a realistic step and, in fact, the only line the Government could have taken.</P>

      <P>The Minister in opening the debate said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I was informed by the then chairman of Córas Iompair Eireann that the company had incurred a loss of over £800,000 in 1947, and that he then estimated that the loss for 1948 would be £1,252,000&mdash;in fact this estimate proved to be somewhat too low as the deficit actually incurred on the year's working was £1,400,000. The measures which the company considered necessary to remedy the position included:&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> (1)  Dismissal of 2,500 men by reductions in maintenance;</P>

      <P>There is no mention in the Milne Report of the proposed dismissal of 2,500 men by reductions in maintenance, and I think that was the Minister's big argument against the old board.  He did not tell us that that was given to him in the course of pointing out the impossible position the board was in unless it got some financial assistance from the Government. There was a proposal that fares be increased which the Minister turned down.  The Government had only just got into power and I can understand that it would not be popular to increase fares then, although they have been increased since.  But there is no statement in the Milne Report that the Minister was informed of the proposed <Col N="1011" /> dismissal of 2,500 men by reductions in maintenance.</P>
      <P>We had better face up to this problem of the railways.  Surely nobody imagines that this Bill is going to improve the position to any great extent? Do we not all know that the railways are a dying concern and have been a dying concern since the development of road transport?  Is not that obvious?  I do not agree with Senator O'Farrell on many things, but I agree with him that as long as we have competition on the roads you will never have a satisfactory railway system. Whether we should allow the railways to die or not is a matter for debate.  I, personally, think we cannot afford that, that it is essential in the national interest that we have the railways.  If we have subsidies we must, despite the propping of the Grand Canal Company, still pay for the railways.  Why should we close branch lines which are just as important to us as the main lines?  I am sorry that the Minister with his Labour background and a Government with Labour men in it baulked at the question of nationalisation. People hold up their hands in horror when nationalisation is mentioned. Professor O'Brien, I think, referred to socialism.  The nationalisation of the public transport system is not socialism in the broad sense of the term.  I am not a socialist, but I am a member of a Labour Party, and I hope, a good one.  I believe it is in the interests of the country that a transport system should be nationalised.  As a matter of fact, with your permission, Leas-Chathaoirleach, I will read from the report of the 4th Annual Congress of Irish Unions held in Tralee in July, 1948.  There was a motion on the agenda proposed by the secretary of the Irish Railwaymen's Union:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This congress calls upon the Government to nationalise public transport in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He made a fairly long speech and, I think, I would claim your indulgence to quote it to you, because it is a very interesting comment on the position of the railways in this country since they were established.  Mr. M. Ó <Col N="1012" /> Maicin, the secretary of the Irish Railwaymen's Union, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the nationalisation of public transport was now more of a necessity than ever before.  For a number of years the railways had considerable difficulty in the matter of revenue whilst the employees were amongst the worst paid of all industries in the country.  That was largely due to the failure of the railways to earn sufficient revenue to pay adequate wages and at the same time pay dividends to shareholders and debenture holders.  He was concerned with the employees.  From the beginning, the Irish railways had been permitted to develop in a haphazard way.  Giving a history of previous inquiries on Irish railways, he said that the first was the Drummond Commission, appointed in 1836.  It reported in 1838.  This commission was appointed before the development of railways in Ireland.  Only the Dublin-Kingstown line which opened in 1834 was in operation.  In 1839 about six miles of railway&mdash;a beginning of the Ulster railway&mdash;were opened.  It had a gauge of 6' 2&rdquo; but this was later discarded and the line between Belfast and Portadown was relaid in the standard Irish gauge 5' 3&rdquo;.  The &lsquo;atmospheric&rsquo; railway, Kingstown to Dalkey, was opened in 1843.  Thomas Drummond, then Under-Secretary in Ireland, was the moving spirit in an endeavour to control the development of railways in Ireland.  He saw the evil of the unsystematic development which had been allowed in England and he pressed the Government so strongly, that a Royal commission was set up, of which he was chairman.</P>
    <P>They proposed three great trunk lines, one for the South and West, with connections to Kilkenny, Waterford, Limerick and Cork; a second by way of Navan to Armagh and thence to Belfast connecting with the already authorised Ulster Railway and having a North-Western branch from Navan via Cavan through Enniskillen and thence to Derry; and the third via Maynooth to Mullingar and thence to Galway and Sligo.  The final report contained a suggestion <Col N="1013" /> for a joint terminus which would also connect with the Dublin-Kingstown line.  The report suggested Government control and guidance rather than State ownership.  &lsquo;The projected railways,&rsquo; they proposed, &lsquo;should be adopted and stamped as national enterprises&rsquo; and should therefore &lsquo; be protected from extravagant demands for compensation, from vexatious opposition, and from the ruinous competition of other companies.&rsquo; These proposals and the emphatic insistence on State control from the very initiation of Irish railways were strongly approved by public opinion in Ireland and the Irish representatives in Parliament, both in Lords and Commons, were almost unanimous in supporting them.  In 1839 the House of Commons adopted the proposals of the report, but as there was included a proposal to provide a sum of £2,500,000 for the construction of the Dublin-Cork line, and as this sum was never forthcoming, nothing further was done and the development of the railways pursued the very haphazard and wasteful course which Drummond sought to avoid.  There was, of course, no vestige of State control.</P>
    <P>In view of subsequent events, Drummond was remarkably foreseeing. He had, of course, the knowledge of what had happened in England to guide him, but the first railway in England had opened only 11 years before&mdash;the Stockton and Darlington Railways in 1825&mdash;and, apart from war controls, it was not until 1948 that English statesmen saw the necessity for the exercise of State control and ownership in England.  The consequence of the neglect of Drummond's warning is that, as Frederick W. Pim, speaking in 1912, says: &lsquo;There is hardly a railway of any importance in Ireland that has not, for half a century or more, been burdened with a weight of over-capitalisation&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>The Devonshire Commission, 1865-1867, was appointed to inquire into the affairs of the railways of the United Kingdom, but they dealt specially with Irish railways and particularly <Col N="1014" /> with proposals of State purchase of the railways&mdash;a matter which was prominently in the public mind in the 1860's, when opinion in Ireland was almost unanimously in favour.  The railways generally were &lsquo;in very low water&rsquo;&mdash;a condition which they have rarely since escaped. This commission nevertheless thought it inexpedient &lsquo;to subvert the policy of leaving the construction and management of railways to the free enterprise of the people&rsquo;&mdash;meaning, of course, the people whose management and development had been so unsuccessful as to make the commission necessary.  One member of the commission, however, did not agree. He was Sir Rowland Hill, originator of the penny stamp.  He thought that &lsquo;railways are essentially monopolies&rsquo; and he advocated State purchase and a system of leases which, by the enforcing of conditions, would give a sufficient measure of State control.  This view was supported by a Mr. Monsell, who advocated a similar expedient. Nothing followed the report of this Commission, and in 1866 a Royal Commission on Irish Public Works, called the Alport Commission, was set up.  It reported in 1888.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Not in four months, like the Milne Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It found that the preponderance of local opinion in Ireland was in favour of State purchase, successive Governments had been against it. Again no action followed the report. Over 20 years passed and a new Commission&mdash;the Viceregal Commission&mdash;was appointed in 1906 and reported in 1910, having spent over three years at 95 public sittings and having examined nearly 250 witnesses. Its terms of reference were &lsquo;to inquire into the present working of railways in Ireland and to report how far they afford separately or in conjunction with other means of transport adequate facilities for the cheap and rapid transport of goods, what causes have retarded the expansion of traffic, and their full utilisation for the development of agricultural and industrial resources of the country; and generally by <Col N="1015" /> what means the economical, efficient and harmonious workings of the Irish railways can be secured.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>Among the suggestions considered by the Commission were subsidies, recoupment of the cost of increased train services, establishment of motor services where no railway facilities were available, voluntary or compulsory amalgamations, and nationalisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think all these remedies are not unknown to us.  They are old friends.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That commission found that &lsquo;broadly speaking, Irish railway managers as a whole neglect few opportunities of developing traffic&rsquo;, but considered it &lsquo;obvious that Irish development will not be fully served by the railways until they cease to be commercial undertakings&rsquo;.  The commission recommended purchase of the railways with administration by a properly elected body, with a guarantee of £250,000 from the treasurer in any year that any deficit in the net revenue made it insufficient to meet the interest on the purchase money. The chances of getting the £250,000 were of course nil and the scheme died.  The most recent commission of course was the transport inquiry of 1938-39, which investigated &lsquo;in particular the circumstances which have led or contributed to the present unfavourable financial position of Great Southern Railways and of other railway companies&rsquo; and &lsquo;whether any changes in the ownership or in the methods of administration or both are necessary or desirable&rsquo;. One hundred and twenty-seven organisations and individuals gave written statements and many of them gave oral evidence.  The inquiry concerned itself with the development of road and motor transport as a competitor of the railways.  The recommendations of the tribunal were mainly: Establishment of a national transport council consisting of a small number of persons with special qualifications; a pooling of the services of the Dublin United Tramways Company and the railway companies; a new Great Southern Railways Board of three directors&mdash;two part-time <Col N="1016" /> elected by the shareholders and one whole-time chairman appointed by the Government; guarantee of the interest on a new capital issue of £1,250,000 debenture stock; and the creation of a special fund from moneys arising out of increased motor vehicle duties.  This to be used to meet deficiencies in the net income of the company for the payment of debenture interest.</P>
    <P>The advent of the war and the reconstructions which were finally made by legislation, but particularly the advent of the war, eased a situation which in 1938 was desperate, but 1948 is worse if anything than 1938.  It is obvious that the legislation has failed to save the railways.  The country either needs a railway system or it does not.  Many think it essential and indispensable.  If it is needed, it must be provided.  In the past, by way of low wages, and deductions from these low wages, the railwayman has had to subsidise the industry.  The basic pay for a railway porter at a first-class station in 1939 was £2 2s. 9d. a week.  These rates were current for 20 years.  They were subject to 10 per cent. reduction for all who joined the railway service subsequent to the 1-1-28 and to a further 10 per cent. cut for all from 1933 to 1939.  These poor rates created in fact a subsidy to the companies. The private haulier and especially the private unorganised haulier operated unfairly against the railways.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I claim your indulgence for reading that.  I want to read the result of it.  It is not very long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be agreed that the subject matter of that speech was relevant.  Here is the paragraph from the 1949 report, headed: &ldquo;Transport Enquiry.&rdquo;  It sets out the terms of reference given to Sir James Milne, and then continues:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The resolution passed at last year's annual meeting, requesting the Government to nationalise public transport was sent to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who replied stating that the representations made would be considered in conjunction with the report on the above inquiry by Sir James Milne.</P>
      <P>A letter was received dated 30th September, 1948, requesting representatives of Congress to meet Sir James Milne, and a conference was arranged, which took place on 6th October, 1948.</P>
      <P>The appointment had been made, in the first instance, by Mr. Sean Keenan of the Department of Industry and Commerce, who stated that Sir James Milne would like to have a general discussion on transport with the Congress representatives. There were no terms of reference for the conference.</P>
      <P>The deputation, in accordance with the resolution passed at the annual meeting, pressed for a recommendation in the report, for nationalisation of transport, but Sir James Milne stated that &lsquo;it was outside his terms of reference&rsquo;.</P>
      <P>The deputation then suggested, after further general discussion that, the rail services should be subsidised and that a long term plan for electrification of road and rail services should be embarked upon in accordance with national policy in the development of native power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the opinion of the members of the deputation that, the discussion with Sir James Milne was unreal, as nothing definite was agreed and vague replies were given to all our <Col N="1018" /> arguments and doubts were expressed as to the amount of good which would come from the inquiry. No publicity was to be given to the conference.</P>
    <P>Two of our affiliated unions submitted written statements to the inquiry&mdash;i.e. the Irish Engineering and Foundry Union and the Irish Railwaymen's Union.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is relevant to the points I am about to make.  It may be my background that makes me have very little faith in experts.  I have seen too many experts in my day and the result of their inquiries has not impressed me very much.  I am not impressed by experts, and I am certainly not impressed by experts that come from outside the country.  Statements were made that Sir James Milne is an Irishman. That may be so, but I believe I am correct in saying that his lifetime has been given in service, not to Ireland but outside the country.  He came over here with several more experts from Britain.  They spent four months going over the position as they found it.  The strange thing is that they never went near the people in control of the transport system.  The strange thing in the report is that all the capital expenditure Córas Iompair Eireann had embarked upon was condemned out of court.  Whether Sir James took cognisance of the fact that the company was in poor circumstances, or whether he was told that&mdash;I suppose he was&mdash;he condemns the capital expenditure out of hand, on the assumption, I suppose, that the company could not afford it.  I would be charitable enough to say that.</P>
    <P>What do we find?  We find the Government embarking on capital expenditure with money they have not got.  The Minister for Finance and, I think, the Minister for External Affairs are raising £12,000,000 capital expenditure which they propose to borrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no, not in the least. I am only trying to justify the ex-chairman in having the vision to hope that, by this expenditure of capital money on capital goods, he would be <Col N="1019" /> in a position to save the company.  It was an impossible task for him, as it will be for the new board, though I wish it well.  I doubt if they can make a success of it without heavy subsidisation and I am sure the Government realise that.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Farrell that as long as there is competition from the road, it will be difficult.  I am not saying it should be prevented.  There has been a lot of talk about the present trouble in Dublin transport and a lot of talk about the rights of the individual. People who have lorries and drive them through the country at cheap rates and injure Córas Iompair Eireann will invoke the Constitution against you if you try to interfere with their livelihood.  Unless some effort is made to control that competition from the roads, I believe the transport system will never be anything but semi-chaotic.</P>
      <P>Senator J.T. O'Farrell has compelled me to mention the late chairman. A man may be over-ambitious and do things with the best of intentions, and if they do not turn out as he would have liked or hoped, he should not be condemned.  After all, it is a maxim that the man who does not take a chance does not get anywhere. Who are the people attacking this man, who has been the butt of Senator O'Farrell and others?  This is the son of a man who spent his life in the service of his country when Cathleen Ní Houlihan had very few friends.</P>
      <P>I as a Labour man have some intimate knowledge of Mr Reynolds. I know that during the 1913 strike, when Labour had very few friends, Mr. Reynolds was in Liberty Hall feeding the hungry strikers and their wives and children. That may be information for some of the people listening to me here tonight. I wondered whether Senator O'Farrell's hostility to Mr. Reynolds was because, as the Senator said, he was bus-minded or had a road transport bias, or whether he was opposed to him as a good Irishman.  Knowing the Senator as I know him, I think I would prefer the latter explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> Mr. Reynolds ran a bus company here and when the Dublin Transport Company took it over, with other bus companies, they got a monopoly and he was appointed chairman.  Despite what Senator Summerfield says, if there was one monopoly that was justified it was the Dublin transport system. We who live in the city know the chaotic condition of transport then.  We were being driven by inexperienced drivers with uninsured vehicles, and it was the mercy of God there were not more accidents.  It was to bring some kind of order out of chaos that the Dublin Transport Company got the monopoly.  At the time, without question, the Dublin United Tramway Company was a failing concern.  Some of us were sentimental with regard to it. I had a bias against Mr. Reynolds because I believed he was bus-minded. We did not like to see the old trams disappearing, but that was a matter of sentiment.  In time they would disappear in any case.  My point is that, with road transport, the railways will go, just as the stage-coach went when the railways came.  Without subsidy and financial help from the taxpayer, the railways cannot be successful.</P>
    <P>The Dublin transport system was a paying concern.  Senator J.T. O'Farrell says that Mr. Reynolds was imposed on the railways.  This prosperous concern, the transport system of Dublin, was imposed on the Great Southern Railways, in an effort to save it.  But for that, the railways would have been shut down long ago.  It is not fair to suggest that, in 1942, there was no petrol, that road transport had ceased, and that the railways had a monopoly.  A monopoly of what?  To run two trains a week, when a train journey from Cork to Dublin took 12 to 14 hours, burning slack and dirt.  I say that, despite the unfair innuendo by Senator O'Farrell about the special trains to the Curragh.</P>

      <P>I understood the reference and it was worthy of the Senator. One would imagine that there was not a war on from 1939 to 1945, that we were working in normal times and that, if the railway system was not a success, it was the responsibility of <Col N="1021" /> the board and the chairman.  We know that nobody could have made a success of the railways in the conditions obtaining in 1943 to 1947.</P>
      <P>I am very sorry that the Minister did not consider nationalisation.  We will have to face it eventually.  As I see what is happening now, the ship is setting sail again, under the same name, possibly with a new coat of paint here and there but with a new crew and we are hoping that with a new crew she will not founder on the rocks that the railway system has foundered on over the past number of years.  The railway system has been a failing concern for the last 20 years. This will not cure it.  It may help and ease the position but, eventually, we will be forced, with or against our will &mdash;personally I would welcome it&mdash;to nationalise the railways and it would be just as well to have done it in the beginning than to wait till later on.</P>

      <P>I am not personal. Despite what Senator Hayes said, I do not like to be personal.  In this House we have a certain standard that we all would like to keep.  If anything hard is said, there is no offence meant.  The difference is this: I suggest that the Minister has shed certain responsibilities that he would have to undertake if the system were nationalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a whole-hogger for nationalisation, because I believe that whoever pays the piper should call the tune.  The Minister is divesting himself of certain responsibilities.  For instance, the shutting of the branch lines.  I say to the Minister, if you have to keep the railways open at all, you are keeping them open at a loss, and keep them all open.  The branch lines are as essential to sections of the <Col N="1022" /> population as the main lines are to other sections.  It is essential that we should not be left with just a skeleton railway serving the big towns and neglecting the small towns.  In the West of Ireland, in Galway and Mayo, and in parts of the South, the branch line is the life of the community. Road transport is not taking the place of the railway.  If it were, we would not be discussing nationalising the railways and there would not be any necessity for this Bill.  I believe that road transport will never replace the railways and, therefore, we must keep them open.  In view of the quantity of freight and the numbers of passengers the railways can carry, they must be kept open.  The railways should be regarded as a national concern and, consequently, should be nationalised.</P>
      <P>With regard to the board proper, it is proposed to set up a board of the maximum number laid down in the Bill.  It is proposed to pay the board and to provide for superannuation of the board.  As I understand the Bill for superannuation purposes they must have ten years' service on the board. I do not know who the members of the board will be.  With Senator Summerfield and others, I hope they will be men chosen for their ability to make a success of the work they have to do. The temptation is always there to appoint men for political reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelColgan" hpid="Mr. Colgan Mr. Colgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not in mind political reasons so much as, possibly, political pensioners.  I consider that they should be comparatively young men with the energy to make a success of what is proposed in the Bill.  In my view, it is a defect in the Bill that they have only five years' tenure of office, although they may be reappointed for another five years.  If you want to get the best, I suggest that you will have to give more security than that.  Under the Trade Union Acts, for instance, a man is appointed as whole-time secretary. Under the rules there must be provision for removing him.  He may be removed by a vote of two-thirds of the members called specially for that <Col N="1023" /> purpose.  That is a statutory rule and, as long as the secretary behaves himself and does his work, he can feel secure and permanent.  There should be a little more security than is provided by appointment for five years with possible reappointment for a further five years.  There ought to be provision for something more permanent than five years, with the goodwill, if you like, of the Minister. I am not talking politics now, but suppose, for instance, there was some rabid Government supporter&mdash;I am not suggesting we have very many of that type about&mdash;on the board of the company and he made himself objectionable to the Opposition, and that, in the meantime, there was a change of Government and his five years were up, it is quite possible that, politics being what they are, that man might not be reappointed.  I do not know who will constitute the board and I think the Minister might consider something more generaous in the way of permanence than what is proposed in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else to say beyond expressing the hope that this measure will be a success.  I feel it cannot be the success we would like it to be until the problem of road transport&mdash;both passenger and freight&mdash;is tackled and some kind of arrangement made to obviate that fierce competition between the private haulier, the privately owned car and the private transport system.  It is obvious that conditions are not as favourable as they might be for Córas Iompair Eireann, from the point of view of their charges, as they are for their private competitors who are not paying the same rates of wages.  Men with lorries are able to pick up freight and to obtain men to work for them cheaper than the concern which has to pay correct and decent wages.  We know that, from a trade union point of view, it is impossible to get these people to conform to proper standards. Many of them are fly-by-nights who take traffic wherever they can get it and whenever it suits them.  I hope the new undertaking will be a success. <Col N="1024" /> I regret the attacks made here and elsewhere on the late chairman.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the Dublin Trades Council, I went to see him with a deputation when he took over the transport system in the city and I know what I am talking about.  At that time the conditions in transport were chaotic.  At Inchicore, for instance, you had quarter baked, half-baked, threequarter baked and fully baked men at work, all getting different rated of pay.  I remember well what the then chairman of Córas Iompair Eireann said.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If any man can do the work, I will pay him the rate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I can tell you that very few employers will say that.  I am speaking from the experience of the man as an employer, and as a result of my dealings with him, and I must say that on one occasion I admired his courage in coming to a meeting of very fierce and violent workers in the passenger section which was held in the Traders Hall in Capel Street.  The feelings of the men were such that he might have been torn asunder but he had the courage to attend that meeting and he gave me an impression of being a reasonable as well as a courageous man.  It is true that he may have been too impatient. He may have had faults, but we ought to give him credit for doing what he thought best in the interests of the people of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most important pieces of legislation ever to come before the Oireachtas.  One must regret that so much of the time was wasted in futilities&mdash;the last time after the Minister's speech and again to-day. This important piece of legislation is going to affect the lives of all the people of this country, young and old, no matter in what part of it they may reside.  Because of that fact it is the kind of legislation that demands acute examination by every responsible member of the House and by everyone who is concerned with the future of the country so that they may be able to make the best contribution they can to the examination and discussion of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> I am sorry that we had Senator Ó Buachalla leading off for the Opposition, and one might say that such a combination of negations and futilities we have seldom had to listen to here, or, indeed, anywhere else.  I do not think that there was one constructive suggestion anywhere from beginning to end in the speech.  The Senator quoted at length from the report of Sir James Milne.  I found it difficult to know whether he supported the report or whether he was against it.  He quoted it in favour of the late chairman of the board when it suited him and he condemned the report in almost the next breath.  Where does all that bring us? The Senator made all sorts of objections and innuendoes against the Minister, and altogether I think his contribution to this important Bill was one of the most unworthy we had for a long time and one which was no credit to his Party or to himself.  It was neither in the spirit nor the language that one would expect on a subject like this that is vital for all of us.  I am not going to worry about his criticisms because that they had no relation to the Bill.  If there never was a Sir James Milne or a Sir James Milne Report the situation that confronted the Minister and his colleagues when they came into office would demand urgent action. They found, unquestionably, a bankrupt concern&mdash;drawers, as we know now, full of cheques that could not be cashed, to the value of over £1,000,000. What were they to do about that?  Was the country to go on with a so-called transport system that was not giving service, but spending money it had not got and signing cheques it could not honour?  The whole problem of transport was in such a mess that it was clear that drastic action would have to be taken if it were not to be closed down.  That was the situation which confronted the Minister and his colleagues when they came into office.</P>
    <P>I do not know the ex-chairman of Córas Iompair Eireann and I am not attacking him&mdash;I am not an accountant &mdash;because I am sure that within his limits he is a man of considerable ability, but he overspent and, of course, he was not the first man of ability in this country who overspent, who spent a great deal more than he had got and <Col N="1026" /> spent money that he had no authority to spend.  Any of us trying to balance our accounts, if we have any sincerity, look to see what we have in our pockets or what credit we have in the bank, and it is for us to remember that if we exceed what we may spend we will not be long in this or any other house.  We know where people land themselves by this kind of conduct and what its consequences are likely to be for the chairman of Córas Iompair Eireann and his colleagues.  We may leave Sir James Milne out of it, and we may also disregard mechanical and engineering problems like the question of altering our engines from steam to Diesel propulsion. We can leave out all considerations like that and remember that the Government was confronted with a situation in which they had to take decisive action and could not go on honestly trying to reconstruct the company under the management of a group of people like those who landed it into such a mess.  I think in fairness to the people who mismanaged the concern that the less we say about them and about the way it was mismanaged, the more charitable we will be.  I will leave it at that, but that does not solve the problems of transport in the country. We must face the fact that we have a problem, and also face the fact that, as we were reminded by some Senators, we will have to pay for it.</P>
    <P>We have as means of transport, rail road and water.  We have plenty of water, but it is not carrying much traffic and we have miles and miles of railway lines and for many years past the amount of traffic which has passed over them has continued to fall.  That has not only been the case over the past couple of years, but it has steadily declined over the last 15 years.  I am not going to go over the things that brought about the decay of the transport system here, but we must visualise what the consequences of the implementation of the legislation before us will be on transport in this country and on the business, trade, commerce and productivity of the nation.</P>
    <P>I feel and I have felt for a very long time&mdash;quite frankly I say it and I think somebody else said the same thing&mdash;<Col N="1027" /> too many people are employed to carry the goods that must be carried in this country.  I think we are not facing that fact.  I would prefer to see more people engaged in production than in the job of carrying goods. Although we have shirked that for a long time, it is a fact.  Like other speakers on the other side of the House, even Senator Colgan addressing himself to the problem of railways, wants all the branch lines to be kept open and, at the same time as far as I can judge, with his colleagues, he wants what some would style the &ldquo;pirate&rdquo; lorries kept running and, in fact, permits given to more.  To transport what?  These people would be better employed producing something which the people already in the transport industry could be paid for carrying.  The problem is that productivity has been declining over the years.  It declined consistently during the war.  There were reasons for that, but I bet that if anybody examines the number of people employed in transport he will find that they have increased during the war and we must face that.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, speaking as one engaged in agriculture, the difficulty confronting agriculturists is that the cost of transporting their goods adds practically as much to their value as the producer received for them and that is a very unsatisfactory condition of affairs and a situation which requires examination.  If we are asked as farmers what we want in the shape of transport it is a very difficult question to answer.  Agriculture in its essence is an industry in which unity is essential and at the same time great diversity.  The transport needs of agriculturists should be well served with considerable flexibility and it is not good to have hard and fast rules.  I find myself in very great difficulty in accepting a situation where you can make a Government Order applying to the country as a whole because I am convinced that it is impossible to work a transport system in that fashion which will give the country the kind of service the country needs.  I myself would be very reluctant to see any <Col N="1028" /> decision taken regarding the closing of the branch lines and, at the same time, the fact remains that in many of the areas served by these branch lines there are a number of privately owned lorries among the business community and there are others plying for hire. When these road vehicles carry whatever goods are available very little is left to be carried by the railways.  A situation like that demands careful study and examination on the spot and, therefore, it seems to me quite ridiculous to make an Order applying to the country as a whole.  The situation must be and ought to be studied on the spot.  The people charged with the responsibility of operating the system should make a study of the situtation; they should go to the district and meet the people of the district who are concerned about transport, particularly the producers who must be particularly concerned, and discuss with them the question of transport.  Heretofore people sat in Kingsbridge and made an order coldly and ruthlessly which applied to the country without any regard for local circumstances.  That is not satisfactory. If consideration were given to the fact that each particular area is different from another in taking a decision regarding transport the transport system would be better organised and more acceptable to the producers of the country and that is what you require in order to encourage productivity in the country.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the fact that in my judgment we have too many hands plying for hire as transporters of goods.  I think that is all wrong and we will have to readjust our point of view regarding this.  I heard Senator Ó Buachalla charge the Minister with a total disregard of the matter of unemployment in particular counties. He referred especially to Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Clare and Kerry and by innuendo he suggested that the Minister was so cold and almost callous &mdash;one would get the impression that that was what he was trying to convey except that he did not use just that word&mdash;about the people who require work that he would not be concerned about holding the 3,500 people whom <Col N="1029" /> the late chairman was going to release. As I see it, the situation in this country is that we have not enough people to do the work which has to be done. That is the truth and I challenge anybody coming from the country to say where in rural Ireland he can get a second or a third worker.  He cannot be got in my district, that is, a man who will work and be worth the pay and that is the way throughout the country.  New capital schemes have been undertaken by the Government and all credit to them.  It is a wise and profitable investment provided that people will work and put their backs into the job.  In studying the transport problem we must in addition study the most economic utilisation of the labour resources open to us.  We talk about the agricultural potential and the industrial potential but the main factor in the productivity of the country and the country's progress is the human potential and it is an absolute waste to have a couple of thousand people wanting to transport goods when there are not enough goods to pay them a decent wage.</P>
    <P>The difficulties of transporting agricultural products to-day are very considerable and there are a whole lot of contradictions in the situation.  Those of us who want to keep our transport organisation or railways going, who believe that they are essential to the life of the country&mdash;although they are somewhat outdated we cannot afford to dispense with our rail system&mdash;see considerable difficulties in the maintenance of the transport system.</P>
    <P>Not the least of these difficulties is the attitude of a great many people employed on the railways.  I have some experience of this.  The decline of the railways generally is due to a variety of causes, but one must admit that the kind of service one gets from the railway company and some of the employees at times is not the kind of service that is most attractive.  A transport organisation like the railways must realise that it has a service to sell and that its courtesy and preparedness to work hard will be a factor in making people determine whether they will buy that service or not.  I wish that both the people managing <Col N="1030" /> that concern and the people working in it over the years had had a better and clearer appreciation of the importance of that when trying to sell their service.  People have gone from the railways.  Why?  If you travel on a train what do you find?  I travel on the railway still and the truth is that one would think the train never wanted to leave some of the wayside stations. One never say any hurry on any of the employees to get the train on to the next station, with the result that one vowed that one would not be caught in a train again, whatever other way one did one's travelling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very fine, but that is a true enough picture of the situation.  It is not at all to our credit that we are so lackadaisical in the matter of the kind of service we are prepared to give to the public in these large undertakings.  It does not matter who is going to run the undertaking&mdash;whether it is run privately, as a semi-State concern, as it was up to recently, or under this new scheme which is practically nationalisation&mdash;unless the people who work it and manage it realise that they are dependent on the goodwill of the people to whom they are selling their service, the undertaking will not meet with sucess.  Then something else will happen.  The paying public and the taxpaying community reach a point at which they get tried of all this kind of thing, and we will come to a stage at which we shall probably be taking another kind of action with regard to our transport organisation.</P>
      <P>As an illustration, I have seen railway lorries employed to do particular work&mdash;to take milk to creameries, to take farmers' pigs to the curing factories, and other work of that nature. But men worked their trade union day, and if they were five or ten minutes over the time, a problem was created for the poor farmer.  That is the sort of thing that makes that method of transport very unwelcome and rather undependable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>In our district, there is a considerable amount of milk to be transported and the lorries had to come so far to the point at which they took the milk that the cost of transporting it from a remote district was more than the value of the milk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Side by side with that, you had the situation that they would not transport it and there was no private haulier in the district who would get a permit to haul it because he did not want it.  The net result was that the productivity of a whole district was completely shut off.  What do you think will be the reaction of producers to such a situation, a situation which could be multiplied many times through the country?  That is not a situation with which a scattered farming community like ours wants to be confronted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope that under more competent management than we have experienced for a number of years that situation will be rectified, but it will not be rectified unless we are prepared to stand up and speak of it not with our tongues in our cheeks but as facts which must be faced and tackled by the people who are to succeed those who so mismanaged the country's transport system as to have cheques for £500,000 drawn which they could not honour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We who live in the more remote <Col N="1032" /> parts of the country on farms and who look out on agricultural Ireland are very concerned about the prospects of this transport organisation.  The tragedy, of course, is that we have for so long been trying to build up Dublin to the neglect of the rest of the country.  The people have gone away from it and the development of the more remote areas from the point of view of agricultural productivity has fallen and nothing has been put in its place.  If our transport organisation is to get a chance to be a success, some positive steps must be taken to decentralise productivity in the country as a whole.  Not only must the capital undertakings, for the putting into operation of which the Government have taken action, be proceeded with apace, not only must the land rehabilitation scheme be given the greatest possible impetus any of us who have responsibility can give it, but wherever it is possible to have industries developed and scattered in the more remote parts, that, too, must be part of Government policy, because it is quite impossible to have a successful transport organisation where you have one great centre like we have to-day in the City of Dublin, with the tendency to centralise all the production and consumption in and around it.  That, in my opinion, is something that must be avoided, something which must be vigorously tackled, if this transport organisation is to get a chance.</P>
    <P>I feel that, while the Minister's Bill gives us an opportunity to express our views on what it contains and our views about its possibilities of successful operation and co-ordination of our transport scheme, there are certain considerations which the Government must keep in mind.  There is no question whatever that we shall have to decide as between the kind of scheme the ex-Minister for Local Government, Deputy MacEntee, had in mind and the kind of scheme which would be sensible with regard to the building up of roads.  Deputy MacEntee at one stage conceived the idea that we had to spend about £20,000,000 on building roads.  The present situation in regard to the maintenance of our roads is a <Col N="1033" /> matter of very serious concern, so far as the ratepayers are concerned.  It is a matter which, in all counties in these days, is being given a great deal of discussion and attention, and I feel, as one who has had to take part in these discussions, that the cost of building and keeping our roads in condition to-day has reached a point at which the ratepayers are not prepared to carry the present burden very much longer.</P>
    <P>If there is an organisation of a transport system on the basis of heavier traffic and more traffic on our roads, the Government will be compelled to face a situation in which they will perforce have to make a much larger contribution to the construction and maintenance of these roads than they are making to-day. I think all that has to be faced.  So far as I am concerned I feel that that aspect of it must be kept in mind by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The country ought to be clear on what it wants, and the new board, in whatever line of policy it is going to pursue, must keep in mind this fact, that if the transport organisation of the future is to be built on the basis of more traffic on the roads than is being carried to-day, that if the costs of that are to be borne to a greater extent by the ratepayers than they are being borne to-day; then we are going to reach breaking point.  I think, Sir, that aspect of it is probably the most important of all from the agricultural point of view.  The Bill just prepares the way.  I think, so far as the Minister is concerned, that he had no alternative but to face the situation and to introduce this measure.  He was left, as I said at the beginning, with such an appalling problem that he had got to take action.  The action which he has taken was the only alternative left.</P>

      <P>I have a vague recollection of seeing a cartoon in one of our comic papers some years ago that depicted two men up a mountain, apparently, making poteen.  There was, apparently, a still and smoke curling up.  One man said to the other: &ldquo;Isn't it funny, our business seems to get on so well and the Government doing everything it can to stamp it out.  All <Col N="1034" /> these industries that the Government seems to support are going down.&rdquo; Well, now, the people who were responsible for that seemed to have public transport in mind.  I do not think there is any other matter that has been so widely discussed in this House, and in Dáil Eireann, or I do not think there is any other matter to which so much public time has been given as this question of transport, as far as I can recollect, over the past number of years, five, ten or even 20 years.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to make another legislative modification of the existing system of our transport, but if one is to try to find in the Bill that fairy godmother that one would think is in the Bill, having heard some people speak in favour of it, I cannot see where that fairy godmother is and that is going to eliminate all the difficulties of our public transport and put everything on a proper footing.  I do not see, nor do I at all agree, that this Bill is going to solve that problem. Now, Córas Iompair Eireann, in 1944 or 1945, was set up in the hope of consolidating public transport in this country. From some points of view, it could be argued that it was successful.  From other points of view, it could be argued that it was unsuccessful.  Where was the difficulty?  We should always remember that Córas Iompair Eireann, and the precursors of Córas Iompair Eireann, the Dublin Transport Company, and the Great Southern Railways&mdash;again, it was a company that was brought about by an amalgamation of other companies&mdash;were and are private businesses.  They were organised by private people, very often poor people and, in some cases, their savings and the nest-eggs of families were subscribed to their creation and were invested in the transport companies of this country that culminated in Córas Iompair Eireann, that is now going to be dissolved to make room for the new Córas Iompair Eireann.  Well, the public transport company belongs to these people who are the members of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our legislation here, we are trying to reconcile two principles that, apparently, it was quite impossible to reconcile already, to make a private enterprise serve as a public easement, <Col N="1035" /> because you cannot call it a public utility.  That is what is still being attempted, to some extent.  The only difference now is that the taxpayers will be shareholders in future as well as the people who originally subscribed their money to the provision of transport companies.</P>
    <P>If Córas Iompair Eireann, having regard to the circumstances in which it found itself, could do things that another private business that was not controlled by the Government in the public interest, if they could do things that a private business could do, then, in such circumstances, Córas Iompair Eireann would have paid its way.  If Córas Iompair Eireann had only given a service where it was economic to give that service, if they had only run buses on the streets of Dublin, and trains on the main lines, where there was a volume of merchandise and a volume of passenger transport, such as would justify its economic existence, then Córas Iompair Eireann would have paid.  But, then, the State through the agency of the Government, imposed on Córas Iompair Eireann an added responsibility, imposed it on a private business in the public interest.  Mind you, I am not saying it was wrong for the State to do that, but I do say it is wrong to try to saddle the responsibility for the bad effects of that on certain individuals. The fact is that it was done, is being done, and that system is going to be continued.  If Córas Iompair Eireann could have operated as a private business, without having any regard to giving the public an easement, then Córas Iompair Eireann would have paid its way and would not have found itself in the difficulties that it is in.</P>
    <P>One cannot help reflecting, and thinking, that there is a certain amount of expediency in our dealings with this question of transport, and that we are just afraid to face up to the realities of the situation.  We are not, apparently, either in the past or the present, prepared to assess facts as they are and have either one thing or the other, have either private business engaged in transport in the country or else have nationalisation. <Col N="1036" /> I am afraid we must make up our minds at this stage, definitely make up our minds, as to what exactly we require by way of public transport.  It is my opinion, that our people want public transport purely as a sort of easement. I think they have gone past the stage of requiring public transport as a service, because that service has not been supported by the people in the manner that would make one think that our people want it as a service.  We seem to want transport like piped water or a sewerage scheme, as an easement. Where is the duty of the State and how far can that requirement be reconciled to private enterprise?  I argue that it cannot be reconciled.  Apparently passenger and freight transportation must be kept there for us to use when it suits us, so that it may carry the uneconomic traffic while we reserve our rights to have our own individual transport at our own convenience. That being the position, I cannot see what benefit will be derived from this new attempt to make legislative provision for reorganisation.  If Córas Iompair Eireann could take only the type of work that is economic and were not compelled to give a public service, it would not be in the financial condition it is in to-day.  I do not, however, subscribe to the statements about bankruptcy made so glibly by people whose interest in transport should be as great as mine, since the livelihood of so many of our workers is involved.</P>
    <P>Last year and the year before, according to figures used in this debate, Córas Iompair Eireann lost £1,200,000 and £1,400,000.  It is really tragic that the responsibility for those losses in some way has been placed on the chairman and board.  It is not right that that should be done.  I hope I will be different from other people who have spoken in reference to the chairman.  In Córas Iompair Eireann there was a chairman and a board.  We have heard very little so far about the board, though the board, acting with the chairman, were the controllers.  As far as I know, that board worked in harmony with the chairman.  I ask those who are anxious to criticise the ex-chairman to contradict that statement, if they can.  Any responsibility <Col N="1037" /> for those losses in two successive years must be placed on the chairman and the board and not on the chairman alone.</P>
    <P>If Córas Iompair Eireann lost those sums, why was that so?  Was it not because, when private transport became available to us, we decided to use our private motor cars and lorries, and sent the sand and the empty Guinness barrels over the rail and travelled on the buses only when our motor cars were broken or it suited us and we wanted always to have that service there as an easement?  The chairman and the board were compelled, and will continue to be compelled, to keep that transport there, as far as I can see. That is not so definite in this Bill as it was in the 1944 Act, which provided that certain things could not be done without the consent of the Minister. Then, at any rate, the Minister had the moral courage to face his responsibilities and if decisions, often unpopular decisions, had to be taken, he did his duty as Minister for Industry and Commerece.</P>
    <P>These losses are due to uneconomic services having to be maintained in rural districts where the volume of either merchandise or passenger traffic would not justify a service, form the private business standpoint.  No private business, unless compelled, would maintain such a service as Córas Iompair Eireann has had to maintain.  I am not suggesting that it should not be maintained, since the poorer areas in the west and the congested districts have a greater need of such service than there is around the City of Dublin. I argue that those services should be maintained, but if I do so argue, it is because I have come round to the viewpoint that public transport is a service, or rather an easement.  If it were run by a private enterprise, they would keep only the paying services in force and a profit could have been made in those years, but Córas Iompair Eireann had to maintain a service.</P>
    <P>The passenger transport decreased substantially in the years in which those losses were incurred.  Most people will agree that passenger traffic is the most economic type on the railways, for the simple reason that passenger <Col N="1038" /> transport loads and unloads itself.  The number of workers on the railway required to load the same weight of merchandise would entail a wage bill which would go a long way to make it uneconomic. That type of traffic has been lost to the company by the return in increasing numbers of private motor cars.  What can we do about that? Senator Baxter suggested that we would have to face up to that question at some time.  I hope I am not misquoting.</P>

      <P>It is necessary to repeat the thing several times to make it clearly understood by some people. That, of course, does not apply to the Chair.  I bow to your ruling.  I have given the reasons why Córas Iompair Eireann finds itself in its present position. The company, through the medium of the chairman and the board, took the only course open to them some time ago.  They found themselves going into an abnormally serious position and decided to do certain things provided they got the sanction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  They decided to reduce the number of workers in areas where they were redundant; to close certain lines, probably; to increase passenger fares, both road and rail, and freight charges.  It is not in any vexatious way that I say to the Minister that he delayed taking a decision on those vital matters for a considerably long time.  In the meantime an inquiry was held into the whole position.  During the interim period, a substantially large amount of the losses that we now hear about were incurred because Córas Iompair Eireann were compelled by the State to continue to lose money. That is a fact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in the <i>Irish Press</i> that I read that.  If the Minister is trying to suggest that the <i>Irish Press</i> prints untruths, I do not subscribe to his view.  That is all I will <Col N="1039" /> say.  I read more than one newspaper. That, I suggest, was unfortunate but it was worse still to place the responsibilities for those losses on one man, the ex-chairman of Córas Iompair Eireann.  That has happened inside this House and outside it.  I have tried to associate the chairman and the board in this matter because the board and the chairman acted in perfect co-operation.  Therefore, it is quite possible&mdash;I am open to contradiction and would welcome contradiction&mdash;that it was malicious, that the responsibility for the position should be placed on the chairman.</P>
      <P>The expert, Sir James Milne, was brought here and he brought experts to help the expert.  A report was duly issued.  This Bill is a contradiction of that report.  If that report meant anything, it meant that the railways or the transportation company would have to be nationalised.  I suggest that this Bill seeks in a certain form to nationalise Córas Iompair Eireann. The Minister has paid tribute to Sir James Milne and his experts, but it is not a great tribute when the recommendations of the report are not implemented. A central highway authority was recommended in the Milne Report.  Apparently, there is no intention on the part of the Minister, in this Bill at any rate, to implement that recommendation.  I suppose it will not be done.  The Milne Report recommended many of the things that Córas Iompair Eireann requested the Minister to agree to at a much earlier date, including increases in fares and freight charges.  The Minister agreed after that very long delay.  It would have been obvious to anybody, after examining the position, without getting experts at all, that as the company was in the condition in which it was, its operations would have to cease altogether or it would have to be allowed to do the things it wanted to do, namely, to increase fares.  That was not done soon enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, in my opinion, proposes to give full control of the management of Córas Iompair Eireann to a board set up by the Minister.  Senator Colgan <Col N="1040" /> does not think it is full-blooded nationalisation.  It is not such complete nationalisation as he would like. I do not want to be construed as being opposed to nationalisation as such.  I am not.  I believe that anything which by its very nature is public, such as money, rivers, or the tides of the sea, any service that is of its nature public, should be controlled by the public, in the public interest.</P>

      <P>It is my opinion. Apparently there is some difference in the mind of Senator Colgan between nationalisation and socialisation.  I leave it to others to define that difference. I cannot see it.  I know that, in Britain, when particular services or undertakings are being nationalised, a certain group say they are being socialised.  I do not think the difference has been very clearly established. But even if it is the desire on the part of some people to suggest that this is socialisation, I say that even then, there would be nothing wrong.  I personally am not opposed to the nationalisation of a service that cannot be maintained otherwise or run along the lines that the people want it run.  If it cannot be run otherwise, then I am in favour of nationalisation. Senator O'Brien referred to the provision that is made in this Bill for compensation to the stockholders of Córas Iompair Eireann and the Grand Canal Company.</P>
