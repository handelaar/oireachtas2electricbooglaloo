    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of this annual Bill is to give effect to the financial resolutions already passed by the Dáil following the Budget.  The opportunity is taken at the same time to introduce any miscellaneous financial matters which require legislative authority.</P>
      <P>Section 1 is the usual section corresponding to Financial Resolution No. 1 and its purpose is to provide for the charge of income-tax and surtax for the current tax year and for the continuance of previous legislation dealing with these taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 2, 3 and 4 are relieving sections.  The first of these brings up <Col N="322" /> to date the existing exemption from income-tax in respect of wound and disability pensions and gratuities granted under the Army Pensions Acts.  The second extends the existing exemption from income-tax of certain allowances payable to the widows of persons killed in the 1916 Rising, so as to cover increases in those allowances granted under the Army Pensions (Increase) Act, 1949. The purpose of the third of these relieving sections is to exempt from income-tax allowances payable to relatives of signatories to the Proclamation of Easter Week, 1916, and also the annuity payable under the Griffith Settlement Act, 1923.  Originally, allowances payable to the relatives of the Proclamation signatories were exempt from income-tax but later these payments were not exempted, as the Griffith Settlement Act did not provide for exemption.  It has been agreed that all such allowances should be exempt from tax and provision is being made in this section accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that the preferential rate of customs duty applicable under Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1949, to unmanufactured tobacco grown in, and consigned from, a part of the British Commonwealth of Nations shall, with certain exceptions, cease to apply as from 31st July, 1950.</P>
    <P>Section 6 has been inserted following representations which I received during the year from a great many quarters.  These representations were to the effect that it was not often possible to keep the expenses incurred in connection with educational and charitable dances or other similar entertainments to as low as 30 per cent. of the takings.  In such circumstances, where the expenses could not be kept as low as 30 per cent., the relief from taxation granted in 1943 was not provided to the extent desired. Section 6 now provides that the expenses limit of 30 per cent. be increased to 50 per cent. as from 1st August, 1950.</P>
    <P>As regards Section 7, my attention had been drawn to the fact that, although most of the games of an amateur type conducted under amateur <Col N="323" /> auspices have been exempt from time to time from entertainment duty, amateur westling games have been left out.  There is no reason why wrestling should not be exempted and I have made provision for such exemption in this section.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (1) of Section 8 provides that, on and after the 6th July, a person authorised to conduct auctions by virtue of an auctioneer's licence or an auction permit, granted under the provisions of the Auctioneers and House Agents Act, 1947, may act as an appraiser without being licensed under the Appraisers Licences Act, 1806.  It was really intended that that should be the case, but licences under the Auctioneers and House Agents Act are often taken out for a company and it is then not possible for the exemption in fact to operate in favour of people who are called appraisers or people who get auction permits.  There is a consequential sub-section which repeals as from the 6th July, 1950, Section 7 of the Appraisers Licences Act, 1806, which provides that all persons duly licensed to act as auctioneers may act as appraisers without being licensed as such under the Act.  That sub-section is consequential on the passing of the auctioneers' and house agents' legislation and on the provision I am now making.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is designed to give full effect to the provisions of the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation in so far as they relate to customs matters.</P>
    <P>Sections 10, 12, 13, 14 and 15 relate to the very technical conventions concluded between the Irish Government and the Government of the United States in relation to double taxation. They were explained by me in considerable detail when I was speaking on the Second Stage in Dáil Eireann and I am assuming, for the time being, that that explanation has been read. These conventions are set out in the Schedules to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 11 extends for a further period of three years the exemption from corporation profits tax allowed to certain public utility concerns, etc. <Col N="324" /> This exemption expired on 31st December, 1949.</P>
    <P>Section 16 secures with retrospective effect that last year's legislation increasing the stamp duty in respect of fines or premiums on leases shall not apply in the case of leases by a local authority under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts or the Labourers Acts or in the case of a lease by a society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts and made in accordance with a scheme for the provision of houses for its members.</P>
    <P>Section 17 is designed to rectify a legal flaw which enabled the 5 per cent. tax to be avoided in the transfer of house property in certain cases.</P>
    <P>Section 18 explains itself.</P>
    <P>Section 19 embodies machinery to allow assurance companies to compound for stamp duty on industrial assurance policies.</P>
    <P>Section 20 again was explained at some length in Dáil Eireann because it was not referred to in the Budget discussions.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Section 20 are of a purely administrative character and do not raise issues of policy.  The main purpose of sub-section (2) is to give the Minister power to invest foreign exchange held to the credit of the foreign exchange account, but he is restricted to two types of investment, either interest-bearing deposits with a bank or Government securities of the country in which such exchange is held.  The rest of the section is consequential and no special point arises on it.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides for a further extension of the life of the Transition Development Fund to the 31st March, 1951, when it will be definitely wound up.  While the moneys of the Fund could have been applied to various capital purposes in practice nearly all issues from it have been in respect of local authority housing including sanitary services which might just as well be provided for in the Vote for Local Government along with allied expenditure. After this year, as the Dáil has already been informed, all State assistance in respect of local authority housing will be provided through that Vote, and the opportunity will be taken <Col N="325" /> to simplify the basis of subsidisation which at present is unduly complicated.</P>
    <P>Issues from the Fund this year are estimated at £3,630,000 of which £3,461,000 is for housing and £169,000 for sanitary services.  As the balance in the Fund at the beginning of the year was down to £1,630,000 it will be necessary to take a special Vote for about £2,000,000 as provided for in sub-section (2) to enable the Fund to meet the total estimated expenditure for the year.</P>
    <P>Section 22 relates to the Capital Services Redemption Account.  It will be noticed that after certain definitions have been set out, there is to be established an account called the Capital Services Redemption Account.  Sub-section (3) of Section 22 provides a sum of £655,432 to redeem borrowing and interest thereon in respect of capital services.  This is to be charged annually in the Central Fund, commencing with the financial year ending on 31st March, 1951.  The annuity will be paid into a redemption account in half-yearly equal instalments.</P>
    <P>Section 23 is the section which provides for the transfer of £300,000 from the Road Fund to the Exchequer for the purpose of meeting general charges falling on the Central Fund. When the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, was being enacted it was indicated that the proceeds of the increases in taxation on private motor vehicles provided for in it would not be available for roads expenditure but would be devoted towards meeting the cost of food subsidies.  The additional revenue at the time was estimated at £300,000 for a full year.  Since then there has been a considerable increase in the number of private vehicles taxed, so that the receipts from the increases in taxation would now be considerably more than £300,000 a year.  This means that the Road Fund gains to the extent of some £100,000 to £150,000 not taken by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Section 24 is the customary provision placing under the &ldquo;care and management&rdquo; of the Revenue Commissioners all taxes imposed by this year's Finance Act.</P>
    <P>Section 25 is the usual provision in the Finance Act covering the &ldquo;short <Col N="326" /> title,&rdquo;&ldquo;construction&rdquo; and commencement of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 22 is the section upon which most of the discussion in Dáil Eireann turned.  Section 22 has apparently been misunderstood.  There is no reason really for a section of this type but it arises out of the borrowing programme in respect of the capital development of the Government announced or forecasted by the Taoiseach to the bankers and at a meeting in Clonmel and mentioned here and there is Dáil statements.  In the Budget statement this year I said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Central Fund Estimate shows an increase of £1,166,000 over actual issues in 1949-50, mainly for the service of public debt, which this year includes an annuity of £655,000 to redeem in full over a 30-year period the £12,113,680 of voted capital services which are being met by borrowing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>£12,000,000 odd is the sum which is shown on the face of the Book of Estimates this year as being for capital services.  This provision then is to set up a special account known as the Capital Services Redemption Account for the payment of the interest on the sum of £12,000,000 odd and the amortisation of it over 30 years.  When the Government came to a decision to admit in the Finance Bill the obligation of lodging this money to the Special Account they were fully aware of certain things: first, that the amount borrowed on foot of capital services might not meet the £12,000,000 odd which appears on the face of the Estimates; second, that it might be incurred only gradually over the year, and third, which has added force if what I said in respect to No. 1 is true, that the interest and sinking fund might be very much less than the sum provided for the year which is a full year's debt.  The fact was lost sight of in the discussion in Dáil Eireann that without special provision of this kind interest on borrowings for capital purposes would have to be charged on the Central Fund as would the sinking fund on long-term borrowing on a national loan.  £655,000 odd is provided for as evidence of the acceptance of the obligation of discharging capital service borrowings out of <Col N="327" /> revenue over a period of 30 years and the determination to secure that result. The 3½ per cent. interest and sinking fund required to redeem the £12,000,000 odd is £655,432.</P>
    <P>That section led in the Dáil to a discussion regarding the matter of capital services and borrowings in respect of them.  That matter has been under discussion in this House once and in Dáil Eireann on several occasions.  Again, I ask here as I asked before that in this debate Senators will let me know of any part of the £12,000,000 itemised in the Book of Estimates for which they consider this not to be a proper system of securing payment.  They might let me know so that the items would be treated here in detail because I find it impossible to get those who are opposed to the scheme to come down to bedrock and list the items which they deem inappropriate to be dealt with in this way.</P>
    <P>I will begin by quoting&mdash;as I will certainly will have to quote it before the end of the debate&mdash;the speech of one of the chief members of the Opposition regarding finance of this type.  On the 6th March, 1948, Deputy Lemass addressed one of the Fianna Fáil Cumainn and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Austerity had not helped in increasing prosperity elsewhere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He had in mind that the Government were setting out on a policy of austerity.  His tune has changed but the speech remains.  He went on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There was no justification for forcing their people to do without goods or services which they needed and which could be purchased for sterling.  There was no need to cut down worthwhile projects for development merely to maintain external assets at their present level.</P>
    <P>Plans for housing, arterial drainage, turf production, aviation, national defence, electricity development, harbour improvements, the expansion of the merchant marine service, transport reorganisation, and the like, would all require substantial capital expenditure.  Fianna Fáil had been fully prepared to undertake <Col N="328" /> all those projects, having been fully satisfied that the national resources were adequate, and that they would contribute in the future to the national prosperity or security. It was not a matter of choosing between those developments, plans and needed improvements in the social services, as the &ldquo;ex-Labour&rdquo; Minister for Local Government had suggested.  There was no reason why the country could not have had both.</P>
    <P>The present was a time for courage and enterprise, drive and enthusiasm. Instead they were being offered a mess of negatives, the timorous conservatism of little men who were afraid of the tasks with which they had been entrusted, who lacked confidence and imagination, and who were going to miss the greatest chance the Irish people ever had of placing the whole national economy permanently on a higher plane of productivity and safety.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are taking that chance now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill affords this House an opportunity of reviewing the past year and dealing with the proposals of the Government, which are put before the people, for the future.  In doing so on this occasion, I think we should have regard to the position not alone at home but abroad. We see to-day the nations of the world, particularly the nations of Europe, preparing for what one could describe, quite justly, as an even greater catastrophe than the last war.  In those circumstances, it is only right that we should, on this occasion, get from the Minister, as the responsible spokesman of the Government, some indication of what preparations are being made or what policy is being put before the people to prepare for any emergencies that might arise.  We see to-day money being poured into the nations of Europe for rehabilitation.  We, here, in this country have partaken of some of the grants made for that purpose.  On the other hand, we see moneys being poured into and preparations made to arm and prepare the countries of Europe for another war.  It is only right, then, that we should on the rare occasions which present themselves <Col N="329" /> such as discussions on the Finance Bill or the Central Fund Bill, get from the Minister some indication of the Government's policy on these things and express our own views on what we regard as matters of urgent national importance regardless of what our views would be in the event of another war&mdash;whether we are going to be, as the Minister for Defence stated recently, in the position of following a willy-nilly policy of neutrality or whether we are going to be forced to take part in the war.  We must have some indication of the policy of the Government and we must also have some indication that we are going to be in a position to give our best efforts if we are to participate in such a war. I believe that the policy that would be most generously supported by our people here would be one of neutrality but, if so, we must be prepared to defend that neutrality.  In this respect, I would urge on the Minister and the Government that the best defence we could have is the defence of being in a position to supply our people with all their requirements in food and otherwise in the event of an emergency. Therefore, the first step to be taken should be that of making every effort which can be made to increase productivity in agriculture and ensure that the food of the people of Ireland is grown by the farmers of Ireland on the land of Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is a sad state of affairs when we, in the year 1950, the one nation which was outstanding in Europe in the production of potatoes, were unable to discharge our obligations in fulfilling a contract entered into by the Minister for Agriculture and we had to import potatoes from outside in order to fulfil that contract.  We had to use borrowed dollars to purchase wheat and other human and animal foods from abroad.  These were all things which could have been grown by our own people but instead we have to pay for them in dollars from America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting at this stage, when moneys are being made available for the rehabilitation of Europe, to recall that it was understood that we were availing of them so that we could make a great contribution towards the <Col N="330" /> rehabilitation of Europe: that we, as an agricultural country, by an expansion of our agriculture would be able to be of great assistance in the provision of the food that Europe required.  Now even after two and a half years of the present policy we find instead that we are in the position that we have to rely on the importation of foods from outside. If that policy is allowed to continue and should the emergency that the world is preparing for arise, then we will have something to regret.  It is the first duty of the Government to ensure that every step is taken and every encouragement is given to the production of food by the farmers. That cannot be done until the farmers feel that the people who give them the advice to grow more and who make the regulations are serious in their advice, and if the farmers cannot feel that there is sincerity behind the whole matter on the part of the Minister who is responsible for agriculture, then they cannot be expected to give the co-opertion which would be necessary.  Statements made by that Minister and particularly his mishandling of the Department of which he is in charge and its ill effects on farmers would not help in getting the farmers to give of their best and produce the desired results.</P>
    <P>Apart from this question of food supplies in the event of an emergency, there are also the military matters to be considered.  We were able to maintain our neutrality in the last war, to a great extent, because the nations who had thought that they might try to drag us in knew that they would have something to reckon with and that to do so might prove a very costly venture. In response to the united appeal made in the country, people joined the Army and other Defence Forces and stood in readiness to defend their country.</P>
    <P>As far as my information goes to-day, the position is that we have now as many officers as men in our armed forces.  We have little or no regard to-day for those people who have joined the voluntary forces such as the F.C.A.  No official encouragement is being given to that branch of our defence forces.  There are no preparations being made to educate our people <Col N="331" /> in methods of defence against modern warfare.  I would like the Minister, when he is replying, to give us some idea of what the Government's policy is in this regard.</P>
    <P>As the Minister stated in his opening remarks, the Finance Bill is to give effect to the Budget proposals and it is in the Budget that we should seek the proposals and then consider the effect they will have on the country. The Budget has been referred to as a standstill Budget.  It might have been better if it were a standstill Budget. It would have been better still if the Government, when elected in 1948, had stood still for a short period and reviewed the position before they took many of the decisions and many of the actions that have led to the position in which we now find ourselves.</P>
    <P>We were promised that unemployment and emigration would cease. There is no provision made in the Bill before the House for the cessation of unemployment or emigration in that part of the country from which emigration is greatest, namely, the congested districts and Gaeltacht areas.  We have repeatedly urged on various Ministers, particularly the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce, the importance of the development of the turf industry.  When the hand-won turf scheme ended, we pointed out the dire results it would have in Galway, Mayo, Donegal and Kerry.  Our representations had some slight effect.  The decision was not exactly reversed but, from what appeared in public, the Government seemed to be prepared to proceed with a very curtailed programme of machine-won turf.  This year we find that there is an almost complete abandonment of the hand-won turf scheme and of the machine-won turf schemes that were about to be started in Galway, Mayo and Donegal.  The reason advanced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Dáil was that it was not possible to find a market for the turf.  The market is there and a market could be created if the Minister and the Government were sincere in their effort to develop this industry.  The cessation of the hand-won turf scheme, as I have <Col N="332" /> shown more than once, led to the immediate emigration of a number of turf workers from the areas affected.</P>
    <P>In addition to the curtailment of the hand-won turf scheme, there was also a curtailment of the various schemes that were in operation in the congested areas&mdash;the minor employment schemes, the farm improvement scheme, and all the other schemes that helped the small farmer to find employment for himself and his family.  If he could not find that employment in developing his own land, it was found under those schemes.</P>
    <P>If the position to-day is that the number of unemployed is less than it was in 1948, it is brought about by the fact that over 40,000 of our people were forced to emigrate.  We should not try to fool ourselves into believing otherwise.</P>
    <P>We do not see in the Budget or in the Bill any proposals or preparation to give assistance to these people.  I am sure there are Senators from the West and the South of Ireland who will admit that there is very little use in telling the people in Connemara, Mayo or Kerry of the wonderful scheme to spend £40,000,000 on land reclamation in the Midlands or elsewhere.  Last week, I met a man who had applied under the land rehabilitation scheme to have work done on his land.  The reply he received was the joke of the parish. It was, that the Department regretted that they would not be able to undertake this work as they had not a bulldozer available at the moment.  If they had any idea of the type of land in question, they would not talk of machinery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision made in the Bill or in the Budget to encourage the fishing industry, to improve the facilities for the sale of fish or for the development of this great industry which affects the people of western Ireland and those living along the seaboard.  It is from these areas that the vast amount of emigration takes place.  If we are serious about stemming the tide of emigration, we must encourage the people to remain in those districts by providing employment <Col N="333" /> for them there and by encouraging cottage industries.  All these things can be done but there is not a word in connection with the land rehabilitation scheme in regard to the people that I speak of.</P>
      <P>There is another national asset that is of great importance in time of emergency, apart from its usefulness in time of peace, that is, the harbours.  During the last war it was discovered that much time could be saved in transport by ships being able to unload cargoes at various ports and harbours.  The majority of the ships were forced to unload at the Port of Dublin, with the result that goods had to be transported, under very difficult circumstances, by rail or road from Dublin throughout the country.  I mention the development of harbours particularly because in Galway we are very interested. I would like the Minister to indicate when final consideration will be given to the application of the Galway Harbour Commissioners for a grant to complete the work that was begun some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Transition Development Fund was built up to enable local authorities to receive special grants so that they could let houses at reasonable rents.  The Minister this evening stated that this fund will cease on 31st December of next year.  He asked for a provision of £2,000,000.  The whole question of housing would occupy the Seanad for a long period.  It is a matter to which the Seanad should on some occasion in the near future devote a discussion.  We have various views being put forward.  On more than one occasion, the Minister, in speaking on this matter, seemed to give expression to the view that all that was necessary was to encourage the contractors to be satisfied with less profits and that then everything would be all right, so far as cheap housing is concerned.  I wonder is that the case, and, if it is, can the Minister or the Minister in charge of the Department more closely concerned, the Department of Local Government, give facts and figures as to what a particular type of house should cost.  They have a large staff in that Department and they have qualified engineers and architects, and it would be easy to <Col N="334" /> have a proper estimate made of what a particular type of house would cost. If the fleecing which the Minister seems to think is going on on the part of contractors building for private persons and local authorities is in fact going on, I suggest that the best way to stop it is by the Department giving us the figures for the different types of houses which local authorities have been erecting.  If that were done, the Minister would find that it is not the contractors who are at fault.  Various local authorities have undertaken the erection of these houses by direct labour.  There may be some small saving on the actual cost of the house, but there are other costs which are not taken into consideration and, in the final analysis, when the cost of machinery and so forth is added on, there is very little between the cost of the direct labour house and the contract system house.</P>
    <P>The Transition Fund was set up in order to encourage local authorities to go ahead with the erection of houses and not to wait until building materials became more plentiful and, therefore, cheaper.  Payments from this fund are to cease on 31st March of next year and any person who has any knowledge of the building trade, any person who is even a member of a local authority, knows how difficult it is, even in normal circumstances, apart altogether from the conditions existing to-day in which supplies of one kind may be plentiful while supplies of other types cannot be got, to get houses erected quickly.  If a contractor requires lead piping at present, it is almost a condition of sale that he hands in lead to the same weight as the weight of the piping being purchased.  There are scarcities of one type of material or another, and there is also the scarcity of qualified tradesmen, so that it is not so easy for a local authority or a private individual to get a house erected as quickly as might have been the case before the war.  What is to happen to local authorities in view of what the Minister has said, that payments from the Transition Fund are to cease on 31st March next year?</P>

      <P>A local authority which may be about to undertake the acquiring and developing of a site and the erection of houses on it has it now definitely from the Minister that payments from the Transition Fund are to cease.  That fund was established to bridge the gap between the prices prevailing and the prices which might prevail in more normal times.  The local authority will, therefore, be inclined to wait and see what are the Minister's new proposals.  There are people on local authorities who are interested in the ratepayers who make a big contribution towards the building and maintenance of housing for the working classes and it would be the duty of any public representative on a public board, reading the Minister's statement that this fund will cease next year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; and that provision will be made in the Local Government Estimate, to ask what that provision is and what shape it will take.  I suggest that the Minister should clarify the position and clear up any misunderstandings which may arise in the minds of local authorities so that they will be encouraged rather than hampered in their efforts to go ahead with housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the cost of living, we were told on various occasions that the main thing which brought the Parties in the Government together as a Government <Col N="336" /> was their anxiety to reduce the cost of living.  We see now that they have not succeeded in that, and, even worse, not alone have we a cost of living which has risen but we have a two price system in operation.  The Minister may say in defence of that system that the prices are there only for those who can afford them.  It reminds me of the statement made by the Minister for Agriculture last week in the Dáil that he had no sympathy with the housewife, with the worker's wife or with those people for whom so many people have sympathy during an election campaign who wanted a rasher for their breakfast probably only on Sunday morning.  That person had no right to be a chooser, and, if such people wanted the cheap article, they should take it and be satisfied, and, if they wanted the best rashers they should be prepared to pay for them.  There were pigs' heads available for these people who were not able to afford to buy bacon.  Down in a very remote part of the country on Sunday I heard a man suggest that we were now to have a new breed of pigs, pigs with three heads which when slaughtered, would provide dinner for six families on the basis of half a head each.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>This system of two prices hits the poor classes more than any other class.  They have the largest families; they are the largest consumers of bread, butter, tea and sugar; and they are the people on whom the rationing system when it was more strictly enforced than now bore most heavily.  They are the people on whom the present rationing system bears most heavily.  While those who might be described as the more wealthy can afford to have meals of many different varieties, the workers in general are confined to bread, butter, tea and sugar, and the present rations are not sufficient for them.  I have first-hand knowledge that it is the workers in the towns and the rural areas who are the <Col N="337" /> largest purchasers of the two price foods.</P>
      <P>It is all very fine to say that they should be content with the amounts made available under the rationing system and that the Government should not be called upon to subsidise any extra amounts.  If a case can be made for that, I should like to hear it, but I have not yet heard it.  No one can defend the system, except by saying that the alternative is to subsidise foodstuffs to the full amount, despite the fact that we were promised, by not one but all the Parties in the Government, that the cost of living could be reduced, even if it meant subsidising commodities such as tea, bread, butter and sugar to the extent of 30 per cent.</P>
      <P>In regard to tourist development, we are glad to see so many people converted to the importance of this industry. We are glad that it is recognised as a good thing to invite these people here and to extend hospitality to them, and especially to attract American tourists.  Times have changed in the past few years when it was proposed that there should be a tax on tourists because they were coming to deprive us of the food that the Irish people should have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question I should like the Minister to answer is this.  In introducing the Budget in 1948, reference was made to the Tourist Board and other boards.  We were told the windows would be opened and the light of day allowed to pour into the rooms and offices of such boards.  I am afraid the opening of the windows and the allowing in of the light has had a very bad effect.  I have failed to see any indication of any activity by this board over the last two and a half years.  I would like the Minister to be able to assure the House that the board is actively engaged in the development of the tourist industry from the American end.  I think their failure to do what the board should be called upon to do at the outset is evident to anyone at the present time.  It is a matter in which the Minister should be keenly interested and is one which has been allowed to drift over a long period. Quite a number of American tourists I have met in recent weeks have come <Col N="338" /> through England and lodged their dollars there and have come to us with these very naughty British pound notes.  There is something that the board, if actively engaged under proper direction, could have forestalled, if not completely checked, by proper publicity and guidance to our people from the other end.</P>
    <P>The last and most important item is that of the Road Fund.  The Minister is making provision in this Bill to take £300,000 out of the Road Fund.  We all have a good idea of how that fund has been accumulated.  We have had many debates in this House and we have seen the Minister take £2,000,000 from the local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Take it from them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The road grant has been cut by £2,000,000.  It was depriving the local authorities of that sum.  We were to be provided with alternative schemes.  Workers engaged on road work for local authorities throughout the country were promised work under the Local Authorities (Works) Act. What happened?  While the Minister curtailed the grant by £2,000,000, he made available under the Works Act, £1,000,000 for local authorities.  Surely no Minister, not even a Minister of the present Government, could find as much employment for as many men over as long a period for £1,000,000?  as could be found for £2,000,000?  We know full well that during the emergency, in some cases through lack of materials, the roads were allowed into bad repair.  An extensive amount of transport of food and fuel was carried over those roads.  The nation owed it to road users to put the roads back in repair, but at that time the county council were deprived of the benefit of using this £2,000,000.  Now the Minister dips further into the kitty to take £300,000 out of it.  This is a matter that, with some other items, we could deal with better on the Committee Stage, but I mention the point so that Senators here, and particularly those who are members of local authorities, will direct their attention to the seriousness of this matter during the discussion on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose one has to sympathise with any spokesman of the <Col N="339" /> Opposition in rising to debate the Bill which is before the House to-day.  I had the feeling that Senator Hawkins found himself in a particularly uncomfortable position.  It was a task for a much more able critic, one with a capacity for analysis that is somewhat beyond the spokesman of the Opposition in this House to-day.  He started his denunciation of the Minister's policy by repeating the caoining of his leader in Cork City at the weekend. Beyond question, the Opposition are losing complete touch, not only with the people in the country but with the conditions in the country.  We had a speech from the Opposition Leader in Cork&mdash;it was a call to arms, preparation for war&mdash;and Senator Hawkins started in on that line to-day, calling for plans for an emergency.  It was that sort of stunting that went on for 16 years.  We were plunged from one emergency into another.</P>
      <P>In those years, they probably understood the emotional character of the Irish people very well and felt that, by stirring the emotions, they might play on them and be able to hold on. By doing that, they prevented the people from reasoning out their problems. There may be emergencies ahead, but it is much wiser and it is a line that is deserving of much more encouragement, to try to get the people to live normal lives, to face their normal jobs and work every day in a thankful, earnest mood.  If the policy of this country is to be planned on the basis that we are to be hurried from one emergency to another, it will never be constructive but always will be of a ramshackle nature, and the consequences for our people will be those that we have been witnessing over a very long period.  If we are not laying any plans, broad and deep, the young people of the country will continue to fly from it.  Have we not had enough of that?  Is there not need for Senator Hawkins or anyone on that side of the House to raise this problem of the flight from the country, or to ask the Minister what he is to do about future emergencies when they see what has been the result of their own policy over the years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator speaks about money <Col N="340" /> being poured into Europe for the rehabilitation of Europe.  I do not know whether he regarded that as a policy to be commended or rejected.  Perhaps he said in the double voice in which these people speak that it is something to be commended when it is applied to Europe and something to be rejected when it is applied to Ireland.  The policy of the rehabilitation of this country and the development of its resources is a policy which is being rejected by Fianna Fáil, at least rejected in so far as it is wise to provide the means, the machines and the mechanism for the development of our resources and the rehabilitation of the land of the country on which the majority of our people live.  The Government, in the policy enunciated by the Minister in this Bill, are doing the things that require to be done, not only to enable our people to live normal lives but to prepare plans for an emergency as well.  The Minister in his speech in the Budget debate in the other House used these words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The need for further capital development in Ireland is apparent. Under-investment in our own resources is in part responsible for unemployment and under-employment, for involuntary emigration, impoverished land, industrial underdevelopment, bad housing and other defects in our economic and social structure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the situation which the Minister found when he came into office with his colleagues.  He is attempting to rectify that situation and is he to be decried for attempting it?  If there are proposals in the Bill that are distasteful to the Opposition, why do they not segregate the good proposals from the bad and let the Minister and his colleagues and the country know with what they are in agreement and with what they disagree, but we have not had that from them.</P>
    <P>It seemed to me that Senator Hawkins thought that the first plank in the Government's policy should be preparedness to defend our neutrality, and he went on to refer to the situation during the last war.  I do not <Col N="341" /> think that there will be any less vigorous spirit among our people to defend their rights in the next war than there was in the last.  When I hear the word &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; used in relation to our attitude in the last war, however, I cannot help thinking of the conditions during the war that were as well known, if not better known, to the people on the far side of the House as they were to the people on this.  We were neutral; we were not taking sides; yet in the dark of the night trains came from the North with British arms into this part of the country and the arms were taken over by our soldiers under the reign of Deputy de Valera and his colleagues in Government.  I am not going to develop that any further but this is not the first time that that line has been pursued in this House and the word &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; is such a misnomer for what went on that I think we should have less of it.  If any crisis comes to the country, I think that this Government will be as competent to face that situation as they were to face the situation which confronted them when they came into office.  What was that?  Senator Hawkins talked about the position regarding food production in the country.  Are we producing less food than we were producing at the time of the change of Government? We are producing far, far more.  The total output of food is far greater now than it was then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>400,000 less acres of tillage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no fewer acres of land in the country as a whole and any intelligent person who wants to study the capacity of the country to produce food must look at the total output of the total agricultural land of the country.  If we want to do right by the country that is the problem confronting us to which we must try to find an answer.  The Minister for Finance made a statement in the Budget speech about the production of food and if Senator Hawkins does not agree, he should take up this statement and analyse it.  The same facts will be found in the <i>Trade Journal</i> and it is not right that they should be <Col N="342" /> challenged by the Opposition in this House or in the country as it is not fair to the country.  We have too much of this thing Sunday after Sunday. The Minister said in the Dáil on the 3rd May, column 1649:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The value of gross agricultural output in 1949 amounted to £127.8 millions as compared with £119.6 millions in 1948.  The value of net output rose from £105.1 millions in 1948 to £110.5 millions in 1949.</P>
      <P>In volume, agricultural output has now regained the pre-war level.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am not quoting 1947 figures at all because if I did the picture would be much more disastrous from Senator Hawkins' point of view.  The Minister went on:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Gross output, in 1949, in terms of 1938-39 prices, is estimated at £53.3 millions as compared with £53.5 millions in 1938-39 and £49.7 millions in 1948.  The 1949 volume of gross agricultural output represents an increase of 7.3 per cent. over 1948. The improvement is most noticeable in cattle, pigs, poultry and eggs. Milk production has also increased remarkably.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the figures and these figures being available to every member of the House, what justification is there for any Senator to get up to decry what has been done by the Government and, in so far as it is possible to do it, to misrepresent the Minister for Agriculture and to say that because of his mishandling of his Department, farmers can have no confidence in him?  As I have said in this House before, the Minister for Agriculture does not say things as I or Senator Hawkins or the Minister for Finance would say them; he pleases to say them in his own way. His language, I know, does not please the Opposition but the fact remains that the Minister has achievements behind him.  We have evidence, not only in the fields, but in the facts which have been collected and presented to members of the Oireachtas, that output from the land of Ireland has very considerably increased during the last two years and that the contribution of the Minister for Agriculture to that <Col N="343" /> increase is very considerable indeed and that fact is understood and appreciated by the farmers of the country. I know that fact does not please the Opposition.  The speeches they make indicate the conditions which they would prefer to see and the position which they would like to see in the country with poorer farm prices and more poverty.  Politically that might be better for them but it is not going to be good for the country.</P>
    <P>We have Opposition Senators in this House with one voice denying the claim of the Government that prices have not risen and at the same time claiming that prices for the farmers have fallen. That might be all very well down the country but it is not going to help the country to get to a position of prosperity. It is not going to create a position which would make it easier to get the young Irishmen and women to remain in the country to tell them that conditions were anything but satisfactory in the matter of prices and employment. Senator Hawkins has deplored the fact that the hand-won turf scheme was abandoned and that there is not all the development in turf schemes that there should be and ought to be.  Why is that?  Is not the Turf Development Board a board established by Fianna Fáil, and have they not the same machinery available to them that was available to them under Fianna Fáil.  Why are they not going ahead with the hand-won turf scheme? The other day there were advertisements in the papers for men to work on the bogs in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>And Senators Seán Hayes and Hawkins will talk about <Col N="344" /> men and women leaving the country. Suppose we had the position in this House where we were all one and united and working harmoniously together as we should be and you had Senator Baxter complaining of the abandonment of the turf schemes and Senator Seán Hayes saying there was not a sod of turf available, somebody else saying there was not full development in turf production, and yet somebody else saying that the people were leaving the country because they could not get employment; what would any outsider listening to such a debate think and what would Irish people, boys and girls, feel they could do in such circumstances but get out?  It is not going to help national projects to have Senators and others dealing in propaganda of that sort.  The problem to which they should set their minds is how they can better develop turf projects and other schemes rather than follow a line of decrying every effort made and try to create in the minds of people that no work was to be found, and that the obvious thing to do was to clear out of the country.  Anybody who read the speech delivered by Monsignor Beck at Maynooth yesterday would see that there is another angle to the consequences of emigration, and if we are to serve our country and the God that made us we should try to concentrate on the problem of keeping our young people at home instead of belittling the work that is being done in that direction. By giving out attention to that problem we would be making a great contribution to our people and to the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hawkins has spoken of the land rehabilitation scheme and has illustrated his remarks with the story of his experience with the Connaught farmer who, he stated, said there was not much use in the scheme for the people of Connemara.  The Senator went on to say that that farmer had made an application for a grant under the scheme but he had been told that the work could not be proceeded with as there was no bulldozer available in the area.  I suggest that that is a grotesque exaggeration and a complete misrepresentation of what the position really is.  From my experience, and I <Col N="345" /> challenge contradiction, that is the sort of propaganda, of misrepresentation, which is being waged against this great national endeavour.  As far as I know when an application is made for a grant under the rehabilitation and drainage schemes the farm is visited by an inspector who discusses his particular problem with the farmer and then makes his report on what is necessary to put the farm in condition.  Before any communication goes to the farmer this visit has to be made by the inspector. Does Senator Hawkins suggest that any graduate of the College of Science will go down and inspect such a farm and on returning to his office merely send out a communication saying that nothing can be done unless a bulldozer is available in the area?  I do not believe any such thing would be done except of course there are rocks which it would be impossible to remove unless with the use and service of a bulldozer.  I am sure Senator Hawkins would tell that story of his to farmers in Cork, Leitrim or any other place to which he might travel in the service of his organisation but I do not think it is right that he should do so.  I think it is a great crime against the nation that we should have propaganda of this type used against any scheme designed at reorganisation of the country's life.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins had a lot to say about tourists and the Tourist Board and also about tourists coming from America through English ports.  The boats land at Southampton and unless Senator Hawkins can get them to land at Galway and Cobh in greater numbers it is inevitable that people would come to Ireland from America through England.  Many of our own people down through the ages went out of this country through England to America and Senator Hawkins knows that quite well.  A little study will have told him that.  The Senator also talked about double-pricing of goods and spent a good deal of time condemning that system.  He did say, I think, that this hit the poor hardest. He spoke of those who have large families.  He indicated that some of these people were buying food off the ration.  I do not know whether these are people who would get a great deal on credit or not, but it is a good sign <Col N="346" /> of the times if these people can provide themselves with more than the ration of butter and other commodities, at a high price.</P>
    <P>When this Government came into office they were faced with a situation in which they could do one of two things.  They could either reduce the cost of living or raise incomes to a level that would enable people to buy as much as would maintain life and give them vitality and energy for work. They saw clearly that food prices can be cut only by cutting farm incomes or by such increase in taxation, in order to increase subsidies, as would make life very difficult for many people. They raised incomes.  That was done all round.  Both in the town or the country, there is a fairer distribution of income to-day than there has been since the establishment of this State. One has only to move about to see evidence of the high level of income both in town and country.</P>
    <P>As far as the farming community are concerned, they are earning incomes to-day the like of which they have never enjoyed.  I am quite satisfied that these incomes will not remain.  In view of the dangers inherent in policy outside this country and in view of the quantity of surplus food that is accumulating in other countries, there is the danger that our prices will be threatened and may fall under the impact of this pressure from outside.  At present, and for the last two years, we have enjoyed farm incomes of a level never before experienced.</P>
    <P>On the whole, there is general satisfaction with the policy of the present Minister for Finance.  I feel that the rather reticent mood in which Senator Hawkins approached the problem to-day and the rather half-hearted attack which he made on the Minister's policy are indicative of the fact that at the back of his mind he knows the country is doing very well indeed.  On the whole, the country is very satisfied with the achievements of the Minister for Finance and his colleagues.  Whatever effort is made, either here or elsewhere, to misrepresent the Government, its policy, and especially the policy and activities of the Minister for Agriculture, that fact remains.  There <Col N="347" /> may be people who do not like the way the Minister for Agriculture says things but there are very few farmers who are not satisfied with what the Minister is doing.</P>
    <P>The levying of taxation is never a popular policy.  On the whole, however, the Minister for Finance, with his usual skill, has been able to achieve something which will not make him any more popular with the Opposition: he has succeeded in maintaining a position of good Government without increasing taxation which, on the whole, is something on which we all ought to be prepared to congratulate him.  In regard to his investment policy, that marks him out as a courageous Minister, with imagination, as he has shown himself to be since he took up the affairs of State 27 years ago.</P>
    <P>We either believe in the future of this nation or we do not.  We believe that it will be built up strong and vigorous by providing a way of life for all the people in future.  That is not going to be effectively tackled, and cannot be achieved, by a niggardliness on the part of those who control the finances, by lack of courage and faith on their part, by unpreparedness on their part to invest money in the future of the nation, in land, housing, planned educational schemes, in its people.  The young people, if they get a chance to work and to live in their own country, will be delighted to do it and will play their part in their generation, as we did in ours.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not a pessimist.  He is not preparing for a continuous series of emergencies.  He is clear visioned enough to know that, if emergencies come, the capacity of our people to face them will be strengthened and secured by the vigour that he has given to their economic life in the days before the emergencies.  That is what the Minister proposes under the Budget which he is standing over to-day.  Far from being critical of his achievements, all sides of the House should congratulate him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was out for a couple of minutes while Senator Baxter was speaking.  On my return I was amazed <Col N="348" /> to see that he had worked himself up into such a heat over a Bill of this kind.  I was particularly amazed to hear him attacking Senator Hawkins in such an apparently determined manner.  I would be prepared to find fault with many people.  Senator Baxter, while he is advocating honesty in other people so strenuously, should at least be honest in his attacks on Senator Hawkins, whom, apparently, he picked out as the object of his attack.  Senator Hawkins may have many faults.  We all have our faults. There is one thing that nobody can say, that is, that Senator Hawkins would be afraid to say what he thinks, here or anywhere else.  One may not agree with what he says but one must admit that, if he convinces himself that a certain line is the right line, he will take that line against any opposition, whether in this House or outside it, whether it pleases Senator Baxter or not.</P>
      <P>Senator Hawkins made a statement about the difficulties some farmer in County Galway had in connection with the Land Rehabilitation Scheme.  We must accept that Senator Hawkins was speaking from actual experience and that he was told the story by the man who applied as he related it here.  We all know that grants are available if people know the right way to apply but that there are considerable difficulties for people who may not know the proper approach.  It is quite understandable that a small farmer from Galway, Cavan, Tipperary, or anywhere else may make an application that is not presented in the proper form and may get a reply from a civil servant in the Department, in all good faith, which would seem to him to be absolutely absurd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see no reason whatever why any man should work himself up into a heat to attack a man because he made a statement of that kind.  It would be a good job for the country if members of this House, and public speakers generally, were as seriously-minded as Senator Hawkins in any speeches that they are likely to make. Senator Baxter does not often lose his temper.  He pretends to do so once in a while, but the fact that he worked himself up into a heat pushed him a <Col N="349" /> little beyond his reach and into making the sort of statements he made. I am sure that he would not make them if he was in what we might call his sane senses.</P>
    <P>Referring to the position in which Ministers found themselves when taking office as members of the Coalition Government, one would think that the Senator was telling us, as he has so often told us before&mdash;if not in the exact words&mdash;the story of Robinson Crusoe when he landed on a desert island and a fellow there pitched him the long tale that is now so well known to children throughout the world.  One would imagine that when the Coalition Government came into office they found this country a desert, that nothing had been done for years until Senator Baxter and his Party came in and started to build houses and to drain bogs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Robinson Crusoe heard all that.  What, in fact, was the position?  It is only right that people should give credit where it is due. Senator Baxter said that we should segregate the good things from the bad things in the Bill now before the House.  I am sure the Senator will accept my statement when I tell him that I searched the Bill and found few things in it on which I could compliment the Minister.  The Senator will be equally disappointed when I tell him that I found in it some things which I wish to mention.  The matter is not very important but, in Section 8, provision is made whereby, as far as auctioneers are concerned, they need no longer apply for appraisers' licences. That licence costs three guineas.  It is good that, at least, some sections of the community are going to benefit to the extent of three guineas and I congratulate the Minister on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Continuing, Senator Baxter, in an over-heated condition went on to deal with the question of neutrality.  He stated that neutrality as it was conducted here was really a misnomer. What he actually said was that neutrality here was a misnomer of what went on.  I think that was most unwise, apart from being an unfair statement.  Neutrality was the <Col N="350" /> accepted policy.  It was backed by Senator Baxter's Party, by my Party, by every other Party, and by every public representative in this and the other House, with one exception, the present Minister for Agriculture.  We may be again forced into a position where this country would have to decide for or against neutrality, and I do not think it would be helpful if people in other countries could quote statements made by allegedly responsible members of this House to the effect that our neutrality during the recent war was really a joke.</P>

      <P>It is the nearest approach that the ordinary person who is not a university professor could get to it.  We have to provide for the ordinary people, but Senator Hayes, when lecturing to his class in the university, might get away with something there that would not suit here. There are many people not quite so smart as the Senator and, for that reason I do not think it wise to refer to neutrality as a misnomer, or a joke or anything of that kind, as we might again be forced back on a policy of neutrality.  To say in justification of such a statement that guns were sent here from the North of Ireland, and were received by the Fianna Fáil Government is no proof that there was anything wrong with our policy.  That statement was so much nonsense.</P>
      <P>If this country was to maintain its neutrality it had to be prepared to fight for it, and if it was to be prepared to fight, it had to get guns somewhere.  Where guns were got at that time was the responsibility of the Government and, if the present Government will only accept its responsibility in any future emergency, as well as the previous Government accepted its responsibility, then this Government will be entitled to be complimented by every Party in similar circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter went to great pains to convince Senators that the position as far as agriculture was concerned was much better now than it was under the Fianna Fáil Government. <Col N="351" /> All depends on what Senator Baxter means by agriculture.  If he means that the position can be estimated in accordance with the price of cattle, then I will say Senator Baxter is right.</P>

I do not think that even the Minister for Agriculture would suggest anything of the kind.  It must be evident that the output as far as food for man and beast is concerned has gone down rapidly.  I say, further, that the Minister for Agriculture would not pretend to defend a policy which would tend to provide adequate food for man and beast.  The Minister fought against that consistently as long as I know him.  When Fianna Fáil were trying to put that policy into effect I think I am right in saying that Senator Baxter criticised it.

      <P>No.  I will deal with that.  What has happened under the present Government?  Tillage has gone down by something like 400,000 acres.  Because land has gone out of production the acreage under wheat has decreased; the production of sugar and other things, which are really the mainstay of the people in any sort of emergency, has gone down.  As an alternative what we are doing is importing foodstuffs that we could produce here.  Whatever excuse there might have been during the three or four years of the emergency for allowing foodstuffs to be imported, there is no such excuse at the present time. Senator Baxter may have criticised Dr. Ryan or Deputy Smith when they were in office for not doing certain things affecting the land.</P>
      <P>Senator Baxter will agree that it is only within the past two years that artificial manures became available in any reasonable supplies and whatever excuse there was for importing, before the manure situation improved, there is not the same excuse to-day.  I do not say that we should absolutely refuse to import anything, but there is no sense whatever in a policy by which wheat is imported wholesale into the country, by which the land is allowed to go out of cultivation and by which we will find ourselves in an emergency, if an emergency comes, in the position in which we found ourselves when Fine Gael went out of office before.  That was a very different situation from that which the present Government found when they came into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would imagine that nothing was done by way of development under Fianna Fáil, but what are the facts? During the term of office of the Fianna Fáil Government, 140,000 houses were built, which will compare favourably, on a yearly or a monthly basis, with anything done during the past 12 months or two years.  It is only fair to remind the House that, during the period of office of Fianna Fáil, there were six years during which we fought what eventually came to be known as the economic war and that during a further six years there was a world war, when supplies were practically impossible to get.  Notwithstanding <Col N="353" /> all these difficulties, the building industry was kept going.  Houses were provided, and, at the time Fianna Fáil went out of office, plans were made for the building of other houses for which other people are now claiming the credit.  That, I think, is an accepted fact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Baxter would not accept it, anyhow, but we will get him to accept something before we finish.  While the Senator was speaking, Senator Sean Hayes passed a remark about the bogs, whereupon Senator Baxter got on his hind legs and talked about all the Government he supports had done for the bogs.  I do not think it necessary to delay the House by quoting statements made by Senator Baxter when various discussions took place here on bog development and it is not necessary for me to quote the Minister for Agriculture, who said we were throwing money into the bog holes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right that the people who are opposed to us should admit that, as soon as they came into office, they decided to ease off on the turf policy&mdash;they had to do something to justify what they had said in the past and the speeches they had made during the general election.  But when they examined the situation, they found that, notwithstanding what they had said in the past, there was something in this turf policy and they decided that they would have to bury their political pride, because the turf industry is a sane, sensible and good industry.  To their credit, they changed their minds with regard to turf and have now apparently decided to carry on the policy in operation before they came into power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What did they find?  One would imagine again that this policy of turf which is now in operation was made possible only because of the machinery got in under the present Government. That is not so.  Were it not for the fact <Col N="354" /> that drainage work was carried out over a very wide area during the administration of Fianna Fáil, the present working of the bogs for the production of machine-won turf would not have been possible.  Another activity which enabled machine working of the bogs to be carried out was the building of bog roads.  Bog roads were built against terrific opposition in this House and we were told that we were building roads leading nowhere. We were building roads, because, on the long-sighted policy of Fianna Fáil, it was estimated that, in a certain number of years, it would be possible to work the bogs for the production of peat fuel and peat moss litter.  We now have glaring headlines in the papers about the amount of money coming into the country through sales of this peat moss.</P>
    <P>It was under Fianna Fáil that the industry was started and any credit which is due, apart from the credit which naturally goes to the headquarters staff of Bord na Móna and their various officials down to the workers, should go to the Government which instituted that industry, as well as various other industries throughout the country.  It comes very badly from the people who in the past opposed the policy of turf development to criticise somebody else because he passes a remark, by way of banter, that workers cannot be got for the bogs.</P>

Reading through this Bill and most other Bills, one cannot help but think that this Government is following an ostrich-like policy, and by that I mean the policy of the bird which puts its head in the sand.  This is particularly so in connection with defence.  Nothing of a practical nature has been done with regard to defence, while it is evident to anybody who keeps in touch with current affairs that most other countries are preparing against the possibility of another war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Baxter would have 1 per cent. of the patience which everybody else has in listening to him, we would get along grand.  We listen to Senator Baxter orating until the cows come home and go out and come back again, and nobody says a word, but when I start talking about defence, he cannot put up with me for three minutes.  When the present Government took office, one of the first things they decided on was the stopping of recruiting for the Army.  I think that was a slight change of policy, as Senator Baxter will agree.  Because of pressure from one side or the other and because of questions asked in the Dáil, that policy has, to some extent, been changed of late in so far as recruiting has again been started.  Because of the lack of enthusiasm in the present Government on the whole question of defence, the recruiting campaign has been a hopeless failure.  I have heard reports from various centres that it is practically impossible to get young men to join the Army.  When Fianna Fáil were in power, the Minister for Defence then made definite speeches in favour of the recruiting campaign and the various Ministers made speeches encouraging it.  Not one member of the present Government has made any public statement I know of, to bolster up the campaign for Army recruits.  At the recent Fine Gael Árd-Fheis, not one speech was made, as far as reports go in any paper, on the question of defence at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Conditions in the Army to-day have not moved on with the conditions generally in the country.  As a result, young men are expected to join under conditions such as existed, say, during the emergency.  In 1950 you will not get young men to join unless the conditions are improved.  I am told that there are very poor living conditions <Col N="356" /> for them, that they are served with meals off tin plates.  There was a time when the Army here would be glad to get a meal off tin plates or without plates, but we have passed on from that time.  The men of the Irish Army are entitled to the benefit of the improvement in living conditions as well, if not more so, than most other sections of the people.</P>
    <P>In a recent speech in the Dáil, the Minister for Defence made a statement to the effect that the numbers in the Army were greater than they were when he took over the office.  He corrected that speech a few days later, when he said in reply to a question by Deputy Major de Valera:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think the Deputy has in mind a reference of mine on the Defence Forces Bill a few days ago.  As I informed the House, I did not anticipate a debate on that particular Bill.  I had not the figures in front of me and I was speaking from memory.  I told the House that the strength to-day was actually greater than it was at the time I took over. My memory did not serve me correctly. There is a difference of some hundreds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister further told Deputy Major de Valera at that particular time that the strength of the reserves on the 28th February, 1950 was: First Line Reserves, 5,764; F.C.A., 26,436. On the Estimates in April, 1948, the Minister said that the strengths were 5,748 and 48,000 respectively.  I think the statement that the numbers were down by a few hundreds was a gross understatement of the actual fact.</P>
    <P>As Senator Baxter said, we should deal with matters here with regard to the national interest.  It is only right that we should regard ourselves as every other country&mdash;in Europe, at any rate&mdash;regards itself, that is, as being in a very dangerous position.  If another war starts, what will be our position, under the present policy? Some 400,000 acres have gone out of production.  We are dependent for our bread supplies largely on imported wheat.  We are exporting cattle, poultry and eggs.  Those could be reduced if necessary in case of an emergency but, as Senator Miss Pearse has <Col N="357" /> prompted me, a man cannot live on beef alone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor on wheat alone.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>While we are allowing our numbers in the Army to decrease, it is interesting to find what other countries are doing.  In Norway, £135,000,000 on a three-year defence plan has been approved by an all-Party Defence Council.  The country is being organised into separate self-defence zones.</P>

      <P>You cannot know whom to prepare yourself for defence against. Would anyone think that Senator Baxter would be standing up to attack Senator Fred Hawkins to-day?  The best way is to prepare to defend yourself against all comers.  If we knew who was likely to attack or that we have to defend ourselves, we would not be under a compliment again for getting arms in over the Border or off the Waterford coast.  Senator Baxter will agree with me that most of the arms we got before, we got from the British, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>In Britain, increased expenditure has been allowed of £21,000,000.  They are now spending £781,000,000 per annum.  Special <Col N="358" /> civil defence schools have been opened in several places in England and they are developing special anti-bomb defence.  What are we doing?  We are not doing anything of the kind at all.  During the last war there may have been some excuse, but notwithstanding all the excuses the Minister then, when the first shots were fired out of the big guns in France, made a definite attempt to build up the defence of this country.  Air-raid shelters were built, bomb-proof buildings were erected and units were established for evacuation of people from the cities in case of bombing, and gas-masks were served out.  Those things were done away with after the war.</P>
      <P>A lot of people foolishly thought that this was going to be the last war.  I think we know enough now to know we have not had the last war yet.  What we should be doing now, instead of criticising our defence in the last war and laughing at the policy of neutrality, is preparing for another war, to make sure that whatever policy may be the national policy at the time would be possible, as a result of preparations made well in advance.</P>
      <P>In Sweden they are developing the civil defence and also protection for all the industries.  Here our industries are wide open.  We have industries in provincial towns which are, I am sure, already mapped by the possible belligerents and one high-powered aeroplane could ruin several of our factories in no time.  If anything has been done to prevent such an occurrence, I would be glad to hear of it.  The same applies to our waterworks.  All these things need attention.  They are getting attention elsewhere, but here we are reducing the number in our Army. When I say that, I do not mean reducing the ordinary rank and file. Several of the important Departments have been allowed to go into decay. Men have gone out of the service and their places have not been filled.  I suggest that at the present time all those Departments should be built up to strength and nothing should be left undone to protect the various items that might be open to attack in case of emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Belgium they decided on the 15th <Col N="359" /> February, 1950, to treble the navy and air force; that expenditure on the navy and air force should be three times what it was previously, while we sit down and do nothing.  They decided to develop radar detection, that is, to use the most up-to-date equipment to discover mines, direct aeroplanes and so on.  That is the sort of thing we should be doing instead of bragging about little things that do not matter while we are neglecting the things that do matter.</P>
    <P>In America, which might be regarded as being a little bit safer from attack than we are and a little bit stronger if they were attacked, they are preparing a civil defence organisation to protect the country in the case of possible attack.  Anybody might smile at the idea of an attack on the United States but the people of the United States are taking the matter very seriously in view of the fact that weapons are now being produced which can carry over a tremendous distance.  It is now quite possible that areas which heretofore might regard themselves as being comparatively safe must now regard themselves as being in the danger zone.  If the United States, Sweden and Switzerland are preparing their defence in case of another war, I think it is about time that we looked up.</P>
    <P>One could go on talking for a long time on those things which we have neglected but I think that the principal fault one can find with the situation here at the present time is that the people generally are being lulled into a position of what might be called false security.  I think more speeches should be made on the possibility of an attack in another war and that preparation should be made for our defence in such an eventuality.  We should have all round an atmosphere in which the people would realise that the Government were taking seriously the situation which might develop in case of another war.</P>
    <P>That does not merely depend on the Army as such.  Several other things must be included in any preparation for an emergency and first and most important, in my opinion, is our position <Col N="360" /> regarding agriculture.  We must get ourselves into a position where we would be able at least to provide half rations for the people.  During the last war we had numerous debates and now that the last of the guns has become silent I think we will at least admit that there were certain weeks during the last war in which this country was in a very precarious position.</P>
    <P>The only reason in my opinion why we were able to carry on at all was that we had a sort of balance between mechanised agriculture and the traditional agriculture of the country.  We had a sort of balance between the number of tractors in the country and the number of horses and horse ploughs.  The Minister for Agriculture in a recent statement said that in ten years' time horse ploughs would only be found in the museum.  I think that a definite effort should be made now to ensure that horse ploughs and the traditional methods of tilling the land of this country should be maintained in so far as it is possible to maintain them despite the march of time.  The reason I say that is that if a policy of mechanised agriculture is to be fostered 100 per cent. by the Minister for Agriculture some attempt should be made by some other Minister or by some public representatives somewhere to ensure that we would not be totally dependent on outside supplies for our agricultural production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>What fostering is he doing?  Are the farmers not free to buy the machines?  Does the Senator want to prevent them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>They are free but there are some farmers like Senator Baxter who think that the Minister for Agriculture is God almighty or the next best thing.  If they hear Senator Baxter say that the Minister for Agriculture is one of the wisest men who ever came into this country, one of the wisest Ministers for Agriculture we ever had or could ever hope to have again, they can only take him seriously and say: &ldquo;I have an old plough. Begor, it is not much use to me and I will buy a tractor.&rdquo;  If we get to a stage in this country when the food of the country is dependent on tractors totally then we will find ourselves in <Col N="361" /> the position in which we found ourselves towards the end of the last war and it will be time to look out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator prevent farmers from buying tractors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not prevent farmers from doing anything but I would encourage them to do what I believe to be right for the nation.  I have said before, and I will say again in case I am misunderstood, that it is a difficult thing to go to a farmer who has the money and tell him that it would be better for him to get two pairs of horses than to get a tractor and it is more difficult still to go to that man's son and tell him that he will be a lot easier if he buys a pair of horses than if he buys a tractor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the national point of view it would be sound policy to get the farms of the country worked partially by horses rather than let the whole lot go over to tractors and I am as sure of that as I am of my own name.  Why I am so sure is that it would be just as sane a policy to be dependent for bread on outside shipping and outside resources as it would to allow yourself to be dependent on outside sources for the means of production of that bread. What I say is based on my experience in the last war and I say here and now that were it not for the fact that the last war came so soon as it did come we would have been in a far worse position.  Go back to 1928, 1929 and 1930 when the people of the country had practically got out of the way of tilling the land at all.  In several counties when the drive came for agriculture it was practically impossible to get the tools to do the work and what I mean by the tools is the ordinary plough which we are only going to find in the museum in ten years' time according to Senator Baxter's ideal Minister.  I believe that if the war had not started so soon we would not have been able to get a man to plough the land.  It may seem a strange thing to say but anyone who was in touch with the situation knows that decent, honest to God farmers who were anxious to co-operate and produce food could not get a man to follow the horses.  If the war had not taken <Col N="362" /> place for another ten years I believe that we would have reached a situation where we would have to go to the museum and ask the man in charge to take out a couple of ploughs to do the tilling.  If we allow the country to go over to mechanised agriculture that situation could exist, and if the Minister for Agriculture advocates that policy we will face another war in a completely hopeless position.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that agriculture is our second line of defence, if not our first, in order to feed the nation and the Army, it is also a fact that as long as horses are used for transport here they can be produced in this country; they can be fed from oats which is produced in the country; they can be shod in the country; the implements by which the horses will provide the food can be manufactured in the country and repaired at the local blacksmith's forge.  Any policy that does not include that system of agriculture is a faulty policy with regard to defence.</P>
    <P>I was talking about defence when I started to deal with agriculture and I do not propose to go back on it again. In every Department at present, however, there is, in my opinion, the attitude that we have had the last of wars. There is no reason whatever why we should wait until the first shots are fired or until the first planes come in, as they did in the past, to realise our position.  We all know that this is a small country which would be completely dependent on its own resources in case of a serious emergency and we should prepare now rather than put it off until the date when we hear the shots fired.</P>

I propose to confine myself generally to certain technical aspects of borrowing which have not been discussed yet in the Seanad, rather than to cover the wider field.  My reason for that is that I think the wider field has already been very well covered in debates in the Dáil and in this House and that the major question of policy, and the capital Budget, and the division of expenditure between current and capital objects have <Col N="363" /> been pretty well accepted by all Parties in the House, subject to certain differences on detail.</P>
      <P>I think the quotation which was read by the Minister from the speech of Deputy Lemass really indicates that on this matter of the development of the resources of the country there is no great difference of opinion between the various Parties in the country, that the policy of the Government to-day is also the policy of the Opposition.  A certain amount of the criticism which has been directed against the Government this afternoon has been, not on the ground that they are doing too much, but that they are not doing enough.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that to criticise a Government for doing what they are doing and, at the same time, to criticise them for not doing more, is very inconsistent, blowing hot and cold, and that the Government's critics must make up their mind which they really want.</P>
      <P>As I said, on the major questions of economic development, I do not believe there is any difference of opinion between the various politicians and the various Parties in this country.  I think we are all agreed that the major object of policy, as far as it can be achieved, is to reduce, if we cannot succeed entirely in stopping, the flow of emigration.  That is the great wound in our side, the great blood-letting, the great haemorrhage, that has gone on for over 100 years, the major feature of Irish economic life, the major waste in our economic system.  I do not propose to go into it in detail to-day.  I think it possible that when the Report of the Commission on Emigration, which is so eagerly awaited, is published, some occasion may arise in the Seanad to discuss the various issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be of some interest, possibly, to call the attention of the House to the fact that in a book which has just appeared, a very fine contribution to the study of this country, a new book on Irish geography, by Mr. Freeman, the opinion is reached there, by that writer, that emigration has now gone to a point in this country when it has <Col N="364" /> produced such a shortage of agricultural labour and labour in the countryside that measures should be taken to bring it to an end.  That is his opinion. I am quoting another person's opinion. I do not for a moment say it is my own.  I simply quote it in order to show the urgency of the problem and the extreme measures to which responsible people are prepared to resort in order to try to remedy it.  The author of this volume, who is a gentleman of high academic standing, indicates that, in his opinion, the policy of agricultural intensification and the intensification of Irish rural development are incompatible with emigration at its existing rate.</P>
    <P>As I say, this is the great problem of Irish life.  When the Report of the Commission on Emigration is published, we shall all read it with very great attention and interest.  Meanwhile, I think we would all agree that, however much we may differ regarding details, we all fervently hope that some policy will be arrived at and agreed upon that will slow down to the minimum this terrible drain on the national life and this terrible wastage of investment in our people's education and rearing.  It seems to me that, in regard to the main matters of policy, there is no great difference regarding aim and objective between the Government, the Minister, and his critics in the House.</P>
    <P>What I cannot understand is why people who attach such great importance to the necessity for stemming emigration, should quarrel with some of the measures which are proposed in order to stem it.  It seems to me that, if one is willing to will the end, one must be willing to will the means; and, therefore, at the same time, to advocate a policy of intensive development in order to end emigration, and to quarrel with the measures which seem to be necessary, in some way to achieve that policy by means of borrowing and investment, is slightly contradictory, certainly on the surface.</P>
    <P>There was a point made by Senator Hawkins which I should like to refer to, namely, that the particular measures of development which are proposed at present are not directed to those areas <Col N="365" /> in the country from which emigration is greatest.  That, no doubt, is true, but I do suggest that the country must be regarded as a whole and that, whereas we all deplore emigration, the lowering of our population, people going abroad to add to the national income of other countries, a mere redistribution of the population inside the boundaries of our own country is not a matter for any regret.  It may be that certain parts of the country have not got the same resources as others and it seems to me that if any Government policy of development employs people in any part of our own country, it has justification.  Whereas, I do agree that it is the duty of the Government, as far as it can, to provide employment inside the nation to absorb as many people in the nation as possible, I do not think that duty applies to any particular area, any particular county or any particular district.  It may be that what is wanted is a redistribution of population and movement of people away from places where the natural resources are not sufficiently bounteous to support a large population to other parts of the country where the resources can be more fully developed.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I just do not quite follow what the Opposition criticism of the Finance Bill is.  Everybody in the country is agreed that we must do all we can to reduce the volume of emigration. Everybody is agreed that, in order to do that, we must try to develop our resources.  How can our resources be developed without a certain amount of capital investment? I have not yet heard the answer to that question.</P>
    <P>Certain criticisms have been made that certain capital investments that might have been undertaken are not being undertaken but I have not heard any criticism here of any of the capital investments that are already being undertaken and, therefore, as I say, the criticism is not so much that too much is being done as that not enough is being done.</P>
    <P>If all this has to be done, if everybody is agreed that it all has to be done, if capital investment is necessary, how can that capital investment take <Col N="366" /> place without borrowing?  Has anybody, in the course of this debate, suggested sources from which that investment could be financed other than borrowing?  Have suggestions been made for increases in taxation that would bring in the £12,000,000 which is proposed for this capital investment? It seems to me that all Parties are agreed, or should be agreed, at the present moment, that a certain amount of investment is necessary, and, if that investment is necessary, borrowing must take place.  Therefore, I really fail to see what the criticism is of the capital Budget and the policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>In saying that I know that I will be accused, in the course of the debate, of certain inconsistency with statements I made on a previous occasion. It has been stated previously that members of the Banking Commission, of which I was a member, have changed their coat; that they were now saying something different from what they said in 1938.  The suggestion is made that we are saying certain things now because we agree with the policy of the Administration, whereas these members said other things in 1938 because they did not agree with the policy then.  That statement has been made and I object to it.  It is a statement I should like to controvert on behalf of the signatories of the majority of the Banking Commission.  I think the virtue of consistency is misunderstood.</P>
    <P>The virtue of consistency does not involve the repetition of the same formula on all occasions.  It seems to me that consistency is a virtue which involves adapting one's principles to rapidly changing conditions; as merely to keep repeating some words in different conditions is really reducing oneself to the intellectual level of a sheep that always repeats the same sound or to a cow or some animal which says &ldquo;moo&rdquo; on all occasions and never varies its diction in any age or country.  I do not think that type of consistency is worthy of respect.  What I should like to suggest to the Seanad is that the circumstances in 1938 were widely different from the circumstances now, and, therefore, certain things that were said then&mdash;and that I subscribed to then and would subscribe <Col N="367" /> to again in the same circumstances&mdash; are not necessarily applicable to the same circumstances to-day.</P>
    <P>In interpreting any historical document one must also consider the position of the people at the time, and one must remember that, when referring to the Banking Commission.  In the Spring of 1938 at the time that report was signed, the country had been suffering for six years from the campaign referred to this afternoon as the economic war.  I have no intention of entering into any history of that campaign. All I wish to say is that the balance of payments was put under a very severe strain owing to the measures taken against exports, that our balance of payments deteriorated, and that we were rapidly losing our external assets during those years.  It therefore, became a matter of extreme urgency at that time, when the end of the economic war was not in sight, and could not be foreseen, to restore the equilibrium.  One of the methods of restoring the equilibrium in the balance of payments as everyone knows to-day from the newspapers is to balance the Budget.</P>
    <P>Therefore, with our preoccupation with the restoration of equilibrium, we attached great importance to the Budget at the time and made very strong observations on the impropriety of increasing the national debt.  I believe in the circumstances in which we were that what we said then was true.  Immediately after the signing of the report the situation changed. Within a few months the economic war was settled in such a way that our exports began to revive.  Within a year the international situation darkened, within two years war had broken out.  I believe if we had been endowed with the gift of prophecy to foresee the almost immediate settlement of the economic war, it would have very much relieved our difficulties at the outset of the world war, a period during which we were short of all sorts of imports, and as a result of which our external balances ceased to decline and accumulated to almost embarrassing extent.</P>
    <P>In 1938, if we had seen such consequences <Col N="368" /> our recommendations might be slightly different.  I believe if we had foreseen the outbreak of a war that was going to interrupt all our supplies from overseas, we would, probably, have advocated a policy of capital investment and of expenditure on stocking for an emergency.  I believe we would then have agreed with a great deal of what Senator Quirke said, but we could not foresee these things, and had to consider how to balance payments and exchange.  The one way was to balance the Budget by applying drastically the pruning knife to every penny of accumulated debt.  The immediate problem was to restore confidence in the country and to that end we had to restore confidence in public finance. The situation completely changed.  The war was a period during which external balances accumulated and imports became difficult to get.  What took place during those years could not have been foreseen.</P>
    <P>If anyone were to criticise the Government of 1939-1945 for neglecting a programme of capital investment, I think such a person would condemn himself to a certain extent, as conditions were not favourable.  It took the Government all its time to maintain the position.  It was not a period during which any country could enjoy a programme of house-building, of land reclamation or anything else.  Its energy was probably directed towards finding a solution of immediate problems.  On the whole, we got through the emergency period with a great deal less inconvenience than we could possibly expect.  I agree that the international situation is not good.  We are in a more parlous position to-day than those who signed the Majority Report of the Banking Commission in 1938 thought we were in then.  Possibly we were wrong.</P>
    <P>At the same time, as Senator Quirke stated, comparing the situation to-day with the situation then, it seems to me that if this threat of war is near&mdash;and it has been suggested that it is near&mdash; a programme of capital development, and an extension of capital expenditure should be conducted on a greater scale than it has been.  It seems to me that everything said this afternoon in the way of providing for any European war <Col N="369" /> has not only been in favour of borrowing but of more borrowing.  I do not think it is right for a country to base its policy in peace time too much on the possibility of war.  It is morbid and unhealthy.  Wars may come, I quite agree, but for a country to base its peace time policy on the fear of a war that may never come always seems to me like the healthy man living on an invalid diet because he may some day find it necessary to do so.  It is hypochondriacal, and, while a person should be cautious with regard to his diet, it seems to me that hypochondria may lead a person to do things which make him unnecessarily uncomfortable.  It is the same in the case of a nation and I therefore cannot help feeling that this insistence on the possibility of a European war may perhaps be overdone.</P>
    <P>The only point I want to make from the point of view of this discussion is that, if that case is true, if the danger of war is as great as it is represented, if the actual risk is as great as it appears to Senator Quirke, it seems to me that the Government is under an obligation to pursue a policy of even greater capital development in the sense of stocking up supplies and creating every sort of insurance against that emergency; but I prefer to discuss the matter on a peace basis and on the basis that war is not a major factor in the situation. Bringing it back merely to a peace basis, the situation to-day is very different from that of 1938.  The balance of payments is practically in equilibrium. The adverse balance of payments is rapidly disappearing&mdash;it has gone down from £30,000,000 to £20,000,000 to £10,000,000 and it is generally thought that, in the present year, there will be equilibrium in the over-all balance of payments.  I do not say that the dollar situation is easy, but I am talking about the over-all balance of payments.</P>
    <P>The intense preoccupation with the balance of payments which is noticeable in the Banking Commission's report need not overshadow our discussion to-day.  The balance of payments is fairly comfortable.  Furthermore, there is this&mdash;it may be a wrong point of view, but it is a very current, <Col N="370" /> widely held and, I should say, fashionable point of view&mdash;that at present, partly owing to the war dangers, to the great deterioration in the international situation and partly owing, I am afraid, to a certain lack of confidence in the future of world currencies, there is an expenditure on capital investment, even of a kind which is not strictly self-liquidating, which is not regarded with the same disapproval&mdash;I might almost say, the same horror&mdash;as it was 50 years ago.</P>
    <P>We are living in a world in which the future is uncertain and unsettled and I am afraid we have to take shorter views.  Certainly individuals are doing it.  People who 50 years ago would have regarded the spending of their current revenue on the acquisition of some object which would give them permanent enjoyment as something slightly wrong, something which should take second place to the accumulation of some saving for the future, do not hold that view to-day.  There has been a change of climate regarding translating one's savings into concrete capital objects.  That may be a wrong point of view&mdash;it may be overdone.  The circumstances of the world may not justify its having gone as far as it has, but, rightly or wrongly, it is there.  It is being done by private individuals and it is being done by business people and I really do not see why, when it is done by the nation, it should be regarded as something very wildly improvident.</P>
    <P>That is why I said that I do not think members of the Banking Commission who are now prepared to support the capital Budget and the borrowing programme of the Government can be accused of inconsistency. In a certain situation in 1938, they held certain views.  In a widely different situation in 1950, while maintaining the same general principles, they may have slightly altered the details of their application.  The world around them has changed and for people in a changing world simply to dig themselves in and refuse to budge for fear of the accusation of inconsistency really shows, at its lowest, a certain moral cowardice and, at best, a certain stupidity and incapacity to move with the times.  Therefore, I take <Col N="371" /> it that all Parties are agreed that some capital development in this country is justified in the situation and it seems to me that a more useful topic to discuss this afternoon is the way in which that capital development can take place with the least burden on the taxpayers in the future.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the subject to which I intend specially to refer quite shortly.  The present structure of Irish Government loans gives the impression that Irish Government borrowing is rather long and rather dear.  I have here the <i>Handbook of Irish Securities</i> issued by the Stock Exchange and an examination of it reveals the following facts, which I think are relevant to this discussion.  Five of the issues of the Irish Government have now got to a position at which they can be converted or redeemed.  There are five issues of the Irish Government, totalling £27,000,000, which are ripe for redemption and the Minister for Finance to-day, if he wishes, can offer to redeem those loans.  A large block of loans, the first earliest date of whose redemption has already passed, are not a very satisfactory type of security to investors. The people who hold them are not anxious to part with them, hoping possibly to redeem them on good terms. Other people are not willing to buy them because their currency is so uncertain, so that there is a very large block of Irish Government securities which have not got a very free market. The only securities in which, I am told, there is a really free market on the Dublin Stock Exchange are the 3 per cent. Exchequer Bonds.  That issue was £24,000,000 and the dates of redemption are 1965-70.  The other issues available are the 3¼ per cent. loan, £7,000,000, 1956-61, the earliest date of which is now six years away and the 3¾ per cent. loan of £9,000,000, 1953-58.  Both these loans stand at quite a substantial premium and the actual amounts are not very large.  People at the Stock Exchange will tell you they are very tightly held and hard to buy.</P>
    <P>No one can tell what is in the mind of the Minister for Finance in regard to new borrowing, but it might be possible to deduce something from <Col N="372" /> Section 22 of the Bill before us.  The sinking fund provisions for the new loans are to extend over a period of 30 years and the basis of calculation of the amount required is 3½ per cent. That suggests to me that the Minister's mind is thinking in terms of 3½ per cent on 30 years' currency.  These are the terms of the British Coal Stock issued the other day&mdash;3½ per cent., 1976/80&mdash;and it would not surprise me if the Irish Government offered similar terms for their borrowing.  If a loan on approximately those terms is issued, it might fail to mop up a certain amount of money in Ireland which, I think, could be readily available at a slightly cheaper rate.</P>
    <P>There is a large amount of money in the hands of companies in Ireland, largely in view of the fears of the international situation to which Senator Quirke has referred, as companies are holding an unusually large part of their resources liquid.  The bank deposits are very high and a large amount of those deposits is, I believe, reserves of companies being held in a liquid form. Companies do not wish to embark on loans for 30 years' currency at the present time.  Fluctuations in gilt edged prices in recent years have not been such as to encourage people who may want to hold money in a liquid form to freeze too much of it in long securities.  These companies, I am told, if they wish to invest their resources in suitable form, have to buy British Government securities.  The trouble about that is that, in buying British Government securities, companies find themselves involved in questions of recovering British tax and complications of that kind; and, therefore, rather than involve themselves in these complications, the money is left idle. If it were not for that income-tax difficulty, there are three British Government securities which, I am told, are regarded as suitable by business people for the holding of liquid funds.</P>
    <P>What I suggest to the Minister is that he should apply his mind to the question whether equivalent Irish Government securities could not be offered to the Irish public.  To offer those securities might save the Exchequer quite a considerable amount <Col N="373" /> of interest in the year.  The worst that could happen is that they would not be taken up, which would not really matter very much.  The experiment would have been tried.  If they were taken up, they would be a gain to the Exchequer; if they were not, the position would not be worse than it is. Therefore, it is one of the experiments that seem to promise gain, without any equivalent possibility of loss.  There are three securities to which I refer and I suggest to the Minister that he might consider whether there is not room in the borrowing structure of the Irish State to fit in some equivalent securities.  The first is the 2½ per cent. Five Year Bonds.  The maximum currency is five years.  In the course of a year or two, they become a really short-dated security of a kind that appeals to people who want to keep their resources liquid.  Another security which is calculated to appeal to private individuals rather than companies, as there is a maximum which may be issued to any one person, and which I believe is very popular in England, is the 3 per cent.  Five Year Bonds issued on tap.  They can be taken up by the public just as they require them. These bonds are repayable on six months' notice and, therefore, they give quite a reasonable return with considerable liquidity.</P>
    <P>The final security to which I would draw the Minister's attention is one which, as far as I know, has not been utilised in this country, that is, the tax certificates.  These enable idle money to be devoted to the payment of future demands for income-tax and other taxes at a substantial rate of discount, a higher rate of discount than can be obtained by leaving the money idle in the bank at 1 per cent. or whatever the deposit rate is. Income-tax which has already been assessed can always be paid before the date at which it is due, at 2½ per cent. discount, I am informed; but these tax certificates are specially designed for the holding of liquid funds in a profitable form against income-tax claims which have not been actually assessed.</P>
    <P>All my observations regarding the necessity for borrowing are really meant to lead up to these concrete <Col N="374" /> proposals.  We are all agreed we must develop the resources of the country, we are all agreed the Government must borrow and, if it must borrow, it should try to do so on the best possible terms.  I ask the Minister to apply his mind to the question whether some of these types of security which have been successfully floated elsewhere might not be successfully floated here also.</P>

      <P>Ní dúirt an tAire mórán nuair a chuir sé an Bille ós ár gcomhair agus ní rabhmar ag súil le mórán uaidh.  D'innis sé dúinn go raibh an oiread seo alt ins an mBille agus dúirt sé focal nó dhó ina dtaobh. Bé an rún a bhí aige, is dóigh liom, go raibh a dhóthain ráite aige sa Dáil ar an scéim agus mar adúirt sé féin bhí súil aige go raibh a chuid óráideachaí léite againn.  Cé is móite den óráid a rinne sé tráthnóna inné ar an gCúigiú Céim, tá a chuid óráideachaí léite agam agus déarfainn nár mhór dó tamall eile a chaitheamh ar an stól cruaidh ag ceapadh míniú dúinn ar a chuid beartas sul a mbeidh mise, go háirithe sásta leis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ar an abhar sin is mó an spéis a bhí agam sna hóráideachaí a tugadh tráthnóna ag lucht an tSeanaid ná mar bhí agam in óráid an Aire.  Níl fhios agam an fiú tagairt a dhéanamh do chuid de na hóráideachaí.  Bhíodar chomh suarach sin, ar ócáid mar seo, go mb'éidir go mb'fhearr iad d'fhágáil marbh.  Ina dhiaidh sin ní maith liom gan a fhágáil le léamh in Imeachtaí an tSeanaid gur bocht an mhaise don tSeanadóir Baxter masla a thabhairt don tSeanadóir Ó hEacháin nó do lucht Fianna Fáil.  Dúirt sé go raibh sé ag súil, an té a labródh ón taobh seo, go ndéanfadh sé scrúdú agus anailís ar an mBille.  Nuair nach raibh sé féin sásta le hóráid an tSeanadóra Ó hEacháin bhíodar ag súil go ndéanfadh sé féin mionscrúdú agus anailís ar an mBille.  Chruthaigh an Seanadóir Baxter anseo tráthnóna go láidir dúinn an tuairim atá againn air féin le tamall: go mb'fhearr dhó a bhéal a choinneáil dúnta níos mó ná mar a choinníonn.  Ní raibh fhios aige go mba cheart dúinn a bheith ag smaoineamh sa tír seo ar ócáid práinne.  Fuair <Col N="375" /> sé locht ar an óráid a rinne an Seanadóir Ó hEacháin mar gheall ar gur chuir sé ar shúile an Aire an saol contúirteach atá ann, an saol éiginnte atá ag bagairt orainn, agus gur mheabhraigh sé don Aire gur bé a leas agus leas na tíre go dtabharfadh sé áird ar chomharthaí an dainséir sin agus go ndéanfadh sé beart dá réir.  Is é an sórt duine é an Seanadóir Baxter&mdash;agus go deimhin duine eile ar a laghad de na Seanadóirí a labhair ina dhiadh&mdash;ná duine den tsórt a cheapas gur bé an uair is ceart an doras a dhúnadh tar éis don fhoghail nó don ghadaíocht a bheith déanta.  Míle buíochas le Dia, sna blianta atá caite, sul má bhris an cogadh mór deireannach amach, narb shin é an fhealsúnacht agus narb shin é an tuiscint a bhí ag an Rialtas ar a ndualgas; gur cheapadar gur cheart dóibh áird a thabhairt ar an saol a  thart orthu agus beart a dhéanamh dá réir; gur cheapadar gur cheart dóibh réiteach a dhéanamh, agus a dhéanamh in am.  Marach go ndearnadar é sin bheadh muid á rá ón ár gcroí amach &ldquo;go bhfóiridh Dia ar mhuintir na hÉireann,&rdquo; i rith an chogaidh agus sna blianta ina dhiaidh sin ó stop an cogadh.</P>
    <P>Rinne sé tagairt do neodracht a bhí á chleachtadh againn i rith na héigeandála agus facthas dó gur cleasach an gníomh é, gur mí-chneasta an gníomh é, ag Rialtas na tíre gur cheannaigh siad airm is oirnéis ón mBreatain Mhóir.  Nach é brí na neodrachta go gceannódh muid in áit ar bith a d'fheilfeadh dúinn?  Níor mhíchneastacht ná mí-dhílseacht é go raibhmuid sásta ceannacht ar mhargadh na Breataine Móire má fheil sé sin dúinn.</P>
    <P>Thaispeáin an Seanadóir Baxter anseo tráthnóna gur duine suarach é ina intinn, muran duine é gan mórán tuisceana, nuair a labhair sé mar a labhair anseo ar an gceist sin agus ar cheisteanna eile.  Rinne sé cosaint ar an Aire sa mhéid atá beartaithe aige. Tá locht againne ar chuid de na rudaí atá beartaithe ag an Aire&mdash;ní hé díreach ar na rúdaí atá beartaithe aige ach ar an mbealach atá sé ag dul ag tabhairt fúthu.  Is é an rud is mó a bhfuil spéis againn ann inniu agus le <Col N="376" /> tamall anuas: cén fáth a bhfuil athrú meoin tagaithe air mar atá le dhá bhliain go leith nó trí bliana anuas? Sin é an rud is mó go bhfuil spéis ag daoine ann.  Cén fáth go bhfuil an <i>somersault</i> seo déanta aige?  An rud a bhí ina pheaca trí bliana ó shoin, cén fáth gur suáilce nó bua anois é? Cén fáth gur mheabhraigh an Seanadóir Ó Briain dúinn go raibh sé sásta rúdaí a dhéanamh i 1938 nach mbeadh sé sásta a dhéanamh inniu?  Mheabraigh seisean dúinn &ldquo;dá mba rud é go raibh fhios agamsa agus ag an Coimisiún Bancaerachta go raibh cogadh le teacht agus go mbeadh an náisiún i sáinn, ní abróimis na rúdaí adúramar i dtuarascáil An Choimisiúin Bhancaereachta. Ní dóigh liom gur chualamar le fada an lá moladh níos mó ar thusicint, ar éirim, ar chúram, ar stuaim, ar fhadbhreathnaíocht an Rialtais a bhí ann san am.  Bhí siad sin ag tabhairt aire don tsaol a bhí thart orthu; bhí siad ag tabhairt áird ar na comharthaí dainséir a bhí ag bagairt ó gach taobh, ach lucht léannta an Choimisiúin Bhancaereachta, ní raibh súile acu le breathnú ar na comharthaí dainséir ná cluasa acu le héisteacht le fuaimeanna an dainséir.  Ar ámharaí an tsaoil bhí Rialtas tuisceanach againn a thuig céard a bhí ar bun agus a thuig an dainséar a bhí i ndán dúinn agus a rinne beart dá réir.</P>

      <P>The effect of this Bill is to confirm ten Orders made under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932.  Orders Nos. 1 and 6 in the Schedule relate to buckets.  Prior to the making of the Orders the duty on buckets was limited to the complete article.  Senators are, no doubt, aware of the emphasis which is being placed <Col N="377" /> on exports by nearly all countries since the end of the war.  A corollary of this policy is that wherever possible countries are concentrating on the export of manufactured or partly manufactured articles rather than on raw materials. These factors operated in the case of the raw materials for bucket making and, accordingly, there was a grave danger that, on the basis of the existing duty, the degree of manufacture of buckets carried on in the country would diminish and that the work would become restricted to the assembly or finishing off of buckets imported in a partially manufactured condition.  The two Orders in the Schedule confirm the duty imposed and extend it to component parts of buckets and partially manufactured buckets.</P>
      <P>Order No. 2 relates to woollen knitted wear.  The revised duties on clothing which were reintroduced in January, 1948, achieved, on the whole, the purposes for which they were intended, with the exception of hosiery. An examination of the position with respect to hosiery showed that the situation was not unsatisfactory in the case of cotton and rayon underwear and hose and in the case of woollen hose, including socks.  Imports of rayon hose are, however, subject to quota restriction in addition to the tariff.  The output, sales and employment of the concerns producing cotton and rayon underwear and hose and woollen hose, including socks, increased each year since 1946.  In the case of woollen outerwear, sales have remained static, while imports continued at the substantial rate of approximately £500,000 per annum.  In these circumstances, it was decided to increase the full rate of duty on woollen underwear and outerwear to 40 per cent. and to restore the suspended preferential rate of 33? per cent.  The restoration was carried out under an Order under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act and the Order is not scheduled in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of Order No. 3 is to remove a loophole in the main Order which it amends.  The cloths covered by this Order are used mainly as linings, and the Revenue Commissioners were authorised to exempt <Col N="378" /> cloths which had been subjected to proofing.  It was found that cloths were being brought in which were intended for and were suitable for use as linings but had been subjected to a process of proofing merely for the purpose of evading the objects of the duty.  The effect of the amending Order is to restrict the exemption to cloths proofed by a process involving the use of rubber or rubber solution.</P>
    <P>Orders Nos. 4, 5, 8 and 9 may be taken together because their purpose is to protect a number of new industries. The first of these industries is the production of wide elastics suitable for braces and suspenders by a new company in Ennis.  Senators are aware that the production of other varieties of elastic up to one inch in width has been carried on at Ennis for a number of years.  The second of these industries is the production of files and hack saw blades at Newbridge.  Apart from general economic considerations, there are definite advantages in having essential tools of this nature produced in the country.  The third new industry is the production of wallboard from straw at Athy.  This industry is valuable not only from the point of view that it produces an article which has a large and growing use and which has hitherto been entirely imported but also from the point of view that it uses straw as a raw material and provides a ready market in a tillage area for surplus straw.</P>
    <P>Order No. 7 merely gives statutory effect to what was already an administrative fact by exempting from scope of the duty elementary parts, fixed resistances and fixed condensers for the importation of which, in the past, duty-free facilities were given.  Elementary or completely unassembled parts are the raw material of the wireless industry in this country and, in fact, in other countries.  The production of elementary parts represents a separate aspect of wireless manufacture which is not yet being undertaken here.</P>
    <P>Order No. 10 was designed to meet a specific situation caused by the export from Hong Kong of cheap cotton shirts. The landed cost of these shirts was considerably below the price at which the raw material for similar cheap <Col N="379" /> shirts could be bought by Irish manufacturers. It may be that the danger from this sort of competition will grow in other respects in future but at present it is intended to confine the Order to the shirts mentioned.  I may say that a number of orders were places for these shirts and the danger to our manufacturing concerns was imminent.</P>

      <P>In the first place, I think there has been a very long time-lag between the making of the Order and its coming before the Houses of the Oireachtas for confirmation.  We have now presented to us not only a particular Order but a number of them, with the principle of which we agree.  I was glad to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary that this provision is necessary in order to encourage Irish industry. In more than one case, and in particular with regard to broader elastics, as well as hack-saws and other essentials, including wallboard, and new fields of undertaking, we are prepared to give every assistance.  Bringing the Orders before the House reminds us of the importance of guarding against dumping.  In the past we heard on many occasions certain criticism of Irish industries.  It has often been suggested that articles could be imported much cheaper and with greater benefit to the community and that the placing of tariffs or restrictions of any kind on such articles was not in the interests of consumers.  We are glad to know that there is now a change of attitude on the part of many people who held another point of view in the past.  If we are to build up our industries we must at the start be prepared to assist them.  Many discussions took place concerning the wallpaper industry.  Taking it on the whole, it is good national policy to give our industries every support and to guard them against dumping from countries where articles could be produced much cheaper than here owing to the difference in labour conditions and in the supply of raw materials.  We are prepared to support the Bill.</P>

      <P>Senator Hawkins mentioned that some considerable time had elapsed between the making of Orders and bringing them before the House.  That has been the practice for some time.  It is better, in the case of new tariffs, when an Order is made that there should be an interval of about six months, so that if any question arises in connection with an industry we will hear of it.  If an Order, when made, was immediately brought before Parliament there would be no time to voice public criticism.</P>

      <P>Sul má scoireamar le haghaidh sosa, bhí mé ag cur síos ar chuid de na pointí a bhí á lua ag cuid de na Seanadóirí a labhair tráthnóna ní i dtaobh an Bhille, ach i dtaobh na ndaoine atá agus a bhí fábharach d'Fhianna Fáil.  Bhí mé ag déanamh tagairt go speisialta do chuid de na rudaí a bhí á lua ag an Seanadóir Baxter.  Ceann de na rudaí eile a luaigh sé: go mba mhaith liom go mór cur ina choine, is é an rud é sin gurb é an rud ba mhaith le muintir Fhianna Fáil go dtiocfadh scrios agus bochtanas ar an tír agus trí bhochtanas agus scrios do theacht ar an tír, go gcuideodh sé leo mar Pháirtí.</P>

      <Col N="381" /> Dúirt mé faoi rud adúirt sé tráthnóna go mba suarach an rud adúirt sé, ach más féidir rud níos suaraí a rá, sin é an rud é.  Ní theastaíonn uainne go dtiocfadh a leithéid ar aghaidh sa tír. Dúirt mé go minic cheana gurb é an rud ba mhaith linn go raghadh cúrsa na tíre chun cinn agus, maidir liomsa, is cuma liom sa tuibaiste cé chuirfidh chun cinn iad, má cuirtear chun cinn iad.

    <P>Is duine é go mbeadh a leas féin agus leas an tSeanaid á dhéanamh aige dá gcoinníodh sé a bhéal dúnta níos mó ná mar choinníonn sé.  Bhí sé ag caint anseo tráthnóna agus á rá dá mba rud é nach raibh móin ins an tír, dá mba rud é nach raibh prátaí ins an tír, dá mba rud é nach raibh daoine le fáil le hoibriú ar na portaigh agus da mba rud é go raibh na daoine óga ag imeacht as an tír, ar cheart dúinn bheith ag cur síos orthu anseo agus strainséirí anseo ag éisteacht linn?

    <P>The Minister, in putting this Bill before us, was rather economical in the matter of speech.  I do not blame him for that.  He made a fairly long speech on the Budget and he hoped that we had read whatever he said in the Dáil on this Bill.  I can only say that I read whatever he said, except whatever he may have said on the Final Stage yesterday evening.  I want to say that, so far as I am concerned, he will have to spend another while on the hard stool and will have to spend another while making speeches, before he convinces me that he is on the right track.  We could not be very interested in what he said, he said so little.</P>
    <P>The Bill has certain features in it which we shall have to discuss at length, but, apart from that, the main interest this evening was in the speeches of the Senators who believe that the Minister for Finance is the world's greatest financial magician, just as the Minister for Agriculture is the greatest Minister for Agriculture the world has ever known or is ever likely to know.  The main feature of the discussion seems to be that of making a virtue of running into debt. It might be all right on occasions that we should run into debt, but we will want to be given much stronger reasons than we have been given for running into debt to the extent we propose to run into debt and the way we propose to run into debt.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter seemed to be the leading light in defending the Bill and the policy enshrined in it.  I think the proper course for Senators on this side would be to treat Senator Baxter with contempt.  I should like to treat him with the contempt of my silence, but I want to protest&mdash;and I want it to go on the records&mdash;against the type of sneer and attack in which he indulged this evening with regard to the speech of Senator Hawkins. Senator Baxter told us that the discussion of this Bill was a matter for <Col N="383" /> a person of special ability, a person with ability to analyse the Bill.  He was not satisfied with Senator Hawkins.  May I say that, if ever a man failed in his attempt to analyse a Bill or what was inherent in a Bill, Senator Baxter failed this evening, and failed miserably?</P>
    <P>I want to protest also against his references to the matter of this country's neutrality during the last war. I think diplomats, with one exception, agree that this country fulfilled the obligations of neutrality to the letter. I think it was generally conceded that we could not have conducted ourselves with greater fairness than we did during the war.  All I can say is that, thanks be to God, that Senator and his colleagues were not in charge of affairs in this State during the war.  He made, again, the statement that it would give members of Fianna Fáil satisfaction if the people of this country were to be impoverished if prices were to fall and so on.  May I say, Sir, that the mind that is capable of thinking in that way, and the person that is capable of making such accusations against political opponents, and especially opponents with the record of Fianna Fail, is hardly fit to be in public life at all.  I protested before against that type of insult and that type of attack. I protest against it again as strongly as I possibly can.  For the rest, as I say, the proper thing to do with regard to Senator Baxter is to pay no heed to him in future and, in that way, to express our contempt for him.</P>

      <P>If Senator Baxter did not mean the things we believe were meant, perhaps he will explain what he meant.  If Senator Baxter's references to neutrality had a meaning other than the meaning taken by Senator Quirke and myself, he ought <Col N="384" /> to tell us what he did mean.  If Senator Baxter did not mean what we believe he meant in his references to Fianna Fáil and the conduct of Fianna Fáil, and its management of this country's affairs in the years gone by, he can explain to us exactly what he meant.</P>

He did not use those words, but it would be true to say that he implied, that the state of affairs for this nation was appalling, the task that had to be faced by the Minister for Finance, and the task that had to be faced by other Ministers.  It might be no harm to mention to Senator Baxter, as was well said in the Dáil on the occasion of the election of the new Government, that this State was handed over in ship-shape condition.  The achievements of Fianna Fáil, in spite of terrific obstacles from outside, and from inside, were achievements of which they may be well proud, whether in the national field, in the political field, in the social or in the economic field. The Parliamentary Secretary smiles and holds up the Bill.  I take it from that that he concludes I am somewhat out of order in discussing these matters.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for the Chair.  I would be sorry to refer to them at all, if they had not been referred to this evening, and referred to in a manner in which they were referred to.  So much for Senator Baxter. I mentioned a moment ago that we seem to have been making a virtue of running into debt.  We seem to be making a virtue of something else; and, that is, the making of promises and running away from them.  We were told, time and time again, that Fianna Fáil was spendthrift, that something ought to be done to curb it, as far as taxation was concerned. I need not tell the Seanad of the <Col N="385" /> jumps that have taken place in taxation from 1947 up to the present.  I do not object very much to these increases in taxation, but what I do object to is, that the people who have brought about these increases were the people who denounced Fianna Fáil as being spendthrift when they brought in a Budget of very much less dimensions.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in 1948, when he talked about having removed the taxes on beer and tobacco, apologised that he did not do more and said, &ldquo;If I cannot do better by this time next year, I will let Deputies accuse me of failure.&rdquo;  May we accuse him, not alone of failure, but of being a miserable failure in his high office?  A few items just to indicate the changes: Stamp duties in 1947 were £921,562 and in 1950-51 £1,640,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <P>I am speaking of stamp duties.  Income-tax was £12,500,000 in 1947, and for 1950-51 £16,715,000.  Senator Baxter will ask me whether the rate is higher or not. In any case, there is £5,000,000 more being collected in income-tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the incomes are higher, more prosperity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to the question of prosperity in a few minutes, if the Senator will be patient. Excise increased from £9,657,000 to £13,260,000 and customs from £16,707,000 to £25,380,000.  If Senator Baxter had asked me whether I was allowing for the changes in the value of money and allowing for certain other matters, there might have been some sense in his remark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I think I should refer to the change in the value of money and so properly explain what these figures mean, the least the Minister for Finance and other Minister ought to do, when they are using 1938-39 as a basis for reference, is to make the same adjustments and not be misleading or attempting to mislead people, as they have been doing for some time. Taxation has not come down.  We <Col N="386" /> were assured that if these people were returned they would reduce taxation. The Minister will reply, as the Tánaiste has replied to us more than once, that they reduced the price of beer and cigarettes.  We grant them that.  I am sure that if Fianna Fáil had been returned they would have made the necessary adjustment in that regard in due course.  At any rate, we know that the public have had other taxes and other charges increased.  If a certain element in the community is getting relief in regard to their beer and tobacco, we know that industry has to bear an impost of 5d. on petrol and an impost on the oil used.</P>

      <P>We remember well the biting remarks in the Dáil and in the Seanad with regard to the high-powered and luxury cars which might be seen in O'Connell Street and other streets during the regime of Fianna Fáil.  Have Senator Baxter and those with him supporting the Government done anything about that themselves? If it were wrong that that should be the case during Fianna Fáil's term of office, what has happened to make it right during the term of office of the present Government?  The Fine Gael Party&mdash;the Party to which the Minister for Finance belongs&mdash;and other Parties declared that if returned they would reduce the cost of the Civil Service and the numbers engaged in the Civil Service.  Have they done so?  They may explain that they did not do so and may offer reasons, but the fact remains that they told the electorate they would do it.  Some of them had experience in Government already and spoke with the authority that that experience gave them, saying they knew how to reduce the Civil Service and its cost.  As a matter of fact, since the present Government came in, I think the number of civil servants has increased by nearly 2,000 persons, while the cost has gone up by several million pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of living was to be reduced. Some people assured us that they knew how to reduce it by 30 per cent.  Others <Col N="387" /> were not so given to exaggeration and told us that it would be reduced by 10 per cent.  That has not been done, and I feel it my duty to remind the Minister and the Government that it has not been done.  Again, those people spoke as people who had experience in Government, people who for years had been holding themselves out as authorities on these matters, as students of finance and students of economics; and out of their knowledge and their experience they assured the electorate that they would reduce the cost of living.  Time and again within the last year or so, when we told the Minister that the cost of living had not fallen but actually had gone up, he disputed the point with us and said it had not gone up.  He then made the claim that at least he had held it firm. I think very few people would agree that he held it firm.</P>

    <P>Senator Hawkins referred to the question of double prices.  I want to protest against such price methods. The aim of rationing is to see that everybody gets an equal share of what is going and that nobody, because of wealth, will be able to get more than his neighbour.  I hold that this double price method is wrong in enabling people who have higher incomes or are <Col N="388" /> wealthy to get all they want.  Apart from that, there is this injustice in it, that the poor find that they themselves must go into the market for these dear commodities.  They find that the sugar ration is not sufficient, that the tea ration is not sufficient.</P>

      <P>I was rather interested in the reference made by Senator O'Brien to the question of emigration.  He himself apparently has no policy on the matter.  I expect he was one of the people who believed that the present set-up in Government would have a policy that would end that terrible evil.  We are all familiar with these posters that were up during the election showing a big ship with emigrants and underneath: &ldquo;Put out Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Senator O'Brien has hopes that the Commission on Emigration will produce a policy and I am rather surprised at that attitude on his part.  However, members of the present Government in my hearing declared that they could solve this question of emigration, that they had a plan whereby they could solve it. They had no plans to solve it.  I said that before; I will say it as long as it is necessary; I will repeat it until they produce a plan.  The Government had no plan and to the extent that they induced the people of the country to support them on the grounds that they had a plan for the solution of the emigration problem, they deceived and defrauded the electorate.  The Government had no plan and their supporters now come along and tell us that they hope that the Commission on Emigration would produce a plan.  Might I remind some of these Senators that one member of that commission, in an article published about mid-year, 1948, assured us that the problem of emigration was solved?  That was the year of miracles but, although this gentleman assured us that the miracle had been wrought, the commission is still sitting. I wish the commission the best of luck; I only wish that the commission would hurry up and give us whatever solution they have.  In any case, the people who had a plan for its solution are responsible for 40,000 young people having left the country in the last two years.  What number has left for the portion of this year that has run I do not know.</P>
      <P>Not alone is there emigration but there has been a tremendous movement of people from the rural parts.  Senator Baxter would hold forth on the horrors of that.  We have been listening for years to people telling us what a curse and what a scourge it was and what it meant.  In the last two years 50,000 people have gone out of rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>Then there is the question of reducing taxation in various ways.  People were led to believe that we were going to get a relief in income-tax, particularly in this year.  In the <Col N="390" /><i>Irish Times</i> in the issue to which I have referred there is a note which runs:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Pressure is being exerted on the Minister for Finance, Mr. McGilligan, by trade unions and professional organisations to secure an increase in the income-tax allowance.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We were told here this evening that the people are very pleased with the Budget.  It continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Trade Union Congress, in a letter to the Minister, and in its journal, <i>Trade Union Information,</i> has urged that the first £100 of taxable income be taxed at one-third the standard rate and the second £100 at two-thirds.  They ask, in addition, that both married and children's allowances and reliefs should be raised to bring them into line with the increase in the cost of living.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Apparently Deputy Norton's Trade Union Congress feels that the cost of living has risen and is not satisfied with this wonderful Budget, judging by this statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Further pressure has been applied by the Congress of Irish Unions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So the dissatisfaction does not seem to be one-sided.  It goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Congress of Professional Organisations also has sought an interview with the Minister to discuss a whole range of proposals in the coming Budget on allowances, personal income and taxation on capital and profits.  The general view is that the Minister may accede to some of the requests and that some relief may be forthcoming, at least in the field of personal and children's allowances.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public, therefore, notwithstanding the protestations of some of the Senators over there, is not too happy over this Budget.  The people represented by both Trade Union Congresses and by professional organisations will hardly be satisfied that their expectations regarding tax reliefs have not been realised.  However, failure to realise their expectations will probably be interpreted by <Col N="391" /> Senator Baxter and his friends as satisfaction with the Budget.</P>
    <P>Other people have been asking for tax relief, and I think they could hold that they were entitled to expect it, especially in view of the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the Federation of Industries dinner.  Industry does need relief. We have been told that we need to increase output; not alone that, but that output should be made available at a lower cost.  Without question one of the biggest burdens that has to be borne by industry is tax in various forms.  I am not the spokesman of industry, but I do think that the relief they have sought and expected should be granted or that something should be done to meet them.  Industry needs this assistance, for various reasons.  It needs it because of conditions on the home market.  It needs it because of the extent to which industrialists are being advised to try to get into overseas markets.  If they are to get into overseas markets it will be only by meeting competition.  Generous reliefs of various kinds have been made available to British manufacturers.  It is idle to expect our manufacturers to get any share of overseas markets without assistance.  One form of assistance that might be given to them is relief in taxation.  However, the relief they sought and did not get will probably be held up by Senator Baxter and his friends as further proof of the popularity of this Budget.</P>
    <P>Industry wants relief because of a further burden it has to bear.  We are aware that Irish manufacturers, and also agriculture, have to bear a tax of 25/- a ton on coal.  They get coal of inferior quality and they get it at a price 25/- a ton more than the price at which coal is available to their competitors in Great Britain.  They cannot escape that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out a fact.  I am indicating the burdens that must be borne by industry in this country.  I am pointing out the necessity for easing their burdens, even to the extent of taking up the matter with the British as being unfair discrimination.  We may have no redress but, at least, we ought to take it up and see if we can do anything about it.  Industry is handicapped and the consumers are handicapped.</P>
      <P>I mentioned a few minutes ago a report that appeared in the <i>Irish Times.</i> I have already quoted from it. To indicate the further difficulties of Irish industry and the need for coming to its relief, might I mention these few facts: As a result of devaluation, it is estimated that materials in use in the food industries have increased by 4.5 per cent.; for agricultural production by 6.1 per cent., and for other industries by 7.7 per cent.  Capital equipment costs have increased by 3.5 per cent.; food by 4.3 per cent., and other consumption by 4.6 per cent.; raw materials in general use by 7 per cent.  The most alarming price increase has been for wheat, which has risen by 33 per cent.  Maize has gone up by 25 per cent.; raw cocoa by 18 per cent.; cocoa butter by 76 per cent., and tea by 21 per cent.</P>
      <P>It is clear that industry has run into difficulties and it is clear that the consumers are running into difficulties. It is the duty of the Minister to come to the relief of both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I refer to the position that is developing out of Marshall Aid?  I referred to this matter several times. On each occasion that I mentioned it, it was indicated that I was acting somewhat like a bogey man.  I do not know what our total commitments under Marshall Aid will be.  When the 1950 allocation was available, I think we would be liable for about 170,000,000 dollars.  I suppose by 1952 we will have received about 200,000,000 or maybe 220,000,000 dollars.  It is hardly necessary to say that, like other people, I appreciate the spirit in which this aid is made available and, like other people, I appreciate the goodwill of <Col N="393" /> the United States Government in making it available.  I wonder do we realise its implications.  I wonder do the people realise that this is a loan that will have to be repaid.  Indeed, I sometimes wonder whether it is the intentíon to repay it at all or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember on one occasion here raising the matter of Britain getting our dollars in an indirect way and I asked the Minister for Agriculture did he realise the implication of that and whether arrangements were being made to ensure that, when the time came for repayment, Britain would make available to us some portion of the dollars we would need to repay our loan.  I do not know whether the Minister was joking or not &mdash;it is very difficult to know, with regard to the Minister for Agriculture, whether he is really in earnest or whether he appreciates what he is saying&mdash;but he did convey that, whenever the time came for repayment and we were not able to repay, there was the likelihood that the debt might be wiped out.</P>
      <P>Senators will remember that when I mentioned at one time the possibility of the £ becoming weaker, and becoming a very difficult proposition for us, the Minister's reply was that when that happened to the £ both of us would be working in the salt mines of Siberia. The £ has gone wallop and neither of us happen to be in Siberia.  Perhaps the Minister's statement with regard to repayment of the Marshall loan would be taken in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am glad that the seriousness of the matter has dawned upon the Government.  The Taoiseach the other evening, addressing the body <Col N="394" /> appointed to try to develop overseas trade, concluded with this remark:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The problem is urgent.  Marshall Aid has less than two years to run.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas asked if I was not taking the good out of the compliment I paid to the United States Government. I do not think I was.  What I had in mind was this, that we ought to cut down certain imports from the United States and from the dollar area in general.  There are considerable items of expenditure which we could very well cut down.  Some Senators may sneer at that.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the fact that the price of wheat had gone up by 33 per cent. We ought to get more wheat from our own soil and less from America.  I mentioned the fact that the price of maize had gone up 25 per cent., adding to the difficulties of our producers, and that we should try to do with less maize and get more feeding stuffs from home sources.  That is what I had in mind when I referred to Marshall Aid and as to whether we were wise in availing of it to such an extent.  I think that we could very well cut down imports from the dollar area.</P>
    <P>Again, may I draw the attention of the Minister to the point I already made, and that is that Britain is getting, in an indirect way, a considerable portion of the dollars allocated to us from the United States?  If we use these dollars to make available extra produce from the land and if that extra produce is going to Britain, is it not clear that she is getting a special advantage from our dollar allocation? Is it not reasonable to ask, when agreements are being made, that some stipulation or arrangement should be come to whereby she would make available to us dollars in return for the advantages she is getting at the present time and during the period of Marshall Aid?</P>
    <P>May I refer to one or two points made by Senator O'Brien?  He offered us this evening a further apology for changing his views on certain matters. I have on occasions in this House expressed my admiration for Senator O'Brien.  Some people at one time thought it strange when I stood up in this House to defend him.  The Senator <Col N="395" /> is a man for whom I have very great admiration.  May I say that some of the statements he made here this evening surprised me?  He mentioned that if the Banking Commission had visualised the changes that did come about shortly after 1938 it would have made somewhat different recommendations. All I can say is that I never felt more satisfied, never felt happier, that the Fianna Fáil Government was in power at the time the commission made its recommendations.  I am glad the Government refused to accept in general the recommendations of the commission.</P>
    <P>I am glad that we had a Government in office at that time which was careful to study the conditions that were developing all around.  I am glad that we had a Government which realised what was happening throughout the world; I am glad we had a Government which understood that an emergency was developing, and that it should take steps to meet that emergency.  I am glad that the Government was able to see, in a much clearer light than the Banking Commission of that day, what was happening, and what was likely to happen.  I wonder have circumstances changed so much since 1938.</P>
    <P>After all, what was the object of Government policy and expenditure that was condemned by the Banking Commission?  It was to provide housing for the people, to provide food, to provide a more extensive telephone system, and to expand industry in order that we might check emigration. The object was to divide the land and so settle as many people as possible back on it, even to the extent of taking over ranches in certain areas and transferring the unfortunate people from congested areas.  That was the aim then.  Senator O'Brien holds that that was the aim of the present Government.  I do not dispute that.</P>
    <P>He said that what troubled them at the time was the balance of payments. The balance of payments is not yet in equilibrium.  It is true that it has been overhauled to some degree.  What exactly the difference is at the moment it is hard to say.  For last year, it was £10,000,000 or £12,000,000, but let <Col N="396" /> us not forget that two of the big items appearing in the balance of payments amount to approximately £50,000,000. One of them is the income from external investments, amounting to £17,000,000 or £18,000,000 in the year. Should anything happen to these, what is likely to be the result?  Maybe &mdash;we will not go into it in detail now&mdash; that, by repatriating these external assets, we would be able to do better with them than is being done at the moment.  We may be able to bring about a situation where the income of £18,000,000 which we are enjoying at the moment would not be needed.  For my part, I do not see clearly, as a result of Government policy, how that state of affairs is going to be brought about.</P>
    <P>The other item in the balance of payments is one of rather doubtful stability or continuity, the income from tourist traffic.  Last year, it amounted to about £33,000,000, and it has been indicated that we may not get as much from that traffic this year. It has been indicated to us that various opportunities for travel and enjoyment have opened up.  Conditions are improving on the Continent and our encouragement of the tourist trade is not of a type that would convince one that the traffic we have known in the past will continue and will expand. The aid being made available for the development and expansion of this traffic, to my mind, is totally inadequate, and, in fact, there is a danger of our losing to a considerable extent this valuable traffic in the years to come.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that the balance of payments was a cause of trouble to the Banking Commission in 1938 and ought to be a cause of trouble at present.  What I have been wondering is to what extent conditions have changed as between 1938 and 1950 that would justify a denunciation of Government policy in 1938 and a bouquet for Government policy at present, seeing that the aims of 1938 were much the same as the aims of 1950 and that the means of achieving these aims were to a considerable extent the same.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien mentioned, in criticism of Senator Quirke, that he <Col N="397" /> did not think we should frame our peace-time policy on the basis that war may come.  It is hard to fall out with that, but nevertheless it is something that requires careful examination. Every thinking person will agree that the world is in a very troubled and uncertain state.  We know that other Governments are uneasy as to what is likely to happen in the future, immediate or somewhat remote.</P>
    <P>We know that, in Europe and in the United States, that uneasiness is felt to a considerable extent and these nations feel they ought to base their policies, economic, political and national, on the basis that emergency conditions may develop.  We seem to be the one people who feel that we ought to let that possibility go to the devil; that the best way to prepare for an emergency is to disregard it altogether.  That may be an unfair interpretation of what Senator O'Brien has said, but, if it is, all I can say is that, the point having been made, it should not have been left at that, but should have been expanded.  I agree with Senator Quirke that it is very unwise on our part to disregard the signs that are to be read.  I think it is very unwise on our part, in the matter of military defence and in the matter of economic and social defence, to shut our eyes to the extent to which we have shut them to the realities of the situation.</P>
    <P>There is just one final point, now that the Minister has returned.  His parting shot to-day was to read a quotation from a speech delivered by Deputy Lemass.  May I say that, so far as I am concerned and so far as the Fianna Fáil Party are concerned, the aims of the Government in the matter of social security, national economic development and so on are aims which have our benediction, but I think the most important duty of the Minister and his Government at present is to explain to us and to the people why they have changed their minds on these matter within the past two or three years?  Speaking in the Dáil at column 2274 of Volume 104 of the Official Debates, the Minister said::&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We can build roads until the <Col N="398" /> country is riddled with straight, terraced roads.  Do we add to production? Only very remotely, very indirectly.  We hear of telephone extensions, putting this country on a par with Sweden, one of the greatest telephone-using nations in the world. What do we want it for?  How much money is to be spent on telephone extensions?  Will it get any more consumer goods produced in the country?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I might go through the list and say with regard to national schools, secondary schools, vocational schools and so on: are they getting any more consumer goods in production?</P>

      <P>What I am asking is that the Minister, when he gets his opportunity, would investigate the matter for us and explain to us, for instance, why telephone development was of such doubtful value in 1947, and of such tremendous possibilities at the present time.  For the rest, I think we can wait until we get the other Stages of the Bill.  As I said, there is very little in the Minister's speech this evening that one could talk about.  Be that as it may, I want to say that I am not thrilled with the Bill, that I, like the members of the Trade Union Congress, the members of the Congress of Irish Unions, the members of the professional associations and the members of the Federation of Industries and everybody else, am thoroughly dissatisfied with the Bill presented to us this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker, I think, on three occasions, complained that there was very little in the Minister's speech which he could talk about.  I cannot say the same about the Senator's speech.  If one were to follow it in detail, it would also take about the same length of time, but I do not propose to compete with him, as far as the first portion of his speech is concerned, in what he called, I think, biting remarks.  I do not believe that it is either for the benefit of this House or of the country that we should be super-sensitive about <Col N="399" /> Party matters or criticisms, and that we should spend the time of the House on a Finance Bill, talking of the benefits, want of benefits, or failures of political Parties in the past.  We must, no matter what Party is in power, have a Budget.  It is a very practical matter.  I have never listened to a Budget that satisfied me, and I never expect to.  That is, possibly, because my Party loyalty is not good enough to make me believe that any Minister will produce a perfect Budget, just because I happen to support him.  The latter part of the Senator's speech dealt with a number of matters which seemed to me to be relevant to the Budget and to the Bill.  I propose to refer to one or two of these.  In the first place, he made a rather extraordinary statement, to my mind, when he said that the aim of rationing was that everyone should get an equal amount.  If so, why not ration fur coats, gold watches and motor cars?</P>
      <P>The aim of rationing should be to provide that the less wealthy portion of the community will get what they need at as reasonable and at as low a price as practicable.  If the Senator thinks that rations which are subsidised are not sufficient, that would be, I think, a proper and correct argument, but he did not even confine himself to that.  I am not sure that he stated it.  He said we should stop rationing and let everbody buy as much as they want at subsidised prices.  That means that the richer people, who can buy all the tea and bread they want, are able to get these extra quantities at prices which the whole community will pay for by way of subsidy; that is, that the poor will have to pay for the extra price of these commodities for the rich.  I think it would be an entirely false position, if we should have unrationed commodities which are subsidised.  The wise thing to do is to find the adequate quantity, pay your subsidy on that and let the rest be available at the market price.  It may be arguable as to whether the quantity is adequate or not.  It may be arguable one way or the other.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally disagree with <Col N="400" /> the suggestion that the proper way is to remove rationing, keep on the subsidies and let everybody buy as much as they want.  I found in England and elsewhere, when I was asked about the rationing system we have here, that quite a number of people seemed to think it was an eminently suitable way to deal with it.  It may not be perfect as to the quantities, but it is the proper way to deal with it.  Remember, no matter what system of taxation is devised, the poorer people pay their share of it.  In that connection, I would like to remind the House that income-tax is only partially a tax on income.  It is a tax on personal income, but it is also a tax on production and distribution, in so far as it is a tax on industry.  It is simply an addition to the costs.  The deduction on dividends is a tax on income, but the rest of it, that is, a tax on profits which are not paid out, simply prevents these profits being available for reduced prices and is paid by the user in some form or other.  In that way, the poorest who buy various commodities which are manufactured in this country pay some share of the income-tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is very little that Senator Ó Buachalla has said with regard to the need for a revision of the methods of taxation on industry, and the need of what used to be called concessions, that I did not say when I was on that side of the House.  The only difference was that I said then, and I say again, now, that I do not believe any Minister for Finance will ever be able in a Budget statement to make the necessary revisions in the method of assessing&mdash;not so much assessing&mdash;as the necessary revisions in the income-tax law which are desirable, because it is impracticable to do that in any one Budget.  I urged, when the previous Government was in power, and I urged the present Minister, and I urge him again, now, that he should set up a committee to examine into the whole question, with a view to seeing whether it is not possible to devise wiser and better methods of assessing income-tax.  Now, personally, I think, that as far as income-tax generally is concerned; that is, tax on <Col N="401" /> income, that there will be certain adjustments which will be found advisable but, in the main, I do not think there will be very much change.  I think, when it comes to a tax on profits on trade and industry, that it should be substituted by a profits tax, that the income-tax should only be applicable to the profits paid out.  A profits tax should take its place, and should be based on the actual profits as shown in the balance sheet given by the company to the public as passed by any competent firm of auditors.  It would probably be a higher tax, but it would be a tax on actual profit, not a tax on income-tax profits, which do not make adequate provision for reserves. I do not want to develop this at length. I did say all this two years ago, and if anybody is interested, they can read my speech.  I do not suppose anybody will.</P>
    <P>The need for increased expenditure on defence has been dealt with briefly by Senator Ó Buachalla and Senator Hawkins and at considerable length by Senator Quirke, who quoted the plans for additional expenditure in a number of countries, including several smaller countries.  He gave us the figures for one.  Frankly, the figure amazed me. He assured me he was correct and he was satisfied that the figure referred to pounds.  The figure is £135,000,000 for three years for Norway.  I happen to know that the last census figures showed the population of Norway at between 50,000 and 100,000 less than the population of the Twenty-Six Counties. It is proposed that they should spend £45,000,000 per annum on defence and presumably Senator Quirke thinks we should spend the same amount.  How any of the concessions which Senator Ó Buachalla thinks should be made, including those which I would like to see given in an easement with regard to the lower income groups, if this country is now to spend even half of £45,000,000 in increased expenditure on defence, I do not know.</P>
    <P>Even apart from that, what really is the position?  There is a war being waged at the present moment, which is sometimes called the cold war.  It is a war between the totalitarian idealism in the shape of Communism and the ideals of democracy and freedom. <Col N="402" /> That war we are in, there is no neutrality in it and if there were we would not want to be neutral.  How is that war to be dealt with?  It is part of the planned policy of the totalitarian Communist States that they will be able so to scare the democratic nations by a fear of war that they will get them to spend so much money that the conditions of their people will be lowered, that the standard of living will be lowered and that as a result it will not be necessary to have a real war because the cold war will be won, by an increase of Communism.  You cannot have it both ways.  If we are going to play our part in the battle for democracy and freedom in this country, it will have to be by development and by improving the conditions of our people.  We cannot do that and also spend millions on defence and we have to choose between them.  I would rather that we should play our part in winning the cold war and take the risk as to where we will be if the other war reaches us, rather than make our people miserable and lower our conditions in the hope that £45,000,000 would keep us out of the war.  If we spent £100,000,000, we would not have a guarantee that it would keep us out of it.</P>
    <P>If we keep our heads and act sensibly, and refuse to panic and if we try to use our resources for the betterment of our own people and the development of the country, we will place this country in as good a position as we can to meet an emergency if it comes.  If we put all our money into defence, to create an army, as Senator Quirke said, &ldquo;to meet all comers,&rdquo; we could not create an army that could meet all comers.  Let us get a balanced, sane point of view and let us not play into the hands of the Communists and totalitarians by allowing ourselves to be scared into an expenditure which would be ruinous and probably futile.</P>

      <P>Like my colleague, Senator Douglas, my contribution will be short.  During the debate, we had lengthy references to politics and personalities and some interesting references to economics.  May I suggest that we should approach this from the point of view that the present taxation <Col N="403" /> figures before us, which this Bill is intended to legalise, have now reached fantastic heights and may be described &mdash;I hope no one will call me a pessimist&mdash;as of abnormal buoyancy?  We have to congratulate ourselves on the buoyancy of our finances, but who can say that that buoyancy will continue? This Bill is based on the assumption that we will be faced with a continuation of that remarkable flexibility of our finance, encouraging revenue returns, that alone will justify taxation on the present scale.</P>
      <P>At the risk of being called a heretic, I am going to draw an analogy between the position in which we, as a nation, find ourselves and that in which a corporation would find itself if it came to the point where expenses were getting out of hand.  Business is regarded as a science and there are concerns specialising in scientific business management and getting large fees for going into businesses to effect economies that even the owners of those businesses hitherto did not think possible.  I suggest that we have seen our Government costs grow bigger and bigger.  I do not mean that as any reflection on the present Government.  They have inherited a thing that has got bigger since they came in.  We have in this country a system of Government where I have no doubt if business experts could go in, no matter what fee they got, they could effect economies and bring down this unproductive load which is crippling the community, whether industrial or agricultural.</P>
      <P>In regard to industrial machinery depreciation, I will content myself with saying that the business community generally feel that the Minister has not paid heed to the representations made to him by organisations, federations and chambers of commerce.  These proposals would mean that he would at least put business on the same basis as in Britain with regard to wear and tear on machinery.</P>

      <P>The House can judge.  Huge organisations&mdash;and they are no fools, no matter what the Minister may think&mdash;have considered they are living under handicaps <i>vis-á-vis</i> their competitors in Great Britain and elsewhere.  They have put up the case that they are less favoured than their competitors in Great Britain and elsewhere. Industrialists have been continually pilloried to produce as good and as cheap goods as produced elsewhere. That is a fallacious contention. The conditions in this country are not the same as in those countries from which goods are dumped in here.  We get a little tired when people harp on efficiency and when we are then asked to operate on obsolete machinery while the others work on depreciation figures that are three or four times as great.

      <P>That is what you will get.  You were asked to give them some relief but you did not give them relief.  Industry is facing a tough time and it should be given conditions comparable with the conditions in the countries from which goods are coming in here.  I have no intention of going into a wide and lengthy survey but there are a lot of things in this Finance Bill which a lot of people think should be remedied.  Some of them were dealt with in the other House and there were some that were not dealt with.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the 5 per cent. stamp duty on domestic property transfers.  There are people who think that that was a bad tax when it was first imposed and that it has not improved with age and that it should have been remedied in this Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to pleasure motoring but we have a less percentage of pleasure motoring in this country than in any country on the face of the globe.  Motoring has become a necessity of life and you are operating with a horse-power taxation which was introduced originally in England in order to kill the American car, and it has been dropped in its original form. We have not only maintained that tax, but in the Supplementary Budget of two or three years ago it was increased until to-day you have the fact that on a car, say a 15-horse-power car, you are paying £26 a year road tax.  That is merely for owning a vehicle.  In addition to that, I wonder does the world at large know that on petrol alone there is ½ tax, with 1½d. tax on alcohol, making a tax of 1/3½ a gallon.  If a car does 16 miles to a gallon, it means that you are paying 1d. a mile petrol tax in addition to the heavy road tax which is there whether you use the vehicle or not.  The Irish Motor Traders' Organisation gave a lot of thought to this matter, got the figures and submitted a scheme to the <Col N="406" /> previous Government whereby there would be a small registration fee and the rest of the revenue would be got in petrol tax.  Obviously, the higher powered the vehicle, the more petrol it would use and the more tax the owner would pay.</P>
    <P>The present system, we contend, is inequitable.  It is also a very elastic tax; it is one of the few taxes which the present Minister for Finance or any other Minister for Finance can impose which is growing.  The increase in motoring in the country with the ordinary type of car, buses and so on means that there is a high increase in the tax on petrol.  The tax is going up continually in its volume.  We have submitted, and I again urge on the Minister, that before the commencement of another calendar year he might think it time to introduce in this country a system of taxation on motor vehicles which would be suited to our needs and not to the needs of a neighbouring country which has considerably reduced its original system of motor taxation.</P>
    <P>Those are the two or three points with which I intended to deal.  I had no intention of making a long contribution to this debate, and I am rather surprised that the Minister was so hasty in regard to a matter which he knows by heart.  He has had representations from the representative bodies to which I have referred, and if that is his form of debate it is one of which I am not very much enamoured.  I do not know whether it was due to bad manners or whether he was feeling uncomfortable because when he was asked to do something he did not do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBurke" hpid="Mr. R.M. Burke Mr. R.M. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of persons have complained about the size of the Budget.  Personally, I think&mdash;and this is not only my view, but the view of a good many people with whom I have discussed it&mdash;that the amount of the Budget is not by any means too large, and that the country can well afford to spend the amount which it is proposed to spend, during the coming year, but that the way the money is raised might be improved.  I believe that too much of the burden of taxation falls on the poorer sections of the <Col N="407" /> community.  That is nothing new; that has been the case for the last 25 years; that has been the case, I suppose, since any system of taxation started in any civilised country, but gradually improvements are being brought about.  I believe that conditions are better now than they were in years gone by, but we still have a long way to go before the burden of taxation is really equitably shared.</P>
      <P>Some people have complained about the size of the capital Budget.  There again, I believe that as a nation, we could afford to spend even more than the amount proposed.  At the same time, I think it is only right to give credit where credit is due, and congratulate the Government on being willing to spend that amount, in view of the fact that it is a much larger amount than has been spent in the past years, and because the spending of that money will enable a large amount of really useful work to be done which will benefit the people of the country.  Many of us would be opposed to it if we felt that this money would be squandered, or spent in foolish ways, but I believe that most of the money will be spent in giving useful employment, which will mean less emigration and the raising of the standard of living of the community, especially the poorer sections of it.</P>
      <P>Some people may ask what justification I have for saying that.  Let me give, therefore, a very brief summary of how the money is to be spent.  About £34,000,000 is to be spent on capital development during the coming year, and of that sum housing will receive £14,000,000; agricultural development, which should bring about increased agricultural output, £6,000,000; electrical development, £4,750,000; transport, £1,750,000; public health services and hospitals, £1,500,000; turf development, £1,500,000; schools, other public buildings and afforestation, £1,500,000. Those are some of the main headings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that all of that expenditure will be of benefit to the community.  I think it is quite right that most of this money should be spent on housing and slum clearance, especially on providing houses for the poorer sections <Col N="408" /> of the community, those who are living in appalling conditions at the present time.  I do not approve of the spending of money on building huge mansions for people who are well off, but when it is spent on small houses for the people who are urgently in need of houses, it is well-spent money.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be desirable to detain the House by going into great detail on what might have been done many years ago, but, at the same time, we can learn a certain amount from the mistakes of the past.  I believe that more money should have been spent during the years 1922 to 1939, at a time when very large numbers of people were living in slums and in poverty, and when large amounts of money were invested abroad.  There were some people, private individuals, as well as the State, who did sell out foreign investments, and who spent this money on building houses for persons with small incomes, and they did not regret it. Houses were built before 1939 at half the cost, and less than half the cost in some cases, of what they can be built for to-day, and that was money well spent.  However, that is all past history, and I do not think there is any advantage in dwelling on it at great length.  We can learn from it that it would be better to spend money now on houses for the people, and on giving them productive work, than to wait for some future date when costs may be even higher, and it would also be better to build now, on account of the human suffering which would be caused to the unfortunate people who would have to wait for several years before houses would be built for them.  With regard to those people who say that a world war is inevitable, I do not believe that.  I think war is not inevitable.  The Christian people of every nation should try to co-operate to prevent war, and I think it is quite possible to prevent war.  Moreover, a practical way of bringing about the better social conditions which we desire would be, as Senator Douglas has said, to spend more money on improving the housing of the people and on slum-clearance, rather than on <Col N="409" /> building up armaments.  We should also raise the standard of living and spend more on blind pensions and similar social services, which would do far more good than the spending of money on armaments.</P>
    <P>Then, again, we should try to bring about more equitable distribution of taxation.  It should bear more heavily on those who can well afford to pay. There are many people still who have huge incomes.  There are many people who are still making excessive profits and who could well afford to pay more in taxation.  There should be less of a burden on people with small incomes. I know that there is a certain number of well-off people who would be perfectly willing to pay more in taxation, provided others did the same.  If others in a similar position had to do the same there are people in this country who would gladly pay more in income-tax, surtax and death duties. I know people who have willingly and voluntarily paid more in taxation than they need have done, because they felt that the money was being well spent and that they were doing something useful for the country and to help the needy.</P>
    <P>If we write a cheque to the Revenue Commissioners or the rate collector, we should regard it in the same manner, to a certain extent, as if we were writing a cheque to a charitable institution.  We should do it with pleasure.  It is money which is being used to help the old age pensioner, the blind, and the widow.  A great deal of the money that the Minister for Finance spends is as well spent as the money that is spent by any charitable institution.  It is spent on helping the poor, and, as Christian people, those who can afford it should gladly and willingly pay more in taxation, but people with small incomes should not be expected to pay more, because heavy indirect taxation and rates are already causing too much hardship on them, and the result is that they have to do without necessaries of life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to <Col N="410" /> the matter of the rate of interest, I do not intend to go into detail on that subject.  I spoke on that matter on previous occasions.  It would be interesting if the Minister would give us his views on experiments that have been made in other countries for raising money for State capital expenditure at lower rates of interest, especially those that were carried out some years ago in New Zealand. Senator O'Brien has mentioned some ways in which money could be obtained at a lower rate of interest.  He mentioned certain types of investment where the rate of interest would be 2½ per cent., or less.  These matters deserve consideration because, if money could be got at lower rates of interest, houses could be built and let more cheaply to persons with small incomes.</P>
      <P>As a Christian country, we should endeavour to do as much as we possibly can to help our fellow-citizens who, through no fault of their own, are unable to provide adequately for themselves.  I refer in particular to such people as old age pensioners, widows and the blind.  We should do all in our power to persuade the public to show their willingness to do more in future for this section of the community. I admit that more is being done for them now than was done in the past, but far more should be done for them and, as a nation, we could well afford to do more.</P>
      <P>In all these things our principal aim should be to try to bring about a more just and more Christian social order, to abolish, as far as possible, extremes of wealth and poverty, and to arrange that, no matter what our national income may be, or may become in the future, that income will be fairly and justly spread over the whole community. If we did that, we would have a happier country, a more progressive country, and, above all, it would be in accordance with Christian principles.</P>

      <P>I have listened each year since I came into this House to speeches on the Finance Bill.  Year after year, the doom of the nation is foretold because of what the Minister for Finance proposes to do.  Yet, year <Col N="411" /> after year, we somehow escape the doom.  When I was very young as a Parliamentarian and very innocent as a Senator, I remember being told that we would die of hunger because there would not be enough oatmeal.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently they have got used to doing without it but they survived.  They were to die because they did not get it.  Then we were to die because white bread was put on the market.  This year, I think, we are to die because somebody suggested that if we cannot get back rashers we might eat pig's cheek.  I cannot reconcile all these prophecies and recommendations.</P>
      <P>I have heard it deplored here that we have 400,000 acres less under tillage than we had.  I assume that the argument, logically carried out, would mean that we ought to go on and on increasing tillage until every available acre was tilled.  Then you would have neither cattle, cows, hens nor pigs. You would have nothing but potatoes and salt.  Is it that we are to be driven back to living on potatoes and salt? I am not saying that these things are to be taken seriously but they are put up seriously here for consideration during debates.</P>
      <P>I have heard it deplored to-night that the poor are handicapped because there are two prices.  Senator Douglas gave as an example that fur coats and gold watches are rationed.  What would happen if you had not the subsidies for food?  Is it seriously suggested that we should reduce taxation by removing that subsidy?  Then you would have only one price for all the food but it would be a price that the poor could not pay, a price that the rich could pay.  You would have rationing then, rationing by means, rationing by poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, everybody is guaranteed a reasonable allowance of essential foodstuff, at a subsidised price.  If <Col N="412" /> anybody wants more than that, he can buy it at a higher price.  I have heard it said that it is the poor who buy most of the commodities at the higher price. I do not believe that.  I think I am in closer touch with the poor than some of the people who at times profess to speak for them in this House.  I know that poor families, the families that people get up and weep about in the Dáil and Seanad, who have six or eight children, get their ration of tea, butter and sugar for the child of three months, just the same as for an adult.  My experience is that, where there are several children in a family, the family has a superabundance of rationed tea and sometimes of subsidised butter.  I am not saying that that is wrong. Maybe they should eat less butter and drink less tea.</P>
    <P>The arguments are not sensible arguments. If we are supposed to be sensible people, we ought to try to have reasoned arguments here.  It does no good to pretend that the country is on the verge of starvation.  It does no good to pretend that the country is being overtaxed.  When I was a journalist, I remember reading and having to write, much against my conscience, that this country was overtaxed, that every year the burden was becoming unbearable.  It was always unbearable, but was becoming more unbearable every year.  Always, the country survived and the people who complained were the people who had the biggest incomes in this country.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke has referred to the difference in taxation.  He says the poor pay the greater part of the taxation in this country.  I am more revolutionary than he is.  The poor pay the whole of the taxation.  They pay the supertax; they pay the tax on petrol; they pay the tax on the expensive motor cars; they pay every tax because, if there were not poor people working for small wages, there would not be any surplus for employers, there would not be any profits for companies, there would be nothing out of which to pay taxation.  It affects me in that way.  Out of everything I buy, somebody has got his piece of income-tax.  Somebody's supertax comes out of it, and somebody's <Col N="413" /> motor car comes out of it, and, if I have to eat pig's cheek, somebody's back rashers came out of it, strange as it may seem.</P>
    <P>One matter which has been discussed, and I wonder if it is relevant at all, is this talk about preparing for another war.  How are we to spend more money on defence in this country?  At one moment, we are told that we are collecting too much in taxation, and, the next moment, it is suggested that we should spend untold additional millions on defence. How is it to be spent?  Are the huge atomic weapons, the scientific war weapons, available merely for the asking, to be bought if we had the millions? Are they to be got any time, if we had the money on tap, and, if they were available, what good would they be without the men?  Is it argued that we ought to put 500,000 or 250,000 additional men into the Army, that we ought to increase the personnel of the Army and merely keep them parading around, drilling and preparing for a war that may never come?</P>
    <P>How does that measure up with the arguments for economy?  If we are to put another 100,000, 200,000 or 500,000 men into the Defence Forces to prepare for another war, who is going to feed them, clothe them and provide them with accommodation?  Who is going to pay for the weapons which may never be used?  Will that number of people not then be taken from productive industry and put into unproductive occupations and will taxation not have to go up, and, if it does, why complain when it is put up?  If there is a war, we will always have the men.  Whenever there was trouble, we always had the men, even when we had not the weapons.  If we had the men and the money to-day, we have no guarantee that we would get the weapons and there is not any immediate prospect that I can see of another war.  My guess is as good or as bad as anybody else's, but I have heard people cry, &ldquo;Wolf, wolf,&rdquo; so often year after year that now, when they begin to cry, &ldquo;Bear,&rdquo; I am not a bit frightened.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> If there is to be a war and if we are to prepare for a war, ought we to be importing motor-cars and ought we to be importing agricultural machinery?  Will they run without petrol and oil?  I have been asked where will the wheat come from, if there is another war.  I would do without bread and I have often done without it, if I could get potatoes and other things; but what will you do if you cannot get petrol?  There are very few horses in the country and there will be fewer, and if we were logical and preparing for another war, we should see that we were not dependent on outside sources for our petrol, because then there will be a reduction in tillage not of 400,000 acres but of 1,000,000 acres, because there will be no way of tilling them.  I am not arguing for or against any of these things, but, as a back-bencher, to whom, presumably, the arguments are addressed, I am wondering what I am expected to think when I cannot reconcile the things said to me.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has found a way of closing the loophole by which there was evasion of the stamp duty. I got into great trouble for talking about the stamp duty before, because I said I thought it was a dangerous thing to have foreigners buying up this country and carrying out another conquest by cheque book.  A lot of people abused me, but they would be surprised by the number of people who agreed with me.  There must have been a great many people trying to buy up this country when solicitors and lawyers and house agents went to such trouble to find loopholes to enable them to buy it up at &ldquo;cut&rdquo; prices.  I am glad that, if they do buy it up, they have to pay the full price.  The Minister has said there is very little land being bought by foreigners, but I do not accept that.  Very little as compared with what?</P>
    <P>Coming to the corner of Grafton Street to-day on my way to the Seanad, I passed the hoarding of an English insurance company and painted up on that hoarding in large letters is the statement that that company alone has invested £4,000,000 in the purchase of houses, businesses and land in this <Col N="415" /> country in the past few years.  That is an English company investing money.  I will be told that the money has been advanced to Irish people to buy their houses and shops.  Maybe it has, and, in the main, it has, I believe, but for that £4,000,000 that English insurance company invested, they will get back £8,000,000 because the rate of interest spread over the years will give them back their capital twice over.  I know it to my cost, because I have had to buy houses through these companies and, if you borrow £1,000, you will pay back £2,000; and, in any case, although it is Senator Ó Buachalla, myself and any other Senator who may nominally be the purchaser of the house, until the last instalment is paid on the house, which may not be for 30 years, the English insurance company owns it.  Look at it how you like, that one company alone has advanced £4,000,000 for the purchase of property in this country and that company is the actual owner of £4,000,000 worth of property in this country, acquired in the past few years, although it is nominally held by Irish citizens.</P>

      <P>Irish companies get the same, but at least the Irish company has Irish shareholders and the money remains in Irish hands.  Any day that English company's money can be transferred to England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one more reference I want to make to this buying of places by non-nationals.  I have no objection to Englishmen in their own country. They are very likeable people, I am sure, in their own country.  Unlike the Irish, who were always loved when they went abroad, the English were always disliked when they went abroad, whether they came here or went to India, Egypt or anywhere else.  They were the most likeable people in the world when they stayed at home and most objectionable when they went adventuring.  Some of these people are buying up this country now, because, for one reason or another, they think it a good investment. I have evidence of one man <Col N="416" /> who bought 1,400 acres of the best land in the country, land which is not too far from Dublin.  Those 1,400 acres would house a good many Irish families.  On these 1,400 acres he employs seven farm labourers and three of them he brought from England.  Even if they were all Irish, he employs one farm labourer on every 200 acres.  I wonder what amount of wheat he is going to produce.  I wonder what good he is going to do this country.</P>
    <P>I think there is a danger and I am glad the Minister has closed the loophole and has retained the tax.  It is not because I have any personal hatred of Britishers or any other people, but I think we should safeguard ourselves against having the country bought from under our feet.  The thing can become a menace in this country. They are not allowed to take their money from Great Britain to-day and buy up France, America or the Argentine. They can only buy within the sterling area and we happen to be the only place within the sterling area where it seems worth their while coming to live.  We are still treated by these people as a British colony or British shire and it is that which makes me so resentful&mdash;that, no matter what we call ourselves, despite all we have done here and despite the fact that the British Government and every foreign Government in the world recognises us as the Republic of Ireland, these people with cheque books can still ignore everything we have done from 1916 down to to-day, to go no further back than 1916, and by the mere writing of a few words on a scrap of paper and presenting a cheque to the bank, can treat us still as a colony and that we took no defensive measures until the previous Government imposed the stamp duty.  If we do not retain that stamp duty, if we do not do something even more drastic, we will leave it too long.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has retained it and this gives me the opportunity to refer to some of the statements published in reply to my remarks here. A whole host of anonymous letters appeared in some of the newspapers <Col N="417" /> pointing out that everything I said was unjustifiable, and insisting that the Britishers who came here were buying up the land which the Irish farmers were too lazy or too incompetent to till and manage, that they bought up nothing but derelict estates and dilapidated houses.  That is not so.  It may be a good argument for a newspaper when you write anonymously, but it is not true.  A typical case was the case I quoted of the man who bought 1,400 acres of the best land in the country and put seven labourers to work on it. He bought no derelict estate.  He got good value for his money, and he is safe and will not complain about the income-tax, or about any of the things we complain about, the things we make all the fuss about while ignoring the really essential problems to which we should be attending.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to some of the speeches made by Opposition Senators.  It is an old dodge, which comes down to us from Roman times, when you have no policy, to engage in war.  It seems to me to-day that the Opposition have been devoid of any constructive or even destructive criticism of the Bill and they had to bring in here the old cry of war, hoping in that way to engender some of the enthusiasm which war always seems to engender amongst the young and unthinking sections of the community.  The people of this country in 1950 are rather too enlightened to be bothered by that type of propaganda. It is certainly an appeal to the emotions rather than to reason and I believe it will fall upon deaf ears.  I was delighted with what Senator Douglas said about its being better for us to win the cold war and it shows that some people in this country have been affected by Russian propaganda which is designed to divert our attention from our economic problems, from the Marshall Plan, the land rehabilitation project and the production of food and wealth from the land in a way that was never done before.  No one in this country will give any heed to the suggestions made by these people to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ó Buachalla said that one of the things we ought to do here was <Col N="418" /> to grow more wheat and cut down our purchases from dollar areas.  What we should do is to export more to dollar areas, because anything we send to the dollar areas at present, we can sell at a very high price, which will give us an opportunity of buying things in the dollar areas at cheap prices.  It is an advantage which is not adequately realised in this country.  Irish goods are being sold in New York to people who can afford to buy them because they can get them at reasonable prices, and we are getting dollars for them, and can buy back products more cheaply and beneficially than we could if there had been no devaluation.  If we make the same use of our trade here, and get the cooperation we should get, I believe that we would be able to develop a good business in America, and I must congratulate the Government on getting so many able men to help in planning for dollar exports.</P>
    <P>It has been put to me that the tax on dances ought to be imposed in units of 3d rather than units of 1/-.  The present system is to place a tax of 1/- on every 4/- admission price, and, for practical purposes, it means that you can have only a 4/- dance, plus tax&mdash; full admission 5/- or a 10/- dance.  It was brought to my attention recently that in many cases the Government would make a good deal more money out of the tax, if they facilitated the dance halls by having the tax in units of 3d.  One dance hall proprietor told me that he would have charged for a big dance on St. Stephen's night 7/6, and that, if there were 1,000 people at the dance, the Government would have got in £25 more and, I think he said, an additional £25 in income-tax.  That meant that the Government by imposing the tax in units of 3d would have derived from one dance in one hall in the country £50 additional in respect of entertainment and income-tax.  I commend it to the Minister as a proper approach to an easing of the problem. Anyone who ever went to a dance knows that there must be some difference between a 5/- and a 10/- dance, and between a ? and a 5/- dance.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the other House said that, if a good case were put up to <Col N="419" /> him which would not cost too much, he might consider giving relief, and I have been asked to make an appeal on behalf of widows who are living on unearned income.  I think the Minister ought to allow these widows the earned income relief.  This is a Christian country, where it is the duty of a woman to bring up her family and look after her home.  If her husband dies and leaves her some money, arising from an insurance policy or from savings he had accumulated, the State ought not to say to that woman, &ldquo;You must pay the full rate of tax on that money.&rdquo;  That woman ought to get the one-fifth earned income allowance as if she were working for somebody else, because she has the duty entrusted to her by God of bringing up her children properly.  I believe the number of people affected is not large, because many widows, the widows of farmers and business people, get the earned income relief.  It affects mainly the middle-salaried classes and the middle professional classes, and I think the Minister, with the small surplus he has in the Budget, has enough to grant this small relief.</P>
    <P>With regard to what Senator O'Farrell has said about the property tax, I believe it ought to be increased on non-nationals.  The 5 per cent. tax in respect of Irish nationals ought to be reduced, because it is good and beneficial that there should be a greater distribution of ownership, and, if a person wants to buy something from another, the State ought not to take 5 per cent. of it, merely because property is being transferred from one citizen to another.  The loss in revenue could be made up by increasing the tax on non-nationals coming in here.</P>
    <P>I want to refer also to what Senator Summerfield said with regard to other reliefs.  It is a problem for all people engaged in business to-day to provide adequately for machinery which is worn out or which has become obsolete, in view of increased costs since 1938. The problem arises in Britain and here.</P>

      <P>Writing in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 28th May, Mr. Norman Crump, the editor, quoted Mr. Stewart Allen, president of the Incorporated Society of Accountants, and said that what they should do in England was to introduce what he called the price level reserve.  In this article, he says that, in 50 years, in Britain the price had gone up 350 per cent.  He says that the price in Britain has gone up by 350 per cent. and therefore that it is necessary, if industry is to maintain its structure intact, that they should set aside each year a certain amount of money equivalent to 14 per cent. of the assets to preserve the industry against the continuous depreciation in money which takes place.  I draw this to the attention of the Minister, because I was elected as an industrial Senator, and I believe that all matters appertaining to industry that I feel are for the permanent benefit of industry, ought to be mentioned.  If industrialists get money, and put it in industry, they are benefiting other people as well as themselves.  It benefits employers, it is a benefit to local taxation, and it is a benefit to State taxation.  If it is for the export trade, it is going to benefit everybody in the country.  If we wake up some day, and they wake up in Britain, and they find that the imposition of taxation was too heavy on industry, then it will be too late. I believe that what people who are qualified to speak, like this man I quoted, Mr. Stewart Allen, say should be considered, and ought to be answered by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I say that I believe that the standard of prosperity in this country, the general standard of prosperity among all the people, is greater than it ever has been before in the history of this State.  A parish priest said to me a week ago, that the difficulty of his little church in the country was to find enough space for the <Col N="421" /> farmers to park their cars.  It is much better that there is a complaint about farmers having cars, than a complaint about industrialists having the cars. If we have sufficient prosperity in the country, we are bound to have prosperity in the towns, and we are bound to have wide prosperity among all sections of the community.  It is to the small farmer that the greatest measure of prosperity is arising.  A farmer said to me, not longer than a week ago, that he got more for the clip of the wool off his mountain sheep this year than he got for his mountain sheep and wool 15 years ago.  That is a considerable improvement for the people living on the marginal lands, the people that some of us hoped would not have to leave agriculture, and sell their land to the Forestry Department.  These people are being paid anything from £8 to £12 for a dropped calf.  It is not so long since 8/- to 12/- was as much as they could get for the same calf.  While there may be some sections of the community, for whom redress will have to be made to redress the balance, particularly after the turmoil of a war, I believe we have greater prosperity than ever we had before, and all we have to do is to hope that it continues. Finally, I must make some reference to what Senator Professor O'Brien has said to us on the question of State borrowing.  I think it was one of the finest contributions that was made on that subject by a member of either House for some time past.  The burden of his remarks was, that if we could short-date loans, the Minister for Finance would have an opportunity of borrowing money at a much lower interest rate than it has been borrowed in the past.  It has been tried in Britain.  Britain, I believe, has a 3 per cent. defence bond, of which they only issue £1,000 worth to each person, and one cannot make the first withdrawal except on six months' notice.</P>
    <P>That is the type of loan that may appeal to the farmers of this country; in fact, it is possible that the Minister may even get money on short term in this country at 2 per cent.  A farmer might want to settle his sons or daughters, but he does not want to lend money to any Minister for <Col N="422" /> Finance for ten or 15 years.  He may lend it for a year or two, because his children are not grown up, and he will not want it.  I think the Minister could get millions of money at round about 2 or 2½ per cent. if, as Senator O'Brien suggests, the money was sufficiently short-dated.  I do not believe for an instant, as some people think about short-dated loans, that everybody will run in and say: &ldquo;We want all our money.&rdquo;  That will not happen.  We are conservative about finance in this country, and those working on the land, in industry, in the professional classes, or anyone who does a bit of saving will not be stampeded, in any way, by scares of that kind.  I think the old theory in the past, that you would have to have all the money there, ready to hand it out to everybody who came in on the one day to look for it, I think that form of over-prudence is a product of Victorianism, and I do not think need be considered by any Minister for Finance who will go to the public for money in the future.</P>
    <P>I have not anything further to add to the debate.  It is getting late, but I would ask the Minister to consider the points I have made, the appeal for the widows, the appeal for the dancers and, finally, for those who want to give money, I would like to have it on terms that might convenience them in making their own arrangements.</P>

      <P>What I feel about this debate, so far, is the extraordinary amount of exaggeration that we have had in the speeches from the other side of the House and from Senator Séamus O'Farrell on this side of the House.  It would seem to me that, to make a case, they exaggerated more than 100 per cent. in every argument they made.  Untold millions in defence was the phrase Senator Séamus O'Farrell used, and Senator Douglas, because Senator Quirke suggested that a certain number of millions of pounds per annum was being allocated for spending in Sweden on defence, suggested we were to spend the same amount and that we were a country with a somewhat similar population. There was no such suggestion, I may <Col N="423" /> say here, on that particular question, so far as Senator Quirke was concerned. His complaint was that we were neglecting completely this question of defence.</P>

      <P>I assert that it is an absolutely correct statement, and I have some knowledge of the Army as it is in Ireland at the present time. I know that one branch of the Army, which was regarded as very important when Fianna Fáil was the Government, the Volunteer Force or the F.C.A. as it is at the present time, is being completely neglected by the Government, and the difficulty of attracting recruits to that very essential service is becoming greater as the years pass.  I rather think that if the particular Minister does not give very special attention to that force, it will dwindle to nothing in a very short time.  Senator O'Farrell, whose conversion seems to be complete, since this reunion of Parties, comes along and speaks of untold millions.  All the talk about subsidies for the poor has ceased, rationing, and all the rest of it.  At the present time, he is completely sold on the idea that we should continue the present system of rationing. We should continue to have two prices.  I wonder what he thought before he was converted.  Senator Douglas gave us an explanation of rationing.  He said that it was in order to allow people to get what they need at as low a price as possible. Senator Ó Buachalla has suggested that people should get a fair quantity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>An equal quantity. I disagree with both definitions.  To my mind, the reason for rationing is that, when necessary articles are scarce, the pool available can be so distributed <Col N="424" /> that each person gets a fair share. When the pool is sufficient to supply all the needs, rationing should be abolished.  That was the attitude of the Fine Gael section of this House when Fianna Fáil was in office, that rationing should be abolished as soon as the pool of necessary articles was sufficient to meet the needs of the people.  We believe that that pool at present has reached that particular stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to do the Minister's job, but I will deal with the question of subsidy to a certain extent.  Senator O'Farrell, for instance, believed that the double price system did not inflict any hardship on the poor people.  Like many others, I happened to be in Donegal during the recent by-election, in a poor section, the Rosses area, where I found that the bulk of the poor people there eat white bread regularly.  It is their main article of food, as they have not plenty of potatoes, beef and other things we have in other parts of the country.  It was quite normal, even in the hotels or ordinary restaurants, to be presented on all occasions with white bread.  The amount which they got by way of ration was not anything like sufficient to meet the needs of people situated as they were.  Consequently, we must make up our minds &mdash;and that is the Government's task&mdash; to allow the people to get the full quantity they require of necessary articles at the rationed price, or else take the odium, if there is odium attached to it, of charging the normal price and allowing wages to adjust themselves so that the people can buy the articles.  That is part of the Government's duty.  If we were in office, we would take the responsibility.</P>

We were able to explain that that particular system enabled the very poorest section of the people to get more of the necessaries of life. We were condemned for that.

      <P>There was an exaggeration here on the question of growing wheat and a lot of talk about whether we should have compulsion or not.  There was a suggestion from Senator Burke&mdash;I was rather amused by it&mdash;that, instead of bothering about growing 400,000 acres of wheat, we should export more goods to the dollar market.  I am sure we should all be very happy, if anyone believes you could export more goods to the dollar market.  I understand that the purchases in the dollar area were so small that it was said our efforts should be directed to buying goods in the sterling area simply because we could not afford to spend dollars in buying goods in the dollar area.  I know it would be splendid if we could sell cattle and other things to America, but we cannot get a market to purchase these things.  I am sure the Minister would be happy if Senator Burke would tell him how he is to export more goods to the dollar area for the 400,000 acres of wheat.</P>

We would like to see the exports of these particular products in huge quantities to the United States, but so far as I can judge there is no great hope that we will increase it to such a large extent that we need not bother about paying dollars for wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="427" /> We did not start immediately the war broke out on this question of growing wheat in Ireland or reverting to a tillage policy.  We started away back in 1932, immediately we took office.  At that time, as most people know, the acreage under wheat amounted to somewhere about 20,000 acres.  There has been talk of compelling people to grow wheat.  We had succeeded, by 1939, in inducing people, by what they reckoned at that time a reasonable price, to increase that acreage to something over 250,000 acres.  That would induce me almost to believe that it is not necessary to compel farmers to grow wheat, but there is one thing that is desirable, that we should not discourage farmers from growing wheat if they want to grow it.  During the time we were in office, we heard many wild statements from the present Minister for Agriculture, phrases such as he &ldquo;would not be seen dead in a field of wheat.&rdquo;  In 1948 he said about the person who grew wheat that he would pay him for it but that if he was of that mentality he might be better in some other part of the world.  He recommended them to grow oats and potatoes but the people found that to grow them on his advice was a ridiculous thing for sensible people to do. The next year he came along and told them to grow oats, potatoes and barley but with regard to barley he said that unless they had a contract with the miller they could not be sure of the price.</P>

      <P>My belief as far as this country is concerned is that it is a wise thing for our people to concentrate on producing all the food that can be produced in this country for the Irish people.  At the present time we are producing food for export to Britain, beef and even bacon to some extent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me develop the argument.  If we have to buy from an outside country the feeding stuffs for either the beef or the bacon, I think it is a very bad policy, because we have to pay dollars for them as a general rule, and we are subsidising with our dollars exports to Britain for sterling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that because other people do something we should do the same; neither would I walk into a river if Senator Baxter walked into it, whether it was good for me or not.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister what the Government's attitude is regarding the purchase of food and the growing of food in this country; whether our people should be encouraged to produce wheat in order that we would not have to spend dollars to purchase it from abroad.  I think this is a question which should be made quite clear.</P>

      <P>Less imported wheat goes into the manufacture of bread in this country than ever before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear it.  The meaning of that is that we had a greater crop than last year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>About 40 per cent. imported and 60 per cent. native.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that out of last year's crop we had a greater quantity of wheat?</P>

      <P>If you grow wheat on proper wheat land the yield goes up.  The acreage may go down, but the yield goes up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to compulsion, when we were in the Government the argument was used by the farmers' section of the Opposition that they would be happy to grow wheat if more fertilisers were available and that they would even accept a less price than the Minister was offering at that time.  My belief is that we should grow more wheat and beet and that we should concentrate on these things which we need ourselves rather than concentrate on the production of beef for export to our neighbours.  I have no objection to letting Britain have all the cattle and even any surplus wheat we can produce, but we should concentrate on seeing that the country will never again be in the position in time of stress of having to import wheat or necessary articles of food from abroad.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether I am in order in referring to this point, but I should like to ask the Minister a question. Is it perfectly correct, as I have heard, that the increase in the postal charges made a couple of years ago is an illegal impost?  The post rates were increased by order of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a form of taxation which was hidden.  I understand that people paid some £500,000 more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be wrong, but my objection to it is that if the Minister was not entitled in law to make these changes they should not have been made, particularly as people like some of us who objected had no opportunity <Col N="430" /> to make a case against them.  I have a particular interest in the printed rate postage and I think that the doubling of that charge inflicted a great hardship on quite a number of people and organisations in the country.  I am given to understand that the Minister was not entitled in law to increase these charges and that legislation will have to be introduced to legalise that particular position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is legislation on foot regarding it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisLoughman" hpid="Mr. Loughman Mr. Loughman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a form of Government system to which I certainly object.  I and other people have been paying postage rates for a considerable time and I know that if I, as a private citizen, were bound by law to sell a particular article at a particular price and if I sold it at a greater price I would be punished, but we have no redress as far as the Government are concerned; they can come in and introduce a Bill.  A funnier situation would arise supposing the Government went out&mdash;I do not say there is any danger of it.  What would happen, for instance, if the succeeding Government did not go through with that legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They would have to pay back the money.  I do not want to interrupt the Senator, but when he says that all these postal charges are related, that is not so.</P>
